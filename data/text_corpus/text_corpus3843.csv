19215,biological nutrient removal performances and kinetics of autochthonous marine biomass in forms of activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge were investigated under different salinity and sludge retention time srt both the biomasses cultivated from a fish canning wastewater were subjected to stepwise increases in salinity 2 gnacl l 1 from 30 gnacl l 1 up to 50 gnacl l 1 with the aim to evaluate the maximum potential in withstanding salinity by the autochthonous marine biomass microbial marine species belonging to the genus of cryomorphaceae and of rhodobacteraceae were found dominant in both the systems at the maximum salinity tested 50 gnacl l 1 the organic carbon was removed with a yield of approximately 98 irrespective of the salinity similarly nitrogen removal occurred via nitritation denitritation and was not affected by salinity the ammonium utilization rate and the nitrite utilization rate were approximately of 3 60 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 and 10 0 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 respectively indicating a high activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria the granulation process did not provide significant improvements in the nutrients removal process likely due to the stepwise salinity increase strategy biomass activity and performances resulted affected by long srt 27 days due to salt accumulation within the activated sludge flocs and granules in contrast a lower srt 14 days favoured the discharge of the granules and flocs with higher inert content thereby enhancing the biomass renewing the obtained results demonstrated that the use of autochthonous halophilic bacteria represents a valuable solution for the treatment of high strength carbon and nitrogen saline wastewater in a wide range of salinity besides the stepwise increase in salinity and the operation at low srt enabled high metabolic activity and to avoid excessive accumulation of salt within the biomass aggregates limiting their physical destructuration due to the increase in loosely bound exopolymers graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge aerobic granular sludge autochthonous halophilic bacteria shortcut nitrification saline wastewater 1 introduction nowadays several activities including petroleum chemical and fish canning produce large amount of wastewaters featured by high salt chloride concentration in many cases these wastewaters contain significant concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and total nitrogen tn chowdhury et al 2010 corsino et al 2016 chemical and physical treatments like membrane separation ion exchange or electrodialysis have been widely investigated in the past fan et al 2011 muthukumaran and baskaran 2013 although these methods are highly performing they lead to secondary pollution chemicals disposal and are less cost effective than biological treatments energy and chemicals consumption therefore they are currently limited only to specific applications he et al 2017 whereas biological treatments are widely recognized as cost effective their application in the field of industrial saline wastewater still represent a challenge indeed one of the main drawbacks when treating saline wastewater is related to plasmolysis that involves the breaking of the cellular membrane leading to the cell death lefebvre and moletta 2006 this phenomenon occurs when the solute concentration in the cytoplasm is higher than that in the surrounding environment similarly plasmolysis could occur when the aqueous environment is hypertonic compared to the cytoplasm although several studies demonstrated that the acclimation of activated sludge as to salinity can be successfully achieved the main bottleneck consists in the removal efficiencies of such salt adapted systems campo et al 2018 lefebvre and moletta 2006 zhang et al 2017 to overcome this drawback many authors suggested the use of aerobic granular sludge ags since bacteria bio aggregation could help to operate at higher salinity and faster kinetics as well wang et al 2015 2017 nevertheless the research findings suggested that halo tolerant biomass even in the form of granular sludge totally lose its metabolic functionalities over a certain salinity level 20 g nacl l 1 jemli et al 2015 thereby resulting in loss of removal efficiencies recently chen et al 2018 demonstrated that microbial community diversity and richness as well as removal performance for nitrogen and organic carbon deteriorated with increasing in salinity from 0 gnacl l 1 to 20 gnacl l 1 the authors observed that salinity inhibited the dehydrogenase activity of activated sludge thus decreasing bacterial metabolic activity for these reasons many researchers encouraged the use of halophilic bacteria for the biological treatment of high strength saline wastewater gomes et al 2018 guo et al 2016 recently several studies on the treatment of saline and hypersaline wastewater by means of halophilic biomass were carried out cui et al 2016 oren 2010 zhuang et al 2010 among these capodici et al 2018 successfully cultivated autochthonous activated sludge from a real fish canning wastewater the authors assumed the presence of autochthonous active biomass in their study and speculated that it may be belonged to halophilic strains because of their ability to survive in hypersaline saline environment 30 gnacl l 1 the removal efficiencies bod and tss were higher than 90 similarly more than 95 of the nitrogen was removed via shortcut nitrification denitrification partial nitrification or nitritation naturally occurs treating saline wastewater because nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are more sensitive to the salt concentration than the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob however capodici and coauthors tested the effectiveness of the autochthonous biomass only at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity therefore the ability of these bacteria to survive at higher salinity and its performances were not tested so far furthermore it is possible to speculate that bio aggregation of these bacteria in aerobic granular sludge ags could represent a further advantage thereby enhancing the biological performances or enabling the possibility to operate at higher salinity another issue concerning the treatment of saline wastewater is related to the choice of a proper sludge retention time srt indeed although at high salinity the biomass yield decreased thereby limiting the sludge wasting ching and redzwan 2017 longer srt could result in excessive ageing of the sludge because of accumulation of inert material within the flocs or granules this in turn affects the biological performances because of the decrease in the biomass active fraction in the system therefore the choice of a proper srt allow to avoid the decay of biological performances in the long term to the authors knowledge no studies reporting about the performances and the kinetics of autochthonous marine biomass at salinity higher than 30 gnacl l 1 nor the effects of srt exist additionally specific molecular analysis aimed at identifying these bacteria were not performed up to now in this respect identification of bacterial communities is indispensable for a better understanding of the biological processes that enable the nutrient removal especially for the treatment of not conventional wastewater the purpose of this study was to validate the approach of cultivating autochthonous marine biomass for the treatment of saline wastewater and to test its maximum potentiality in terms of salinity withstanding with this aim this study investigated the biological nutrient removal efficiencies and the metabolic kinetics of autochthonous marine biomass derived from fish canning wastewater in forms of activated sludge and granular sludge in a range of salinity between 30 gnacl l 1 and 50 gnacl l 1 at different srts 2 materials and method 2 1 reactors set up two sequencing batch reactors sbr one with aerobic granular sludge ags sbr and the other with flocculent activated sludge as sbr were operated as reported in previous studies capodici et al 2018 corsino et al 2018 because the biomass retention capacity of the ags reactor was double than the as with the aim to compare the performances of those systems operating with the same biomass amount the volume of the as sbr was chosen as the double of the ags sbr more precisely the ags sbr was a column type 100 cm height with a working volume of 4 l internal diameter of 8 6 cm and was characterized by an internal riser 50 cm high with an internal diameter of 5 4 cm the as sbr had an operating volume of 8 l both the sbrs were equipped with a feeding pump and a solenoid valve for the effluent discharge placed at the mid point of the reactor yielding a volumetric exchange ratio ver equal to 50 the volume of the raw wastewater treated per day was equal to 4 l and 8 l for the ags sbr and for the as sbr respectively therefore the hydraulic retention time hrt was equal to 24 h in both the reactors the ags sbr was operated on a 12 h cycle divided into 60 min of not aerated influent upflow feeding 10 h and 50 min of aeration 650 min 5 min of settling and 5 min of effluent discharge air was introduced via a fine bubble aerator at the base of the reactor at a flow rate of 3 l min 1 so that the superficial air velocity was approximately of 2 4 cm s 1 the as sbr cycle included 60 min of influent feeding mixed and not aerated 9 h and 30 min 570 min of aeration 60 of anoxic mixing followed by 5 min of aeration to favour nitrogen stripping 20 min of settling and 5 min of effluent discharge the length of aerated not aerated period was set in order to maximize nitrogen removal efficiency a stirrer device provided the mixing during the non aerated period and a fine bubble diffuser provided the air supply a programmable logic controller plc automatically handled the sbrs cycling operations the dissolved oxygen do concentration within the bulk was maintained close to the saturation value according to the temperature and salinity 2 2 experimental set up the ags sbr and the as sbr were monitored for 165 days both the reactors were seeded with autochthonous activated sludge derived from a fish canning wastewater for the cultivation of this sludge a parent reactor working as a conventional sbr was started up without an activated sludge inoculum more precisely this reactor was filled with raw fish canning wastewater and was operated with a complete sludge retention strategy until the autochthonous activated sludge developed for further details on the cultivation of the autochthonous biomass the reader is referred to the literature capodici et al 2018 the fish canning wastewater was collected from a local industry that produces canned anchovies palermo italy the raw fish canning wastewater was collected from the canning section of the industry where the wastewater had a salt concentration of approximately 150 g nacl l 1 then the raw fish canning wastewater was diluted with tap water 1 5 v v to obtain a salt concentration approximately equal to that of the wastewater at the outlet of the industry 30 g nacl l 1 after dilution the cod and the bod5 concentration resulted on average in approximately 800 mg l 1 respectively whereas the tn and the nh4 n were on average equal to 150 mg l 1 and 115 mg l 1 respectively table 1 the ags sbr and the as sbr were seeded with the autochthonous activated sludge derived from the parent sbr reactor with a tss concentration of approximately 3 gtss l 1 subsequently both the reactors were operated for approximately 3 months until steady conditions were achieved the salinity was kept constant to 30 gnacl l 1 until full granulation and stable performance data not discussed were achieved in the ags sbr and as sbr systems at the end of the start up phase beginning of this study the tss concentration was of approximately 6 3 gtss l 1 and 13 1 gtss l 1 in the as and ags reactor respectively when steady state conditions were reached in both the sbrs salt concentration was gradually increased in details although steady state condition is conventionally referred to the srt in this study it was assumed that steady state condition were reached when a steady nutrients removal efficiency occurred fluctuations smaller than 3 nevertheless a minimum duration of 15 days for each phase was imposed the experiment was divided into eleven phases during which salinity was stepwise increased by 2 gnacl l 1 each by adding a known amount of sodium chloride to the diluted wastewater in this way the bod5 and total nitrogen concentration in the feed were kept constant during the entire experiment salinity was increased up to 50 gnacl l 1 and it was not further increased because of issues related to the oxygen transfer and scaling as a consequence of the high salt concentration the srt was not imposed until phase 6 corresponding to 40 gnacl l 1 table 1 when the sludge wastage flux was set in order to maintain a tss concentration of approximately 12 0 gtss l 1 and 6 0 gtss l 1 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively thus the srt was approximately of 27 days in both the sbrs however due to the accumulation of inert material within the aerobic granules in the ags sbr and to the ageing of the activated sludge in the as sbr since phase 7 a regular sludge withdrawal corresponding to a srt close to 14 days was performed more precisely a selective wastage strategy was performed in the ags sbr consisting in discharging the granules from the bottom of the reactor after the settling phase in this way the heaviest granules likely those with the highest inert matter content were selectively wasted in the as sbr the sludge was wasted from the liquid bulk during the aeration phase in table 1 the main operating conditions and wastewater characteristics are summarized 2 3 analytical methods the chemical physical parameters cod bod5 nh4 n no2 n were analyzed according to standard methods apha 2005 the tss and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations were troublesome due to the salt adsorption within the activated sludge flocs to address this problem a modified method was used capodici et al 2018 the total nitrogen concentration was determined in total nitrogen measuring unit tnm 1 shimadzu japan eps extraction was performed according to the heating method le clech et al 2006 for each eps fraction the carbohydrates ps and the proteins pn were determined in accordance with the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 and with the folin method lowry et al 1951 respectively the observed yield coefficient yobs was calculated through mass balances between sludge withdrawn and sludge production dividing by the cumulated bod5 removed according to eq 1 eq 1 y o b s x 2 x 1 v x e q x s q s b o d i n b o d o u t q g v s s g b o d 1 where x2 and x1 are the biomass concentrations g vss l 1 at day n and n 1 v is the working volume of the reactor q is the influent flow xs and xe are the concentrations of the waste biomass and the effluent g vss l 1 qs is the volume of waste sludge on a daily base bodin and bodout are the influent and effluent bod5 concentration g l 1 respectively the size of the activated sludge flocs and granules was examined by means of a high speed image analyses sensor sympatec qicpic that allowed the evaluation of sludge particle size distribution psd the settling properties of the ags and the as were evaluated by means of the sludge volume index svi the svi was calculated as the ratio between the volume occupied by the sludge after a static settling phase and the tss concentration of the sample because of the different nature of the ags and as to compare the achieved results with previous respective studies the svi was calculated in a different way more precisely for the ags the svi was calculated based on the volume of settled sludge after 5 min svi5 whereas for the as the svi was calculated by considering the volume of settled sludge after 30 min svi30 giesen et al 2013 the svi30 was calculated also for the ags in order to evaluate the svi5 svi30 ratio the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the mixed liquor was measured continuously by means of a wtw iq sensor net system 2020 xt equipped with on line sensor probes the electrical conductivity ec was measured instead of a direct assessment of salinity because it was more reliable therefore salinity was calculated based on a correlation curve with the ec one way analysis of variance one way anova was used to assess the relationship between salinity changes and biomass kinetics error level equal to 0 05 2 3 1 metabolic kinetic assessment to evaluate the impact of the salinity increase on nitrogen removal kinetics ammonium utilization rate aur and nitrite utilization rate nur tests were performed in each experimental phase kinetic tests were performed only when steady conditions were reached these tests were performed in a 1 5 l batch reactor 3 gtss l 1 at controlled temperature 20 c specifically based on the tss concentration a known amount of mixed liquor sample was withdrawn from the respective parent reactors and put in the batch reactor ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite were added as ammonia and nitrite sources respectively kinetic batch tests were replicated during each experimental phase during aur tests do was provided via a fine bubble diffuser and it was maintained close to the saturation value in accordance with the temperature and salinity nur tests were performed in not aerated conditions by using a magnetic stirrer device to mix the sample during the trials although anoxic conditions generally occur within the inner layers of granules even in the presence of dissolved oxygen in the bulk it was decided to perform nur tests for the ags under the same conditions of the as not aerated conditions sodium acetate was added as external carbon source to enhance the nitrites reduction in particular 100 ml of a concentrate solution containing sodium acetate 10 g l 1 was dosed as to have a concentration within the batch reactor of approximately 500 g l 1 moreover in order to assess the possible presence of nob specific experiments were periodically run in a similar way than the aur tests by adding sodium nitrite instead of ammonium chloride under aerobic conditions kinetic tests were operated for 2 h each during which 10 ml of sample was withdrawn at regular time intervals 10 min thus samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for nh4 n and no2 n analyses the aur and nur were calculated as the slope of the linear regression line of nh4 n and no2 n data these values were then referred to the volatile suspended solids concentration of the sample the initial ammonium concentration for each aur batch test was approximately of 100 mg nh4 n l 1 whereas the nitrite concentration for the nur tests was close to 50 mg no2 n l 1 2 3 2 dna extraction and 16s rrna amplicon

diversity was estimated by applying richness shannon and simpson indices hill family indices hill 1973 data analyses were performed with the software past paleontological statistics 3 results 3 1 granules and activated sludge characteristics physical properties of granular and activated sludge observed at different salinity are reported in table 2 the mature granules obtained at the end of cultivation period were characterized by a mean size of approximately 2 6 mm a svi after 5 min of settling of 14 9 ml gtss 1 and an inert content of approximately 35 vss tss 0 65 the mean size of granules rapidly increased during the experiment and granules of approximately 4 mm were obtained at 40 gnacl l 1 of salinity which was consistent with previous studies that reported the average size of particles increased with salinity ji et al 2018 until phase 6 the vss concentration was decreasing and accordingly the inert content of the granules was over 45 thereby indicating a significant accumulation of inert material after the srt was decreased to 14 days phase 7 onward the vss concentration and the vss tss ratio increased to 65 thereby suggesting the occurrence of biomass renewing the mean size of flocs in the as sbr slightly decreased with the increase in salinity from 152 μm to approximately 115 μm at 50 gnacl l 1 of salinity the vss concentration in the as sbr decreased during the period in which the srt was maintained at approximately 27 days reaching a minimum value of 4 32 gvss l 1 at phase 6 corresponding to an inert content of 35 after the srt was decreased the vss concentration ranged between 4 5 gvss l 1 and 4 7 gvss l 1 until the end of the experiment the inert content was close to 27 and it was constant for the rest of the experiment thereby indicating that salt accumulation within the flocs did not occurred under lower srt referring to the svi values no significant changes with the increase in salinity were observed in the ags sbr the svi5 slightly ranged between 14 ml gtss 1 and 17 ml gtss 1 during the entire experiment whereas the svi5 svi30 value was approximately 1 1 this result was in contrast with the findings of a previous study in which the svi decreasing with the increase in salinity from 2 gnacl l 1 to 15 gnacl l 1 wang et al 2017 this was probably due to the fact that in this study the maturation of granular sludge was achieved before than salinity was increased whereas in the study by wang and co authors salinity was increased simultaneously with the granulation process the svi30 decreased with the increase in salinity in the as sbr starting from an initial value of 85 ml gtss 1 the svi30 constantly decreased to 68 ml gtss 1 at the end of the experiment this result could be related to the increase of the bulk buoyancy that resulted in the increase of the hydraulic selection pressure in this way the reactor started to enrich in faster settling activated sludge similar findings were also achieved in other studies chen et al 2018 ou et al 2018a this was not observed in the ags sbr likely because the granules were already hydraulically selected by the shorter duration of the settling phase the observed yield coefficient of the heterotrophic biomass in the ags sbr slightly decreased during the entire experiment from 0 168 gvss g bod5 1 to 0 121 gvss g bod5 1 suggesting the reduction of new biomass synthesis due to the salinity increase which was consistent with the literature mannina et al 2016 wu et al 2008 the influence of srt on the observed yield coefficient resulted negligible similarly in the as sbr the observed yield coefficient decreased by almost 40 from 0 195 gvss g bod5 1 phase 1 to 0 113 gvss g bod5 1 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 however after phase 7 42 gnacl l 1 under srt of 14 days the yobs increased and ranged between approximately 0 159 gvss g bod5 1 and 0 168 gvss g bod5 1 until the end of the experiment the achieved results indicated that the biomass synthesis decreased with the increase in salinity nevertheless a lower srt enhanced the biomass renewing as well as the synthesis of new bacterial cells it is reasonable to explain the biomass activity although the high salinity level due to the dominance of the marine species 3 2 eps pattern in activated and granular sludge the trend of the specific eps content and that of the loosely bound fraction in the activated sludge and granular sludge reactors during the experiment are depicted in fig 1 the specific eps content increased with salinity in both the sbrs thereby confirming that bacteria produce excess of exopolymers to face the salinity increases corsino et al 2017 ji et al 2018 this is likely due to the cell protection role played by eps against high salinity as suggested for biofilm communities decho 2013 these exopolymeric substances are an abundant component of microbial mats developed in hypersaline systems such as salt ponds salterns and hypersaline lagoons decho and gutierrez 2017 where eps seem to condense with increasing salinity and even form a hydrophobic barrier on the surface of biofilm decho 2013 interestingly the eps content significantly started to increase in both the reactors after phase 4 when the salinity was equal to 36 gnacl l 1 in general when saline concentration is changing in the bulk the overproduction of eps helps to reduce the destruction of microorganisms due to maintaining of the cellular osmotic pressure balance in halotolerant activated sludge bioreactors the response of bacteria to salinity increases in terms of overproduction of eps occurs from salinity levels of approximately 5 10 gnacl l 1 campo et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in this study the response by the halophilic marine bacteria to the salinity increase occurred at salinity over 36 gnacl l 1 therefore based on the result above it is possible to speculate that the response of marine bacteria to the salinity increase in terms of overproduction of eps started when the gradient of osmotic pressure between the inner and the outer of the bacterial cells exceeded a certain threshold value which is significantly higher than that of halotolerant microorganisms in both the ags sbr and the as sbr the eps were mainly constituted by the tightly bound fraction average value 90 however it is worth to observe that the loosely bound fraction was increasing when the srt was not controlled fig 1 indeed the loosely bound fraction reached its maximum value at phase 6 in both the reactors when the salinity was equal to 40 gnacl l 1 specifically the lb eps accounted for approximately 22 and 18 of the total eps content in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively this result was in good agreement with a previous study corsino et al 2017 in which the authors observed an exponential increase in the lb eps content with the increase in salinity under not controlled srt after phase 6 when a shorter srt was applied the lb eps fraction decreased in both the reactors as far as a stable value of approximately 5 in the ags sbr and 3 in the as sbr was reached previous studies demonstrated that the increase in salinity caused a significant increase in the loosely bound eps fraction of halotolerant activated and granular sludge corsino et al 2017 wang et al 2015 l zhao et al 2016a similarly other authors observed a significant increase in the loosely bound eps of halophilic biomass in both forms of activated and granular sludge subjected to drastic salinity increase corsino et al 2018 ismail et al 2010 demonstrated that under high salinity the epss matrix suffers a deterioration because of the replacement of calcium ions by sodium ones thereby resulting in the increase in the loosely bound fraction in contrast the results obtained in this study indicated that by stepwise increasing the salinity and by decreasing the srt the amount of loosely bound eps decreased these results likely suggest that the detrimental effect exerted by sodium cations toward the eps matrix occurs in the long term and as a response of high salinity increases therefore lower srt and stepwise salinity increases enable to minimize the eps matrix deterioration thereby promoting the formation of sludge with good physical characteristics concerning the eps composition the proteins resulted the main eps constituent the amount of proteins was more than five times higher than that of carbohydrates and no significant changes were observed in the pn ps ratio with the increase in salinity and srt as well specifically the protein concentration increased from 190 mg gvss 1 to approximately 320 mg gvss 1 in the ags and from 150 mg gvss 1 to approximately 410 mg gvss 1 in the as during the entire experiment similarly the carbohydrates concentration increased from 40 mg gvss 1 to approximately 65 mg gvss 1 in the ags and from 30 mg gvss 1 to approximately 82 mg gvss 1 in the as during the entire experiment consequently the pn ps ratio was constant to a stable value of approximately 5 during the entire experiment 3 3 carbon removal efficiency time courses of the bod5 and cod in the influent and effluents of the ags sbr and as sbr as well as the removal efficiencies in both the reactors are depicted in fig 2 a and b respectively the bod5 in the influent fish canning wastewater ranged approximately between 700 mg l 1 and 1100 mg l 1 both the sbrs provided effluents of constant quality in terms of bod5 which resulted always below 45 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively therefore the carbon removal efficiency was on average equal approximately to 98 which was much higher than the performance achieved in other studies with salt adapted microorganisms chen et al 2018 ou et al 2018a a slight decrease was observed in both reactors when the srt was set equal to 27 days likely due to the accumulation of salt within the flocs and granules as discussed above the reduction of srt since phase 7 enabled the biomass renewing resulting in an improvement of carbon removal efficiency the removal efficiencies in both the reactors were in good agreement with the vss tss ratio values table 1 suggesting that when treating saline wastewater a lower srt enables to avoid the decrease of the active biomass within the microbial aggregates thereby preventing the worsening of the biological performances a similar trend was observed also concerning the cod the cod in the influent ranged between 1710 mg l 1 and 2423 mg l 1 whereas the cod in the effluent was mostly below 100 mg l 1 in both the ags and the as systems fig 2c overall both the sbrs provided more than 95 of cod removal the achieved results indicated that the autochthonous heterotrophic bacteria were extremely active even at high salinity levels in terms of organic loading rate both the sbrs were able to remove more than 95 of the influent organic load with an average rate of approximately 2 14 g cod m 3d 1 in a previous study zhao et al 2016a 2016b obtained 80 of cod removal at 35 gnacl l 1 in a sbr with acclimated activated sludge operating with an organic loading rate of approximately 2 g cod m 3d 1 synthetic medium similarly in an salt adapted ags system ou et al 2018b achieved the removal of approximately 1 06 g cod m 3d 1 operating with acetate based wastewater at 50 gnacl l 1 of salinity based on the available literature salt adapted microorganisms were able to remove approximately the 50 70 of the influent organic load at salinity higher than 30 gnacl l 1 showing a decreasing trend with the salinity increase ji et al 2018 wang et al 2014 it is worth mentioning that mostly of the cited studies are referred to the treatment of synthetic wastewater while referring to real wastewater val del rio et al val del río et al 2012 obtained the removal approximately of 30 of the influent organic loading rate 4 g cod m 3d 1 in a ags sbr treating fish canning wastewater at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity similarly figueroa et al 2008 obtained 90 of cod removal in a ags sbr operating with an organic loading rate of 1 5 g cod m 3d 1 at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity after a long acclimation period the results achieved in this study demonstrated that the autochthonous marine biomass was able of providing excellent carbon removal performance even at higher salinity than those tested in previous studies capodici et al 2018 ramos et al 2015 van den akker et al 2015 the dominance of this marine species can explain the biomass activity although the high salinity level it is worth mentioning that strategy of stepwise increasing the salinity contributed to avoid sudden increase in the solute concentration around bacterial cells thereby preventing osmotic stress indeed drastic osmotic shocks would cause plasmolysis because cells lose water through osmosis thus inhibiting the transport of substrates into the cell and the carbon removal performance lang et al 2005 a gradual adaptation to salinity enables bacteria to face to the higher osmotic pressure by accumulating organic compounds in the cytoplasm avoiding the loss of the metabolic activity the obtained results clearly demonstrated that the use of autochthonous biomass and the stepwise increase in salinity are effective approaches to achieve excellent carbon removal performance for the treatment of wastewater at high salinity 3 4 nitrogen removal efficiency the overall performance of ags sbr and as sbr systems concerning nitrogen removal with the increased salinity is shown in fig 4 in this study no nitrates were observed in the effluent for the entire experiment and also kinetic batch tests confirmed that biological activity of nob bacteria was inhibited in high saline environment besides also ngs analysis revealed the absence of nob bacteria in both the sbrs communities a typical trend of the nitrogen pattern during an operational cycle in the ags sbr and as sbr phase 1 is shown in fig s1 since the srt was set equal to 27 days the effluent ammonium concentration showed a slightly increasing trend in both the sbrs while maintaining always below 20 mg l 1 fig 3 a accordingly the nitritation efficiencies decreased from approximately 98 phase 1 to 92 and 88 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively fig 3b the achieved results were in good agreement with the sludge ageing previously discussed nevertheless the nitritation performance was approximately close to 90 in both the sbrs thereby indicating a high activity of the beta aob mainly belonging to nitrosomonas species as shown by ngs analysis when the srt was decreased at the beginning of phase 7 the effluent ammonium concentration increased in both the reactors in particular the effluent ammonium concentration reached its maximum value at phase 8 of approximately 36 mg l 1 and 23 mg l 1 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively accordingly the nitritation efficiency rapidly decreased reaching the minimum value of 78 in the ags sbr and 85 in the as sbr this result could be likely related to the srt decrease which caused a wash out of nitrifies nevertheless both the reactors rapidly adapted to the new operating conditions indeed the effluent ammonium concentration decreased in the subsequent phases reaching a steady value of approximately 18 mgnh4 n l 1 at the end of the experiment the nitritation efficiency was 93 and 88 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively based on the achieved results the salinity did not significantly affect the biological activity of the halophilic aob strains which were able to provide high performances during the entire experiment in contrast an excessive accumulation of salt and inert material within the granules or flocs worsened the nitritation performances likely because of the decrease in the overall active biomass within the reactors that occurred from phase 1 to phase 6 before the srt was decreased during the entire experiment the nitrite concentrations in the effluents of the sbrs ranged between 40 mg no2 n l 1 and 70 mg no2 n l 1 consistent with the ammonium oxidation performances the high concentration of nitrites in the effluent suggested that the denitritation process was limited independently of salinity nitrites reduction by denitrifies occurred during the anoxic period in the as sbr and within the layered structure of the granules in the ags sbr simultaneously with the nitritation process corsino et al 2016 overall the total nitrogen concentration in the sbrs effluents ranged between 40 mg tn l 1 and 75 mg tn l 1 fig 3c resulting in tn removal efficiencies ranging between 60 and 40 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively fig 3d no significant relation with the increase in salinity was observed based on the results above denitritation was the limiting process for total nitrogen removal it is reasonable to assume that denitritation was limited by lack of carbon as nitrite concentration in both the effluents did not show any significant relation with salinity however a distinction should be made between the ags sbr and the as sbr in the latter because denitritation occurred only during the not aerated phase when ammonium was already oxidized to nitrite and the organic carbon was almost completely oxidized therefore this certainly limited the availability of the organic substrate for nitrite reduction it is reasonable that endogenous denitritation occurred through the use of bacterial internal carbon sources that limited the reaction kinetic bernat et al 2008 in the ags reactor in addition to the carbon limitation it is also reasonable that the high oxygen concentration in the bulk close to the saturation value was the limiting factor for the simultaneous nitritation denitritation process indeed under these operating conditions it is possible that the oxygen concentrations in the inner layers of the granule was very high thereby favouring aerobic reactions instead of anoxic 3 5 nitrogen removal kinetics nitritation and denitritation kinetics were evaluated by means of aur and nur tests the results obtained during the experiments are depicted in fig 4 nitritation and denitritation kinetics showed a high metabolic activity of both nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria although the high salinity level the achieved results were comparable to those of cas systems metcalf and eddy 2015 and were significantly higher than kinetics related to halotolerant biomass pronk et al 2014 aur slightly decreased in both sbrs when salinity was increased from 30 gnacl l 1 to 40 gnacl l 1 fig 4a during the period at 27 days of srt more precisely the aur in the ags sbr decreased from 4 67 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity to 3 97 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 thereby reducing by approximately 16 in contrast the aur in the as sbr decreased from 4 05 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 to 2 93 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 within the same range of salinity thus the decrease in aur was of approximately 38 in the as sbr which was 2 4 times more the ags sbr these results were in good agreement with nitritation performances above discussed based on these results the increase in salinity with a stepwise strategy within a range of 30 gnacl l 1 and 40 gnacl l 1 had a negligible effect on biological activity of aobs in the ags i e p 0 286 whereas a significant decrease was noted in the as although the one way analysis of variance indicated a low correlation value i e p 0 210 after phase 6 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 the aur sharply decreased in the ags sbr approximately by 22 at salinity of 42 gnacl l 1 the aur in the ags sbr was approximately 3 20 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 and this value was comparable with that in the as sbr therefore a sharp decrease in aobs activity was noted at salinity higher than 40 gnacl l 1 although this occurred only in the ags reactor such result could be likely due to the accumulation of inert material within the granules and to the limitation to oxygen diffusion indeed at phase 6 approximately the 78 of aerobic granules were on average bigger that 4 mm likely because of the inclusions of inert material within the structure of granules salt and inert particulate deriving from the raw wastewater the high salt concentration that decreased the oxygen saturation within the liquid bulk and the bigger size of granules increased the resistance to oxygen diffusion within the inner layers endangering the ammonia oxidation process besides accumulation of inert inorganic material within the granule caused a decrease in the vss tss ratio that was approximately 53 because of the lower vss tss ratio in the ags the biologically active fraction of the granule significantly decreased thereby reducing the ammonium oxidation capacity by the ags system after the srt was decreased to 14 days the new operating conditions rapidly reflected on the aobs activity in the as sbr indeed the aur increased from 3 18 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 to approximately 4 0 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 at salinity of 46 gnacl l 1 thereafter the aur ranged between 3 87 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 and 3 84 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 during the rest of the experiment contrarily the aur in the ags sbr still decreased until phase 8 at salinity of 44 gnacl l 1 when it reached its minimum value of approximately 2 44 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 subsequently a reversal of this decreasing trend occurred however the trend reversal point was slightly shifted in time respect to that in the as sbr in the last experimental phase at 50 gnacl l 1 of salinity the aur reached a value of approximately 3 54 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 it is worth mentioning that the shortened in srt after phase 6 caused the decrease in the size of granules in the ags sbr this certainly affected the aur kinetics because the smaller size of bio aggregates favoured the increase of oxygen penetration depth thereby increasing the aerobic zone of the granule which is associated with the capacity for nitritation wang et al 2017 overall the stepwise increase strategy resulted in a decrease in aur of approximately 2 7 and 0 5 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively for each salinity increase nonetheless the stepwise strategy of increasing salinity did not significantly affect the aur kinetics of the ags sbr and as sbr systems the results of one way analysis of variance one way anova indicated that considering the entire range of salinity the salinity increase had a marginal effect on aur kinetic in the ags p 0 302 and the as reactors p 0 289 based on the results above the metabolic activity of the aobs was higher in the ags than the as up to a salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 whereas at higher salinity levels aur kinetics were higher in the as it is worth mentioning that over a certain salinity the oxygen diffusion within the liquid bulk began to be salt limited zannotti and giovannetti 2015 consequently at high salinity the ammonia oxidation process could be oxygen limiting besides in the aerobic granules autotrophic bacteria develop in the inner layers winkler et al 2012 consequently to provide enough electron donors for the aobs metabolic functionalities oxygen has to penetrate deeper within the granule therefore although the compact structure of the granules act as a kind of protecting shield for bacteria it makes even more difficult the oxygen diffusion within the inner layers this would explain why over a salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 the metabolic activity of aobs was higher in the as sbr at lower salinity instead the oxygen diffusion is not a limiting factor for the ammonia oxidation process therefore within a range of salinity between 30 gnacl l 1 and 40 gnacl l 1 aur kinetics were higher in the ags sbr likely because of the higher active biomass retention in the aerobic granules than the flocculent activated sludge that enabled to enhance a faster oxidation of ammonium in this respect the nur tests confirmed that lower srt enabled to achieve a significant reprise of metabolic activity of aobs strains especially in ags systems the values of the nur at different salinity are shown in fig 4b the nur ranged between 9 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 and 10 5 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 in the ags sbr during the entire experiment independently of salinity conversely the nur in the as sbr showed a decreasing trend during the period at srt of 27 days when salinity was increased from 30 gnacl l 1 to 40 gnacl l 1 indeed the nur decreased from 13 8 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 to approximately 9 0 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 at phase 6 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 thereby decreasing approximately of 40 after phase 6 when the srt was decreased the nur in the as sbr increased and ranged between 9 8 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 and 11 5 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 until the end of the experiment based on the results above denitrifies activity was independent of both salinity and srt in the ags sbr although the size of the granules decreased after period 6 this did not affect the nur kinetics of the ags indeed the average size of the granules was larger than 2 5 mm thereby enabling the achievement of a sufficient anoxic zone within the granule structure that allowed the maintenance of the denitritation capacity conversely the nur in the as sbr decreased with the increase in salinity until phase 6 as previously observed for the aur however the decrease of the srt enabled a recovery of denitrifies metabolism independently of salinity this result suggested that the biomass ageing in the as sbr occurred until phase 6 caused a significant decrease in the heterotrophic active fraction whereas a lower srt allowed the biomass renewing indeed it was calculated that the specific observed heterotrophic yield in the as sbr decreased with the increase in salinity from 0 20 gvss gbod 1 to approximately 0 10 gvss gbod 1 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 thereafter the decrease in the srt enabled to increase the yobs to approximately 0 18 gvss gbod 1 thereby favouring the biomass renewing these results indicated that the removal rate of nitrites did not show any significant relationship with the increase in salinity p 0 465 but rather with the srt 3 6 bacterial community analysis due to the promising results on biological performance of the autochthonous halophilic marine biomass in both the sbrs also at 50 gnacl l 1 the high throughput sequencing technology was applied on such communities to provide a first insight into their microbial diversity to the best author s knowledge although several studies investigated the impact of salinity on microorganisms in activated sludge processes he et al 2017 a few data are available about the bacterial diversity of halophilic marine biomass at salinity higher than 30 gnacl l 1 ji et al 2018 both the analyzed microbial communities showed to harbor considerable microbial diversity with high species richness fig 5 a despite the high salinity experimented in this study this can be explained by the presence of a high number of rare species as shown by the rank abundance curves that revealed that these communities were characterized by a strong dominance of a few operational taxonomic units otus and a long tail of rare otus fig 5b abundances of the rare otus were indeed 93 3 and 93 of the total otus in ags sbr and as sbr communities respectively abundant otus were defined as those comprising 1 or more of the community and rare otus comprised 1 campbell et al 2011 as previously suggested besemer 2016 for other microbial communities the presence of high amounts of rare taxa many of which not actively metabolizing provides the genetic capability to respond to changes in environmental conditions although the taxon richness resulted to be higher in the ags sbr sample fig 5a the halophilic marine biomass showed similar taxon composition in both the sbrs on phylum level fig 5c samples were dominated by otus affiliated to bacteroidetes 60 in as sbr and 64 in ags sbr proteobacteria were also present at high percentages 31 91 in as sbr and 30 82 in ags sbr while both the phyla planctomycetes 1 57 in as sbr and 0 30 in ags sbr and firmicutes 1 29 in as sbr and 1 34 in ags sbr contributed less to the dominant portion of the communities results are in agreement with previous studies reaveling bacteroitedes as one of the most abundant phylum composing marine microbial communities due to their important role played in the organic degradation in such environments díez vives et al 2012 although a direct comparison with data available in literature is difficult due to the lack of information on microbial diversity of halophilic marine biomass it should be reasonable compare results obtained here with the outputs of studies on the effect of salinity on microbial composition in activated processes he et al 2017 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 our results seemed to be in agreement with different studies that revealed the dominance of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in activated sludges grown at high salinity conditions he et al 2017 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 and that highlighted the high tolerance to salt stress of bacteroidetes chen et al 2018 from fig 5d and e the community composition on class and family level was further analyzed bacteroitedes were dominated by members of the flavobacteria 49 20 in as sbr and for 55 37 in ags sbr and included members of the bacteroidia 3 84 in as sbr and 4 53 in ags sbr among the flavobacteria the family cryomorphaceae predominated with the highest contribution from members of the genus owenweeksia 38 in as sbr and 45 in ags sbr the family flavobacteriaceae mainly the genus vitellibacter 7 25 in as sbr and 4 40 in ags sbr was also abundant for the bacteroidia marinifilum represented the most abundant genus 2 09 in as sbr and 2 69 in ags sbr within the proteobacteria members of alpha 14 59 in as sbr and 6 72 in ags sbr delta proteobacteria 4 53 in as sbr and 10 76 in ags sbr and gamma proteobacteria 8 53 in as sbr and 6 17 in ags sbr were also prominent the microbial composition found in the analyzed samples can explain the performance of the autochthonous halophilic marine biomass in both the sbrs at 50 gnacl l 1 the dominance of cryomorphaceae in both the samples indeed agrees with the ecology of this family that comprises primarily marine genera mcbride 2014a b moreover the dominant genus owenweeksia contains only a single species isolated from sand filtered seawater collected at port shelter in hong kong lau 2005 and the genera vitellibacter and marinifilum comprised mainly marine species isolated from seawater ruvira et al 2009 thevarajoo et al 2016 in addition the presence of high percentages of members belonging to proteobacteria are generally in agreement with studies evaluating the salt tolerance of microbial communities in activated and granular sludge processes he et al 2017 ji et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 autochthonous or allochthonous biomass one of the aim of this study was to compare the performance of the autochthonous biomass with that allochthonous acclimated to salinity the results discussed above indicated that the autochthonous halophilic marine bacteria enabled very high nutrient removal efficiencies compared to halotolerant biomasses he et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in terms of nutrient removal performance both the sbrs enables more than 95 of the influent organic load 2 25 g cod m 3d 1 which resulted higher than that obtained in other studies with acclimated biomass operating at lower salinity and treating synthetic wastewater ji et al 2018 ou et al 2018a wang et al 2014 while referring to nitrogen removal complete nitritation was successfully achieved within the entire range of salinity investigated in contrast in previous literature nitrogen removal is considered the main concern related to the treatment of saline wastewater in the majority of the available studies in the literature complete nitrification is generally achieved up to 20 gnacl l 1 pronk et al 2014 whereas stable nitritation was achieved up to a salinity of approximately 45 gnacl l 1 although it rapidly collapsed at higher salt concentration garcía ruiz et al 2018 moreover in terms of physical structure of the bio aggregates it was observed that detrimental effects on the eps matrix occurred as a result of long srt whereas it was not affected by the increase in salinity as reported in previous studies with acclimated biomasses corsino et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the results above confirmed that the use of autochthonous halophilic bacteria represents a valuable solution for the treatment high strength carbon and nitrogen saline wastewater the results also indicated that both kinetics and performances were significantly higher than those achievable with acclimated halotolerant microorganisms even at higher salinity lefebvre and moletta 2006 wang et al 2017 results reported in literature suggest that although the acclimatization of conventional activated sludge to the salinity is possible lefebvre and moletta 2006 van den akker et al 2015 wang et al 2015 the achievement of high ammonium oxidation rates and nitrogen removal efficiencies is limited within a range of salinity between 5 gnacl l 1 and 33 gnacl l 1 pronk et al 2014 wang et al 2017 moreover the autochthonous biomass had a better biodiversity compared to the acclimated biomass as proven by the considerable microbial diversity that gained a higher nutrient removal performances and process stability at high salinity levels it is worth mentioning that a comparison between the results above with others referred to the autochthonous halophilic biomass under similar operating conditions was not carried out because of the lack of knowledge in the literature besides the achieved results suggested that halophilic biomass could tolerate higher salinity levels than those tested in this study however it has to be mentioned that under higher salinity levels several technical drawbacks could occur like salt deposits on equipment and devices as well as scaling on the air diffuser that create management difficulties independently on the effects of the salinity on the bacterial metabolism the result discussed above demonstrated that the start up of a plant designed for the treatment of a saline wastewater with an inoculum of autochthonous biomass is more appropriated than using allochthonous bacteria indeed the cultivation of the autochthonous biomass offers benefits in terms of higher metabolic kinetics higher microbial diversity stable process operation thereby enabling an effluent of superior quality while saving energy and footprint therefore both from a management and process point of view the system s start up without any inoculum thus allowing developing the autochthonous biomass represent a valuable operating strategy to achieve highly performing systems 4 2 granular or activated sludge overall biological performances were comparable in both the activated and the granular sludge reactors thereby indicating that when a stepwise increase strategy of the salinity is performed the granulation process did not provide significant improvements in the nutrient removal processes previous studies demonstrated that the aerobic granulation of halophilic sludge offers an advantage in case of drastic salinity fluctuations corsino et al 2018 indeed because of the bigger and denser structure the aerobic granules are able to withstand drastic and moderate salinity fluctuations in the short and long term better than activated sludge nonetheless if a stepwise strategy of salinity increases is performed the halophilic activated sludge shows a similar response to salinity increases compared to halophilic granular sludge the bacterial community analysis did not highlight significant differences between the ags sbr and as sbr indeed although the taxon richness resulted to be higher in the ags sbr sample the halophilic marine biomass showed a very similar taxon composition in both the sbrs biological performances resulted mostly affected by the srt and by the decreasing solubility of the oxygen due to the salinity in both the systems indeed the oxygen transfer and diffusion processes as well as the biomass ageing significantly affected both the carbon and the nitrogen removal kinetics and performances more than salinity this was more noticeable in the ags sbr because of the higher size and density of the microbial aggregates that represented an additional barrier to the oxygen diffusion and favoured the buildup of inert material nevertheless although the kinetic and the biological performances were comparable within the entire range of salinity investigated in this study it is worth mentioning that because of the higher biomass retention capacity ags systems could be able to enable almost 50 of volume saving 5 conclusions nutrient removal performances and kinetics of autochthonous marine bacteria in forms of activated and granular sludge were assessed at different salinity levels ranging from 30 gnacl l 1 to 50 gnacl l 1 in two sbrs the achieved results demonstrated that the cultivation of the autochthonous biomass offers benefits in terms of higher metabolic kinetics higher microbial diversity and stable process operation than allochthonous acclimated biomass thereby enabling an effluent of superior quality at the maximum salinity level tested the microbial community was dominated in both the systems by marine species belonged to the genera owenweeksia cryomorphaceae vitellibacter flavobacteriaceae and marinifilum bacteroidia both the sbrs provided a high quality effluent enabling performances approximately of 98 and 90 in terms of carbon removal and nitritation efficiency respectively denitritation process was limited independently of salinity resulting in tn removal efficiency lower than 70 nevertheless the biomass activity and performances slightly decreased as a result of a long srt 27 days because of salt accumulation within the activated sludge flocs and granules although the high salinity aur and nur of approximately 3 60 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 and 10 0 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 respectively indicated a high activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria the obtained results also indicated that a lower srt 14 days favoured the discharge of the granules and flocs with higher inert content thereby enhancing the biomass renewing and a high metabolic activity the operating strategy of stepwise increasing the salinity and decreasing the srt is crucial for a dual proposal when treating saline wastewater first to avoid an excessive buildup of salt within the biomass aggregates and second to avoid their physical destructuration indeed both the strategies enabled to achieve sludge with good physical properties because of the decrease in the lb eps fraction lastly if a stepwise strategy of salinity increases is performed the halophilic activated sludge shows a similar response to salinity increases compared to halophilic granular sludge

19215,biological nutrient removal performances and kinetics of autochthonous marine biomass in forms of activated sludge and aerobic granular sludge were investigated under different salinity and sludge retention time srt both the biomasses cultivated from a fish canning wastewater were subjected to stepwise increases in salinity 2 gnacl l 1 from 30 gnacl l 1 up to 50 gnacl l 1 with the aim to evaluate the maximum potential in withstanding salinity by the autochthonous marine biomass microbial marine species belonging to the genus of cryomorphaceae and of rhodobacteraceae were found dominant in both the systems at the maximum salinity tested 50 gnacl l 1 the organic carbon was removed with a yield of approximately 98 irrespective of the salinity similarly nitrogen removal occurred via nitritation denitritation and was not affected by salinity the ammonium utilization rate and the nitrite utilization rate were approximately of 3 60 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 and 10 0 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 respectively indicating a high activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria the granulation process did not provide significant improvements in the nutrients removal process likely due to the stepwise salinity increase strategy biomass activity and performances resulted affected by long srt 27 days due to salt accumulation within the activated sludge flocs and granules in contrast a lower srt 14 days favoured the discharge of the granules and flocs with higher inert content thereby enhancing the biomass renewing the obtained results demonstrated that the use of autochthonous halophilic bacteria represents a valuable solution for the treatment of high strength carbon and nitrogen saline wastewater in a wide range of salinity besides the stepwise increase in salinity and the operation at low srt enabled high metabolic activity and to avoid excessive accumulation of salt within the biomass aggregates limiting their physical destructuration due to the increase in loosely bound exopolymers graphical abstract image 1 keywords activated sludge aerobic granular sludge autochthonous halophilic bacteria shortcut nitrification saline wastewater 1 introduction nowadays several activities including petroleum chemical and fish canning produce large amount of wastewaters featured by high salt chloride concentration in many cases these wastewaters contain significant concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and total nitrogen tn chowdhury et al 2010 corsino et al 2016 chemical and physical treatments like membrane separation ion exchange or electrodialysis have been widely investigated in the past fan et al 2011 muthukumaran and baskaran 2013 although these methods are highly performing they lead to secondary pollution chemicals disposal and are less cost effective than biological treatments energy and chemicals consumption therefore they are currently limited only to specific applications he et al 2017 whereas biological treatments are widely recognized as cost effective their application in the field of industrial saline wastewater still represent a challenge indeed one of the main drawbacks when treating saline wastewater is related to plasmolysis that involves the breaking of the cellular membrane leading to the cell death lefebvre and moletta 2006 this phenomenon occurs when the solute concentration in the cytoplasm is higher than that in the surrounding environment similarly plasmolysis could occur when the aqueous environment is hypertonic compared to the cytoplasm although several studies demonstrated that the acclimation of activated sludge as to salinity can be successfully achieved the main bottleneck consists in the removal efficiencies of such salt adapted systems campo et al 2018 lefebvre and moletta 2006 zhang et al 2017 to overcome this drawback many authors suggested the use of aerobic granular sludge ags since bacteria bio aggregation could help to operate at higher salinity and faster kinetics as well wang et al 2015 2017 nevertheless the research findings suggested that halo tolerant biomass even in the form of granular sludge totally lose its metabolic functionalities over a certain salinity level 20 g nacl l 1 jemli et al 2015 thereby resulting in loss of removal efficiencies recently chen et al 2018 demonstrated that microbial community diversity and richness as well as removal performance for nitrogen and organic carbon deteriorated with increasing in salinity from 0 gnacl l 1 to 20 gnacl l 1 the authors observed that salinity inhibited the dehydrogenase activity of activated sludge thus decreasing bacterial metabolic activity for these reasons many researchers encouraged the use of halophilic bacteria for the biological treatment of high strength saline wastewater gomes et al 2018 guo et al 2016 recently several studies on the treatment of saline and hypersaline wastewater by means of halophilic biomass were carried out cui et al 2016 oren 2010 zhuang et al 2010 among these capodici et al 2018 successfully cultivated autochthonous activated sludge from a real fish canning wastewater the authors assumed the presence of autochthonous active biomass in their study and speculated that it may be belonged to halophilic strains because of their ability to survive in hypersaline saline environment 30 gnacl l 1 the removal efficiencies bod and tss were higher than 90 similarly more than 95 of the nitrogen was removed via shortcut nitrification denitrification partial nitrification or nitritation naturally occurs treating saline wastewater because nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are more sensitive to the salt concentration than the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob however capodici and coauthors tested the effectiveness of the autochthonous biomass only at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity therefore the ability of these bacteria to survive at higher salinity and its performances were not tested so far furthermore it is possible to speculate that bio aggregation of these bacteria in aerobic granular sludge ags could represent a further advantage thereby enhancing the biological performances or enabling the possibility to operate at higher salinity another issue concerning the treatment of saline wastewater is related to the choice of a proper sludge retention time srt indeed although at high salinity the biomass yield decreased thereby limiting the sludge wasting ching and redzwan 2017 longer srt could result in excessive ageing of the sludge because of accumulation of inert material within the flocs or granules this in turn affects the biological performances because of the decrease in the biomass active fraction in the system therefore the choice of a proper srt allow to avoid the decay of biological performances in the long term to the authors knowledge no studies reporting about the performances and the kinetics of autochthonous marine biomass at salinity higher than 30 gnacl l 1 nor the effects of srt exist additionally specific molecular analysis aimed at identifying these bacteria were not performed up to now in this respect identification of bacterial communities is indispensable for a better understanding of the biological processes that enable the nutrient removal especially for the treatment of not conventional wastewater the purpose of this study was to validate the approach of cultivating autochthonous marine biomass for the treatment of saline wastewater and to test its maximum potentiality in terms of salinity withstanding with this aim this study investigated the biological nutrient removal efficiencies and the metabolic kinetics of autochthonous marine biomass derived from fish canning wastewater in forms of activated sludge and granular sludge in a range of salinity between 30 gnacl l 1 and 50 gnacl l 1 at different srts 2 materials and method 2 1 reactors set up two sequencing batch reactors sbr one with aerobic granular sludge ags sbr and the other with flocculent activated sludge as sbr were operated as reported in previous studies capodici et al 2018 corsino et al 2018 because the biomass retention capacity of the ags reactor was double than the as with the aim to compare the performances of those systems operating with the same biomass amount the volume of the as sbr was chosen as the double of the ags sbr more precisely the ags sbr was a column type 100 cm height with a working volume of 4 l internal diameter of 8 6 cm and was characterized by an internal riser 50 cm high with an internal diameter of 5 4 cm the as sbr had an operating volume of 8 l both the sbrs were equipped with a feeding pump and a solenoid valve for the effluent discharge placed at the mid point of the reactor yielding a volumetric exchange ratio ver equal to 50 the volume of the raw wastewater treated per day was equal to 4 l and 8 l for the ags sbr and for the as sbr respectively therefore the hydraulic retention time hrt was equal to 24 h in both the reactors the ags sbr was operated on a 12 h cycle divided into 60 min of not aerated influent upflow feeding 10 h and 50 min of aeration 650 min 5 min of settling and 5 min of effluent discharge air was introduced via a fine bubble aerator at the base of the reactor at a flow rate of 3 l min 1 so that the superficial air velocity was approximately of 2 4 cm s 1 the as sbr cycle included 60 min of influent feeding mixed and not aerated 9 h and 30 min 570 min of aeration 60 of anoxic mixing followed by 5 min of aeration to favour nitrogen stripping 20 min of settling and 5 min of effluent discharge the length of aerated not aerated period was set in order to maximize nitrogen removal efficiency a stirrer device provided the mixing during the non aerated period and a fine bubble diffuser provided the air supply a programmable logic controller plc automatically handled the sbrs cycling operations the dissolved oxygen do concentration within the bulk was maintained close to the saturation value according to the temperature and salinity 2 2 experimental set up the ags sbr and the as sbr were monitored for 165 days both the reactors were seeded with autochthonous activated sludge derived from a fish canning wastewater for the cultivation of this sludge a parent reactor working as a conventional sbr was started up without an activated sludge inoculum more precisely this reactor was filled with raw fish canning wastewater and was operated with a complete sludge retention strategy until the autochthonous activated sludge developed for further details on the cultivation of the autochthonous biomass the reader is referred to the literature capodici et al 2018 the fish canning wastewater was collected from a local industry that produces canned anchovies palermo italy the raw fish canning wastewater was collected from the canning section of the industry where the wastewater had a salt concentration of approximately 150 g nacl l 1 then the raw fish canning wastewater was diluted with tap water 1 5 v v to obtain a salt concentration approximately equal to that of the wastewater at the outlet of the industry 30 g nacl l 1 after dilution the cod and the bod5 concentration resulted on average in approximately 800 mg l 1 respectively whereas the tn and the nh4 n were on average equal to 150 mg l 1 and 115 mg l 1 respectively table 1 the ags sbr and the as sbr were seeded with the autochthonous activated sludge derived from the parent sbr reactor with a tss concentration of approximately 3 gtss l 1 subsequently both the reactors were operated for approximately 3 months until steady conditions were achieved the salinity was kept constant to 30 gnacl l 1 until full granulation and stable performance data not discussed were achieved in the ags sbr and as sbr systems at the end of the start up phase beginning of this study the tss concentration was of approximately 6 3 gtss l 1 and 13 1 gtss l 1 in the as and ags reactor respectively when steady state conditions were reached in both the sbrs salt concentration was gradually increased in details although steady state condition is conventionally referred to the srt in this study it was assumed that steady state condition were reached when a steady nutrients removal efficiency occurred fluctuations smaller than 3 nevertheless a minimum duration of 15 days for each phase was imposed the experiment was divided into eleven phases during which salinity was stepwise increased by 2 gnacl l 1 each by adding a known amount of sodium chloride to the diluted wastewater in this way the bod5 and total nitrogen concentration in the feed were kept constant during the entire experiment salinity was increased up to 50 gnacl l 1 and it was not further increased because of issues related to the oxygen transfer and scaling as a consequence of the high salt concentration the srt was not imposed until phase 6 corresponding to 40 gnacl l 1 table 1 when the sludge wastage flux was set in order to maintain a tss concentration of approximately 12 0 gtss l 1 and 6 0 gtss l 1 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively thus the srt was approximately of 27 days in both the sbrs however due to the accumulation of inert material within the aerobic granules in the ags sbr and to the ageing of the activated sludge in the as sbr since phase 7 a regular sludge withdrawal corresponding to a srt close to 14 days was performed more precisely a selective wastage strategy was performed in the ags sbr consisting in discharging the granules from the bottom of the reactor after the settling phase in this way the heaviest granules likely those with the highest inert matter content were selectively wasted in the as sbr the sludge was wasted from the liquid bulk during the aeration phase in table 1 the main operating conditions and wastewater characteristics are summarized 2 3 analytical methods the chemical physical parameters cod bod5 nh4 n no2 n were analyzed according to standard methods apha 2005 the tss and volatile suspended solid vss concentrations were troublesome due to the salt adsorption within the activated sludge flocs to address this problem a modified method was used capodici et al 2018 the total nitrogen concentration was determined in total nitrogen measuring unit tnm 1 shimadzu japan eps extraction was performed according to the heating method le clech et al 2006 for each eps fraction the carbohydrates ps and the proteins pn were determined in accordance with the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 and with the folin method lowry et al 1951 respectively the observed yield coefficient yobs was calculated through mass balances between sludge withdrawn and sludge production dividing by the cumulated bod5 removed according to eq 1 eq 1 y o b s x 2 x 1 v x e q x s q s b o d i n b o d o u t q g v s s g b o d 1 where x2 and x1 are the biomass concentrations g vss l 1 at day n and n 1 v is the working volume of the reactor q is the influent flow xs and xe are the concentrations of the waste biomass and the effluent g vss l 1 qs is the volume of waste sludge on a daily base bodin and bodout are the influent and effluent bod5 concentration g l 1 respectively the size of the activated sludge flocs and granules was examined by means of a high speed image analyses sensor sympatec qicpic that allowed the evaluation of sludge particle size distribution psd the settling properties of the ags and the as were evaluated by means of the sludge volume index svi the svi was calculated as the ratio between the volume occupied by the sludge after a static settling phase and the tss concentration of the sample because of the different nature of the ags and as to compare the achieved results with previous respective studies the svi was calculated in a different way more precisely for the ags the svi was calculated based on the volume of settled sludge after 5 min svi5 whereas for the as the svi was calculated by considering the volume of settled sludge after 30 min svi30 giesen et al 2013 the svi30 was calculated also for the ags in order to evaluate the svi5 svi30 ratio the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the mixed liquor was measured continuously by means of a wtw iq sensor net system 2020 xt equipped with on line sensor probes the electrical conductivity ec was measured instead of a direct assessment of salinity because it was more reliable therefore salinity was calculated based on a correlation curve with the ec one way analysis of variance one way anova was used to assess the relationship between salinity changes and biomass kinetics error level equal to 0 05 2 3 1 metabolic kinetic assessment to evaluate the impact of the salinity increase on nitrogen removal kinetics ammonium utilization rate aur and nitrite utilization rate nur tests were performed in each experimental phase kinetic tests were performed only when steady conditions were reached these tests were performed in a 1 5 l batch reactor 3 gtss l 1 at controlled temperature 20 c specifically based on the tss concentration a known amount of mixed liquor sample was withdrawn from the respective parent reactors and put in the batch reactor ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite were added as ammonia and nitrite sources respectively kinetic batch tests were replicated during each experimental phase during aur tests do was provided via a fine bubble diffuser and it was maintained close to the saturation value in accordance with the temperature and salinity nur tests were performed in not aerated conditions by using a magnetic stirrer device to mix the sample during the trials although anoxic conditions generally occur within the inner layers of granules even in the presence of dissolved oxygen in the bulk it was decided to perform nur tests for the ags under the same conditions of the as not aerated conditions sodium acetate was added as external carbon source to enhance the nitrites reduction in particular 100 ml of a concentrate solution containing sodium acetate 10 g l 1 was dosed as to have a concentration within the batch reactor of approximately 500 g l 1 moreover in order to assess the possible presence of nob specific experiments were periodically run in a similar way than the aur tests by adding sodium nitrite instead of ammonium chloride under aerobic conditions kinetic tests were operated for 2 h each during which 10 ml of sample was withdrawn at regular time intervals 10 min thus samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for nh4 n and no2 n analyses the aur and nur were calculated as the slope of the linear regression line of nh4 n and no2 n data these values were then referred to the volatile suspended solids concentration of the sample the initial ammonium concentration for each aur batch test was approximately of 100 mg nh4 n l 1 whereas the nitrite concentration for the nur tests was close to 50 mg no2 n l 1 2 3 2 dna extraction and 16s rrna amplicon

granules and activated sludge characteristics physical properties of granular and activated sludge observed at different salinity are reported in table 2 the mature granules obtained at the end of cultivation period were characterized by a mean size of approximately 2 6 mm a svi after 5 min of settling of 14 9 ml gtss 1 and an inert content of approximately 35 vss tss 0 65 the mean size of granules rapidly increased during the experiment and granules of approximately 4 mm were obtained at 40 gnacl l 1 of salinity which was consistent with previous studies that reported the average size of particles increased with salinity ji et al 2018 until phase 6 the vss concentration was decreasing and accordingly the inert content of the granules was over 45 thereby indicating a significant accumulation of inert material after the srt was decreased to 14 days phase 7 onward the vss concentration and the vss tss ratio increased to 65 thereby suggesting the occurrence of biomass renewing the mean size of flocs in the as sbr slightly decreased with the increase in salinity from 152 μm to approximately 115 μm at 50 gnacl l 1 of salinity the vss concentration in the as sbr decreased during the period in which the srt was maintained at approximately 27 days reaching a minimum value of 4 32 gvss l 1 at phase 6 corresponding to an inert content of 35 after the srt was decreased the vss concentration ranged between 4 5 gvss l 1 and 4 7 gvss l 1 until the end of the experiment the inert content was close to 27 and it was constant for the rest of the experiment thereby indicating that salt accumulation within the flocs did not occurred under lower srt referring to the svi values no significant changes with the increase in salinity were observed in the ags sbr the svi5 slightly ranged between 14 ml gtss 1 and 17 ml gtss 1 during the entire experiment whereas the svi5 svi30 value was approximately 1 1 this result was in contrast with the findings of a previous study in which the svi decreasing with the increase in salinity from 2 gnacl l 1 to 15 gnacl l 1 wang et al 2017 this was probably due to the fact that in this study the maturation of granular sludge was achieved before than salinity was increased whereas in the study by wang and co authors salinity was increased simultaneously with the granulation process the svi30 decreased with the increase in salinity in the as sbr starting from an initial value of 85 ml gtss 1 the svi30 constantly decreased to 68 ml gtss 1 at the end of the experiment this result could be related to the increase of the bulk buoyancy that resulted in the increase of the hydraulic selection pressure in this way the reactor started to enrich in faster settling activated sludge similar findings were also achieved in other studies chen et al 2018 ou et al 2018a this was not observed in the ags sbr likely because the granules were already hydraulically selected by the shorter duration of the settling phase the observed yield coefficient of the heterotrophic biomass in the ags sbr slightly decreased during the entire experiment from 0 168 gvss g bod5 1 to 0 121 gvss g bod5 1 suggesting the reduction of new biomass synthesis due to the salinity increase which was consistent with the literature mannina et al 2016 wu et al 2008 the influence of srt on the observed yield coefficient resulted negligible similarly in the as sbr the observed yield coefficient decreased by almost 40 from 0 195 gvss g bod5 1 phase 1 to 0 113 gvss g bod5 1 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 however after phase 7 42 gnacl l 1 under srt of 14 days the yobs increased and ranged between approximately 0 159 gvss g bod5 1 and 0 168 gvss g bod5 1 until the end of the experiment the achieved results indicated that the biomass synthesis decreased with the increase in salinity nevertheless a lower srt enhanced the biomass renewing as well as the synthesis of new bacterial cells it is reasonable to explain the biomass activity although the high salinity level due to the dominance of the marine species 3 2 eps pattern in activated and granular sludge the trend of the specific eps content and that of the loosely bound fraction in the activated sludge and granular sludge reactors during the experiment are depicted in fig 1 the specific eps content increased with salinity in both the sbrs thereby confirming that bacteria produce excess of exopolymers to face the salinity increases corsino et al 2017 ji et al 2018 this is likely due to the cell protection role played by eps against high salinity as suggested for biofilm communities decho 2013 these exopolymeric substances are an abundant component of microbial mats developed in hypersaline systems such as salt ponds salterns and hypersaline lagoons decho and gutierrez 2017 where eps seem to condense with increasing salinity and even form a hydrophobic barrier on the surface of biofilm decho 2013 interestingly the eps content significantly started to increase in both the reactors after phase 4 when the salinity was equal to 36 gnacl l 1 in general when saline concentration is changing in the bulk the overproduction of eps helps to reduce the destruction of microorganisms due to maintaining of the cellular osmotic pressure balance in halotolerant activated sludge bioreactors the response of bacteria to salinity increases in terms of overproduction of eps occurs from salinity levels of approximately 5 10 gnacl l 1 campo et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in this study the response by the halophilic marine bacteria to the salinity increase occurred at salinity over 36 gnacl l 1 therefore based on the result above it is possible to speculate that the response of marine bacteria to the salinity increase in terms of overproduction of eps started when the gradient of osmotic pressure between the inner and the outer of the bacterial cells exceeded a certain threshold value which is significantly higher than that of halotolerant microorganisms in both the ags sbr and the as sbr the eps were mainly constituted by the tightly bound fraction average value 90 however it is worth to observe that the loosely bound fraction was increasing when the srt was not controlled fig 1 indeed the loosely bound fraction reached its maximum value at phase 6 in both the reactors when the salinity was equal to 40 gnacl l 1 specifically the lb eps accounted for approximately 22 and 18 of the total eps content in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively this result was in good agreement with a previous study corsino et al 2017 in which the authors observed an exponential increase in the lb eps content with the increase in salinity under not controlled srt after phase 6 when a shorter srt was applied the lb eps fraction decreased in both the reactors as far as a stable value of approximately 5 in the ags sbr and 3 in the as sbr was reached previous studies demonstrated that the increase in salinity caused a significant increase in the loosely bound eps fraction of halotolerant activated and granular sludge corsino et al 2017 wang et al 2015 l zhao et al 2016a similarly other authors observed a significant increase in the loosely bound eps of halophilic biomass in both forms of activated and granular sludge subjected to drastic salinity increase corsino et al 2018 ismail et al 2010 demonstrated that under high salinity the epss matrix suffers a deterioration because of the replacement of calcium ions by sodium ones thereby resulting in the increase in the loosely bound fraction in contrast the results obtained in this study indicated that by stepwise increasing the salinity and by decreasing the srt the amount of loosely bound eps decreased these results likely suggest that the detrimental effect exerted by sodium cations toward the eps matrix occurs in the long term and as a response of high salinity increases therefore lower srt and stepwise salinity increases enable to minimize the eps matrix deterioration thereby promoting the formation of sludge with good physical characteristics concerning the eps composition the proteins resulted the main eps constituent the amount of proteins was more than five times higher than that of carbohydrates and no significant changes were observed in the pn ps ratio with the increase in salinity and srt as well specifically the protein concentration increased from 190 mg gvss 1 to approximately 320 mg gvss 1 in the ags and from 150 mg gvss 1 to approximately 410 mg gvss 1 in the as during the entire experiment similarly the carbohydrates concentration increased from 40 mg gvss 1 to approximately 65 mg gvss 1 in the ags and from 30 mg gvss 1 to approximately 82 mg gvss 1 in the as during the entire experiment consequently the pn ps ratio was constant to a stable value of approximately 5 during the entire experiment 3 3 carbon removal efficiency time courses of the bod5 and cod in the influent and effluents of the ags sbr and as sbr as well as the removal efficiencies in both the reactors are depicted in fig 2 a and b respectively the bod5 in the influent fish canning wastewater ranged approximately between 700 mg l 1 and 1100 mg l 1 both the sbrs provided effluents of constant quality in terms of bod5 which resulted always below 45 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively therefore the carbon removal efficiency was on average equal approximately to 98 which was much higher than the performance achieved in other studies with salt adapted microorganisms chen et al 2018 ou et al 2018a a slight decrease was observed in both reactors when the srt was set equal to 27 days likely due to the accumulation of salt within the flocs and granules as discussed above the reduction of srt since phase 7 enabled the biomass renewing resulting in an improvement of carbon removal efficiency the removal efficiencies in both the reactors were in good agreement with the vss tss ratio values table 1 suggesting that when treating saline wastewater a lower srt enables to avoid the decrease of the active biomass within the microbial aggregates thereby preventing the worsening of the biological performances a similar trend was observed also concerning the cod the cod in the influent ranged between 1710 mg l 1 and 2423 mg l 1 whereas the cod in the effluent was mostly below 100 mg l 1 in both the ags and the as systems fig 2c overall both the sbrs provided more than 95 of cod removal the achieved results indicated that the autochthonous heterotrophic bacteria were extremely active even at high salinity levels in terms of organic loading rate both the sbrs were able to remove more than 95 of the influent organic load with an average rate of approximately 2 14 g cod m 3d 1 in a previous study zhao et al 2016a 2016b obtained 80 of cod removal at 35 gnacl l 1 in a sbr with acclimated activated sludge operating with an organic loading rate of approximately 2 g cod m 3d 1 synthetic medium similarly in an salt adapted ags system ou et al 2018b achieved the removal of approximately 1 06 g cod m 3d 1 operating with acetate based wastewater at 50 gnacl l 1 of salinity based on the available literature salt adapted microorganisms were able to remove approximately the 50 70 of the influent organic load at salinity higher than 30 gnacl l 1 showing a decreasing trend with the salinity increase ji et al 2018 wang et al 2014 it is worth mentioning that mostly of the cited studies are referred to the treatment of synthetic wastewater while referring to real wastewater val del rio et al val del río et al 2012 obtained the removal approximately of 30 of the influent organic loading rate 4 g cod m 3d 1 in a ags sbr treating fish canning wastewater at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity similarly figueroa et al 2008 obtained 90 of cod removal in a ags sbr operating with an organic loading rate of 1 5 g cod m 3d 1 at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity after a long acclimation period the results achieved in this study demonstrated that the autochthonous marine biomass was able of providing excellent carbon removal performance even at higher salinity than those tested in previous studies capodici et al 2018 ramos et al 2015 van den akker et al 2015 the dominance of this marine species can explain the biomass activity although the high salinity level it is worth mentioning that strategy of stepwise increasing the salinity contributed to avoid sudden increase in the solute concentration around bacterial cells thereby preventing osmotic stress indeed drastic osmotic shocks would cause plasmolysis because cells lose water through osmosis thus inhibiting the transport of substrates into the cell and the carbon removal performance lang et al 2005 a gradual adaptation to salinity enables bacteria to face to the higher osmotic pressure by accumulating organic compounds in the cytoplasm avoiding the loss of the metabolic activity the obtained results clearly demonstrated that the use of autochthonous biomass and the stepwise increase in salinity are effective approaches to achieve excellent carbon removal performance for the treatment of wastewater at high salinity 3 4 nitrogen removal efficiency the overall performance of ags sbr and as sbr systems concerning nitrogen removal with the increased salinity is shown in fig 4 in this study no nitrates were observed in the effluent for the entire experiment and also kinetic batch tests confirmed that biological activity of nob bacteria was inhibited in high saline environment besides also ngs analysis revealed the absence of nob bacteria in both the sbrs communities a typical trend of the nitrogen pattern during an operational cycle in the ags sbr and as sbr phase 1 is shown in fig s1 since the srt was set equal to 27 days the effluent ammonium concentration showed a slightly increasing trend in both the sbrs while maintaining always below 20 mg l 1 fig 3 a accordingly the nitritation efficiencies decreased from approximately 98 phase 1 to 92 and 88 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively fig 3b the achieved results were in good agreement with the sludge ageing previously discussed nevertheless the nitritation performance was approximately close to 90 in both the sbrs thereby indicating a high activity of the beta aob mainly belonging to nitrosomonas species as shown by ngs analysis when the srt was decreased at the beginning of phase 7 the effluent ammonium concentration increased in both the reactors in particular the effluent ammonium concentration reached its maximum value at phase 8 of approximately 36 mg l 1 and 23 mg l 1 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively accordingly the nitritation efficiency rapidly decreased reaching the minimum value of 78 in the ags sbr and 85 in the as sbr this result could be likely related to the srt decrease which caused a wash out of nitrifies nevertheless both the reactors rapidly adapted to the new operating conditions indeed the effluent ammonium concentration decreased in the subsequent phases reaching a steady value of approximately 18 mgnh4 n l 1 at the end of the experiment the nitritation efficiency was 93 and 88 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively based on the achieved results the salinity did not significantly affect the biological activity of the halophilic aob strains which were able to provide high performances during the entire experiment in contrast an excessive accumulation of salt and inert material within the granules or flocs worsened the nitritation performances likely because of the decrease in the overall active biomass within the reactors that occurred from phase 1 to phase 6 before the srt was decreased during the entire experiment the nitrite concentrations in the effluents of the sbrs ranged between 40 mg no2 n l 1 and 70 mg no2 n l 1 consistent with the ammonium oxidation performances the high concentration of nitrites in the effluent suggested that the denitritation process was limited independently of salinity nitrites reduction by denitrifies occurred during the anoxic period in the as sbr and within the layered structure of the granules in the ags sbr simultaneously with the nitritation process corsino et al 2016 overall the total nitrogen concentration in the sbrs effluents ranged between 40 mg tn l 1 and 75 mg tn l 1 fig 3c resulting in tn removal efficiencies ranging between 60 and 40 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively fig 3d no significant relation with the increase in salinity was observed based on the results above denitritation was the limiting process for total nitrogen removal it is reasonable to assume that denitritation was limited by lack of carbon as nitrite concentration in both the effluents did not show any significant relation with salinity however a distinction should be made between the ags sbr and the as sbr in the latter because denitritation occurred only during the not aerated phase when ammonium was already oxidized to nitrite and the organic carbon was almost completely oxidized therefore this certainly limited the availability of the organic substrate for nitrite reduction it is reasonable that endogenous denitritation occurred through the use of bacterial internal carbon sources that limited the reaction kinetic bernat et al 2008 in the ags reactor in addition to the carbon limitation it is also reasonable that the high oxygen concentration in the bulk close to the saturation value was the limiting factor for the simultaneous nitritation denitritation process indeed under these operating conditions it is possible that the oxygen concentrations in the inner layers of the granule was very high thereby favouring aerobic reactions instead of anoxic 3 5 nitrogen removal kinetics nitritation and denitritation kinetics were evaluated by means of aur and nur tests the results obtained during the experiments are depicted in fig 4 nitritation and denitritation kinetics showed a high metabolic activity of both nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria although the high salinity level the achieved results were comparable to those of cas systems metcalf and eddy 2015 and were significantly higher than kinetics related to halotolerant biomass pronk et al 2014 aur slightly decreased in both sbrs when salinity was increased from 30 gnacl l 1 to 40 gnacl l 1 fig 4a during the period at 27 days of srt more precisely the aur in the ags sbr decreased from 4 67 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity to 3 97 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 thereby reducing by approximately 16 in contrast the aur in the as sbr decreased from 4 05 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 to 2 93 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 within the same range of salinity thus the decrease in aur was of approximately 38 in the as sbr which was 2 4 times more the ags sbr these results were in good agreement with nitritation performances above discussed based on these results the increase in salinity with a stepwise strategy within a range of 30 gnacl l 1 and 40 gnacl l 1 had a negligible effect on biological activity of aobs in the ags i e p 0 286 whereas a significant decrease was noted in the as although the one way analysis of variance indicated a low correlation value i e p 0 210 after phase 6 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 the aur sharply decreased in the ags sbr approximately by 22 at salinity of 42 gnacl l 1 the aur in the ags sbr was approximately 3 20 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 and this value was comparable with that in the as sbr therefore a sharp decrease in aobs activity was noted at salinity higher than 40 gnacl l 1 although this occurred only in the ags reactor such result could be likely due to the accumulation of inert material within the granules and to the limitation to oxygen diffusion indeed at phase 6 approximately the 78 of aerobic granules were on average bigger that 4 mm likely because of the inclusions of inert material within the structure of granules salt and inert particulate deriving from the raw wastewater the high salt concentration that decreased the oxygen saturation within the liquid bulk and the bigger size of granules increased the resistance to oxygen diffusion within the inner layers endangering the ammonia oxidation process besides accumulation of inert inorganic material within the granule caused a decrease in the vss tss ratio that was approximately 53 because of the lower vss tss ratio in the ags the biologically active fraction of the granule significantly decreased thereby reducing the ammonium oxidation capacity by the ags system after the srt was decreased to 14 days the new operating conditions rapidly reflected on the aobs activity in the as sbr indeed the aur increased from 3 18 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 to approximately 4 0 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 at salinity of 46 gnacl l 1 thereafter the aur ranged between 3 87 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 and 3 84 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 during the rest of the experiment contrarily the aur in the ags sbr still decreased until phase 8 at salinity of 44 gnacl l 1 when it reached its minimum value of approximately 2 44 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 subsequently a reversal of this decreasing trend occurred however the trend reversal point was slightly shifted in time respect to that in the as sbr in the last experimental phase at 50 gnacl l 1 of salinity the aur reached a value of approximately 3 54 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 it is worth mentioning that the shortened in srt after phase 6 caused the decrease in the size of granules in the ags sbr this certainly affected the aur kinetics because the smaller size of bio aggregates favoured the increase of oxygen penetration depth thereby increasing the aerobic zone of the granule which is associated with the capacity for nitritation wang et al 2017 overall the stepwise increase strategy resulted in a decrease in aur of approximately 2 7 and 0 5 in the ags sbr and as sbr respectively for each salinity increase nonetheless the stepwise strategy of increasing salinity did not significantly affect the aur kinetics of the ags sbr and as sbr systems the results of one way analysis of variance one way anova indicated that considering the entire range of salinity the salinity increase had a marginal effect on aur kinetic in the ags p 0 302 and the as reactors p 0 289 based on the results above the metabolic activity of the aobs was higher in the ags than the as up to a salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 whereas at higher salinity levels aur kinetics were higher in the as it is worth mentioning that over a certain salinity the oxygen diffusion within the liquid bulk began to be salt limited zannotti and giovannetti 2015 consequently at high salinity the ammonia oxidation process could be oxygen limiting besides in the aerobic granules autotrophic bacteria develop in the inner layers winkler et al 2012 consequently to provide enough electron donors for the aobs metabolic functionalities oxygen has to penetrate deeper within the granule therefore although the compact structure of the granules act as a kind of protecting shield for bacteria it makes even more difficult the oxygen diffusion within the inner layers this would explain why over a salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 the metabolic activity of aobs was higher in the as sbr at lower salinity instead the oxygen diffusion is not a limiting factor for the ammonia oxidation process therefore within a range of salinity between 30 gnacl l 1 and 40 gnacl l 1 aur kinetics were higher in the ags sbr likely because of the higher active biomass retention in the aerobic granules than the flocculent activated sludge that enabled to enhance a faster oxidation of ammonium in this respect the nur tests confirmed that lower srt enabled to achieve a significant reprise of metabolic activity of aobs strains especially in ags systems the values of the nur at different salinity are shown in fig 4b the nur ranged between 9 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 and 10 5 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 in the ags sbr during the entire experiment independently of salinity conversely the nur in the as sbr showed a decreasing trend during the period at srt of 27 days when salinity was increased from 30 gnacl l 1 to 40 gnacl l 1 indeed the nur decreased from 13 8 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 to approximately 9 0 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 at phase 6 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 thereby decreasing approximately of 40 after phase 6 when the srt was decreased the nur in the as sbr increased and ranged between 9 8 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 and 11 5 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 until the end of the experiment based on the results above denitrifies activity was independent of both salinity and srt in the ags sbr although the size of the granules decreased after period 6 this did not affect the nur kinetics of the ags indeed the average size of the granules was larger than 2 5 mm thereby enabling the achievement of a sufficient anoxic zone within the granule structure that allowed the maintenance of the denitritation capacity conversely the nur in the as sbr decreased with the increase in salinity until phase 6 as previously observed for the aur however the decrease of the srt enabled a recovery of denitrifies metabolism independently of salinity this result suggested that the biomass ageing in the as sbr occurred until phase 6 caused a significant decrease in the heterotrophic active fraction whereas a lower srt allowed the biomass renewing indeed it was calculated that the specific observed heterotrophic yield in the as sbr decreased with the increase in salinity from 0 20 gvss gbod 1 to approximately 0 10 gvss gbod 1 at salinity of 40 gnacl l 1 thereafter the decrease in the srt enabled to increase the yobs to approximately 0 18 gvss gbod 1 thereby favouring the biomass renewing these results indicated that the removal rate of nitrites did not show any significant relationship with the increase in salinity p 0 465 but rather with the srt 3 6 bacterial community analysis due to the promising results on biological performance of the autochthonous halophilic marine biomass in both the sbrs also at 50 gnacl l 1 the high throughput sequencing technology was applied on such communities to provide a first insight into their microbial diversity to the best author s knowledge although several studies investigated the impact of salinity on microorganisms in activated sludge processes he et al 2017 a few data are available about the bacterial diversity of halophilic marine biomass at salinity higher than 30 gnacl l 1 ji et al 2018 both the analyzed microbial communities showed to harbor considerable microbial diversity with high species richness fig 5 a despite the high salinity experimented in this study this can be explained by the presence of a high number of rare species as shown by the rank abundance curves that revealed that these communities were characterized by a strong dominance of a few operational taxonomic units otus and a long tail of rare otus fig 5b abundances of the rare otus were indeed 93 3 and 93 of the total otus in ags sbr and as sbr communities respectively abundant otus were defined as those comprising 1 or more of the community and rare otus comprised 1 campbell et al 2011 as previously suggested besemer 2016 for other microbial communities the presence of high amounts of rare taxa many of which not actively metabolizing provides the genetic capability to respond to changes in environmental conditions although the taxon richness resulted to be higher in the ags sbr sample fig 5a the halophilic marine biomass showed similar taxon composition in both the sbrs on phylum level fig 5c samples were dominated by otus affiliated to bacteroidetes 60 in as sbr and 64 in ags sbr proteobacteria were also present at high percentages 31 91 in as sbr and 30 82 in ags sbr while both the phyla planctomycetes 1 57 in as sbr and 0 30 in ags sbr and firmicutes 1 29 in as sbr and 1 34 in ags sbr contributed less to the dominant portion of the communities results are in agreement with previous studies reaveling bacteroitedes as one of the most abundant phylum composing marine microbial communities due to their important role played in the organic degradation in such environments díez vives et al 2012 although a direct comparison with data available in literature is difficult due to the lack of information on microbial diversity of halophilic marine biomass it should be reasonable compare results obtained here with the outputs of studies on the effect of salinity on microbial composition in activated processes he et al 2017 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 our results seemed to be in agreement with different studies that revealed the dominance of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in activated sludges grown at high salinity conditions he et al 2017 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 and that highlighted the high tolerance to salt stress of bacteroidetes chen et al 2018 from fig 5d and e the community composition on class and family level was further analyzed bacteroitedes were dominated by members of the flavobacteria 49 20 in as sbr and for 55 37 in ags sbr and included members of the bacteroidia 3 84 in as sbr and 4 53 in ags sbr among the flavobacteria the family cryomorphaceae predominated with the highest contribution from members of the genus owenweeksia 38 in as sbr and 45 in ags sbr the family flavobacteriaceae mainly the genus vitellibacter 7 25 in as sbr and 4 40 in ags sbr was also abundant for the bacteroidia marinifilum represented the most abundant genus 2 09 in as sbr and 2 69 in ags sbr within the proteobacteria members of alpha 14 59 in as sbr and 6 72 in ags sbr delta proteobacteria 4 53 in as sbr and 10 76 in ags sbr and gamma proteobacteria 8 53 in as sbr and 6 17 in ags sbr were also prominent the microbial composition found in the analyzed samples can explain the performance of the autochthonous halophilic marine biomass in both the sbrs at 50 gnacl l 1 the dominance of cryomorphaceae in both the samples indeed agrees with the ecology of this family that comprises primarily marine genera mcbride 2014a b moreover the dominant genus owenweeksia contains only a single species isolated from sand filtered seawater collected at port shelter in hong kong lau 2005 and the genera vitellibacter and marinifilum comprised mainly marine species isolated from seawater ruvira et al 2009 thevarajoo et al 2016 in addition the presence of high percentages of members belonging to proteobacteria are generally in agreement with studies evaluating the salt tolerance of microbial communities in activated and granular sludge processes he et al 2017 ji et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 autochthonous or allochthonous biomass one of the aim of this study was to compare the performance of the autochthonous biomass with that allochthonous acclimated to salinity the results discussed above indicated that the autochthonous halophilic marine bacteria enabled very high nutrient removal efficiencies compared to halotolerant biomasses he et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 in terms of nutrient removal performance both the sbrs enables more than 95 of the influent organic load 2 25 g cod m 3d 1 which resulted higher than that obtained in other studies with acclimated biomass operating at lower salinity and treating synthetic wastewater ji et al 2018 ou et al 2018a wang et al 2014 while referring to nitrogen removal complete nitritation was successfully achieved within the entire range of salinity investigated in contrast in previous literature nitrogen removal is considered the main concern related to the treatment of saline wastewater in the majority of the available studies in the literature complete nitrification is generally achieved up to 20 gnacl l 1 pronk et al 2014 whereas stable nitritation was achieved up to a salinity of approximately 45 gnacl l 1 although it rapidly collapsed at higher salt concentration garcía ruiz et al 2018 moreover in terms of physical structure of the bio aggregates it was observed that detrimental effects on the eps matrix occurred as a result of long srt whereas it was not affected by the increase in salinity as reported in previous studies with acclimated biomasses corsino et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the results above confirmed that the use of autochthonous halophilic bacteria represents a valuable solution for the treatment high strength carbon and nitrogen saline wastewater the results also indicated that both kinetics and performances were significantly higher than those achievable with acclimated halotolerant microorganisms even at higher salinity lefebvre and moletta 2006 wang et al 2017 results reported in literature suggest that although the acclimatization of conventional activated sludge to the salinity is possible lefebvre and moletta 2006 van den akker et al 2015 wang et al 2015 the achievement of high ammonium oxidation rates and nitrogen removal efficiencies is limited within a range of salinity between 5 gnacl l 1 and 33 gnacl l 1 pronk et al 2014 wang et al 2017 moreover the autochthonous biomass had a better biodiversity compared to the acclimated biomass as proven by the considerable microbial diversity that gained a higher nutrient removal performances and process stability at high salinity levels it is worth mentioning that a comparison between the results above with others referred to the autochthonous halophilic biomass under similar operating conditions was not carried out because of the lack of knowledge in the literature besides the achieved results suggested that halophilic biomass could tolerate higher salinity levels than those tested in this study however it has to be mentioned that under higher salinity levels several technical drawbacks could occur like salt deposits on equipment and devices as well as scaling on the air diffuser that create management difficulties independently on the effects of the salinity on the bacterial metabolism the result discussed above demonstrated that the start up of a plant designed for the treatment of a saline wastewater with an inoculum of autochthonous biomass is more appropriated than using allochthonous bacteria indeed the cultivation of the autochthonous biomass offers benefits in terms of higher metabolic kinetics higher microbial diversity stable process operation thereby enabling an effluent of superior quality while saving energy and footprint therefore both from a management and process point of view the system s start up without any inoculum thus allowing developing the autochthonous biomass represent a valuable operating strategy to achieve highly performing systems 4 2 granular or activated sludge overall biological performances were comparable in both the activated and the granular sludge reactors thereby indicating that when a stepwise increase strategy of the salinity is performed the granulation process did not provide significant improvements in the nutrient removal processes previous studies demonstrated that the aerobic granulation of halophilic sludge offers an advantage in case of drastic salinity fluctuations corsino et al 2018 indeed because of the bigger and denser structure the aerobic granules are able to withstand drastic and moderate salinity fluctuations in the short and long term better than activated sludge nonetheless if a stepwise strategy of salinity increases is performed the halophilic activated sludge shows a similar response to salinity increases compared to halophilic granular sludge the bacterial community analysis did not highlight significant differences between the ags sbr and as sbr indeed although the taxon richness resulted to be higher in the ags sbr sample the halophilic marine biomass showed a very similar taxon composition in both the sbrs biological performances resulted mostly affected by the srt and by the decreasing solubility of the oxygen due to the salinity in both the systems indeed the oxygen transfer and diffusion processes as well as the biomass ageing significantly affected both the carbon and the nitrogen removal kinetics and performances more than salinity this was more noticeable in the ags sbr because of the higher size and density of the microbial aggregates that represented an additional barrier to the oxygen diffusion and favoured the buildup of inert material nevertheless although the kinetic and the biological performances were comparable within the entire range of salinity investigated in this study it is worth mentioning that because of the higher biomass retention capacity ags systems could be able to enable almost 50 of volume saving 5 conclusions nutrient removal performances and kinetics of autochthonous marine bacteria in forms of activated and granular sludge were assessed at different salinity levels ranging from 30 gnacl l 1 to 50 gnacl l 1 in two sbrs the achieved results demonstrated that the cultivation of the autochthonous biomass offers benefits in terms of higher metabolic kinetics higher microbial diversity and stable process operation than allochthonous acclimated biomass thereby enabling an effluent of superior quality at the maximum salinity level tested the microbial community was dominated in both the systems by marine species belonged to the genera owenweeksia cryomorphaceae vitellibacter flavobacteriaceae and marinifilum bacteroidia both the sbrs provided a high quality effluent enabling performances approximately of 98 and 90 in terms of carbon removal and nitritation efficiency respectively denitritation process was limited independently of salinity resulting in tn removal efficiency lower than 70 nevertheless the biomass activity and performances slightly decreased as a result of a long srt 27 days because of salt accumulation within the activated sludge flocs and granules although the high salinity aur and nur of approximately 3 60 mgnh4 n gvss 1h 1 and 10 0 mgno2 n gvss 1h 1 respectively indicated a high activity of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria the obtained results also indicated that a lower srt 14 days favoured the discharge of the granules and flocs with higher inert content thereby enhancing the biomass renewing and a high metabolic activity the operating strategy of stepwise increasing the salinity and decreasing the srt is crucial for a dual proposal when treating saline wastewater first to avoid an excessive buildup of salt within the biomass aggregates and second to avoid their physical destructuration indeed both the strategies enabled to achieve sludge with good physical properties because of the decrease in the lb eps fraction lastly if a stepwise strategy of salinity increases is performed the halophilic activated sludge shows a similar response to salinity increases compared to halophilic granular sludge

19216,reducing human and ecological risks of groundwater nitrate contamination requires understanding the source of nitrate land use practices such as agriculture and residential development can increase groundwater nitrate concentrations this study evaluated a chemical source tracing suite that paired analysis of agricultural herbicide metabolites and human wastewater constituents the source tracing suite was tested in an area subject to nitrate from both agriculture and on site waste septic systems monitoring wells showed that agricultural contamination was deeper 5 m in the aquifer consistent with its origin a greater distance from wells and that on site waste septic system contamination was shallower in the aquifer 3 m repeated sampling of seventeen household wells showed evidence of both agricultural and on site waste contamination in wells with higher nitrate concentrations the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were the only septic system indicators consistently detected less persistent compounds such as caffeine and acetaminophen were never detected in the household wells indicating they were attenuated over the distance between septic system and well and reducing their utility as a tracer of septic system nitrate overall there was a positive relationship between sucralose acesulfame and nitrate in wells with low levels of agricultural contamination although the relationship varied between wells graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate wastewater tracers groundwater sweeteners 1 introduction nitrate contamination of groundwater poses well known human health and ecological risks the current drinking water standard in the u s is 10 mg n l 1 based on acute effects of methemoglobinemia in infants knobeloch et al 2000 nitrate also contributes to carcinogenic activity as it has the potential to form carcinogens after ingestion by nitrosating other molecules weyer et al 2001 ward et al 2010 nitrate contaminated groundwater discharging to lakes and streams increases biological productivity in surface waters and ultimately could lead to increased hypoxia and altered phytoplankton communities donald et al 2013 finlay et al 2013 one of the challenges to addressing groundwater nitrate is that there are many sources atmospheric contributions of nitrate in central wisconsin are less than 1 0 mg l which is considered background for nitrate concentrations in this area mechenich and shaw 1994 national atmospheric deposition program 2018 at the large watershed scale most of the nitrate in groundwater likely originates from agricultural fertilizer plant residue and manure rosenstock et al 2014 locally important sources of nitrate may also include human waste disposal through either private on site waste septic or community treatment systems being able to identify the source of nitrate in a well is a first step towards directing remedial activities to restore groundwater quality previous attempts to use chemical tracing to distinguish nitrate groundwater contamination sources have not provided an unambiguous resolution of nitrate sources for example variations in isotope abundance of 15n and 18o provide a strong contrast between nitrate from mineral fertilizers and organic nitrogen but it is difficult to distinguish animal and human nitrate and source tracing can be confounded by denitrification kendall and aravena 2000 showers et al 2008 shomar et al 2008 xue et al 2009 ratios of chloride and other ions such as boron and bromide can provide a contrast between septic systems and local background water quality although the relationship can be site specific and complicated by other sources of chloride such as road salt miller and ortiz 2007 showers et al 2008 katz et al 2011 recent advances in the analysis of hydrophilic organic wastewater constituents such as artificial sweeteners and pharmaceuticals suggest they might provide a more unambiguous source tracing suite for human wastewater nitrate the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame for example have been shown to be particularly useful for identifying human wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater godfrey et al 2007 spoelstra et al 2013 schaider et al 2014 oppenheimer et al 2012 tran et al 2014 robertson et al 2016a b james et al 2016 fairbairn et al 2016 robertson et al 2016b used the artificial sweetener acesulfame to trace wastewater contamination in groundwater and suggested the acesulfame concentration could be an indicator of the relative contribution of wastewater to the nitrate contamination the success of these compounds in identifying water that has originated from wastewater disposal suggests they could be part of a more comprehensive chemical source tracing suite for determining the source of groundwater nitrate the objective of this study was to combine the analysis of chemical indicators of wastewater contamination with the analysis of a group of hydrophilic organic compounds from the metabolism of agricultural pesticides in a novel chemical source tracing method for groundwater nitrate contamination we tested this source tracing method through repeated analysis of groundwater from a group of household wells with elevated nitrate concentrations these wells were in an area of residential development with private household wells and private septic systems that was adjacent to areas of agricultural land use 2 study sites the study was performed within two clusters of suburban homes adjacent to agricultural fields fig 1 shows the homes were hydraulically downgradient of the agricultural areas these homes had both individual household wells and septic systems they were on lots typically less than 0 5 ha in size with spacing between septic system drainfields and private wells of at least 50 m area 1 was a larger suburban area with approximately 5 km of land between the homes and the groundwater divide the homes in area 2 were approximately 1 km south of the groundwater divide the agricultural land in both study areas was primarily irrigated vegetable crops in rotations that include corn peas beans and potatoes with some forested areas the only fields in the agricultural area with a history of wastewater biosolids or septage application were approximately 4 km east of area 1 and likely south of the groundwater flow travel path to that study area based on groundwater modeling by kraft et al 2004 in both study areas the groundwater aquifer is an unconfined surficial aquifer with approximately twenty to 30 m of coarse sand and gravel underlain by relatively impermeable granitic bedrock clayton 1986 the sand and gravel is outwash from wisconsin age glacial stream sediment the water table is at a depth of three to 5 m from the ground surface the horizontal groundwater velocity in this area is estimated to be approximately 0 5 1 m day holt 1965 kraft et al 2004 because the unconfined surficial aquifer is uniform and the recharge is distributed across all land uses we expect that the contaminants that enter further upgradient will be deeper in the aquifer by the time that water reaches the study area böhlke 2002 kraft et al 2004 böhlke 2002 showed how the contamination from more distant sources moves deeper into the aquifer as subsequent recharge is added to the groundwater surface to evaluate the penetration depth of the contamination in the aquifer we installed a nest of monitoring wells at the downgradient end of each study area as shown in fig 1 these multipoint wells had 0 9 m screens at various depths below the ground surface to explore the variation of contamination with depth those well locations are shown in fig 1 monitoring wells m2 m3 and m4 are screened at 5 2 9 8 and 14 5 m respectively and monitoring wells m5 m6 m7 and m8 are screened at 7 9 11 0 14 0 and 18 m respectively granite bedrock prevented installation of a fourth monitoring well in area 1 household wells were selected based on previous monitoring that showed they had elevated nitrate concentrations we purposely selected wells with higher nitrate concentrations to evaluate whether the chemical indicator suite would resolve likely sources of nitrate contamination fig 1 shows the location of sampled wells in relation to septic system and groundwater flow direction the household wells were either shallow driven point or drilled wells typically with short approximately 0 9 m screens 3 methods 3 1 chemical tracers the chemical tracer suite is a group of eighteen potential chemical tracers selected based on previous studies of on site waste contamination of groundwater or previous groundwater monitoring in this area table 1 artificial sweeteners and human pharmaceuticals are unique to human use and provide a relatively unambiguous source identification of septic system discharge the agricultural herbicide metabolites in the suite are reflective of herbicide use in the area and were included to help identify wells impacted by agricultural contamination aga and thurman 2001 we selected herbicides that previous monitoring showed their occurrence in groundwater increased with increasing intensity of agricultural land use although they could also be used for weed control in turf and landscape plantings wisconsin department of agriculture trade and consumer protection 2017 all of the compounds in the tracer suite are likely to be mobile in groundwater based on their frequent occurrence in groundwater and their low octanol water partition coefficients 3 2 sample collection monitoring well samples were collected in the summer of 2014 and 2015 prior to sampling wells were purged of four volumes using a peristaltic pump or a reciprocating pump samples were collected in amber glass bottles and kept cool until analyzed household well samples were collected five times between the spring of 2014 and the spring of 2015 to account for temporal variation a sample tap near the well entrance to the home or an untreated tap were used with the exceptions of wells 104 and 108 which were softened wells were pumped for at least 10 minutes to remove stagnant water before the sample was collected 3 3 analytical methods samples for human wastewater organic compounds were concentrated prior to analysis by solid phase extraction dionex autotrace using 6 cc 200 mg hlb cartridges waters unlike epa method 1694 which uses a four part extraction method and requires four separate analytical runs the method developed for this study required only one elution step and analytical run while epa method 1694 is more quantitative our method is sufficiently appropriate for rapid related source identification detections limits ranged from 2 1 to 60 ng l 1 table 2 and s2 analysis was performed on an agilent 1200 series high performance liquid chromatograph coupled to an agilent 6430 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source lc ms ms deuterated analogs were used as internal standards for their respective analytes when available analysis of chloroacetanilide herbicide metabolite residues used

confirmation of all positive samples was conducted a lachat 8000 flow injection analyzer was used for nitrate lachat method 10 107 04 1 a and chloride lachat method 10 117 07 1 b 4 results and discussion 4 1 monitoring wells groundwater from two multi level monitoring wells consistently showed detectable concentrations of four organic tracer compounds acesulfame sucralose sulfamethoxazole and metolachlor esa fig 2 of the herbicide metabolites metolachlor esa was detected most frequently alachlor esa was found less frequently and was always coincident with metolachlor esa so it was not examined further as an agricultural tracer fig 2 summarizes results for nitrate and four detected organic chemical tracers for two samples from each well nitrate concentrations were elevated and varied with depth and over time at both locations the nitrate concentration exceeded the maximum contaminant level of 10 mg n l 1 at both locations at some depths chemical tracer analysis shows the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame and the pharmaceutical sulfamethoxazole were found in shallower groundwater and the agricultural contaminant metolachlor esa was found in deeper groundwater this variation in contaminant occurrence with depth fig 2 is consistent with different land uses and their proximity to monitoring wells fig 1 shallower groundwater in the study areas is likely to have contamination from nearby domestic septic systems agricultural land uses are further from the monitoring wells and groundwater impacted by those uses would be deeper in the aquifer when it reaches the monitoring well locations böhlke 2002 the monitoring well results confirmed the study areas have groundwater that is influenced by both agricultural chemical application and septic system wastewater disposal there was no evidence of suburban sources of the tracer herbicide metabolites from turf applications or agricultural sources of the septic indicators from land applied biosolids 4 2 household wells nitrate concentrations in the household wells were frequently near or exceeded the maximum contaminant level of 10 mg n l 1 the average concentrations in wells ranged from 2 1 to 23 5 mg n l 1 table 2 and fig 3 show the results of nitrate monitoring in seventeen household wells over the fifteen month study period the range in nitrate concentration also varied between wells the difference between maximum and minimum nitrate n ranged from less than 1 mg n l 1 at several wells to more than 10 mg n l 1 at well 102 variations in the concentration of nitrate at a single well over time can result from variations in the timing of recharge and variations in the concentration of nitrate in the recharging groundwater for example the rate of nitrogen movement from agricultural land through soil and into groundwater varies over time as groundwater recharge events move water through the soil profile landon et al 1999 the rate and timing of organic matter mineralization and ammonia nitrification may also contribute to this temporal variability while septic systems provide a continuous source of nitrogen to groundwater there will be variations over time in the concentration of nitrate from a household and in the rate at which that mixes with flowing groundwater after these temporally varying nitrogen loads and recharge water enter the groundwater they will travel horizontally downgradient with their flow paths moving deeper and their nitrate concentrations dispersing additional variation will result if an individual well accesses different combinations of flow paths as might occur when the water table is rising or falling clay et al 1996 analyses of chemical source tracing compounds are summarized in table 2 showing the number of detections of each results were similar to measurements made in monitoring wells with acesulfame sucralose and sulfamethoxazole as the detected human waste indicators and metolachlor esa as the most commonly detected agricultural indicator we did not find some of the contaminants previously identified in wastewater surface water and some groundwater for example caffeine and acetaminophen were not found in the household wells even though they are usually found in high concentrations in u s wastewater and frequently detected in surface water kolpin et al 2002 fairbairn et al 2016 the absence of caffeine in our household wells and monitoring wells is consistent with results of seiler et al 1999 godfrey et al 2007 standley et al 2008 schaider et al 2014 and yang et al 2017 showing that although concentrations in wastewater are high caffeine is degraded in treatment systems and the environment in our wells we also did not find the caffeine metabolite paraxanthine confirming it is also likely to be degraded over time and distance in groundwater aquifers although acetaminophen has been reported in groundwater verstraeten et al 2005 lopez et al 2015 its absence in other studies suggests it may also degrade too rapidly to be a reliable septic system tracer godfrey et al 2007 yang et al 2017 carbamazepine has also been shown as a marker of wastewater in surface water receiving community wastewater kahle et al 2009 but our results show it is not a reliable tracer for individual septic systems because of its sporadic occurrence or limited mobility our results are similar to those of james et al 2016 who found carbamazepine to be a more useful tracer for community wastewater than for individual household wells the frequent occurrence of two artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame is consistent with a growing body of literature suggesting these compounds have sufficient ubiquity mobility and persistence to serve as tracers of on site domestic wastewater sources tran et al 2014 robertson et al 2016a b james et al 2016 fairbairn et al 2016 our monitoring also showed that sulfamethoxazole was a frequent contaminant in household wells with elevated nitrate although sulfamethoxazole is frequently reported as a mobile wastewater constituent james et al 2016 and we expected that its use would be sufficiently sporadic that it would not be as consistently detected as the artificial sweeteners table 1 shows that sulfamethoxazole was detected as frequently as sucralose and acesulfame in our study areas results of tracer analysis in table 1 were used to assign primary nitrate sources to individual wells wells 101 102 and 103 appear to be primarily agriculturally impacted with only one or two detections of wastewater indicators fig 1 shows that is consistent with their locations close to agricultural land use where shallower groundwater is more likely influenced by agriculture wells 116 and 117 had little evidence of impact from either agriculture or wastewater and also had the lowest nitrate concentration less than 3 mg l 1 wells 104 through 115 all had relatively strong signatures of human wastewater impact with three compounds acesulfame sucralose and sulfamethoxazole fig 1 shows this is consistent with their locations downgradient of suburban areas where shallower groundwater is likely to exhibit wastewater impacts many of these wells also had some evidence of agricultural contamination through detection of at least one of the herbicide metabolites these results are consistent with monitoring well results showing some of these wells may access both agricultural and septic system contamination that is consistent with the vertical variation in contamination shown in the monitoring wells the sucralose and acesulfame results show these sweeteners provide a robust test of septic system contamination and concentrations of sweeteners vary from well to well in suburban areas we used results from household wells that consistently detected artificial sweeteners but had few detections of agricultural herbicide contamination to explore the relationship between the concentrations of sucralose and acesulfame and the concentration of nitrate fig 4 shows that for these nine wells the concentrations of these two artificial sweeteners increased with increasing nitrate in some but not all wells we also found sweetener concentration ranges varied considerably between wells for example wells 105 110 and 113 had very little variation in nitrate acesulfame and sucralose concentrations between samples fig 4 shows the relationship between sweetener and nitrate as a cluster on their respective graphs wells 104 109 111 and 115 showed increasing sucralose and acesulfame as nitrate concentrations increased wells 106 and 108 showed a negative relationship between sweetener and nitrate while these relationships varied in their strength sample to sample variations in sweetener to nitrate ratio were shown to be complex overall the presence of artificial sweeteners in water indicates groundwater that has recharged after 1988 in the united states fda 2018 usage between homes and over time is also expected to vary because sweetener use is likely increasing higher artificial sweetener concentrations relative to nitrate concentrations are expected in wells closer to septic sources in wells highlighted in fig 4 the highest concentrations of artificial sweeteners were found in well 108 the concentrations of approximately 5 μg l 1 sucralose at a nitrate concentration of 10 mg n l 1 is near the range found by robertson et al 2016a b 28 m from a drainfield where they found 2 3 μg l 1 sucralose and 20 40 mg nitrate n l 1 the other wells in fig 4 show lower concentrations of sucralose at higher nitrate concentrations suggesting either longer travel times with lower initial source concentrations or some degradation of the sweeteners robertson et al 2016a b identifying groundwater nitrate sources is important to determining future management actions this study showed how agricultural and septic waste tracers can be used to differentiate sources of contamination between locations and even with depth at a specific location although the septic waste tracers used in this study do not currently have drinking water standards their presence could signify the presence of other contaminants from septic waste such as other pharmaceuticals or pathogens with this information groundwater resource managers can target additional testing direct remediation and support land use planning 5 conclusions a relatively simple chemical tracer method using artificial sweeteners and herbicide metabolites was able to identify likely sources of nitrate contamination in private wells in a suburban area adjacent to irrigated vegetable crops the herbicide metabolites were found in the presence of high nitrate concentrations in several of the household wells and in the deeper groundwater in the monitoring wells the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame were ubiquitous in household wells with elevated nitrate nitrogen and a low frequency of agricultural chemicals the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole was also commonly detected in suburban groundwater caffeine paraxanthine carbamazepine and acetaminophen were notably not detected in household wells in our suburban study areas the relationship between the sucralose and acesulfame concentrations and the nitrate concentrations showed large well to well variability suggesting factors such as usage history or distance from source might also be influencing the magnitude of the concentrations acknowledgements we acknowledge the assistance of students and staff in the water and environmental analysis lab at the university of

knobeloch et al 2000 nitrate also contributes to carcinogenic activity as it has the potential to form carcinogens after ingestion by nitrosating other molecules weyer et al 2001 ward et al 2010 nitrate contaminated groundwater discharging to lakes and streams increases biological productivity in surface waters and ultimately could lead to increased hypoxia and altered phytoplankton communities donald et al 2013 finlay et al 2013 one of the challenges to addressing groundwater nitrate is that there are many sources atmospheric contributions of nitrate in central wisconsin are less than 1 0 mg l which is considered background for nitrate concentrations in this area mechenich and shaw 1994 national atmospheric deposition program 2018 at the large watershed scale most of the nitrate in groundwater likely originates from agricultural fertilizer plant residue and manure rosenstock et al 2014 locally important sources of nitrate may also include human waste disposal through either private on site waste septic or community treatment systems being able to identify the source of nitrate in a well is a first step towards directing remedial activities to restore groundwater quality previous attempts to use chemical tracing to distinguish nitrate groundwater contamination sources have not provided an unambiguous resolution of nitrate sources for example variations in isotope abundance of 15n and 18o provide a strong contrast between nitrate from mineral fertilizers and organic nitrogen but it is difficult to distinguish animal and human nitrate and source tracing can be confounded by denitrification kendall and aravena 2000 showers et al 2008 shomar et al 2008 xue et al 2009 ratios of chloride and other ions such as boron and bromide can provide a contrast between septic systems and local background water quality although the relationship can be site specific and complicated by other sources of chloride such as road salt miller and ortiz 2007 showers et al 2008 katz et al 2011 recent advances in the analysis of hydrophilic organic wastewater constituents such as artificial sweeteners and pharmaceuticals suggest they might provide a more unambiguous source tracing suite for human wastewater nitrate the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame for example have been shown to be particularly useful for identifying human wastewater contamination in surface water and groundwater godfrey et al 2007 spoelstra et al 2013 schaider et al 2014 oppenheimer et al 2012 tran et al 2014 robertson et al 2016a b james et al 2016 fairbairn et al 2016 robertson et al 2016b used the artificial sweetener acesulfame to trace wastewater contamination in groundwater and suggested the acesulfame concentration could be an indicator of the relative contribution of wastewater to the nitrate contamination the success of these compounds in identifying water that has originated from wastewater disposal suggests they could be part of a more comprehensive chemical source tracing suite for determining the source of groundwater nitrate the objective of this study was to combine the analysis of chemical indicators of wastewater contamination with the analysis of a group of hydrophilic organic compounds from the metabolism of agricultural pesticides in a novel chemical source tracing method for groundwater nitrate contamination we tested this source tracing method through repeated analysis of groundwater from a group of household wells with elevated nitrate concentrations these wells were in an area of residential development with private household wells and private septic systems that was adjacent to areas of agricultural land use 2 study sites the study was performed within two clusters of suburban homes adjacent to agricultural fields fig 1 shows the homes were hydraulically downgradient of the agricultural areas these homes had both individual household wells and septic systems they were on lots typically less than 0 5 ha in size with spacing between septic system drainfields and private wells of at least 50 m area 1 was a larger suburban area with approximately 5 km of land between the homes and the groundwater divide the homes in area 2 were approximately 1 km south of the groundwater divide the agricultural land in both study areas was primarily irrigated vegetable crops in rotations that include corn peas beans and potatoes with some forested areas the only fields in the agricultural area with a history of wastewater biosolids or septage application were approximately 4 km east of area 1 and likely south of the groundwater flow travel path to that study area based on groundwater modeling by kraft et al 2004 in both study areas the groundwater aquifer is an unconfined surficial aquifer with approximately twenty to 30 m of coarse sand and gravel underlain by relatively impermeable granitic bedrock clayton 1986 the sand and gravel is outwash from wisconsin age glacial stream sediment the water table is at a depth of three to 5 m from the ground surface the horizontal groundwater velocity in this area is estimated to be approximately 0 5 1 m day holt 1965 kraft et al 2004 because the unconfined surficial aquifer is uniform and the recharge is distributed across all land uses we expect that the contaminants that enter further upgradient will be deeper in the aquifer by the time that water reaches the study area böhlke 2002 kraft et al 2004 böhlke 2002 showed how the contamination from more distant sources moves deeper into the aquifer as subsequent recharge is added to the groundwater surface to evaluate the penetration depth of the contamination in the aquifer we installed a nest of monitoring wells at the downgradient end of each study area as shown in fig 1 these multipoint wells had 0 9 m screens at various depths below the ground surface to explore the variation of contamination with depth those well locations are shown in fig 1 monitoring wells m2 m3 and m4 are screened at 5 2 9 8 and 14 5 m respectively and monitoring wells m5 m6 m7 and m8 are screened at 7 9 11 0 14 0 and 18 m respectively granite bedrock prevented installation of a fourth monitoring well in area 1 household wells were selected based on previous monitoring that showed they had elevated nitrate concentrations we purposely selected wells with higher nitrate concentrations to evaluate whether the chemical indicator suite would resolve likely sources of nitrate contamination fig 1 shows the location of sampled wells in relation to septic system and groundwater flow direction the household wells were either shallow driven point or drilled wells typically with short approximately 0 9 m screens 3 methods 3 1 chemical tracers the chemical tracer suite is a group of eighteen potential chemical tracers selected based on previous studies of on site waste contamination of groundwater or previous groundwater monitoring in this area table 1 artificial sweeteners and human pharmaceuticals are unique to human use and provide a relatively unambiguous source identification of septic system discharge the agricultural herbicide metabolites in the suite are reflective of herbicide use in the area and were included to help identify wells impacted by agricultural contamination aga and thurman 2001 we selected herbicides that previous monitoring showed their occurrence in groundwater increased with increasing intensity of agricultural land use although they could also be used for weed control in turf and landscape plantings wisconsin department of agriculture trade and consumer protection 2017 all of the compounds in the tracer suite are likely to be mobile in groundwater based on their frequent occurrence in groundwater and their low octanol water partition coefficients 3 2 sample collection monitoring well samples were collected in the summer of 2014 and 2015 prior to sampling wells were purged of four volumes using a peristaltic pump or a reciprocating pump samples were collected in amber glass bottles and kept cool until analyzed household well samples were collected five times between the spring of 2014 and the spring of 2015 to account for temporal variation a sample tap near the well entrance to the home or an untreated tap were used with the exceptions of wells 104 and 108 which were softened wells were pumped for at least 10 minutes to remove stagnant water before the sample was collected 3 3 analytical methods samples for human wastewater organic compounds were concentrated prior to analysis by solid phase extraction dionex autotrace using 6 cc 200 mg hlb cartridges waters unlike epa method 1694 which uses a four part extraction method and requires four separate analytical runs the method developed for this study required only one elution step and analytical run while epa method 1694 is more quantitative our method is sufficiently appropriate for rapid related source identification detections limits ranged from 2 1 to 60 ng l 1 table 2 and s2 analysis was performed on an agilent 1200 series high performance liquid chromatograph coupled to an agilent 6430 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization source lc ms ms deuterated analogs were used as internal standards for their respective analytes when available analysis of chloroacetanilide herbicide metabolite residues used the method of zimmerman et al 2000 usgs ofr 00 182 briefly this process utilizes solid phase extraction c18 concentration and analysis on an agilent 1100 hplc with a diode array detector two column confirmation of all positive samples was conducted a lachat 8000 flow injection analyzer was used for nitrate lachat method 10 107 04 1 a and chloride lachat method 10 117 07 1 b 4 results and discussion 4 1 monitoring wells groundwater from two multi level monitoring wells consistently showed detectable concentrations of four organic tracer compounds acesulfame sucralose sulfamethoxazole and metolachlor esa fig 2 of the herbicide metabolites metolachlor esa was detected most frequently alachlor esa was found less frequently and was always coincident with metolachlor esa so it was not examined further as an agricultural tracer fig 2 summarizes results for nitrate and four detected organic chemical tracers for two samples from each well nitrate concentrations were elevated and varied with depth and over time at both locations the nitrate concentration exceeded the maximum contaminant level of 10 mg n l 1 at both locations at some depths chemical tracer analysis shows the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame and the pharmaceutical sulfamethoxazole were found in shallower groundwater and the agricultural contaminant metolachlor esa was found in deeper groundwater this variation in contaminant occurrence with depth fig 2 is consistent with different land uses and their proximity to monitoring wells fig 1 shallower groundwater in the study areas is likely to have contamination from nearby domestic septic systems agricultural land uses are further from the monitoring wells and groundwater impacted by those uses would be deeper in the aquifer when it reaches the monitoring well locations böhlke 2002 the monitoring well results confirmed the study areas have groundwater that is influenced by both agricultural chemical application and septic system wastewater disposal there was no evidence of suburban sources of the tracer herbicide metabolites from turf applications or agricultural sources of the septic indicators from land applied biosolids 4 2 household wells nitrate concentrations in the household wells were frequently near or exceeded the maximum contaminant level of 10 mg n l 1 the average concentrations in wells ranged from 2 1 to 23 5 mg n l 1 table 2 and fig 3 show the results of nitrate monitoring in seventeen household wells over the fifteen month study period the range in nitrate concentration also varied between wells the difference between maximum and minimum nitrate n ranged from less than 1 mg n l 1 at several wells to more than 10 mg n l 1 at well 102 variations in the concentration of nitrate at a single well over time can result from variations in the timing of recharge and variations in the concentration of nitrate in the recharging groundwater for example the rate of nitrogen movement from agricultural land through soil and into groundwater varies over time as groundwater recharge events move water through the soil profile landon et al 1999 the rate and timing of organic matter mineralization and ammonia nitrification may also contribute to this temporal variability while septic systems provide a continuous source of nitrogen to groundwater there will be variations over time in the concentration of nitrate from a household and in the rate at which that mixes with flowing groundwater after these temporally varying nitrogen loads and recharge water enter the groundwater they will travel horizontally downgradient with their flow paths moving deeper and their nitrate concentrations dispersing additional variation will result if an individual well accesses different combinations of flow paths as might occur when the water table is rising or falling clay et al 1996 analyses of chemical source tracing compounds are summarized in table 2 showing the number of detections of each results were similar to measurements made in monitoring wells with acesulfame sucralose and sulfamethoxazole as the detected human waste indicators and metolachlor esa as the most commonly detected agricultural indicator we did not find some of the contaminants previously identified in wastewater surface water and some groundwater for example caffeine and acetaminophen were not found in the household wells even though they are usually found in high concentrations in u s wastewater and frequently detected in surface water kolpin et al 2002 fairbairn et al 2016 the absence of caffeine in our household wells and monitoring wells is consistent with results of seiler et al 1999 godfrey et al 2007 standley et al 2008 schaider et al 2014 and yang et al 2017 showing that although concentrations in wastewater are high caffeine is degraded in treatment systems and the environment in our wells we also did not find the caffeine metabolite paraxanthine confirming it is also likely to be degraded over time and distance in groundwater aquifers although acetaminophen has been reported in groundwater verstraeten et al 2005 lopez et al 2015 its absence in other studies suggests it may also degrade too rapidly to be a reliable septic system tracer godfrey et al 2007 yang et al 2017 carbamazepine has also been shown as a marker of wastewater in surface water receiving community wastewater kahle et al 2009 but our results show it is not a reliable tracer for individual septic systems because of its sporadic occurrence or limited mobility our results are similar to those of james et al 2016 who found carbamazepine to be a more useful tracer for community wastewater than for individual household wells the frequent occurrence of two artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame is consistent with a growing body of literature suggesting these compounds have sufficient ubiquity mobility and persistence to serve as tracers of on site domestic wastewater sources tran et al 2014 robertson et al 2016a b james et al 2016 fairbairn et al 2016 our monitoring also showed that sulfamethoxazole was a frequent contaminant in household wells with elevated nitrate although sulfamethoxazole is frequently reported as a mobile wastewater constituent james et al 2016 and we expected that its use would be sufficiently sporadic that it would not be as consistently detected as the artificial sweeteners table 1 shows that sulfamethoxazole was detected as frequently as sucralose and acesulfame in our study areas results of tracer analysis in table 1 were used to assign primary nitrate sources to individual wells wells 101 102 and 103 appear to be primarily agriculturally impacted with only one or two detections of wastewater indicators fig 1 shows that is consistent with their locations close to agricultural land use where shallower groundwater is more likely influenced by agriculture wells 116 and 117 had little evidence of impact from either agriculture or wastewater and also had the lowest nitrate concentration less than 3 mg l 1 wells 104 through 115 all had relatively strong signatures of human wastewater impact with three compounds acesulfame sucralose and sulfamethoxazole fig 1 shows this is consistent with their locations downgradient of suburban areas where shallower groundwater is likely to exhibit wastewater impacts many of these wells also had some evidence of agricultural contamination through detection of at least one of the herbicide metabolites these results are consistent with monitoring well results showing some of these wells may access both agricultural and septic system contamination that is consistent with the vertical variation in contamination shown in the monitoring wells the sucralose and acesulfame results show these sweeteners provide a robust test of septic system contamination and concentrations of sweeteners vary from well to well in suburban areas we used results from household wells that consistently detected artificial sweeteners but had few detections of agricultural herbicide contamination to explore the relationship between the concentrations of sucralose and acesulfame and the concentration of nitrate fig 4 shows that for these nine wells the concentrations of these two artificial sweeteners increased with increasing nitrate in some but not all wells we also found sweetener concentration ranges varied considerably between wells for example wells 105 110 and 113 had very little variation in nitrate acesulfame and sucralose concentrations between samples fig 4 shows the relationship between sweetener and nitrate as a cluster on their respective graphs wells 104 109 111 and 115 showed increasing sucralose and acesulfame as nitrate concentrations increased wells 106 and 108 showed a negative relationship between sweetener and nitrate while these relationships varied in their strength sample to sample variations in sweetener to nitrate ratio were shown to be complex overall the presence of artificial sweeteners in water indicates groundwater that has recharged after 1988 in the united states fda 2018 usage between homes and over time is also expected to vary because sweetener use is likely increasing higher artificial sweetener concentrations relative to nitrate concentrations are expected in wells closer to septic sources in wells highlighted in fig 4 the highest concentrations of artificial sweeteners were found in well 108 the concentrations of approximately 5 μg l 1 sucralose at a nitrate concentration of 10 mg n l 1 is near the range found by robertson et al 2016a b 28 m from a drainfield where they found 2 3 μg l 1 sucralose and 20 40 mg nitrate n l 1 the other wells in fig 4 show lower concentrations of sucralose at higher nitrate concentrations suggesting either longer travel times with lower initial source concentrations or some degradation of the sweeteners robertson et al 2016a b identifying groundwater nitrate sources is important to determining future management actions this study showed how agricultural and septic waste tracers can be used to differentiate sources of contamination between locations and even with depth at a specific location although the septic waste tracers used in this study do not currently have drinking water standards their presence could signify the presence of other contaminants from septic waste such as other pharmaceuticals or pathogens with this information groundwater resource managers can target additional testing direct remediation and support land use planning 5 conclusions a relatively simple chemical tracer method using artificial sweeteners and herbicide metabolites was able to identify likely sources of nitrate contamination in private wells in a suburban area adjacent to irrigated vegetable crops the herbicide metabolites were found in the presence of high nitrate concentrations in several of the household wells and in the deeper groundwater in the monitoring wells the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame were ubiquitous in household wells with elevated nitrate nitrogen and a low frequency of agricultural chemicals the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole was also commonly detected in suburban groundwater caffeine paraxanthine carbamazepine and acetaminophen were notably not detected in household wells in our suburban study areas the relationship between the sucralose and acesulfame concentrations and the nitrate concentrations showed large well to well variability suggesting factors such as usage history or distance from source

effective for fib removal under high flow conditions kay et al 2008 while evaluating the variability of a wrrf removal efficiency rate during various weather conditions is important characterizing the variability of concentrations is even more critically needed when it comes to untreated or partially treated discharges there is a need for data on the varibility of raw sewage microbiological quality during intense storm events in order to understand potential peak concentrations of by pass discharges sewer sediments have been identified as a sink for bacteria wastewater micropollutants and total suspended solids and their contribution to cso loads have been determined gasperi et al 2010 passerat et al 2011 madoux humery et al 2015 however little is known about the role of sewer sediments with regards to loads of bacteria micropollutants and total suspended solids tss from sanitary sewer networks with high levels of infiltration and inflow data on the relative contribution of sewer sediments to concentrations arriving at wrrfs may be especially critical when it comes to implementing management practices for sewer lines and estimating the impact of sewage by passes on receiving waters since pathogenic parasite analyses are time consuming expensive and complex standard enumeration of fib e coli enterococci is usually performed as a surrogate for pathogens however fecal indicators are often not correlated with pathogens wu et al 2011 in order to partly overcome the difficulties associated with the use of conventional fib the combined application of alternative chemical indicators during initial screening and or as a supplementary cross validation tool has been suggested hagedorn and weisberg 2009 fecal microorganisms originate from both human and non human sources hence the application of human origin wastewater micropollutants wwmps has garnered more attention in recent years daneshvar et al 2012 sauvé et al 2012 however the relationships between pathogenic parasites and wwmps have not been widely addressed the presence of suitable wwmps in source waters e g drinking water intakes downstream of a wrrf indicates fecal pollution from human

routine monitoring programmes to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the temporal variability of pathogenic parasites with wastewater micropollutants in raw sewage moreover few data are available on the variability of influent concentrations during wet weather periods the variability of untreated wastewater concentrations are needed to understand the impact of fecal pollution sources on downstream drinking water intakes especially given the higher risk of gastrointestinal illnesses for consumers whose drinking water sources have been impacted by untreated

wastewater from residential industrial commercial and institutional facilities is treated using preliminary primary and secondary treatment conventional activated sludge with phosphorus removal through precipitation with ferrous chloride followed by chlorine disinfection after screening and grit removal raw sewage is conveyed to primary clarifiers through three channels raw sewage from channels 1 and 2 are treated in plant 3 and channel 3 is treated in plants 1 and 2 the by pass gate is located after the primary clarifier of plant 3 treated effluents are discharged into lake ontario in which several drinking water intakes are located although the sewer system is separated studies conducted in this area have shown that additional flows may enter the sanitary sewer system through inflow and infiltration following heavy storm events coleengineering 2011 under heavy rainfall conditions high flowrates lead to the discharge of primary treated effluents with or without disinfection into lake ontario thereby representing a direct input of potential pathogens into a drinking water supply 2 2 sample collection influent and effluent of the wrrf were monitored under various weather conditions in order to determine monthly thresholds that were indicative of an increase of flowrate from increased inflow and infiltration during wet weather the relationship between historical flowrates and precipitation was examined wet weather conditions were defined based on i 2 day cumulative rainfall 10 mm prior to sample collection and ii flowrates above a threshold determined by historical data analysis for each month of the year for the purpose of this study dry weather conditions were defined as events with only trace amounts of rainfall 3 mm and flow rates below the determined threshold a total of four wet weather events one in april two in june and 1 in september 2014 and two trace precipitation events may and september 2014 were monitored the april precipitation event occurred during a snowmelt period the 2 day cumulative rainfall prior to sample collection is shown in table s2 and ranged from trace to 32 mm the return periods for the monitored

uncertainties in giardia measurements as a result of variable recoveries within and between events two day cumulative rainfall data were calculated using thiessen polygons through hourly data obtained from seventeen rain gauges within a 30 km distance a normalizing technique was applied to understand the relationship between peak concentrations and peak flowrates by quantifying concentration and flowrate patterns regardless of temporal variability total influent flowrates and concentrations of each parameter measured during wet weather events were divided by their respective peak values c cpeak and q qpeak and the boxplots of the normalized concentrations were presented for the last deciles of normalized flowrate 0 9 q qpeak 1 the normalized boxplots of c cpeak are a visual representation of the likelihood that contaminant peaks will occur with peak flows during wet weather 3 results and discussion 3 1 inflow and infiltration influence on flowrate the time of day and the amount of inflow and infiltration as a result of groundwater table depths precipitation and snowmelt influence the wrrf s flowrate to evaluate the impact of precipitation and snowmelt on the flowrate δq channel 2 s event flowrates minus the average flowrate for its corresponding month and historical hourly flowrates for the corresponding months in channel 2 are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively the difference relative to the mean flowrate for each event as mean monthly flowrates also vary helps to illustrate how each event was influenced by precipitation or snowmelt δq is generally higher for the events with 2 day cumulative rainfall 15 mm prior to sample collection regardless of the time of day events occurred suggesting a direct impact of rainfall during those events ev1 ev3 and ev5 in this study event sampling was generally triggered in the afternoon or evening table s2 the median value of δq was highest for ev3 june 12th daytime 2 day cumulative rainfall of 24 mm and lowest for ev6 september 10th night time trace precipitation p 0 05 further demonstrating the effect of precipitation on flowrates the flowrate in channel 2 is also higher during spring months fig 1b especially in april following snowmelt and frequent precipitation events that likely resulted in higher groundwater and infiltration levels it should be noted that the flowrate measured in channel 2 is part of total plant influent flowrate and is variable its fraction relative to total influent flowrate was in the range of 0 01 0 7 in the period of march to september 2014 but generally represents 42 of the total plant influent 3 2 prevalence and contaminant concentrations in influent and effluent samples the concentrations of parasites cryptosporidium and giardia fib e coli and c perfringens wwmps caf cbz cbz 2oh ace suc and asp and tss in raw sewage and treated effluent discharges are shown in table 1 we found a higher prevalence of giardia as compared to cryptosporidium in raw sewage 88 6 compared to 8 6 and in effluent samples 100 compared to 30 the prevalence rates for parasites in raw sewage were indeed lower than in effluent samples and it relates to the complexity of the raw sewage matrix which causes recovery efficiencies to drop compared to treated effluents this has been previously reported by others rose et al 2004 lalancette et al 2012 concentrations of cryptosporidium and giardia in raw sewage varied from below lod to 10 oocysts l and from below the lod to 1010 cysts l respectively in treated effluents they ranged from below lod to 0 2 oocysts l and from 0 1 to 11 1 cysts l respectively the giardia and cryptosporidium concentrations in raw sewage and treated effluents fall within the ranges documented in the literature table s4 additional discussion is presented in section s 3 supplementary information e coli and c perfringens were detected in 100 of the raw sewage and treated effluent samples median concentrations in raw sewage samples were 2 6 106 cfu 100 ml and 4 104 cfu 100 ml for e coli and c perfringens respectively they were generally 5 and 2 logs lower in treated effluents respectively the observed concentrations are in the range of reported values in the literature table s5 with the exception of asp which was detected in 92 7 of raw sewage samples and was absent in the treated effluents micropollutants including caf cbz cbz 2oh ace and suc were found in all raw sewage and treated effluent samples the absence of asp in effluent samples is likely due to its higher degradability kokotou et al 2012 lange et al 2012 asp concentrations in raw sewage samples of two wastewater treatment plants in china were in the range of 44 53 ng l but they were absent in treated effluents gan et al 2013 in the studied wrrf the asp median concentrations were significantly lower than other artificial sweeteners of ace and suc p 0 05 in mann whitney u test potentially indicating different consumption patterns of asp compared to other artificial sweeteners in addition to higher degradation rates following ingestion asp is eliminated to a larger degree from the human body nabors 2001 whereas a large amount of ace and suc pass in an unchanged form buerge et al 2009 in contrast to asp we observed an average increase of 26 for cbz during wastewater treatment table 1 cbz is a highly persistent micro pollutant not easily degraded or adsorbed during wastewater treatment processes and its concentrations have been shown to increase at rates as high as 100 in treated effluents miao and metcalfe 2003 clara et al 2004 gao et al 2012 bahlmann et al 2014 carbamazepine forms n glucuronides and its concentration increase in treated effluent could be related to the partial cleavage of n glucuronide conjugates during treatment bahlmann et al 2014 in the present study the cbz 2oh concentration was usually higher than that of its parent cbz compound and may be the result of the different nature of their glucuronides interestingly a higher concentration was reported in other studies for cbz dioh another metabolite of carbamazepine in raw sewage and treated effluents compared to that of its parent cbz compound miao and metcalfe 2003 miao et al 2005 hummel et al 2006 leclercq et al 2009 bahlmann et al 2014 in contrast to cbz which forms n glucuronides all hydroxylated metabolites of cbz especially cbz 2oh and cbz 3oh are excreted as o glucuronides bahlmann et al 2014 the cleavage of the o glucuronides of the hydroxylated metabolites of cbz occurs relatively quickly in the sewer network before they enter the wrrf leclercq et al 2009 bahlmann et al 2014 in our study the length of sewer network is about 2110 km thus it is more likely to observe higher concentrations of cbz 2oh in its free form in raw sewage wwmps are regularly discharged into lake ontario from the studied wrrf and are expected to be found at drinking water treatment plant intakes that are influenced by sewage discharges a comparison of measured concentrations with other studies is discussed in section s 4 3 3 temporal variability of contaminant concentrations in raw sewage parasite fib and wwmp concentrations were assessed between and within events that occurred under various rainfall and flowrate conditions 3 3 1 intra event variability within single events higher variations were observed for microbial contaminants than for wwmps fig 2 and fig 3 for e coli c perfringens and giardia differences were as high as 2 1 9 and 1 5 orders of magnitude respectively in contrast wwmps varied by 1 order of magnitude or less except for asp max 1 2 orders of magnitude for fib a similar trend was observed for both e coli and c perfringens over the course of a day fig 4 under wet weather conditions ev1 ev3 ev4 and ev5 their concentrations decreased overnight 0 00 to 7 00 a m then started to increase at 7 00 a m to reach their peak values in the early afternoon under trace precipitation weather conditions ev2 and ev6 the onset of increases occurred later the daily variation of fecal pollution and the occurrence time of peak fib concentrations is associated with diurnal defecation patterns as well as with residence time of the sewer system mara and horan 2003 during wet weather inflow to the sewershed increases the flowrates and velocities and thereby shortens the travel time of fecal contaminants within the sewer network madoux humery et al 2013 no clear temporal trends were observed for tss over the course of a day fig s1 as many samples were negative for cryptosporidium in the influent 3 of 35 samples were positive no temporal trends could be observed for giardia peak concentrations occurred during the day fig s1 rather than at night demonstrating a weak potential for a temporal trend that is heavily influenced by the uncertainties of the methods and also potentially the sporadic spatial occurrences throughout the sewershed for wwmps little variation was observed for cbz and its metabolite cbz 2oh within single events figs 3 and 4 and fig s1 little or no daily variation was also reported for cbz in a wrrf effluent in the usa nelson et al 2010 and in raw sewage in the greater montreal area madoux humery et al 2013 a trend was observed for caf suc and cbz when considering all monitored events fig 4 their concentrations decreased overall from 0 00 a m to 7 00 a m and then increased from 7 00 a m to 6 00 p m for both caf and suc and from 7 00 a m to 3 30 p m for cbz within day fluctuations of wwmps ace cbz 2oh and asp are also shown in fig s1 may be related to their consumption patterns half lives in the body excretion pathways and retention time in the sewer system madoux humery et al 2013 our findings further indicate that the impact of untreated or partially treated sewage discharges into lake ontario will be greater with regards to wwmps if they occur in the late afternoon or early evening 3 3 2 inter event variability comparing events figs 2 and 3 show the variability of concentrations for the samples collected under various weather conditions higher inter event fluctuations up to 2 orders of magnitude were observed for giardia e coli and c perfringens as compared to those of wwmps the lowest variation was observed for cbz and its metabolite cbz 2oh 0 6 orders of magnitude among events the lowest median value of giardia was observed in the september wet weather event fig 2 p 0 05 in kruskal wallis test followed by mann whitney u test when mean monthly flows into channel 2 were at their lowest fig 1b the maximum value observed for giardia 1010 cysts l was during the first june wet weather event with a 2 day cumulative rainfall of 24 mm prior to sample collection for e coli median concentrations were significantly higher under wet weather conditions than under trace precipitation weather conditions mann whitney u test p 0 05 differences between median c perfringens concentrations under trace precipitation and wet weather conditions were insignificant p 0 05 the median concentrations of c perfringens were significantly higher in the spring april wet weather and may trace precipitation events as compared to the other events p 0 05 in kruskal wallis test followed by mann whitney u test fig 2 wastewater inflow and sewer deposit resuspension may contribute to the conveyance of fecal pollution wastewater concentrations of fecal microorganisms are orders of magnitude higher than inflow stormwater concentrations madoux humery et al 2013 sewer deposit resuspension is related to the type and configuration of the sewershed rainfall intensity and antecedent dry period madoux humery et al 2015 spore forming c perfringens can be associated with settleable particles and they have a long survival in surface waters and sediments edwards et al 1998 lisle et al 2004 krometis et al 2007 mueller spitz et al 2010 the flowrate is generally higher in april and may due to the higher level of infiltration inflow following the snowmelt period and higher water table fig 1 sewer sediments could become a source of c perfringens spores that accumulated during lower flow periods snowmelt has been recognized as a critical time with regards to source water protection because of few restrictions on raw sewage discharges from sewer overflows and lower temperatures affecting drinking water treatment efficiencies madoux humery et al 2013 the probability of a by pass event is higher during and following the snowmelt period with rain on snow the spring period was identified as a vulnerable time for the water treatment plants located in lake ontario as a result of higher parasite concentrations at offshore intakes edge et al 2013 at the studied wrrf by passes are discharged following primary treatment sometimes with and sometimes without disinfection it is assumed that the high concentrations of fecal microorganisms following a by pass event are mitigated because raw sewage is treated to some extent after primary treatment however not all microorganisms are reduced following primary treatment katayama et al 2004 kay et al 2008 giardia log removal through primary treatment has been reported to be in the range of 0 12 0 65 robertson et al 2000 cacciò et al 2003 fu et al 2010 among the selected wwmps the median concentration of ace was significantly lower during wet weather conditions p 0 05 in mann whitney u test perhaps as a result of its higher solubility 587500 mg l at 25 c as compared to other wwmps table s1 among events the variability of caf cbz and cbz 2oh concentrations was significantly higher p 0 05 in the september wet weather event with 2 day cumulative rainfall of approximately 32 mm prior to sample collection fig 3 differences among concentrations may be related to their different excretion patterns influenced by the time of sampling as illustrated in table s2 and can be influenced by hydraulic conditions in the sewer system for example sewer system sediments were identified as both source and sink of wwmps in urban water systems hajj mohamad et al 2014 madoux humery et al 2015 discharge patterns dilution processes degradation rates sorption and desorption processes were recognized as key controlling factors regarding the fate and transport of wwmps in aquatic environments including within combined sewer systems scheytt et al 2005 hajj mohamad et al 2017 wwmps that are highly soluble and degradable would tend to not accumulate in sewer sediments and are more likely to be diluted by the addition of stormwater into the sewer system in contrast wwmps that accumulate in sewer sediments could see concentrations increase with the addition of stormwater as increased flowrates lead to sediment resuspension and desorption 3 3 3 relationship between concentrations and flowrates when studying contaminants in urban sewersheds it is useful to consider whether contaminant concentrations are flow or mass limited the concepts of mass limited and flow limited events have been described by cristina and sansalone 2003 for characterizing the dynamics of pollutant transport in urban areas a mass limited concentration means that when the source of the contaminant is exhausted or diluted in the case of sewage there is no longer enough mass available in the system to be carried by hydraulic transport thus the concentration will decrease as flow increases with flow limited contaminants the source of the contaminant remains and the flowrate is the critical factor for pollution concentrations and loads piro and carbone 2014 although these concepts have generally been applied to stormwater driven systems they are also useful in the context of sewage flow driven systems because they can help explain trends and relationships between contaminant concentrations and peak flows flowrates were weakly yet significantly correlated to e coli r 0 32 p 0 05 c perfringens r 0 48 p 0 05 and giardia concentrations r 0 4 p 0 05 suggesting similar sources as well as fate and transport dynamics for microbial contaminants in the sewer network when considering only the period from 7 00 am to early afternoon the correlations between flowrate and fecal indicator bacteria were stronger e coli r 0 67 p 0 05 c perfringens r 0 70 p 0 05 the association of fib with settleable particles and sediment resuspension during increasing flowrate conditions presumably influences microbial fate and transport in the sewer network gonçalves et al 2009 passerat et al 2011 in general microbial contaminants were not strongly mass limited and increasing flowrates led to higher concentrations even when greater dilution of sewage would be expected possible explanations are 1 less die off as a result of shorter travel times 2 peak flows corresponding to peak fecal excretion periods and 3 higher flows leading to greater net resuspension or less net deposition no significant correlations were observed between flowrate and asp or suc caf cbz and cbz 2oh were positively correlated with flowrates r 0 34 0 66 0 53 respectively p 0 05 in contrast tss and ace were negatively associated with flowrates r 0 28 0 33 respectively p 0 05 ace is highly soluble and is diluted by higher flows if some sediment resuspension occurred during flowrate increase in the sewer network tss concentration was more mass limited as compared to the other contaminants for the events monitored the absence of correlation between tss and giardia or e coli p 0 05 suggests that they were not associated with fecal contamination likely because they were released from different sources madoux humery et al 2013 by pass discharges typically occur when flowrates are at their highest from a drinking water source protection perspective it is important to understand how concentrations vary in relation to peak flows because it is logistically difficult to deploy for sampling when by passes occur as they are less frequent and more difficult to predict in order to determine the degree to which peak contaminant concentrations were associated with peak flows box plots of normalized concentrations c cpeak of fecal microorganisms wwmps and tss in raw sewage were illustrated for the last decile of normalized flowrate 0 9 q qpeak 1 fig 5 the concentration variations c cpeak were lower for caf cbz cbz 2oh and suc with the median values in the range of 0 79 0 9 and higher for asp and ace with the median values of 0 61 and 0 49 respectively the fluctuation of c cpeak was also higher for giardia e coli c perfringens and tss with median values of 0 3 0 59 0 73 and 0 46 respectively evaluation of peak concentrations of fecal contamination sources are needed to estimate peak concentrations at drinking water intakes in order to ensure that drinking water treatment plants are appropriately designed dorner et al 2006 peak concentrations of giardia e coli and c perfringens may not be observed during peak flowrates and hence they are more mass limited than flow limited with regards to their origins in sewer networks as compared to caf cbz cbz 2oh and suc 3 4 indicators of fecal pollution in surface waters impacted by by passes selection of appropriate indicators of fecal pollution should be carried out by considering their sources fate and transport characteristics sauvé et al 2012 these were shown to be variable in sewer systems under wet weather conditions gasperi et al 2010 passerat et al 2011 indicating the important role of local hydro meteorology suitable indicators of fecal pollution in a by pass discharge and or wrrf effluent in the case of a treatment failure were assessed by examining the correlations between concentrations in raw sewage under trace precipitation and wet weather conditions table 2 this information provides a reliable indication of the potential for the presence of pathogens in source waters under wet weather conditions giardia was not correlated with bacterial indicators but was significantly and positively correlated with cbz cbz 2oh r 0 45 p 0 05 and caf r 0 4 p 0 05 cbz is more persistent than caf and its removal is marginal through conventional wastewater treatment as a result of its refractory behaviour miao and metcalfe 2003 sauvé et al 2012 tran et al 2018 the half life for caf was shown to range between 0 8 and 5 h in wastewater with biological processes buerge et al 2003 giardia cysts are also environmentally resistant therefore a more stable marker is more conservative and useful given the correlations and poor removal through wastewater treatment cbz and its metabolite cbz 2oh appear to be the most suitable markers of fecal contamination in a by pass discharge and or failed treatment following wet weather conditions under wet weather conditions many wwmps were strongly intercorrelated table 2 significant correlations were previously observed between ace and cbz concentrations in surface waters r2 0 94 and in riverbank filtration wells r2 0 85 scheurer et al 2011 a significant correlation r 0 79 p 0 05 was observed between giardia and e coli n 7 for events with only trace precipitation but not for wet weather events survival rates differ among fecal microorganisms for instance die off rates of fecal coliforms salmonella typhimurium and giardia in sediments of two constructed wetlands were reported as 0 15 log10 day 1 0 31 log10 day 1 and 0 37 log10 day 1 respectively karim et al 2004 thus over time giardia and e coli would accumulate in the sewer network at different rates which could lead to differences in their relative contributions from the sewer network during wet weather overall tss were significantly negatively correlated with c perfringens caf cbz cbz 2oh and ace r 0 47 to 0 61 p 0 05 and were positively correlated with asp r 0 51 p 0 05 positive correlations would be expected for parameters with similar origins and pathways daneshvar et al 2012 proposed cbz as a marker of cumulative wastewater discharges into surface waters and caf as recent marker of fecal contamination correlations among fecal microorganisms and wwmps change according to weather conditions and potentially the time of day these variations may relate to changes in terms of source including varying excretion patterns sources within the network fecal inputs and sewer sediments and different travel times as affected by flowrates and velocities from sewage and additional inflow during precipitation events and fate and transport behaviours of studied parameters within the sewer network 4 conclusions a total of 864 separate microbial and chemical analyses were conducted for the quantification of pathogenic parasites fecal indicator bacteria and wwmps in raw sewage and treated effluents under various hydro meteorological conditions our conclusions with regards to the studied contaminants in sewage influents and effluents are the following in raw sewage and treated effluents giardia cysts were more prevalent than cryptosporidium oocysts parasites were more prevalent in treated effluents than in raw sewage as a result of the higher recovery efficiencies in the treated effluent from reduced water matrix effects the concentration of carbamazepine cbz increased in treated effluents the observed cbz increase was possibly related to the partial cleavage of n glucuronide conjugates during wastewater treatment asp was the only wwmp to be consistently removed to below its limit of detection in treated effluents given the significant correlation between cbz and giardia e coli and c perfringens in raw sewage samples r 0 45 p 0 05 cbz appears to be an appropriate chemical marker of human related fecal pollution resulting from untreated or partially treated wastewater discharges such as wrrf by passes hence the presence of cbz in source waters indicates the potential for human pathogen presence intra and inter event variations were more pronounced for microbial contaminants giardia e coli and c perfringens than for wwmps under both dry and wet weather conditions even with the addition of stormwater from inflow to the sewer network observed concentrations of microbiological contaminants and wwmps in raw sewage were driven largely by daily patterns related to human behaviour concentrations were only moderately influenced by precipitation events when considering the dilution potential of infiltration and inflow during wet weather the concentrations of microorganisms in raw sewage were not strongly mass limited peak contaminant concentrations were also observed during wet weather events thus dilution of raw sewage could be partly offset by reduced travel times and fewer losses from deposition or degradation within the sewer network during periods with higher flow for the wrrf studied higher concentrations were observed in the afternoon and early evening and can be considered as critical periods with regards to untreated or partially treated sewage discharges however critical periods for other sewersheds might vary depending on the size and configuration of the sewershed the population served and the time of travel within the sewer network wrrf by pass discharges are more likely to occur during periods of high flow for systems with frequent by pass flows it is important to consider when by passes occur and the relationship between flowrates and concentrations an increase in flow will not necessarily represent an equivalent increase in sewage dilution even when the increase is partly from stormwater inflow and

19217,wastewater discharges lead to the deterioration of receiving waters through treated effluents and by passes combined and sanitary sewer overflows and cross connections to storm sewers the influence of weather conditions on fecal indicator bacteria pathogens and wastewater micropollutants on raw and treated sewage concentrations has not been extensively characterized however such data are needed to understand the effects of by pass discharges and incomplete treatment on receiving waters a water resource recovery facility was monitored for pathogenic parasites cryptosporidium

during 6 events under different weather conditions snowmelt and trace to 32 mm 2 day cumulative precipitation greater intra and inter event variability was observed for giardia e coli and c perfringens than for studied wwmps even with the addition of inflow and infiltration daily variations dominated concentration trends thus afternoon and early evening were identified as critical times with regards to high concentrations and flows for potential by pass discharges peak concentrations of giardia were observed during the june wet weather event 1010 cysts l with the highest flowrates

precipitation conditions caffeine carbamazepine and its metabolite 2 oh carbamazepine were significantly correlated p 0 05 with giardia e coli and c perfringens demonstrating that they are useful markers for untreated sewage discharges data from the study are needed for estimating peak concentrations discharged from wastewater sources in relation to precipitation or snowmelt events graphical

waterborne disease outbreaks associated with parasitic protozoa were documented worldwide between 2011 and 2016 efstratiou et al 2017 besides the cryptosporidiosis outbreak in milwaukee wisconsin major waterborne outbreaks have also occurred in canada over the past two decades water supplies in walkerton ontario and north battleford saskatchewan were contaminated by pathogens identified as e coli o157 h7 campylobacter jejuni and cryptosporidium parvum laing 2002 o connor 2002 many reported outbreaks have occurred following heavy rainfall events that led to the contamination of drinking water sources hrudey et al 2002 hunter 2003 drinking water intakes of the great lakes were assumed to have low vulnerability due to their great depth distance from shore and large dilution potential and are considered as good sources of drinking water canadian public health association 1986 yet the milwaukee outbreak resulted from contamination of the offshore intake by sewage derived cryptosporidium oocysts introduced into lake michigan mackenzie et al 1994 the great lakes region is expected to experience more extreme precipitation events as a result of climate and land use change patz et al 2008 some of the greatest uncertainties associated with global change are in relation to future sewage discharges and local contaminant mass loads jalliffier verne et al 2015 waterborne pathogens enter the great lakes from a variety of point and non point sources that represent potential threats for the production of drinking water delivered to more than 40 million people patz et al 2008 water resource recovery facilities wrrfs also known as wastewater treatment plants have been identified as major point sources of pollution in the great lakes basin with billions of liters of sewage from combined sewer overflows csos and sewage by passes being discharged into the great lakes yearly podolsky and macdonald 2013 it is important to not only investigate the quality of treated effluent discharges but raw sewage as well discharge concentrations of fecal microorganisms vary over orders of magnitude madoux humery et al 2013 and storm events can lead to discharges with limited or no treatment in a wrrf served by a separate sewer system flows originate from three major components base sanitary flow infiltration flow from groundwater through network defects and rapid inflow during intense storm events and snowmelt epa 2014 inflow and infiltration flow present important challenges including reduced treatment efficiency or sewage by passes brière 2014 wrrf by passes are common during intense storm events in the great lakes basin and they are a major source of fecal pollution epa 2004 podolsky and macdonald 2013 available literature has focused on evaluating the prevalence of pathogenic parasites and fecal indicator bacteria fib in wrrfs their concentrations and removal rates during different stages of treatment processes their seasonal variation and the impact of effluent discharges on the microbiological quality of drinking water reservoirs ottoson et al 2006 ajonina et al 2012 2013 cheng et al 2012 gallas lindemann et al 2013 burnet et al 2014 the prevalence of infectious cryptosporidium has also been observed in raw sewage and secondary treated effluents rose et al 2004 lalancette et al 2012 the prevalence and removal rates of giardia have usually been higher than those of cryptosporidium kitajima et al 2014 taran benshoshan et al 2015 parasites and fib are eliminated through treatment processes with efficiencies depending on the size type and capacity of the treatment facilities garcia armisen et al 2008 kistemann et al 2008 fu et al 2010 the efficiency of conventional wastewater treatment has been shown to be limited for parasite

2010 most studies that have examined pathogen and indicator occurrence and removal during wastewater treatment have been conducted during dry weather conditions or weather conditions were not specified however wrrfs are subject to hydrologic events and their performances vary between dry and wet weather conditions lucas et al 2012 secondary and tertiary treatments were reported to be less effective for fib removal under high flow conditions kay et al 2008 while evaluating the variability of a wrrf removal efficiency rate during various weather conditions is important characterizing the variability of concentrations is even more critically needed when it comes to untreated or partially treated discharges there is a need for data on the varibility of raw sewage microbiological quality during intense storm events in order to understand potential peak concentrations of by pass discharges sewer sediments have been identified as a sink for bacteria wastewater micropollutants and total suspended solids and their contribution to cso loads have been determined gasperi et al 2010 passerat et al 2011 madoux humery et al 2015 however little is known about the role of sewer sediments with regards to loads of bacteria micropollutants and total suspended solids tss from sanitary sewer networks with high levels of infiltration and inflow data on the relative contribution of sewer sediments to concentrations arriving at wrrfs may be especially critical when it comes to implementing management practices for sewer lines and estimating the impact of sewage by passes on receiving waters since pathogenic parasite analyses are time consuming expensive and complex standard enumeration of fib e coli enterococci is usually performed as a surrogate for pathogens however fecal indicators are often not correlated with pathogens wu et al 2011 in order to partly overcome the difficulties associated with the use of conventional fib the combined application of alternative chemical indicators during initial screening and or as a supplementary cross validation tool has been suggested hagedorn and weisberg 2009 fecal microorganisms originate from both human and non human sources hence the application of human origin wastewater micropollutants wwmps has garnered more attention in recent years daneshvar et al 2012 sauvé et al 2012 however the relationships between pathogenic parasites and wwmps have not been widely addressed the presence of suitable wwmps in source waters e g drinking water intakes downstream of a wrrf indicates fecal pollution from human sources and the potential for human pathogen presence table s1 contains information on wwmps that are useful markers of wastewater contamination in aquatic environments the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate the prevalence and temporal varibility of pathogenic parasites cryptosporidium and giardia fib e coli and c perfringens and wwmps caffeine caf carbamazepine cbz 2 hydroxycarbamazepine cbz 2oh acesulfame ace sucralose suc and aspartame asp under weather conditions ranging from snowmelt and trace to intense precipitation 2 investigate describe co variations between pathogenic parasites fib and wwmps to identify appropriate markers of sewage by passes in receiving waters and 3 determine the relationship between the varibility pattern of parasites fib wwmps and tss concentrations during wet weather events with flowrates these data are needed to simulate events such as by pass discharges that occur during peak flows and are not usually captured by routine monitoring programmes to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the temporal variability of pathogenic parasites with wastewater micropollutants in raw sewage moreover few data are available on the variability of influent concentrations during wet weather periods the variability of untreated wastewater concentrations are needed to understand the impact of fecal pollution sources on downstream drinking water intakes especially given the higher risk of gastrointestinal illnesses for consumers whose drinking water sources have been impacted by untreated wastewater discharges following precipitation events jagai et al 2015 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the studied wrrf is located on the north shore of lake ontario canada it receives sewage from a drainage area of 32 964 ha sewer length of 2110 km and has a daily capacity to treat 518 000 m3 of wastewater collected from approximately 1 million people kambeitz 2015 personal communication wastewater from residential industrial commercial and institutional facilities is treated using preliminary primary and secondary treatment conventional activated sludge with phosphorus removal through precipitation with ferrous chloride followed by chlorine disinfection after screening and grit removal raw sewage is conveyed to primary clarifiers through three channels raw sewage from channels 1 and 2 are treated in plant 3 and channel 3 is treated in plants 1 and 2 the by pass gate is located after the primary clarifier of plant 3 treated effluents are discharged into lake ontario in which several drinking water intakes are located although the sewer system is separated studies conducted in this area have shown that additional flows may enter the sanitary sewer system through inflow and infiltration following heavy storm events coleengineering 2011 under heavy rainfall conditions high flowrates lead to the discharge of primary treated effluents with or without disinfection into lake ontario thereby representing a direct input of potential pathogens into a drinking water supply 2 2 sample collection influent and effluent of the wrrf were monitored under various weather conditions in order to determine monthly thresholds that were indicative of an increase of flowrate from increased inflow and infiltration during wet weather the relationship between historical flowrates and precipitation was examined wet weather conditions were defined based on i 2 day cumulative rainfall 10 mm prior to sample collection and ii flowrates above a threshold determined by historical data analysis for each month of the year for the purpose of this study dry weather conditions were defined as events with only trace amounts of rainfall 3 mm and flow rates below the determined threshold a total of four wet weather events one in april two in june and 1 in september 2014 and two trace precipitation events may and september 2014 were monitored the april precipitation event occurred during a snowmelt period the 2 day cumulative rainfall prior to sample collection is shown in table s2 and ranged from trace to 32 mm the return periods for the monitored wet weather events were below 2 years based on historical meteorological data detailed information regarding sampling is presented in section s 1 and table s2 2 3 analytical methods and physico

from seventeen rain gauges within a 30 km distance a normalizing technique was applied to understand the relationship between peak concentrations and peak flowrates by quantifying concentration and flowrate patterns regardless of temporal variability total influent flowrates and concentrations of each parameter measured during wet weather events were divided by their respective peak values c cpeak and q qpeak and the boxplots of the normalized concentrations were presented for the last deciles of normalized flowrate 0 9 q qpeak 1 the normalized boxplots of c cpeak are a visual representation of the likelihood that contaminant peaks will occur with peak flows during wet weather 3 results and discussion 3 1 inflow and infiltration influence on flowrate the time of day and the amount of inflow and infiltration as a result of groundwater table depths precipitation and snowmelt influence the wrrf s flowrate to evaluate the impact of precipitation and snowmelt on the flowrate δq channel 2 s event flowrates minus the average flowrate for its corresponding month and historical hourly flowrates for the corresponding months in channel 2 are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively the difference relative to the mean flowrate for each event as mean monthly flowrates also vary helps to illustrate how each event was influenced by precipitation or snowmelt δq is generally higher for the events with 2 day cumulative rainfall 15 mm prior to sample collection regardless of the time of day events occurred suggesting a direct impact of rainfall during those events ev1 ev3 and ev5 in this study event sampling was generally triggered in the afternoon or evening table s2 the median value of δq was highest for ev3 june 12th daytime 2 day cumulative rainfall of 24 mm and lowest for ev6 september 10th night time trace precipitation p 0 05 further demonstrating the effect of precipitation on flowrates the flowrate in channel 2 is also higher during spring months fig 1b especially in april following snowmelt and frequent precipitation events that likely resulted in higher groundwater and infiltration levels it should be noted that the flowrate measured in channel 2 is part of total plant influent flowrate and is variable its fraction relative to total influent flowrate was in the range of 0 01 0 7 in the period of march to september 2014 but generally represents 42 of the total plant influent 3 2 prevalence and contaminant concentrations in influent and effluent samples the concentrations of parasites cryptosporidium and giardia fib e coli and c perfringens wwmps caf cbz cbz 2oh ace suc and asp and tss in raw sewage and treated effluent discharges are shown in table 1 we found a higher prevalence of giardia as compared to cryptosporidium in raw sewage 88 6 compared to 8 6 and in effluent samples 100 compared to 30 the prevalence rates for parasites in raw sewage were indeed lower than in effluent samples and it relates to the complexity of the raw sewage matrix which causes recovery efficiencies to drop compared to treated effluents this has been previously reported by others rose et al 2004 lalancette et al 2012 concentrations of cryptosporidium and giardia in raw sewage varied from below lod to 10 oocysts l and from below the lod to 1010 cysts l respectively in treated effluents they ranged from below lod to 0 2 oocysts l and from 0 1 to 11 1 cysts l respectively the giardia and cryptosporidium concentrations in raw sewage and treated effluents fall within the ranges documented in the literature table s4 additional discussion is presented in section s 3 supplementary information e coli and c perfringens were detected in 100 of the raw sewage and treated effluent samples median concentrations in raw sewage samples were 2 6 106 cfu 100 ml and 4 104 cfu 100 ml for e coli and c perfringens respectively they were generally 5 and 2 logs lower in treated effluents respectively the observed concentrations are in the range of reported values in the literature table s5 with the exception of asp which was detected in 92 7 of raw sewage samples and was absent in the treated effluents micropollutants including caf cbz cbz 2oh ace and suc were found in all raw sewage and treated effluent samples the absence of asp in effluent samples is likely due to its higher degradability kokotou et al 2012 lange et al 2012 asp concentrations in raw sewage samples of two wastewater treatment plants in china were in the range of 44 53 ng l but they were absent in treated effluents gan et al 2013 in the studied wrrf the asp median concentrations were significantly lower than other artificial sweeteners of ace and suc p 0 05 in mann whitney u test potentially indicating different consumption patterns of asp compared to other artificial sweeteners in addition to higher degradation rates following ingestion asp is eliminated to a larger degree from the human body nabors 2001 whereas a large amount of ace and suc pass in an unchanged form buerge et al 2009 in contrast to asp we observed an average increase of 26 for cbz during wastewater treatment table 1 cbz is a highly persistent micro pollutant not easily degraded or adsorbed during wastewater treatment processes and its concentrations have been shown to increase at rates as high as 100 in treated effluents miao and metcalfe 2003 clara et al 2004 gao et al 2012 bahlmann et al 2014 carbamazepine forms n glucuronides and its concentration increase in treated effluent could be related to the partial cleavage of n glucuronide conjugates during treatment bahlmann et al 2014 in the present study the cbz 2oh concentration was usually higher than that of its parent cbz compound and may be the result of the different nature of their glucuronides interestingly a higher concentration was reported in other studies for cbz dioh another metabolite of carbamazepine in raw sewage and treated effluents compared to that of its parent cbz compound miao and metcalfe 2003 miao et al 2005 hummel et al 2006 leclercq et al 2009 bahlmann et al 2014 in contrast to cbz which forms n glucuronides all hydroxylated metabolites of cbz especially cbz 2oh and cbz 3oh are excreted as o glucuronides bahlmann et al 2014 the cleavage of the o glucuronides of the hydroxylated metabolites of cbz occurs relatively quickly in the sewer network before they enter the wrrf leclercq et al 2009 bahlmann et al 2014 in our study the length of sewer network is about 2110 km thus it is more likely to observe higher concentrations of cbz 2oh in its free form in raw sewage wwmps are regularly discharged into lake ontario from the studied wrrf and are expected to be found at drinking water treatment plant intakes that are influenced by sewage discharges a comparison of measured concentrations with other studies is discussed in section s 4 3 3 temporal variability of contaminant concentrations in raw sewage parasite fib and wwmp concentrations were assessed between and within events that occurred under various rainfall and flowrate conditions 3 3 1 intra event variability within single events higher variations were observed for microbial contaminants than for wwmps fig 2 and fig 3 for e coli c perfringens and giardia differences were as high as 2 1 9 and 1 5 orders of magnitude respectively in contrast wwmps varied by 1 order of magnitude or less except for asp max 1 2 orders of magnitude for fib a similar trend was observed for both e coli and c perfringens over the course of a day fig 4 under wet weather conditions ev1 ev3 ev4 and ev5 their concentrations decreased overnight 0 00 to 7 00 a m then started to increase at 7 00 a m to reach their peak values in the early afternoon under trace precipitation weather conditions ev2 and ev6 the onset of increases occurred later the daily variation of fecal pollution and the occurrence time of peak fib concentrations is associated with diurnal defecation patterns as well as with residence time of the sewer system mara and horan 2003 during wet weather inflow to the sewershed increases the flowrates and velocities and thereby shortens the travel time of fecal contaminants within the sewer network madoux humery et al 2013 no clear temporal trends were observed for tss over the course of a day fig s1 as many samples were negative for cryptosporidium in the influent 3 of 35 samples were positive no temporal trends could be observed for giardia peak concentrations occurred during the day fig s1 rather than at night demonstrating a weak potential for a temporal trend that is heavily influenced by the uncertainties of the methods and also potentially the sporadic spatial occurrences throughout the sewershed for wwmps little variation was observed for cbz and its metabolite cbz 2oh within single events figs 3 and 4 and fig s1 little or no daily variation was also reported for cbz in a wrrf effluent in the usa nelson et al 2010 and in raw sewage in the greater montreal area madoux humery et al 2013 a trend was observed for caf suc and cbz when considering all monitored events fig 4 their concentrations decreased overall from 0 00 a m to 7 00 a m and then increased from 7 00 a m to 6 00 p m for both caf and suc and from 7 00 a m to 3 30 p m for cbz within day fluctuations of wwmps ace cbz 2oh and asp are also shown in fig s1 may be related to their consumption patterns half lives in the body excretion pathways and retention time in the sewer system madoux humery et al 2013 our findings further indicate that the impact of untreated or partially treated sewage discharges into lake ontario will be greater with regards to wwmps if they occur in the late afternoon or early evening 3 3 2 inter event variability comparing events figs 2 and 3 show the variability of concentrations for the samples collected under various weather conditions higher inter event fluctuations up to 2 orders of magnitude were observed for giardia e coli and c perfringens as compared to those of wwmps the lowest variation was observed for cbz and its metabolite cbz 2oh 0 6 orders of magnitude among events the lowest median value of giardia was observed in the september wet weather event fig 2 p 0 05 in kruskal wallis test followed by mann whitney u test when mean monthly flows into channel 2 were at their lowest fig 1b the maximum value observed for giardia 1010 cysts l was during the first june wet weather event with a 2 day cumulative rainfall of 24 mm prior to sample collection for e coli median concentrations were significantly higher under wet weather conditions than under trace precipitation weather conditions mann whitney u test p 0 05 differences between median c perfringens concentrations under trace precipitation and wet weather conditions were insignificant p 0 05 the median concentrations of c perfringens were significantly higher in the spring april wet weather and may trace precipitation events as compared to the other events p 0 05 in kruskal wallis test followed by mann whitney u test fig 2 wastewater inflow and sewer deposit resuspension may contribute to the conveyance of fecal pollution wastewater concentrations of fecal microorganisms are orders of magnitude higher than inflow stormwater concentrations madoux humery et al 2013 sewer deposit resuspension is related to the type and configuration of the sewershed rainfall intensity and antecedent dry period madoux humery et al 2015 spore forming c perfringens can be associated with settleable particles and they have a long survival in surface waters and sediments edwards et al 1998 lisle et al 2004 krometis et al 2007 mueller spitz et al 2010 the flowrate is generally higher in april and may due to the higher level of infiltration inflow following the snowmelt period and higher water table fig 1 sewer sediments could become a source of c perfringens spores that accumulated during lower flow periods snowmelt has been recognized as a critical time with regards to source water protection because of few restrictions on raw sewage discharges from sewer overflows and lower temperatures affecting drinking water treatment efficiencies madoux humery et al 2013 the probability of a by pass event is higher during and following the snowmelt period with rain on snow the spring period was identified as a vulnerable time for the water treatment plants located in lake ontario as a result of higher parasite concentrations at offshore intakes edge et al 2013 at the studied wrrf by passes are discharged following primary treatment sometimes with and sometimes without disinfection it is assumed that the high concentrations of fecal microorganisms following a by pass event are mitigated because raw sewage is treated to some extent after primary treatment however not all microorganisms are reduced following primary treatment katayama et al 2004 kay et al 2008 giardia log removal through primary treatment has been reported to be in the range of 0 12 0 65 robertson et al 2000 cacciò et al 2003 fu et al 2010 among the selected wwmps the median concentration of ace was significantly lower during wet weather conditions p 0 05 in mann whitney u test perhaps as a result of its higher solubility 587500 mg l at 25 c as compared to other wwmps table s1 among events the variability of caf cbz and cbz 2oh concentrations was significantly higher p 0 05 in the september wet weather event with 2 day cumulative rainfall of approximately 32 mm prior to sample collection fig 3 differences among concentrations may be related to their different excretion patterns influenced by the time of sampling as illustrated in table s2 and can be influenced by hydraulic conditions in the sewer system for example sewer system sediments were identified as both source and sink of wwmps in urban water systems hajj mohamad et al 2014 madoux humery et al 2015 discharge patterns dilution processes degradation rates sorption and desorption processes were recognized as key controlling factors regarding the fate and transport of wwmps in aquatic environments including within combined sewer systems scheytt et al 2005 hajj mohamad et al 2017 wwmps that are highly soluble and degradable would tend to not accumulate in sewer sediments and are more likely to be diluted by the addition of stormwater into the sewer system in contrast wwmps that accumulate in sewer sediments could see concentrations increase with the addition of stormwater as increased flowrates lead to sediment resuspension and desorption 3 3 3 relationship between concentrations and flowrates when studying contaminants in urban sewersheds it is useful to consider whether contaminant concentrations are flow or mass limited the concepts of mass limited and flow limited events have been described by cristina and sansalone 2003 for characterizing the dynamics of pollutant transport in urban areas a mass limited concentration means that when the source of the contaminant is exhausted or diluted in the case of sewage there is no longer enough mass available in the system to be carried by hydraulic transport thus the concentration will decrease as flow increases with flow limited contaminants the source of the contaminant remains and the flowrate is the critical factor for pollution concentrations and loads piro and carbone 2014 although these concepts have generally been applied to stormwater driven systems they are also useful in the context of sewage flow driven systems because they can help explain trends and relationships between contaminant concentrations and peak flows flowrates were weakly yet significantly correlated to e coli r 0 32 p 0 05 c perfringens r 0 48 p 0 05 and giardia concentrations r 0 4 p 0 05 suggesting similar sources as well as fate and transport dynamics for microbial contaminants in the sewer network when considering only the period from 7 00 am to early afternoon the correlations between flowrate and fecal indicator bacteria were stronger e coli r 0 67 p 0 05 c perfringens r 0 70 p 0 05 the association of fib with settleable particles and sediment resuspension during increasing flowrate conditions presumably influences microbial fate and transport in the sewer network gonçalves et al 2009 passerat et al 2011 in general microbial contaminants were not strongly mass limited and increasing flowrates led to higher concentrations even when greater dilution of sewage would be expected possible explanations are 1 less die off as a result of shorter travel times 2 peak flows corresponding to peak fecal excretion periods and 3 higher flows leading to greater net resuspension or less net deposition no significant correlations were observed between flowrate and asp or suc caf cbz and cbz 2oh were positively correlated with flowrates r 0 34 0 66 0 53 respectively p 0 05 in contrast tss and ace were negatively associated with flowrates r 0 28 0 33 respectively p 0 05 ace is highly soluble and is diluted by higher flows if some sediment resuspension occurred during flowrate increase in the sewer network tss concentration was more mass limited as compared to the other contaminants for the events monitored the absence of correlation between tss and giardia or e coli p 0 05 suggests that they were not associated with fecal contamination likely because they were released from different sources madoux humery et al 2013 by pass discharges typically occur when flowrates are at their highest from a drinking water source protection perspective it is important to understand how concentrations vary in relation to peak flows because it is logistically difficult to deploy for sampling when by passes occur as they are less frequent and more difficult to predict in order to determine the degree to which peak contaminant concentrations were associated with peak flows box plots of normalized concentrations c cpeak of fecal microorganisms wwmps and tss in raw sewage were illustrated for the last decile of normalized flowrate 0 9 q qpeak 1 fig 5 the concentration variations c cpeak were lower for caf cbz cbz 2oh and suc with the median values in the range of 0 79 0 9 and higher for asp and ace with the median values of 0 61 and 0 49 respectively the fluctuation of c cpeak was also higher for giardia e coli c perfringens and tss with median values of 0 3 0 59 0 73 and 0 46 respectively evaluation of peak concentrations of fecal contamination sources are needed to estimate peak concentrations at drinking water intakes in order to ensure that drinking water treatment plants are appropriately designed dorner et al 2006 peak concentrations of giardia e coli and c perfringens may not be observed during peak flowrates and hence they are more mass limited than flow limited with regards to their origins in sewer networks as compared to caf cbz cbz 2oh and suc 3 4 indicators of fecal pollution in surface waters impacted by by passes selection of appropriate indicators of fecal pollution should be carried out by considering their sources fate and transport characteristics sauvé et al 2012 these were shown to be variable in sewer systems under wet weather conditions gasperi et al 2010 passerat et al 2011 indicating the important role of local hydro meteorology suitable indicators of fecal pollution in a by pass discharge and or wrrf effluent in the case of a treatment failure were assessed by examining the correlations between concentrations in raw sewage under trace precipitation and wet weather conditions table 2 this information provides a reliable indication of the potential for the presence of pathogens in source waters under wet weather conditions giardia was not correlated with bacterial indicators but was significantly and positively correlated with cbz cbz 2oh r 0 45 p 0 05 and caf r 0 4 p 0 05 cbz is more persistent than caf and its removal is marginal through conventional wastewater treatment as a result of its refractory behaviour miao and metcalfe 2003 sauvé et al 2012 tran et al 2018 the half life for caf was shown to range between 0 8 and 5 h in wastewater with biological processes buerge et al 2003 giardia cysts are also environmentally resistant therefore a more stable marker is more conservative and useful given the correlations and poor removal through wastewater treatment cbz and its metabolite cbz 2oh appear to be the most suitable markers of fecal contamination in a by pass discharge and or failed treatment following wet weather conditions under wet weather conditions many wwmps were strongly intercorrelated table 2 significant correlations were previously observed between ace and cbz concentrations in surface waters r2 0 94 and in riverbank filtration wells r2 0 85 scheurer et al 2011 a significant correlation r 0 79 p 0 05 was observed between giardia and e coli n 7 for events with only trace precipitation but not for wet weather events survival rates differ among fecal microorganisms for instance die off rates of fecal coliforms salmonella typhimurium and giardia in sediments of two constructed wetlands were reported as 0 15 log10 day 1 0 31 log10 day 1 and 0 37 log10 day 1 respectively karim et al 2004 thus over time giardia and e coli would accumulate in the sewer network at different rates which could lead to differences in their relative contributions from the sewer network during wet weather overall tss were significantly negatively correlated with c perfringens caf cbz cbz 2oh and ace r 0 47 to 0 61 p 0 05 and were positively correlated with asp r 0 51 p 0 05 positive correlations would be expected for parameters with similar origins and pathways daneshvar et al 2012 proposed cbz as a marker of cumulative wastewater discharges into surface waters and caf as recent marker of fecal contamination correlations among fecal microorganisms and wwmps change according to weather conditions and potentially the time of day these variations may relate to changes in terms of source including varying excretion patterns sources within the network fecal inputs and sewer sediments and different travel times as affected by flowrates and velocities from sewage and additional inflow during precipitation events and fate and transport behaviours of studied parameters within the sewer network 4 conclusions a total of 864 separate microbial and chemical analyses were conducted for the quantification of pathogenic parasites fecal indicator bacteria and wwmps in raw sewage and treated effluents under various hydro meteorological conditions our conclusions with regards to the studied contaminants in sewage influents and effluents are the following in raw sewage and treated effluents giardia cysts were more prevalent than cryptosporidium oocysts parasites were more prevalent in treated effluents than in raw sewage as a result of the higher recovery efficiencies in the treated effluent from reduced water matrix effects the concentration of carbamazepine cbz increased in treated effluents the observed cbz increase was possibly related to the partial cleavage of n glucuronide conjugates during wastewater treatment asp was the only wwmp to be consistently removed to below its limit of detection in treated effluents given the significant correlation between cbz and giardia e coli and c perfringens in raw sewage samples r 0 45 p 0 05 cbz appears to be an appropriate chemical marker of human related fecal pollution resulting from untreated or partially treated wastewater discharges such as wrrf by passes hence the presence of cbz in source waters indicates the potential for human pathogen presence intra and inter event variations were more pronounced for microbial contaminants giardia e coli and c perfringens than for wwmps under both dry and wet weather conditions even with the addition of stormwater from inflow to the sewer network observed concentrations of microbiological contaminants and wwmps in raw sewage were driven largely by daily patterns related to human behaviour concentrations were only moderately influenced by precipitation events when considering the dilution potential of infiltration and inflow during wet weather the concentrations of microorganisms in raw sewage were not strongly mass limited peak contaminant concentrations were also observed during wet weather events thus dilution of raw sewage could be partly offset by reduced travel times and fewer losses from deposition or degradation within the sewer network during periods with higher flow for the wrrf studied higher concentrations were observed in the afternoon and early evening and can be considered as critical periods with regards to untreated or partially treated sewage discharges however critical periods for other sewersheds might vary depending on the size and configuration of the sewershed the population served and the time of travel within the sewer network wrrf by pass discharges are more likely to occur during periods of high flow for systems with frequent by pass flows it is important to consider when by passes occur and the relationship between flowrates and concentrations an increase in flow will not necessarily represent an equivalent increase in sewage dilution even when the increase is partly from stormwater inflow and

19218,nanoplastics nps have been identified as newly emerging particulate contaminants in marine environments the interaction between nps and other engineered nanoparticles remains unknown this study investigated the cotransport of nps with fullerene c60 in seawater saturated columns packed with natural sand as affected by the mass concentration ratio of nps c60 and the hydrochemical characteristics in seawater with 35 practical salinity units psu nps could remarkably enhance c60 dispersion with a nps c60 ratio of 1 nps behaved as a vehicle to facilitate c60 transport by decreasing colloidal ζ potential and forming stable primary heteroaggregates as the nps c60 ratio decreased to 1 3 nps mobility was progressively restrained because of the formation of large secondary aggregates when the ratio continuously decreased to 1 10 the stability and transport of colloids were governed by c60 rather than nps under this condition the transport trend of binary suspensions was similar to that of single c60 suspension which was characterized by a ripening phenomenon seawater salinity is another key factor affecting the stability and associated transport of nps and c60 in seawater with 3 5 psu nps and c60 1 1 in binary suspension exhibited colloidal dispersion which was driven by a high energy barrier thus the profiles of the cotransport and retention of nps c60 resembled those of single nps suspension this work demonstrated that the cotransport of nps c60 strongly depended on their mass concentration ratios and seawater salinity graphical abstract image 1

low to medium ionic strength conditions bradford et al 2002 2003 2007 quevedo and tufenkji 2012 dong et al 2018 further demonstrated that the transport of nps was strongly inhibited in seawater saturated sand these studies have revealed that a decrease in the mobility of nps is closely associated with the increase in ionic strength and nps size and the decline in the homogeneity of porous media additionally nps transport is intricately connected to other artificially produced nanoparticle matrices in seawater alimi et al 2018 afrooz et al 2016 however the stabilization and transport of

because of the formation of large nps hetero aggregates with go peng et al 2017 this finding suggests that the cotransport of nps with a secondary particulate entity depends on the ionic strengths of

accelerating channeling of vertical transport movement alimi et al 2018 quevedo and tufenkji 2012 therefore further investigations should be performed to determine the exact mechanism of emerging nps

transferred into 50 ml vials with 25 ml deionized water the mixtures were shaken for 60 min to remobilize the nanoparticles from the sand surface similar methods have been used in other studies to detach the nanoparticle from the sand surface sun et al 2015 jiang et al 2012 the supernatant was collected to determine the concentration of remobilized nanoparticles to visually describe the retention of nps and c60 in sand columns the sand samples at the inlet of the column were collected to measure their morphology via sem s4800 hitachi japan column experiments were performed more than thrice to enhance the result reliability and the data were presented as mean the mass balance information i e the mass percentages recovered from effluent sand and total is shown in table 1 the detection of the concentrations of nps and c60 is given in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of nps and c60 in single suspension fig s6 shows the effect of varying solution salinity and nps mass concentration on the sedimentation of the suspension in deionized water 0 psu the ratio of solution mass concentration to initial mass concentration c c0 of nps remained constant 0 98 for 40 min as the salinity increased from 3 5 psu to 35 psu c c0 gradually decreased this result was consistent with previous findings that high ionic strength can cause a decrease in suspension stability xu et al 2017b xiao et al 2017 although the zeta potential of nps increased from 37 72 0 11 mv to 20 29 0 42 mv as the salinity increased from 0 psu to 35 psu table 1 the hydrodynamic diameters ddls of nps remained lower than 230 nm which was close to its initial size 200 nm fig s6b the stability of nps in seawater was attributed to strong electrostatic repulsion and the presence of energy barrier between nps and nps fig s7 fig s6b suggests that the variation in the mass concentration of nps has a negligible effect on nps aggregation at 35 psu the sedimentation and homoaggregation of c60 figs s6c and d were more sensitive to salinity variation than those of nps figs s6a and b when the salinity increased from 0 psu to 3 5psu the c c0 of c60 in the supernatant decreased from 0 97 to 0 87 fig s6c indicating that c60 aggregates readily settled in high salinity water the average ddls of c60 during 40 min increased from 118 02 1 95 nm to 149 69 9 21 nm with the increase of salinity from 0 psu to 3 5 psu the size of c60 remained relatively stable fig s6d suggesting that c60 was well dispersed in 3 5 psu water previous studies demonstrated that the critical coagulation concentration of c60 is 120 mmol l nacl chen and elimelech 2006 zhang et al 2013 at 3 5 psu approximately 50 mmol l nacl the large c60 particles might form because of their self assembly and aggregation fig s8a in 35 psu seawater the large aggregate structure appeared as evidenced by the tem images of c60 fig 1 a and the rapid increase of ddls of c60 from 201 21 nm to 639 43 nm during 40 min fig s6d this result could be attributed to the significant decrease of electrostatic repulsion zhang et al 2013 the ζ potentials of c60 at 0 3 5 and 35 psu were 27 41 1 02 20 02 0 69 and 10 27 0 51 mv table 1 respectively less negatively charged particles causes a reduction of repulsive energy between c60 and c60 in our study the total interfacial interaction energies between c60 clusters at different salinities were estimated in accordance with dlvo theory to further illustrate the aggregation mechanism fig 1c at 3 5 psu the energy barrier of c60 was 18 6 kbt in seawater 35 psu the energy barrier disappeared because a decrease in electrostatic double layer interaction results in the complete dominance of van der waals interaction aich et al 2016 xu et al 2017b 3 2 properties of nps and c60 in binary suspension the sedimentation curve and aggregation of nps and c60 in 35 psu seawater are determined and presented in fig 2 when nps and c60 were mixed at a mass concentration ratio of 1 c c0 of mixture suspension decreased to 0 89 at 40 min fig 2a and was slightly less than that 0 91 of single nps suspension fig s6a suggesting that nps dominated the stability of binary particle suspension the ζ potential of nps c60 was 19 09 0 53 mv which was similar to that 20 29 0 42 mv of nps without c60 and twice than that of c60 in single suspension 10 27 0 51 mv table 1 thus the strong electrostatic force inhibited the sedimentation of c60 wang et al 2015b the ddls of nps c60 particles was relatively stable at 287 01 11 08 nm average value of 0 min 40 min which was more than that of single nps 226 33 3 39 nm in seawater fig s6b by contrast c60 in single suspension was unstable the size of c60 aggregates rose steadily figs 1a and s6d the tem image of nps c60 suspension showed that the particles were polydisperse and mainly spherical with slight angular features in binary suspension instead of regular microspheres with a smooth surface of the particles in the nps suspension fig 1b obviously c60 was attached to single nps and formed stable nps c60 nanohybrids primary heteroaggregates this results indicated that heteroaggregation between nps and c60 might occur in binary suspensions according to dlvo theory the primary maximum energy between nps and c60 in seawater was 7 8 kbt fig 1d which was lower than that 5 5 kbt between nps and nps in seawater fig s7 and this lower value contributed to the formation of nps c60 heteroaggregation wang et al 2015b the similar ζ potential in single nps and binary nps c60 resulted in the almost equal eclectic force the van der waals forces rather than the electrical force between nps and c60 might cause the heteroaggregation wang et al 2015a dusak et al 2015 additionally π π interactions could typically occur between nps aromatic rings and c60 aromatic rings similar mechanism of heteroaggregation has been reported in previous findings wang et al 2015a chen and elimelech 2008 wu et al 2012 as the ratio of nps c60 decreased from 1 to 1 3 and 1 10 the effect of nps on the stability of binary suspension gradually weakened the sedimentation curves indicated that c c0 of binary suspension decreased from 0 89 to 0 86 and 0 82 fig 2a the results were consistent with the observation in nps c60 aggregation experiments fig 2b at low nps c60 ratio 1 3 and 1 10 ddls of the particles in binary suspension gradually increased over time possibly because of two mechanisms of nps c60 aggregation including homoaggregation and heteroaggregation 1 the mass concentration ratio of individual ingredients determines the overall surface charge of colloid in binary suspension wang et al 2015a the decrease in nps c60 ratio triggered the reduction of electrostatic repulsion because of the increase in ζ potential less negative of binary suspension table 1 thereby resulting into the formation of larger c60 homoaggregates 2 nps were fully shielded with c60 and the large clusters secondary heteroaggregates were produced by bridging the primary heteroaggregates with c60 because of the predominant c60 in the number of particles which could be supported by tem fig s8b yi et al 2015 huynh et al 2012 fig 2c shows that the stability of binary suspension was significantly enhanced as the solution salinity decreased ddls of binary suspension was 189 48 6 12 and 193 57 4 82 nm at 3 5 and 0 psu respectively fig 2d these values were between those of nps and c60 in single suspension figs s6b and d furthermore the tem image revealed that both nps and c60 were monodispersed at 3 5 psu fig s8d in contrast to nanohybrids at 35 psu fig 1b because the primary maximum energy increased from 7 8 kbt at 35 psu to 98 6 kbt at 3 5 psu fig 1d therefore the possibility of the formation of the heteroaggregates in the sample during drying on the tem grid could be ruled out at 35 psu chen and elimelech 2007 as the salinity continously declined from 3 5 to 0 psu the ζ potential of nps c60 decreased from 29 43 0 56 mv to 34 31 0 45 mv table 1 causing a strong electrostatic repulsion between nps and c60 xiao et al 2017 therefore the heteroaggregation resulting from the van der waals force and π π interactions at 35 psu was completely inhibited at a low salinity 3 5 and 0 psu wang et al 2015b 3 3 transport and retention of single nps and c60 one dimensional column experiments were conducted to assess nps and c60 transport and retention in natural sea sand our preliminary experiment showed that c60 hetero aggregation with or without nps in suspension cannot influence the input concentration of nanoparticles during transport experiments because of the continuous flow via a bump fig s9 this finding suggested that the relative mass concentration was consistent 0 95 1 02 in the column experiments the total mass percentage recovery in the column experiments ranged from 86 96 to 108 03 table 1 the btcs of all of the colloids could reach the column outlet and disappear slightly behind the conservative tracer of pfba fig s10 indicating that size exclusion and detachment can be negligible in this work kasel et al 2013 babakhani et al 2017 fig 3 presents the btcs and rps of 15 ppm nps and 15 ppm c60 at different salinities of 35 3 5 and 0 psu in seawater 35 psu the transport of nps and c60 through the saturated natural sand column was remarkably inhibited with low maximum effluent concentrations mecs 0 31 for nps and 0 23 for c60 intriguingly the btcs of nps and c60 presented different shapes in 35 psu seawater fig 3a and c the btcs of nps had a rising asymmetric plateau without tailing and this finding was considered as a clear sign of a site blocking phenomenon sun et al 2015 babakhani et al 2017 it is due to a gradually increasing occupancy of the retention location on the sand surface with the colloidal particles that is previously retained nps particles can block retention sites on grain surfaces resulting in a deposition decline bradford et al 2002 sun et al 2015 this phenomenon was demostrated by the sem images of the detached nps on sand surface fig s11a the btcs of c60 exhibited a ripening behavior or a dropping plateau that is an increasing rate of deposition with time ripening would occur as nanoparticles aggregated agglomerated in the aqueous phase and the attached or immobilized phase babakhani et al 2017 fig s11b evidenced that a great number of c60 aggregates were on the sand surface the increased particle size of c60 in influent decreased the mobility of nanoparticles in the column wang et al 2012a it is because that the volume of void space accessible by colloids decreases with the increase of the particle size of colloids therefore c60 aggregates could not enter pore spaces with opening smaller than their size chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 moreover ripening arises from the interactions of previously depositing particles on the sand surface thereby offering a rough morphology and several attachment sites and consequently leading to the multilayer accumulation of the particles on the collector surface babakhani et al 2017 physical straining may be a key process of colloid retention in columns babakhani et al 2017 fig 3b and d shows the notable hyper exponential trend of nps and c60 retention profiles in seawater this condition might indicate that straining occurred in columns at a high salinity babakhani et al 2017 although the ratio of the average particle diameter i e nps to sand diameter dp ds of 0 0005 table 1 is approximately one order of magnitude lower than the threshold values 0 002 0 003 bradford et al 2007 babakhani et al 2017 the threshold value would decrease as the solution salinity increases bradford et al 2007 su et al 2017 shen et al 2008 bridging may be another mechanism to enhance the straining of nonaggregated colloids at a high salinity babakhani et al 2017 it caused the pore throats which were initially wider than the colloidal size to gradually narrow via nps deposition therefore the deposited nps was captured similarly mitropoulou et al 2013 demonstrated that the physical straining was a key process during the transport of nps in porous media under a wide range of ionic strength 0 1 1000 mm nacl as the solution salinity decreased from 35 psu to 3 5 psu the transportability of both nps and c60 increased and the mecs of nps and c60 increased to 0 59 and 0 33 respectively fig 3a and b because the surface charge of colloid and sand increased with the decline of solution salinity according to dlvo zhang et al 2012 at 3 5 psu the ζ potentials of nps c60 and sand were 34 42 0 71 20 02 0 69 and 26 62 0 91 mv which were more negative than those 19 82 0 24 10 27 0 51 and 10 01 1 45 mv at 35 psu respectively tables 1 and s1 resulting in a strong electrostatic repulsion between the colloid nps and c60 and the sand zhang et al 2012 ripening was completely suppressed and the btc of c60 at 3 5 psu exhibited a blocking phenomenon which was similar to the btc of nps fig 3c on one hand the negative ζ potential of c60 causes an increase in the repulsive energy barrier between the colloid and the sand attached colloids dong et al 2018 on the other hand the size of c60 retained a stable value of 149 71 9 19 nm resulting in high mobility kasel et al 2013 meanwhile the small size c60 aggregates were observed on the sand surface at 3 5 psu fig s11c by contrast the large c60 aggregates occurred at 35 psu fig s11b in deionized water the ζ potentials of sand c60 and nps were 33 21 1 19 27 41 1 02 and 37 72 0 11 mv respectively tables 1 and s1 therefore the strong electrostatic repulsive force between the nps and the sand resulted in a complete breakthrough additional column experiments were performed to investigate the influence of nps input concentrations fig s12 indicates that the mec and the mass effluent percentage from the effluent meff of nps decreased from 0 31 to 0 23 and from 26 22 to 22 03 respectively as c0 decreased from 15 ppm to 1 5 ppm table 1 the btc shape at the lowest c0 1 5 ppm was flat indicating that the blocking behavior gradually weakened similar observations have been systematically explored and explained in other reports on colloid transport in porous media sun et al 2015 kasel et al 2013 liang et al 2013 3 4 cotransport and coretention of nps and c60 fig s13 presents the btcs and corresponding rps of binary suspension in 35 psu seawater when the mass concentration ratio of nps c60 was equal to 1 the btc of the mixtures fig s13a differed from that of the single c60 fig 3c but closely resembled the shape of the single nps breakthrough curve fig 3a the observed resemblances suggested that nps might absolutely dominate the mobility of the mixtures in the column the individual concentrations of nps and c60 in binary suspension were measured to further describe their cotransport behavior and their btcs and rps are presented in fig 4 the btcs of nps with and without c60 in sea sand almost completely overlapped fig s14 the mobility of c60 with nps was similar to the transport of single nps and remarkably greater than that of single c60 without nps these observations demonstrated that the copresence of nps in mixture suspensions could enhance the mobility of c60 in sand in seawater systems the competition of deposition sites is an important mechanism to explain the transport enhancement one type of colloid can initially adsorb onto the porous media and then block the sites for the deposition of another colloid thereby promoting the latter transport in porous media cai et al 2013 han et al 2016 an additional transport experiment was conducted to obtain the btcs of c60 in pre equilibrating the columns at 85 ml of nps and to verify this hypothesis a negligible release of nps was observed on the sand surface during c60 injection fig s15 if the coexisting nps induced competition in the column the deposition sites in the pre equilibrating column with nps suspension would be preferentially occupied by nps thereby creating few sites available for c60 deposition nevertheless the results showed that the btcs fig s15 of c60 in pre equilibration experiments were practically similar to those of c60 without pre equilibration fig 3c sem image further demostrates that many c60 aggregates were around the pre deposited nps on the sand surface fig 5 a therefore the increased transport of c60 observed in the presence of nps was not due to the deposition competition of nps according to dlvo theory the alteration of zeta potential affects colloid transport in porous media shen et al 2008 hoek and agarwal 2006 c60 in the presence of nps exhibited more negative zeta potentials 19 09 0 53 mv than it did in the absence of nps 10 27 0 51 mv resulting in the great electrostatic repulsive action between c60 and sand in addition the presence of nps would change the aggregation agglomeration status of c60 at 35 psu the disappearance of large c60 aggregates figs 2b and s6d probably enhances the mobility of c60 suspension wang et al 2012b previous studies also demonstrated that large particles coexisting in suspensions may act as mobile carriers for small particles thereby facilitating the transport of the latter in porous media cai et al 2013 han et al 2016 fig 2b illustrates that the primary heteroaggregate of nps c60 with a stable particle size of 287 01 11 08 nm in 35 psu seawater the nps c60 heteroaggregates were observed on the sand surface and the c60 agglomerates did not occur fig 5b thus the transport of these heteroaggregate particles might also be one of the mechanisms of cotransport nps and c60 in columns in seawater systems the effects of mass ratio and aquatic chemistry on cotransport and coretention were further explored when the mass concentration ratio nps c60 decreased from 1 to 1 3 by decreasing the nps concentration from 15 ppm to 5 ppm meff of the mixtures decreased from 27 67 to 24 38 table 1 this result might be due to the enhancement of physical straining in the porous medium because of the heteroaggregate size at a ratio of 1 3 which is larger than that at a ratio of 1 fig 2b bradford et al 2007 the increasing pattern of the plateau of btc at a ratio of 1 3 was obviously depressed compared with that at a ratio of 1 indicating that the blocking effect gradually faded at the ratio of 1 3 the ζ potential became less negative 15 72 0 32 mv consequently the electrostatic repulsion between the subsequent colloids and colloids attached to the sand surface decreases and inhibits the blocking effect xia et al 2015 at the ratio of 1 3 the low mass concentration 5 ppm nps might be one reason for the high retention of binary suspension because a decrease in input concentrations can restrain the transport of colloids kasel et al 2013 however the mec 0 24 of individual nps 5 ppm in cotransport experiments was slightly lower than that of single nps 0 28 and the blocking behavior of nps was inhibited compared with the single nps without c60 figs s12 and s13 this result demonstrated that the effect of nps 5 ppm did not completely dominate the transport and retention of binary suspension in other words the cotransport behavior of different colloids might depend on the proportion of each component in binary suspension a low mass ratio of nps c60 1 10 was set to test the hypothesis fig s13a shows that ripening an increasing deposition rate with time occurred in the transport of nps c60 mixture and this observation was similar to the transport of single c60 fig 3c rather than the corresponding nps 1 5 ppm at 35 psu fig s12a although the mobility of c60 was partly enhanced by the nps copresence fig 4c the effect was weaker than that at a high mass concentration ratio 1 and 1 3 of nps c60 this condition can be explained by the surface electrical property and heteroaggregation of nps c60 suspension afrooz et al 2016 godinez and darnault 2011 1 the ζ potential at a ratio of 1 10 became less negative 13 29 0 33 mv or close to the value 10 27 0 51 mv of single c60 2 the heteroaggregate size of nps c60 increased progressively over time and the aggregation profile fig 2b was similar to that of single c60 suspension fig s6d a similar result has been reported in other studies peng et al 2017 syngouna et al 2017 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 similarly syngouna et al 2017 observed that the copresence of bacteria decreased the transport and increased the deposition of tio2 nanoparticles in columns due to heteroaggregation the retention of large heteroaggregates would narrow the pore throat and cause additional deposition of colloids at the nps c60 ratio of 1 10 the part of the primary heteroaggregate nanohybrids of nps c60 is further bridged together by c60 to form large clusters or secondary heteroaggregates feng et al 2017 this outcome was supported by the result of ddls fig 2b additionally the larger hetero aggregates were observed on the sand surface at the nps c60 ratio of 1 3 fig 5c and 1 10 fig 5d therefore the cotransport and coretention of nps c60 were remarkably dependent on the mass concentration ratio of nps c60 fig s16 presents the btcs and retention profiles of binary suspension in 3 5 psu seawater the result showed that the mec and meff of binary suspension were 0 61 and 50 19 at 3 5 psu table 1 respectively these values were obviously higher than those 0 33 and 27 67 at 35 psu table 1 suggesting the enhanced transport of colloids in the sea sand column as the solution salinity decreased this trend was consistent with the decrease in colloid sand electrostatic interactions bradford et al 2007 as the salinity decreased from 35 psu to 3 5 psu the ζ potential of the colloids and the sand decreased from 19 09 0 53 mv to 29 43 0 56 mv table 1 and from 10 01 1 45 mv to 26 62 0 91 mv table s1 respectively unlike the hetero aggregates 287 01 11 12 nm at 35psu fig 2b ddls of monodisperse colloids i e nps and c60 in mixture suspension only valued 193 57 4 82 nm at 3 5 psu fig 2d the small colloidal size can result in a high mobility of mixture suspension in porous media because of the decline of straining bradford et al 2003 shen et al 2008 at 3 5 psu btcs and rps of individual c60 fig s16 in binary suspension almost coincided with these of nps in both single fig 3a and binary suspension fig s16 rather than these of c60 in single suspension fig 3c suggesting that the mobility of c60 was facilitated by nps similar as the phenomenon at 35 psu however the heteroaggregation of nps and c60 did not occur at 3 5 psu and the carrier migration was not the primary mechanism of the cotransport of nps and c60 at 3 5 psu the ζ potential of c60 in the presence of nps was 29 43 0 56 mv which was close to that 34 42 0 71 mv of nps but was more negative than that 20 02 0 69 mv of c60 without nps therefore we speculated that the strong electrostatic repulsion between c60 and sand is the primary cause for the facilitated transport in column experiments at 3 5 psu bradford et al 2007 gentile and fidalgo de cortalezzi 2016 in di water 0 psu the breakthrough of binary suspension reached essentially 100 within a few pv fig s17 likewise this phenomenon was observed in individual nps and c60 therefore discussing the cotransport and retention of binary suspension is meaningless 4 conclusions the interaction between nps and nonplastic engineered nanoparticles e g c60 could occur because they are prevalent in marine environments in our work the mass concentration ratio of nps c60 and aquatic chemistry considerably affected their aggregation and cotransport at a high nps c60 ratio of 1 the mobility and stability of c60 in seawater were obviously enhanced by increasing the electrostatic repulsion and forming the nps c60 nanohybrids 287 01 11 08 nm at a medium nps c60 ratio of 1 3 the large aggregates formed in binary suspension and the transport of nps was slightly depressed by c60 when the nps c60 ratio decreased to 1 10 the sedimentation aggregation and transport curves of binary suspension were similar to those of single c60 in seawater these findings demonstrated that the environmental behavior of nps and c60 significantly relies on their mass concentration ratio additionally seawater salinity intensely influenced the colloidal stability and the associated transport as the salinity decreased from 35 psu to 3 5 psu nps were anticipated to be resistant to heteroaggregation with c60 because of the increase in the primary maximum energy from 7 8 kbt to 98 6 kbt with the input of nps with the other nonplastic nanocolloids from rivers to estuaries coastal regions and then to deep sea environments the growing heteroaggregates would occur they would accumulate and partially transport to superficial marine sediments conflicts of interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science

19218,nanoplastics nps have been identified as newly emerging particulate contaminants in marine environments the interaction between nps and other engineered nanoparticles remains unknown this study investigated the cotransport of nps with fullerene c60 in seawater saturated columns packed with natural sand as affected by the mass concentration ratio of nps c60 and the hydrochemical characteristics in seawater with 35 practical salinity units psu nps could remarkably enhance c60 dispersion with a nps c60 ratio of 1 nps behaved as a vehicle to facilitate c60 transport by decreasing colloidal ζ potential and forming stable primary heteroaggregates as the nps c60 ratio decreased to 1 3 nps mobility was progressively restrained because of the formation of large secondary aggregates when the ratio continuously decreased to 1 10 the stability and transport of colloids were governed by c60 rather than nps under this condition the transport trend of binary suspensions was similar to that of single c60 suspension which was characterized by a ripening phenomenon seawater salinity is another key factor affecting the stability and associated transport of nps and c60 in seawater with 3 5 psu nps and c60 1 1 in binary suspension exhibited colloidal dispersion which was driven by a high energy barrier thus the profiles of the cotransport and retention of nps c60 resembled those of single nps suspension this work demonstrated that the cotransport of nps c60 strongly depended on their mass concentration ratios and seawater salinity graphical abstract image 1

mattsson et al 2015 ma et al 2016 liu et al 2018 the aggregation transport and retention of nps in aqueous environments are commonly influenced by the ionic strength of solutions and other coexisting

nacl xu et al 2013 which is consistent with derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory to clearly understand the fate of nps in marine sediment environments with porous media we should investigate

low to medium ionic strength conditions bradford et al 2002 2003 2007 quevedo and tufenkji 2012 dong et al 2018 further demonstrated that the transport of nps was strongly inhibited in seawater saturated sand these studies have revealed that a decrease in the mobility of nps is closely associated with the increase in ionic strength and nps size and the decline in the homogeneity of porous media additionally nps transport is intricately connected to other artificially produced nanoparticle matrices in seawater alimi et al 2018 afrooz et al 2016 however the stabilization and transport of

that the transport of heterogeneous mixtures is more complex than that of individual ones xu et al 2017a cai et al 2013 liu et al 2017 syngouna et al 2017 for example hydrochars elicit a negligible effect on the mobility of nsio2 at salinities of 100 and 200 mm nacl but can significantly increase the transportability of nsio2 at 300 mm nacl liu et al 2017 however few studies have addressed the

because of the formation of large nps hetero aggregates with go peng et al 2017 this finding suggests that the cotransport of nps with a secondary particulate entity depends on the ionic strengths of

accelerating channeling of vertical transport movement alimi et al 2018 quevedo and tufenkji 2012 therefore further investigations should be performed to determine the exact mechanism of emerging nps

polystyrene sphere served as a nps model because polystyrene is one of the commodity plastics with the largest volume in a wide range of applications andrady and neal 2009 kim et al 2017 sussarellu et al 2016 buckminsterfullerene a type of fullerene with the formula c60 was selected as a representative manufactured nanomaterial because of its potential toxicity attributed to photochemical transformation to marine organisms e g mytilus edulis in coastal areas yang et al 2013 alsubiai and naser 2011 the hetero aggregation profiles of single nanoparticle nps or c60 and binary particles with a variable mass ratio of nps c60 were monitored in fresh brackish and sea water with salinities of 0 3 5 and 35 psu respectively their breakthrough curves btcs and retention profiles rps were obtained in a packed column with natural sea sand the mechanisms controlling the cotransport behavior of nps with c60 were proposed and discussed this study provided information to elucidate the influences of coexisting nanoparticles on the environmental behavior of nps which could be used as a basis for the assessment of the ecological fate of nps in marine environments 2 experimental material and methods 2 1 material the natural sea sand was obtained from the seafloor of pingtan strait fujian province china the sand preparation is presented in the supplementary material the average grain size of the sand was 0 45 0 03 mm table s1 through measured laser scattering particle size distribution analysis la 960 horiba ltd japan the porosity of the sand was 44 88 table s1 klute 1986 the morphological property of the sands was fig s1 determined with a scanning electron microscope sem nanosem 450 fei usa fluorescent nanopolystyrene spheres with a diameter of 200 nm were purchased from shanghai huge biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the spheres just have trace amount of surface carboxyl groups 30 μmol g for stable suspension in aqueous solution the datum was provided by the supplier and was determined by conductometric titrations fullerene c60 was obtained from aladdin reagent company shanghai china and had a declared purity of 99 9 wt c60 stock suspension was prepared using a previously developed solvent exchange method zhang et al 2012 aich et al 2016 the detailed procedures are given in the supplementary material the structure and composition of nps and c60 fig s2 was determined via a fourier transform infrared nicolet 5700 thermo america artificial seawater salinity 35 psu table s2 was prepared by dissolving various salts with fresh water in accordance with the methods proposed by kester et al 1967 low salinity seawaters 3 5 psu were obtained by diluting them with deionized water salinity 0 psu 2 2 properties of nps and c60 the zeta potential size morphology sedimentation and dlvo calculation of nps and c60 in various solutions are listed in the supplementary material 2 3 column transport experiments the column transport experiments of nps c60 and nps c60 were conducted with natural sea sand saturated with artificial seawater of different salinities the experimental conditions are showed in details in table 1 the sands were wetly packed into glass columns 1 cm inner diameter 10 cm length with 50 μm stainless steel screens on both ends to avoid sand loss each column had an average length of 9 00 0 20 cm and contained approximately 11 50 0 10 g of sand dry weight before the transport experiment was started the column was rinsed with 100 ml background solution to reach saturation at a flow of 2 20 0 10 ml min meanwhile the column was tapped with a rubber mallet to exhaust small bubbles the transport of conservative tracer pentafluorobenzoic acid pfba is provided in the supplementary material the suspension single particle or binary particles was temporarily prepared before the column experiments were performed and then sonicated using an ultrasonic cleaner sk3200hp kudos china to obtain the well dispersion systems the influent was successively pumped into the column from a 500 ml glass beaker for 40 min finally the background solution was pumped into the column for 10 min until no nanoparticle was detectable 2 in the effluent shown in the pre experiment the effluent samples were collected in glass vials every 2 min nearly 1 47 pore volumes pv to determine the concentrations of nps and c60 during transport the rps were obtained immediately after column transport experiments were performed approximately 1 cm thick increments were carefully excluded and then the sand was transferred into 50 ml vials with 25 ml deionized water the mixtures were shaken for 60 min to remobilize the nanoparticles from the sand surface similar methods have been used in other studies to detach the nanoparticle from the sand surface sun et al 2015 jiang et al 2012 the supernatant was collected to determine the concentration of remobilized nanoparticles to visually describe the retention of nps and c60 in sand columns the sand samples at the inlet of the column were collected to measure their morphology via sem s4800 hitachi japan column experiments were performed more than thrice to enhance the result reliability and the data were presented as mean the mass balance information i e the mass percentages recovered from effluent sand and total is shown in table 1 the detection of the concentrations of nps and c60 is given in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of nps and c60 in single suspension fig s6 shows the effect of varying solution salinity and nps mass concentration on the sedimentation of the suspension in deionized water 0 psu the ratio of solution mass concentration to initial mass concentration c c0 of nps remained constant 0 98 for 40 min as the salinity increased from 3 5 psu to 35 psu c c0 gradually decreased this result was consistent with previous findings that high ionic strength can cause a decrease in suspension stability xu et al 2017b xiao et al 2017 although the zeta potential of nps increased from 37 72 0 11 mv to 20 29 0 42 mv as the salinity increased from 0 psu to 35 psu table 1 the hydrodynamic diameters ddls of nps remained lower than 230 nm which was close to its initial size 200 nm fig s6b the stability of nps in seawater was attributed to strong electrostatic repulsion and the presence of energy barrier between nps and nps fig s7 fig s6b suggests that the variation in the mass concentration of nps has a negligible effect on nps aggregation at 35 psu the sedimentation and homoaggregation of c60 figs s6c and d were more sensitive to salinity variation than those of nps figs s6a and b when the salinity increased from 0 psu to 3 5psu the c c0 of c60 in the supernatant decreased from 0 97 to 0 87 fig s6c indicating that c60 aggregates readily settled in high salinity water the average ddls of c60 during 40 min increased from 118 02 1 95 nm to 149 69 9 21 nm with the increase of salinity from 0 psu to 3 5 psu the size of c60 remained relatively stable fig s6d suggesting that c60 was well dispersed in 3 5 psu water previous studies demonstrated that the critical coagulation concentration of c60 is 120 mmol l nacl chen and elimelech 2006 zhang et al 2013 at 3 5 psu approximately 50 mmol l nacl the large c60 particles might form because of their self assembly and aggregation fig s8a in 35 psu seawater the large aggregate structure appeared as evidenced by the tem images of c60 fig 1 a and the rapid increase of ddls of c60 from 201 21 nm to 639 43 nm during 40 min fig s6d this result could be attributed to the significant decrease of electrostatic repulsion zhang et al 2013 the ζ potentials of c60 at 0 3 5 and 35 psu were 27 41 1 02 20 02 0 69 and 10 27 0 51 mv table 1 respectively less negatively charged particles causes a reduction of repulsive energy between c60 and c60 in our study the total interfacial interaction energies between c60 clusters at different salinities were estimated in accordance with dlvo theory to further illustrate the aggregation mechanism fig 1c at 3 5 psu the energy barrier of c60 was 18 6 kbt in seawater 35 psu the energy barrier disappeared because a decrease in electrostatic double layer interaction results in the complete dominance of van der waals interaction aich et al 2016 xu et al 2017b 3 2 properties of nps and c60 in binary suspension the sedimentation curve and aggregation of nps and c60 in 35 psu seawater are determined and presented in fig 2 when nps and c60 were mixed at a mass concentration ratio of 1 c c0 of mixture suspension decreased to 0 89 at 40 min fig 2a and was slightly less than that 0 91 of single nps suspension fig s6a suggesting that nps dominated the stability of binary particle suspension the ζ potential of nps c60 was 19 09 0 53 mv which was similar to that 20 29 0 42 mv of nps without c60 and twice than that of c60 in single suspension 10 27 0 51 mv table 1 thus the strong electrostatic force inhibited the sedimentation of c60 wang et al 2015b the ddls of nps c60 particles was relatively stable at 287 01 11 08 nm average value of 0 min 40 min which was more than that of single nps 226 33 3 39 nm in seawater fig s6b by contrast c60 in single suspension was unstable the size of c60 aggregates rose steadily figs 1a and s6d the tem image of nps c60 suspension showed that the particles were polydisperse and mainly spherical with slight angular features in binary suspension instead of regular microspheres with a smooth surface of the particles in the nps suspension fig 1b obviously c60 was attached to single nps and formed stable nps c60 nanohybrids primary heteroaggregates this results indicated that heteroaggregation between nps and c60 might occur in binary suspensions according to dlvo theory the primary maximum energy between nps and c60 in seawater was 7 8 kbt fig 1d which was lower than that 5 5 kbt between nps and nps in seawater fig s7 and this lower value contributed to the formation of nps c60 heteroaggregation wang et al 2015b the similar ζ potential in single nps and binary nps c60 resulted in the almost equal eclectic force the van der waals forces rather than the electrical force between nps and c60 might cause the heteroaggregation wang et al 2015a dusak et al 2015 additionally π π interactions could typically occur between nps aromatic rings and c60 aromatic rings similar mechanism of heteroaggregation has been reported in previous findings wang et al 2015a chen and elimelech 2008 wu et al 2012 as the ratio of nps c60 decreased from 1 to 1 3 and 1 10 the effect of nps on the stability of binary suspension gradually weakened the sedimentation curves indicated that c c0 of binary suspension decreased from 0 89 to 0 86 and 0 82 fig 2a the results were consistent with the observation in nps c60 aggregation experiments fig 2b at low nps c60 ratio 1 3 and 1 10 ddls of the particles in binary suspension gradually increased over time possibly because of two mechanisms of nps c60 aggregation including homoaggregation and heteroaggregation 1 the mass concentration ratio of individual ingredients determines the overall surface charge of colloid in binary suspension wang et al 2015a the decrease in nps c60 ratio triggered the reduction of electrostatic repulsion because of the increase in ζ potential less negative of binary suspension table 1 thereby resulting into the formation of larger c60 homoaggregates 2 nps were fully shielded with c60 and the large clusters secondary heteroaggregates were produced by bridging the primary heteroaggregates with c60 because of the predominant c60 in the number of particles which could be supported by tem fig s8b yi et al 2015 huynh et al 2012 fig 2c shows that the stability of binary suspension was significantly enhanced as the solution salinity decreased ddls of binary suspension was 189 48 6 12 and 193 57 4 82 nm at 3 5 and 0 psu respectively fig 2d these values were between those of nps and c60 in single suspension figs s6b and d furthermore the tem image revealed that both nps and c60 were monodispersed at 3 5 psu fig s8d in contrast to nanohybrids at 35 psu fig 1b because the primary maximum energy increased from 7 8 kbt at 35 psu to 98 6 kbt at 3 5 psu fig 1d therefore the possibility of the formation of the heteroaggregates in the sample during drying on the tem grid could be ruled out at 35 psu chen and elimelech 2007 as the salinity continously declined from 3 5 to 0 psu the ζ potential of nps c60 decreased from 29 43 0 56 mv to 34 31 0 45 mv table 1 causing a strong electrostatic repulsion between nps and c60 xiao et al 2017 therefore the heteroaggregation resulting from the van der waals force and π π interactions at 35 psu was completely inhibited at a low salinity 3 5 and 0 psu wang et al 2015b 3 3 transport and retention of single nps and c60 one dimensional column experiments were conducted to assess nps and c60 transport and retention in natural sea sand our preliminary experiment showed that c60 hetero aggregation with or without nps in suspension cannot influence the input concentration of nanoparticles during transport experiments because of the continuous flow via a bump fig s9 this finding suggested that the relative mass concentration was consistent 0 95 1 02 in the column experiments the total mass percentage recovery in the column experiments ranged from 86 96 to 108 03 table 1 the btcs of all of the colloids could reach the column outlet and disappear slightly behind the conservative tracer of pfba fig s10 indicating that size exclusion and detachment can be negligible in this work kasel et al 2013 babakhani et al 2017 fig 3 presents the btcs and rps of 15 ppm nps and 15 ppm c60 at different salinities of 35 3 5 and 0 psu in seawater 35 psu the transport of nps and c60 through the saturated natural sand column was remarkably inhibited with low maximum effluent concentrations mecs 0 31 for nps and 0 23 for c60 intriguingly the btcs of nps and c60 presented different shapes in 35 psu seawater fig 3a and c the btcs of nps had a rising asymmetric plateau without tailing and this finding was considered as a clear sign of a site blocking phenomenon sun et al 2015 babakhani et al 2017 it is due to a gradually increasing occupancy of the retention location on the sand surface with the colloidal particles that is previously retained nps particles can block retention sites on grain surfaces resulting in a deposition decline bradford et al 2002 sun et al 2015 this phenomenon was demostrated by the sem images of the detached nps on sand surface fig s11a the btcs of c60 exhibited a ripening behavior or a dropping plateau that is an increasing rate of deposition with time ripening would occur as nanoparticles aggregated agglomerated in the aqueous phase and the attached or immobilized phase babakhani et al 2017 fig s11b evidenced that a great number of c60 aggregates were on the sand surface the increased particle size of c60 in influent decreased the mobility of nanoparticles in the column wang et al 2012a it is because that the volume of void space accessible by colloids decreases with the increase of the particle size of colloids therefore c60 aggregates could not enter pore spaces with opening smaller than their size chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 moreover ripening arises from the interactions of previously depositing particles on the sand surface thereby offering a rough morphology and several attachment sites and consequently leading to the multilayer accumulation of the particles on the collector surface babakhani et al 2017 physical straining may be a key process of colloid retention in columns babakhani et al 2017 fig 3b and d shows the notable hyper exponential trend of nps and c60 retention profiles in seawater this condition might indicate that straining occurred in columns at a high salinity babakhani et al 2017 although the ratio of the average particle diameter i e nps to sand diameter dp ds of 0 0005 table 1 is approximately one order of magnitude lower than the threshold values 0 002 0 003 bradford et al 2007 babakhani et al 2017 the threshold value would decrease as the solution salinity increases bradford et al 2007 su et al 2017 shen et al 2008 bridging may be another mechanism to enhance the straining of nonaggregated colloids at a high salinity babakhani et al 2017 it caused the pore throats which were initially wider than the colloidal size to gradually narrow via nps deposition therefore the deposited nps was captured similarly mitropoulou et al 2013 demonstrated that the physical straining was a key process during the transport of nps in porous media under a wide range of ionic strength 0 1 1000 mm nacl as the solution salinity decreased from 35 psu to 3 5 psu the transportability of both nps and c60 increased and the mecs of nps and c60 increased to 0 59 and 0 33 respectively fig 3a and b because the surface charge of colloid and sand increased with the decline of solution salinity according to dlvo zhang et al 2012 at 3 5 psu the ζ potentials of nps c60 and sand were 34 42 0 71 20 02 0 69 and 26 62 0 91 mv which were more negative than those 19 82 0 24 10 27 0 51 and 10 01 1 45 mv at 35 psu respectively tables 1 and s1 resulting in a strong electrostatic repulsion between the colloid nps and c60 and the sand zhang et al 2012 ripening was completely suppressed and the btc of c60 at 3 5 psu exhibited a blocking phenomenon which was similar to the btc of nps fig 3c on one hand the negative ζ potential of c60 causes an increase in the repulsive energy barrier between the colloid and the sand attached colloids dong et al 2018 on the other hand the size of c60 retained a stable value of 149 71 9 19 nm resulting in high mobility kasel et al 2013 meanwhile the small size c60 aggregates were observed on the sand surface at 3 5 psu fig s11c by contrast the large c60 aggregates occurred at 35 psu fig s11b in deionized water the ζ potentials of sand c60 and nps were 33 21 1 19 27 41 1 02 and 37 72 0 11 mv respectively tables 1 and s1 therefore the strong electrostatic repulsive force between the nps and the sand resulted in a complete breakthrough additional column experiments were performed to investigate the influence of nps input concentrations fig s12 indicates that the mec and the mass effluent percentage from the effluent meff of nps decreased from 0 31 to 0 23 and from 26 22 to 22 03 respectively as c0 decreased from 15 ppm to 1 5 ppm table 1 the btc shape at the lowest c0 1 5 ppm was flat indicating that the blocking behavior gradually weakened similar observations have been systematically explored and explained in other reports on colloid transport in porous media sun et al 2015 kasel et al 2013 liang et al 2013 3 4 cotransport and coretention of nps and c60 fig s13 presents the btcs and corresponding rps of binary suspension in 35 psu seawater when the mass concentration ratio of nps c60 was equal to 1 the btc of the mixtures fig s13a differed from that of the single c60 fig 3c but closely resembled the shape of the single nps breakthrough curve fig 3a the observed resemblances suggested that nps might absolutely dominate the mobility of the mixtures in the column the individual concentrations of nps and c60 in binary suspension were measured to further describe their cotransport behavior and their btcs and rps are presented in fig 4 the btcs of nps with and without c60 in sea sand almost completely overlapped fig s14 the mobility of c60 with nps was similar to the transport of single nps and remarkably greater than that of single c60 without nps these observations demonstrated that the copresence of nps in mixture suspensions could enhance the mobility of c60 in sand in seawater systems the competition of deposition sites is an important mechanism to explain the transport enhancement one type of colloid can initially adsorb onto the porous media and then block the sites for the deposition of another colloid thereby promoting the latter transport in porous media cai et al 2013 han et al 2016 an additional transport experiment was conducted to obtain the btcs of c60 in pre equilibrating the columns at 85 ml of nps and to verify this hypothesis a negligible release of nps was observed on the sand surface during c60 injection fig s15 if the coexisting nps induced competition in the column the deposition sites in the pre equilibrating column with nps suspension would be preferentially occupied by nps thereby creating few sites available for c60 deposition nevertheless the results showed that the btcs fig s15 of c60 in pre equilibration experiments were practically similar to those of c60 without pre equilibration fig 3c sem image further demostrates that many c60 aggregates were around the pre deposited nps on the sand surface fig 5 a therefore the increased transport of c60 observed in the presence of nps was not due to the deposition competition of nps according to dlvo theory the alteration of zeta potential affects colloid transport in porous media shen et al 2008 hoek and agarwal 2006 c60 in the presence of nps exhibited more negative zeta potentials 19 09 0 53 mv than it did in the absence of nps 10 27 0 51 mv resulting in the great electrostatic repulsive action between c60 and sand in addition the presence of nps would change the aggregation agglomeration status of c60 at 35 psu the disappearance of large c60 aggregates figs 2b and s6d probably enhances the mobility of c60 suspension wang et al 2012b previous studies also demonstrated that large particles coexisting in suspensions may act as mobile carriers for small particles thereby facilitating the transport of the latter in porous media cai et al 2013 han et al 2016 fig 2b illustrates that the primary heteroaggregate of nps c60 with a stable particle size of 287 01 11 08 nm in 35 psu seawater the nps c60 heteroaggregates were observed on the sand surface and the c60 agglomerates did not occur fig 5b thus the transport of these heteroaggregate particles might also be one of the mechanisms of cotransport nps and c60 in columns in seawater systems the effects of mass ratio and aquatic chemistry on cotransport and coretention were further explored when the mass concentration ratio nps c60 decreased from 1 to 1 3 by decreasing the nps concentration from 15 ppm to 5 ppm meff of the mixtures decreased from 27 67 to 24 38 table 1 this result might be due to the enhancement of physical straining in the porous medium because of the heteroaggregate size at a ratio of 1 3 which is larger than that at a ratio of 1 fig 2b bradford et al 2007 the increasing pattern of the plateau of btc at a ratio of 1 3 was obviously depressed compared with that at a ratio of 1 indicating that the blocking effect gradually faded at the ratio of 1 3 the ζ potential became less negative 15 72 0 32 mv consequently the electrostatic repulsion between the subsequent colloids and colloids attached to the sand surface decreases and inhibits the blocking effect xia et al 2015 at the ratio of 1 3 the low mass concentration 5 ppm nps might be one reason for the high retention of binary suspension because a decrease in input concentrations can restrain the transport of colloids kasel et al 2013 however the mec 0 24 of individual nps 5 ppm in cotransport experiments was slightly lower than that of single nps 0 28 and the blocking behavior of nps was inhibited compared with the single nps without c60 figs s12 and s13 this result demonstrated that the effect of nps 5 ppm did not completely dominate the transport and retention of binary suspension in other words the cotransport behavior of different colloids might depend on the proportion of each component in binary suspension a low mass ratio of nps c60 1 10 was set to test the hypothesis fig s13a shows that ripening an increasing deposition rate with time occurred in the transport of nps c60 mixture and this observation was similar to the transport of single c60 fig 3c rather than the corresponding nps 1 5 ppm at 35 psu fig s12a although the mobility of c60 was partly enhanced by the nps copresence fig 4c the effect was weaker than that at a high mass concentration ratio 1 and 1 3 of nps c60 this condition can be explained by the surface electrical property and heteroaggregation of nps c60 suspension afrooz et al 2016 godinez and darnault 2011 1 the ζ potential at a ratio of 1 10 became less negative 13 29 0 33 mv or close to the value 10 27 0 51 mv of single c60 2 the heteroaggregate size of nps c60 increased progressively over time and the aggregation profile fig 2b was similar to that of single c60 suspension fig s6d a similar result has been reported in other studies peng et al 2017 syngouna et al 2017 vasiliadou and chrysikopoulos 2011 similarly syngouna et al 2017 observed that the copresence of bacteria decreased the transport and increased the deposition of tio2 nanoparticles in columns due to heteroaggregation the retention of large heteroaggregates would narrow the pore throat and cause additional deposition of colloids at the nps c60 ratio of 1 10 the part of the primary heteroaggregate nanohybrids of nps c60 is further bridged together by c60 to form large clusters or secondary heteroaggregates feng et al 2017 this outcome was supported by the result of ddls fig 2b additionally the larger hetero aggregates were observed on the sand surface at the nps c60 ratio of 1 3 fig 5c and 1 10 fig 5d therefore the cotransport and coretention of nps c60 were remarkably dependent on the mass concentration ratio of nps c60 fig s16 presents the btcs and retention profiles of binary suspension in 3 5 psu seawater the result showed that the mec and meff of binary suspension were 0 61 and 50 19 at 3 5 psu table 1 respectively these values were obviously higher than those 0 33 and 27 67 at 35 psu table 1 suggesting the enhanced transport of colloids in the sea sand column as the solution salinity decreased this trend was consistent with the decrease in colloid sand electrostatic interactions bradford et al 2007 as the salinity decreased from 35 psu to 3 5 psu the ζ potential of the colloids and the sand decreased from 19 09 0 53 mv to 29 43 0 56 mv table 1 and from 10 01 1 45 mv to 26 62 0 91 mv table s1 respectively unlike the hetero aggregates 287 01 11 12 nm at 35psu fig 2b ddls of monodisperse colloids i e nps and c60 in mixture suspension only valued 193 57 4 82 nm at 3 5 psu fig 2d the small colloidal size can result in a high mobility of mixture suspension in porous media because of the decline of straining bradford et al 2003 shen et al 2008 at 3 5 psu btcs and rps of individual c60 fig s16 in binary suspension almost coincided with these of nps in both single fig 3a and binary suspension fig s16 rather than these of c60 in single suspension fig 3c suggesting that the mobility of c60 was facilitated by nps similar as the phenomenon at 35 psu however the heteroaggregation of nps and c60 did not occur at 3 5 psu and the carrier migration was not the primary mechanism of the cotransport of nps and c60 at 3 5 psu the ζ potential of c60 in the presence of nps was 29 43 0 56 mv which was close to that 34 42 0 71 mv of nps but was more negative than that 20 02 0 69 mv of c60 without nps therefore we speculated that the strong electrostatic repulsion between c60 and sand is the primary cause for the facilitated transport in column experiments at 3 5 psu bradford et al 2007 gentile and fidalgo de cortalezzi 2016 in di water 0 psu the breakthrough of binary suspension reached essentially 100 within a few pv fig s17 likewise this phenomenon was observed in individual nps and c60 therefore discussing the cotransport and retention of binary suspension is meaningless 4 conclusions the interaction between nps and nonplastic engineered nanoparticles e g c60 could occur because they are prevalent in marine environments in our work the mass concentration ratio of nps c60 and aquatic chemistry considerably affected their aggregation and cotransport at a high nps c60 ratio of 1 the mobility and stability of c60 in seawater were obviously enhanced by increasing the electrostatic repulsion and forming the nps c60 nanohybrids 287 01 11 08 nm at a medium nps c60 ratio of 1 3 the large aggregates formed in binary suspension and the transport of nps was slightly depressed by c60 when the nps c60 ratio decreased to 1 10 the sedimentation aggregation and transport curves of binary suspension were similar to those of single c60 in seawater these findings demonstrated that the environmental behavior of nps and c60 significantly relies on their mass concentration ratio additionally seawater salinity intensely influenced the colloidal stability and the associated transport as the salinity decreased from 35 psu to 3 5 psu nps were anticipated to be resistant to heteroaggregation with c60 because of the increase in the primary maximum energy from 7 8 kbt to 98 6 kbt with the input of nps with the other nonplastic nanocolloids from rivers to estuaries coastal regions and then to deep sea environments the growing heteroaggregates would occur they would accumulate and partially transport to superficial marine sediments conflicts of interest there are no conflicts to declare acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science

recovered batch tests were performed in the reactor at different conditions to understand the experimental results an existing one dimensional biofilm model was used to simulate batch tests and theoretically assess the impact of stratification dissolved oxygen do and short term effects of temperature on time course concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate this theoretical assessment served to develop an experimental methodology for the evaluation of in situ batch tests in the partial nitritation reactor these batch tests proved to be a powerful tool to easily monitor the extent of stratification of nitrifier guilds in granular sludge and to determine the required bulk ammonium concentration to minimize nitrite oxidation when nitrifier guilds were stratified in the granular

demonstrated feasible at temperatures from 20 to 10 c and low c n ratios or without organic carbon isanta et al 2015 poot et al 2016 reino et al 2016 as well as adequate anammox performance at these conditions lotti et al 2014 reino et al 2018 main advantages of a two stage pn a removal processes are i control strategies for nob repression can be applied separately in the pn reactor and ii the separation of pn a and anammox processes avoids competition between amx and nob for nitrite two stage processes have been recently highlighted as a possible solution for attaining stable pn avoiding nob proliferation even at the unfavourable mainstream municipal wastewater treatment conditions hendrickx et al 2012 ma et al 2011 pérez et al 2015 at temperatures below 20 c the maximum specific growth rate μmax of nob is higher than that of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob hellinga et al 1998 hunik et al 1994 so it seems much more challenging to repress nob at these conditions currently strategies to control nob proliferation are based on the general assumption that nob have lower affinity for oxygen than aob liu and wang 2013 pérez et al 2009 thus operation at low dissolved oxygen do concentration has been commonly adopted as a strategy to accumulate nitrite blackburne et al 2008 sliekers et al 2002 third et al 2001 winkler et al 2011 however nob oxygen affinity reported in literature varies among different genera nowka et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 reino et al 2016 on top of that a recent study highlighted that colony size of nitrifying organisms in the sludge flocs or biofilm determines the apparent oxygen affinity picioreanu et al 2016 thus the intrinsic oxygen affinity which is strain dependent will overall play a minor role picioreanu et al 2016 another strategy that has been highlighted for successful nob repression is to control the ratio of oxygen to ammonium concentration bartrolí et al 2010 isanta et al 2015 reino et al 2016 short term effects of the bulk do ammonium ratio on the nitrate production were studied previously in poot et al 2016 the study was carried out with the same granular sludge pn reactor used in the present study stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular biofilm with aob dominated outer shell was reported at 20 c with a minimum ammonium effluent concentration of 2 5 mg n nh4 l for a dissolved oxygen concentration lower than 4 mg o2 l poot et al 2016 therefore for a given do concentration if enough ammonium was available the external aob layer would completely exhaust oxygen whereas nob occupying inner layers could not oxidise nitrite because of oxygen limitation however when residual ammonium concentration was too low below 2 5 mg n nh4 l the growth rate of aob slowed down resulting in less oxygen consumption by aob and more oxygen was available for nob which proliferated poot et al 2016 previous studies focused on the influence of residual ammonium on nob repression in long term operation isanta et al 2015 reino et al 2016 poot et al 2016 focused on the short term effect of residual ammonium at 20 c where the advantage on growth rate of aob compared to nob is rather small hellinga et al 1998 hunik et al 1994 here the residual ammonium concentration required for efficient nob repression was investigated at 15 c at this temperature nob were shown to exhibit a higher maximum specific growth rate than aob hellinga et al 1998 hunik et al 1994 the question remains if at 15 c the stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge persists despite the disadvantage of aob in terms of maximum specific growth rate the aim of this study was to further understand what are the key operating parameters and their specific roles in order to maintain stable pn thus numerical simulations were run with a biofilm model to assess how stratification do and temperature impact the stability of partial nitritation in a granular sludge airlift reactor an ad hoc methodology involving in situ batch tests was developed based on the simulations to investigate how nob repression is affected by i ammonium concentration ii temperature in the range 15 20 c iii do and iv stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge fish analysis of pottered and cryosectioned granules was used to correlate population dynamics and spatial distribution of aob and nob in the granular sludge with the operation and batch tests results 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor continuous operation an airlift reactor with 1 5l working volume performing partial nitrification was operated from day 0 153 inoculum start up and part of the operational period at 20 c were described in a previous paper poot et al 2016 to clarify that the reactor had been operating stable at 20 c phase v of the already published data poot et al 2016 was included as days 23 to 1 fig 1 a break is included to indicate that the reactor was stopped and moved to a new building the influent flow rate was controlled manually to keep an ammonium to oxygen ratio in the effluent adequate for partial nitritation as described previously bartrolí et al 2010 isanta et al 2015 pérez et al 2015 do and ph were followed online but not controlled air flow rate was regulated fig 1c with a mass flow controller 2 l min capacity brooks the netherlands temperature was controlled and regulated between 20 and 15 c with an external jacket the reactor ph was rather constant at 7 7 0 05 throughout the continuous operation period 2 2 wastewater synthetic wastewater was used with the same composition as

solution was adjusted to 6 to avoid precipitation with solid naoh 2 3 modelling study a previously developed mathematical model pérez et al 2014 was slightly modified in the present study to theoretically evaluate the key mechanisms impacting nob repression in a granular biofilm performing nitritation the model was used to simulate batch tests the simulations aimed to characterize the time course concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and dissolved oxygen do during a batch test when imposing either stratified or mixed nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge nitrate nitrite ammonium and oxygen were considered as soluble compounds particulate species were aob nob and inert biomass an average granule diameter of 1 mm and a biomass concentration of 1gvss l were used in the modelling study aquasim v 2 1d was used as simulation platform the model description equations and stoichiometric matrix can be found in supplementary information tables s1 s3 to study the impact of the stratification of nitrifier guilds the distribution of particulate species in the biofilm was imposed to represent two opposite scenarios i stratification of nitrifier guilds with aob dominating the external shell and nob in the inner layers as previously reported by poot et al 2016 see also fig 2 a ii mixed nitrifier guilds with aob and nob coexisting in the same biofilm layers fig 2b the chosen biomass profiles for the stratification of nitrifier guilds aimed to investigate how stratification of nitrifier guilds impacts the rates of ammonium oxidation and nitrate production during a batch test for the simulation of a batch test the initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations were assumed equal to 25 mg n l a constant aeration was set to obtain an initial do concentration of 3 mg o2 l or 2 mg o2 l in one of the simulations temperature was set to either 20 or 15 c depending on the simulation fig 3 which affects maximum specific growth rates and decay rates see equations s1 s4 2 3 1 effect of kinetics stoichiometry since the process is operated under oxygen limitation the key parameter to be taken into account to assess competition between aob and nob is the maximum oxygen respiration rate qo2max yo2 μmax this lumps the effect of maximum specific growth rate μmax affected by temperature with stoichiometry for oxygen oxygen yield see table 1 to assess the effect of the kinetics and stoichiometry assumed for aob and nob in the simulations additional simulations were run in three scenarios i same fitness with nob having the same kinetics than that of aob i e same maximum specific growth rate same half saturation coefficients and same oxygen yield therefore qo2max aob qo2max nob ii same kinetics i e same maximum specific growth rate same half saturation coefficients iii same maximum specific growth rate where the maximum specific growth rate of nob was set equal to that of aob fig s1 see details of the parameters used for each scenario in table 1 2 4 in situ batch tests along with following the reactor performance during continuous operation in situ batch tests were performed in the pn granular air lift reactor batch tests aimed to assess the impact of variable ammonium nitrite and nitrate on the ammonium and nitrite oxidation rates the experiments were carried out at different do concentrations and temperatures as done previously in the simulations to assess the impact of these variables on nob repression and the stratification of the nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge continuous operation was stopped by switching off the feeding pump temporarily while the batch experiment was performed during the batch test samples were withdrawn at different times from the top section of the reactor filtered and analysed as described in section 2 5 during the tests do and ph were not automatically controlled but measured on line when exploring the effects of do air flow rate was manually adjusted to achieve the targeted values if required this manipulation of the air flow rate was carried out for batch tests on days 92 111 and 153 2 5 physicochemical analysis samples were withdrawn from the reactor and filtered for daily measurements offline analysis for ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were carried out using hach lange cuvette kits dry weight tss which refers to the total solid mass per volume of mixture in reactor and volatile suspended solids vss which was assessed by subtracting the ash content from tss were determined according to standard methods apha 2012 2 6 procedure for in situ batch test evaluation here we propose a method to analyse the batch tests experimental data specifically developed to investigate how nob repression is affected by ammonium concentration temperature do and stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge the first step in the procedure is to calculate the rates of ammonium oxidation ammonium oxidation rate rnh4 and nitrate production nitrate production rate rno3 during the continuous reactor operation see equation 1 just before starting the in situ batch test the initial rates during the batch test were calculated based on linear regression minimizing the sum of squared errors using the first two sampled measurements and the averaged initial concentration measured during continuous operation additionally a maximum nitrate production rate maximum rno3 can be calculated also by linear regression when ammonium is fully depleted with the last three sampled measurements using the calculated rno3 during continuous operation and the maximum rno3 when ammonium is depleted two straight lines can be drawn using equation 2 starting from the initial and final nitrate concentrations respectively on the graph the measured points deviating from those lines can be easily identified see fig s2 for an example the slope obtained with the rno3 during continuous operation indicates from which point onwards nob repression is not as efficient as it was during the continuous operation see red solid line in fig 4 the slope obtained with the maximum rno3 indicates at which time point rno3 is maximum see dashed green line in fig 4 for a better comparison of rates the specific nitrate production rate qno3 was used equation 3 in table 2 during the batch test three periods are to be highlighted see light grey white and dark grey areas respectively in fig 4 assuming a well stratified granule with aob in the outer core and nob in the inner layers the following periods can be described nitrate production during oxygen limitation due to ammonia oxidation not enough oxygen is available for nob in the inner layers because the ammonium concentration is enough for aob to consume a large fraction of the oxygen before it reaches nob layers transition period a non linear nitrate production rate is observed with lower nitrate production rates at the higher ammonium concentrations the ammonium concentration observed at the start of this period indicates the minimum residual ammonium concentration required to minimize nitrate production rate i e to efficiently repress nob see fig s2 for an example maximum nitrate production after ammonium depletion no oxygen is consumed by aob thus oxygen reaches inner layers resulting in a maximum rno3 at the do concentration applied 1 r continuous q c n out c n in v l 2 c n t i r t i t 0 c n

fluorescence in situ hybridization fish fish was performed in both pottered biomass and cryosectioned granules the aim of pottered biomass was to assess relative abundances of populations in the granule whereas cryosectioning granules aimed to locate the distribution of different populations to obtain pottered biomass granules were disrupted by pottering washed in 1xpbs 3 times pbs ph 7 2 fixed 1 h in paraformaldehyde solution 4 paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer and stored in the freezer until further use the pottered cells were put onto pre coated slides and then immersed in 50 80 and 98 ethanol for 3min each granules cryosectioning technique was performed as previously described poot et al 2016 briefly granular sludge was taken from the upper section of reactor and was suspended in 1x pbs immediately for 3 h after that the sludge was washed with 1x pbs and fixed with paraformaldehyde solution for 1 h and stored in the freezer until further use a freeze microtome leica cm1990 was used to cut the granules at 25 c to obtain slices 10 15 μm thick the obtained slices were put onto pre coated slides and then immersed in 50 ethanol for 5min and in 98 ethanol for 5 s the pottered biomass was hybridized with eub338 aobmix nobmix and ntoga1424 oligonucleotide probes while the cryosectioned granules were hybridized with eub338 aobmix and nobmix see table s4 a zeiss axioplan 2 imaging microscope an axiocam mrm camera zeiss an ebq100 lamp for fluorescent light and the axiovision software were used to analyse the images 3 results discussion 3 1 reactor continuous operation the partial nitritation granular sludge reactor was previously operated at 20 c for 214 days with an average loading rate of 0 8 g n l d poot et al 2016 the last phase of the already published data is included in the present study for convenience day 23 to 1 to show that partial nitritation was stable at 20 c fig 1 in the present study partial nitrification at 20 c was maintained from day 0 8 the effluent concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in reactor were 24 2 25 1 and 0 9 0 1 mg n l respectively indicating that approximately half of the influent ammonium was converted to nitrite by aob low nitrate effluent 1 mg n no3 l was produced so an efficient nob repression was achieved from day 9 15 low effluent ammonium concentration was targeted ca 10 mg n nh4 l by decreasing influent flow rate which led to an accumulation of small amounts of nitrate ca 2 mg n no3 l this indicates that nob were still present and active in the granular sludge fig 1 a gradual acclimation of the biomass from 20 to 15 c was achieved by decreasing the operational temperature 2 c per week from day 16 40 the influent flow rate was adjusted to maintain an effluent ammonium concentration at ca 25 30 mg n nh4 l averaged effluent nitrogen concentration during this period remained rather constant at 26 4 21 2 and 1 6 0 7 mg n l for ammonium nitrite and nitrate respectively fig 1 the reactor was operated at 15 c from day 41 onwards with an average loading rate of 0 6 0 2 g n l d approximately 25 of the granular sludge from ca 2 to 1 5 g vss l was removed from the reactor at day 72 during the continuous operation at low temperature nitrate concentration in the effluent increased in time from ca 2 5 mg n no3 l up to maximum values of ca 9 mg n no3 l on day 111 fig 1 however from day 112 onwards effluent nitrate concentration started to decrease gradually to ca 4 mg n no3 l on day 153 when this study was ended fig 1 thus although nitrate production increased during the first period at 15 c days 41 111 low residual nitrate concentrations were obtained again simply by maintaining the operational conditions reasons for the recovery of low effluent nitrate concentrations are discussed sections 3 5 3 6 3 2 theoretical assessment of in situ batch tests through mathematical modelling theoretical analysis of the short term effects of temperature and do on process performance was carried out by mathematical modelling two different scenarios were imposed for the location of the nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge i stratification of nitrifier guilds in the biofilm fig 2a ii mixed nitrifier guilds fig 2b firstly the time course concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and do in a batch test were simulated at 20 c for a granular sludge reactor for both scenarios fig 2c and d when there is stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge with aob occupying the external granule shell as shown in fig 2a the time course concentration of nitrate switches from a phase at low nitrate production rate to a phase at high nitrate production rate fig 2c during the period with a low nitrate production rate ammonium is in excess and mainly nitritation is taking place then the switch to a high nitrate production rate is observed just after ammonium is depleted when oxygen can reach inner layers of the biofilm however the time course concentration of nitrate is different when both nitrifier guilds are mixed fig 2b with a relatively high nitrate production rate also before ammonium is depleted fig 2d consequently the fact that the nitrate production rate does not increase strongly until ammonium concentrations are rather low is indicative of a granular sludge with stratified nitrifier guilds with aob occupying the outer shell secondly the short term effect of temperature on the time course concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and do was evaluated with the model for the first scenario in which nitrifier guilds are stratified in the granular sludge fig 2a the decrease in temperature from 20 to 15 c impacts the maximum growth rate of both populations aob and nob reducing their activity i e a decrease of the qo2max however in the model while at 20 c the maximum specific growth rate of aob and nob are considered equal see equations s1 s2 at 15 c there is a difference favouring nob i e μmax nob 0 56 d 1 μmax aob 0 48 d 1 at 15 c at a ph of 7 7 see table 1 the simulations indicated that the nitrate production rate before ammonium is depleted increased at decreasing temperatures in a stratified biofilm compare figs 2c and 3a therefore the suppression of nitrite oxidation activity at lower temperatures is more challenging as expected however it is a complex problem as temperature impacts not only the maximum specific growth rate but also the oxygen penetration depth at 15 c the overall aob activity decreases if compared to that at 20 c thus at 15 c less oxygen is consumed compared to consumption at 20 c in the aob shell leading to a deeper oxygen penetration in the biofilm see fig 3c thus the increase in nitrate production rate found in the simulations is not due to a higher specific growth rate of nob at 15 c but to a deeper oxygen penetration derived from the decrease in aob activity to confirm this reasoning and to rule out the contribution of the nob kinetics a new set of simulations was performed comparing four scenarios see table 1 i standard kinetics as already computed in fig 2a ii same fitness with fitness of nob equal to that used for aob in the standard kinetics i e same half saturation coefficient same maximum specific growth rate and same oxygen yield iii same kinetics with kinetics of nob equal to those used for aob in the standard kinetics i e same half saturation coefficient and maximum specific growth rate iv same μ max with maximum specific growth rate of nob equal to that used for aob in the standard kinetics the results obtained in the simulations demonstrated a marginal impact of nob fitness on the short term activity fig s1 the time course concentrations of nitrate and oxygen are almost unaffected by the nob kinetic parameter selection fig s1 thus what determines the increase of nitrate production rate at 15 c in the simulations is the decrease in aob activity in the external shell which directly impacts the oxygen penetration depth in turn resulting in more oxygen available for nob located in the inner layers overall this is the dominant effect on short term independently of the specific kinetics assumed for nob in other words the effect of the position of the nitrifier guilds overrides in this case the effects of kinetics and stoichiometry finally to study the impact of do an additional simulation was performed in which aeration was decreased to obtain an initial do concentration of 2 mg o2 l instead of 3 mg o2 l as in fig 3b the modelling results indicated a decrease of the oxygen penetration depth together with a decrease of the nitrate production rate see fig 3b and c note how the do profile affects the whole aob shell indicating that the activity of aob would overall be negatively impacted by the decrease in the bulk do decreasing the process performance interestingly the ammonium concentration required to keep a low nitrate production rate at 15 c and at 2 mg o2 l can be identified in fig 3b as ca 8 9 mg n nh4 l therefore rno3 was not affected by a decrease in the do concentration overall the theoretical study carried out with the model provides insight regarding the impact of kinetics do and temperature on a batch test in case of stratification of the nitrifier guilds the modelling data suggest that the extent of stratification of nitrifier guilds can be estimated from nitrification batch experiments with granular biomass which was the objective of the experiments in section 3 3 3 4 3 3 experimental assessment of the impact of residual bulk ammonium on nob repression at different temperatures to experimentally investigate the effect of temperature on nob repression in situ batch tests on day 7 and 49 of continuous operation were performed at 20 and 15 c respectively on both days nitrate concentrations during continuous operation were low indicating an efficient nob repression 2 and 4 mg n nh4 l at 20 and 15 c respectively see fig 1 initial do and ammonium concentrations were also comparable 3 and 2 5 mg o2 l at 20 and 15 c respectively see fig 1 table 2 the batch tests were analysed according to the proposed ad hoc methodology allowing for comparison between experiments the main results are presented in fig 4 table 2 both batch tests showed similar trends with an initial nitrate production rate similar to the rate observed during continuous operation red solid line in fig 4 at a low ammonium concentration the nitrate production rate increased green dashed line in fig 4 thus between the red solid and green dashed line in fig 4 a gradual increase in nitrate production rate was observed which was named transition period considering the stoichiometry of nitritation and diffusivities of oxygen and ammonium the nitritation process in the granular sludge is stoichiometrically limited by oxygen if the ratio of the bulk concentrations is below 3 go2 g n nh4 bartrolí et al 2010 pérez et al 2015 poot et al 2016 interestingly the change in the nitrate production rate can be observed at both temperatures 20 and 15 c see fig 4 well before reaching this stoichiometric threshold value highlighted in fig 4 with a vertical dash dot dot type line for instance at 20 c the required ammonium concentration to minimize the nitrate production rate can be estimated from fig 4a as 7 mg n nh4 l for a do concentration of 2 9 mg o2 l table 2 see fig s2 for more details which is indeed in agreement with the value determined by poot et al 2016 during continuous operation between 2 and 5 mg n nh4 l for do lower than 4 mg o2 l therefore the bulk ammonium concentration is kinetically limiting aob activity as previously demonstrated poot et al 2016 at 15 c this concentration strikingly increased to 19 mg n nh4 l for a do of 2 4 mg o2 l see table 2 and fig 4b this means that a higher ammonium concentration is required at lower temperatures for effective nob repression assuming a comparable distribution of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge this observation is in agreement with the theoretical simulations performed in section 3 2 in case of a granular sludge with stratified nitrifier guilds the simulations indicated that a decreased temperature affects the aob activity in the external shell leading to a higher oxygen penetration depth thus to avoid a high nitrate production higher ammonium concentrations are needed to promote higher consumption of oxygen by the external aob shell it is considered proven that the required ammonium concentration for efficient nob repression increased when the temperature decreased from 20 to 15 c fig 4 and table 2 however given the heterogeneity of the system the exact values are probably system dependent and difficult to be precisely determined in the batch test of day 149 fig 5 b nitrate production during continuous operation was equivalent to that measured in day 49 ca 5 mg n no3 l when performing the batch test in day 149 do was 1 mg o2 l 2 fold lower than in the batch of day 49 nevertheless the ammonium concentration at the start of the transition phase was ca 19 mg n nh4 l on day 149 comparable to the value measured on day 49 ca 19 mg n nh4 l see table 2 this suggested that the bulk ammonium concentration required for efficient nob repression is not much affected in the short or long term by a decrease in the do concentration the same trend was found by theoretical simulations compare fig 3 a with fig 3b 3 4 use of the time course concentration of do to determine the required bulk ammonium concentration for nob repression the increase in the time course for nitrate production rate assessed with the described ad hoc methodology is correlated to an increase in the time course concentration of do during the batch test see fig 4b and s3a therefore the bulk ammonium concentration required for efficient nob repression can be determined assessing the changes in the time course concentration of do during the in situ batch test fig s3b when do concentration increased 5 over the initial bulk do concentration value the bulk ammonium concentration was 7 16 and 16 mg n nh4 l for the batch tests performed in days 7 49 and 149 respectively see figs 4 and 5b this is in agreement with the results presented in table 2 which are based on the changes of the nitrate production rate there are two advantages when using the do concentration instead of the time course concentration of nitrate to determine the required bulk ammonium concentration for nob repression i do concentration is a rate measurement because it is the resultant from mass transfer and reaction aeration is continuous during the batch test whereas nitrate or ammonium concentration require slope estimation to identify kinetics ii the measurement of do concentration is often available online which might result in a more reliable estimation as more data points are available compared to the proposed method in section 2 6 which relies on ammonium and nitrate off line measurements however the selection of the threshold value of the change of do concentration has a direct impact on the obtained bulk ammonium concentration in this study a 5 change in the bulk do concentration was chosen as threshold value the rationale behind it can be found in the supplementary information 3 5 proper stratification rather than do plays a more important role when repressing nob a common strategy used for nob repression in biofilm like systems or granular sludge is operation at a limiting do concentration bartrolí et al 2010 garrido et al 1997 peng and zhu 2006 pérez et al 2004 picioreanu et al 1997 the bulk do concentration affects the oxygen penetration depth in case of a granular sludge with stratified nitrifier guilds a decrease in do concentration results in a decrease of nitrate production i e an increase of nitrite production during continuous operation however if the stratification of the nitrifier guilds is deteriorated and a fraction of nob are growing close to the granule surface i e close to the biofilm liquid interface decreasing do would have a reduced impact on nitrate production in other words the location of aob and nob in the granule influences the response in terms of nitrate production at decreasing do concentrations furthermore a lower do concentration would also imply overall lower conversion rates which would challenge the process performance during the period with increasing nitrate production in continuous reactor the bulk do concentration decreased from 2 2 to 1 2 mg o2 l days 40 45 and even to 1 mg o2 l days 58 70 still the effluent nitrate concentrations increased slightly this indicates that a fraction of nob was growing close to the biofilm liquid surface i e indicating deterioration of the stratification to further investigate this hypothesis the batch test of day 92 was performed at a lower do concentration 1 1 mg o2 l than that used during the continuous operation 2 2 mg o2 l at day 92 see fig 5a and table 2 on day 92 the nitrate accumulation during the continuous operation was rather high ca 9 mg n no3 l at 2 2 mg o2 l the results of the in situ batch test in day 92 table 2 fig 5a indicated how the nitrate production rate was not severely impacted by a decrease in do concentration specific nitrate production rate qno3 was measured as 3 mg n no3 gvss h in continuous operation at 2 2 mg o2 l whereas in the batch test qno3 was 3 mg n no3 gvss h at 1 1 mg o2 l see table 2 this comparable nitrate production rate despite the oxygen concentration was decreased by 50 could be explained by a not fully segregated growth of aob and nob resulting in nob colonies located close to the granule surface for comparison see the theoretical results obtained with the model in case of stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge compare fig 3a with 3b the assessment of the nitrifier guild locations in granular sludge has been shown to be possible by performing batch tests at a decreased do concentration compared to the continuous operation fig 5a also a strong switch of the time course of nitrate concentration was shown to be indicative of a stratified granule figs 2 and 4 as already suggested in previous sections when limiting the do concentration not only nob conversion is decreased but also aob overall conversion is affected that can challenge the overall process performance another application of in situ batch tests could be to optimize the do concentration applied during continuous operation aiming for maximization of the aob activity while nob activity is repressed for instance the short term impact of a higher do concentration was investigated using batch tests performed on days 111 and 153 fig s5 both batch tests were performed at higher do concentration ca 3 6 mg o2 l than that used during continuous operation 1 8 and 1 0 mg o2 l for day 111 and 153 respectively thus in both cases the increased do during the batch tests resulted in an initial rno3 higher than that measured during continuous operation independently of the putative location of the nitrifier guilds see red lines in fig s5 however these tests also showed that the qnh4 can be much higher than what it is actually being measured during continuous operation as an example on day 153 specific ammonium consumptions rate qnh4 during continuous operation was 5 mg n nh4 gvss h whereas during the initial phase of the batch tests it reached values of 11 mg n nh4 gvss h table 2 so there was an aob overcapacity that was not being used during continuous operation by performing batch tests at different do concentration the optimal operation at which high qnh4 is promoted while nob are efficiently repressed could be identified in summary location of the nitrifier guilds rather than do played an important role when determining the ratio of aob nob overall conversion rates strategies to minimize nob activity should be focused on combining both the optimization of the do concentration and sufficient excess of ammonium to enhance and maintain adequate stratification of the nitrifier guilds even though this will not allow for nob washout from the sludge in the short term even if their activity can effectively be repressed jemaat et al 2013 3 6 microbial population dynamics in order to investigate the population dynamics and link it to the reactor continuous operation and in situ batch tests results fish was performed using either pottered or cryosectioned granules first pottered samples from days 16 71 and 153 were fixed for fish analysis initially eub338 aobmix and nobmix probes table s4 were used fig s6 a c e in all three samples aob and nob were detected implying that nob and aob always coexisted in the granule throughout the period of continuous operation despite hardly any nitrite oxidation occurred over long periods furthermore eub338 and ntoga1424 table s4 were used to detect nitrotoga in the same samples as this genus was reported to develop in full scale wastewater treatment plants operating at low temperature 7 16 c lücker et al 2015 reino et al 2017 in samples fixed on day 16 and 153 no nitrotoga was detected fig s6 b f however in samples fixed on day 71 nitrotoga was detected even though in a small fraction fig s6d once aob and nob showed to be the predominant microbial community members in pottered samples eub338 aobmix and nobmix probes were used to stain cryosectioned granules from day 71 82 and 153 for visualisation of the distribution of aob and nob in the granular sludge fig 6 granules from day 71 and 82 had gaps on the surface layer most likely due to the cutting process for both samples most of the bacteria detected were aob and were located on the surface layer fig 6a and c nob were found both on the surface layer of the granule and in the inner core although few active clusters were detected fig 6b and d for a cryosectioned granule fixed on day 153 nob were mainly located inside of the granules while aob dominated the surface layer fig 6e and f however obtaining statistically solid evidence demonstrating that the stratification was deteriorated in days 71 and 82 only based on the analysis of fish pictures would require a large number of samples granules and fields per sample being analysed of course this would be a time consuming and costly task here we used the pictures obtained through fish coupled to confocal microscopy on cryosectioned granules just as indicative of the findings achieved with the in depth analysis of the experimental batch tests and the theoretical considerations discussed in view of the results obtained through mathematical modelling both nitrospira and nitrobacter genera were detected in the granular sludge before starting the operation here reported poot et al 2016 their relative abundances during the present study were not further investigated however after the period reported in this manuscript ca 150 days we found a very comparable response of the system through in situ batch tests at days 49 and 149 thus even if there were putative microbial population dynamics the operation or kinetic response of the system was comparable some nob species i e nitrotoga were not detected on day 153 whereas they were present on day 71 fig s6 d f both recovery of stratification and decay of nitrotoga correlated to the recovery of efficient nob repression although the cell numbers were so low that a solid conclusion could not be drawn 3 7 short long term effects of do concentration when lowering temperature the response of the reactor after decreasing the temperature presents a pattern known as inverse response inverse response is typical of processes in which two opposite additive effects simultaneously occur stephanopoulos 1984 one of the processes acts faster but the second slower one dominates the final response of the process when decreasing the temperature in the reactor there is a decrease of the ammonium oxidation rate which left more oxygen available to nob this is a rather fast response resulting in an increase of the nitrate production rate however the second slower process is that the higher do concentration in the aob layer would result in a thicker or denser aob layer in the granular sludge that could eventually deplete the oxygen preventing nitrite oxidation by nob occupying inner positions in the granule this slower process dominates the overall response of the system in the long term and this is possibly the reason why a stable nitritation recovered this overall response of the system is visible when analysing the reactor operation fig 1 the short term effects could be easily assessed by means of the in situ batch tests described here as a consequence if the operator could decide to decrease the do concentration to decrease nitrate production a smaller do concentration imposed would slow down the transient period towards stable nitritation the smaller do concentration imposed would impact the growth rate of aob at a lower do the time required to obtain a thicker or denser aob layer is expected to be longer so in that situation tolerating a transient nitrate production might be of interest for a fast recovery of the process performance in the long term 3 8 further implications of the findings the need for a higher ammonium concentration at low temperatures i e below 20 c to maintain stable nitritation i e efficient nob repression fits with a process strategy of a two stage n removal compared to one stage nitrogen removal where bulk ammonium must be low to accomplish with discharging limits two stage nitrogen removal allows for an ammonium concentration usually in a range 20 30 mg n nh4 l in the partial nitritation reactor however the stability of pn reactors requires of a biofilm structure in which nitrifier guilds are stratified with aob occupying the external shell picioreanu et al 2016 poot et al 2016 this study given the importance of the thickness of the aob layer for the process performance at low temperatures an overcapacity in terms of aob should be achieved maintained during the operation at high temperatures this overcapacity for ammonium oxidation is required to buffer the negative effects of temperature on aob activity as demonstrated with the experimental study in continuous operation fig 1 in situ batch tests fig 4 and with the aid of the mathematical model figs 2 and 3 s1 regarding the inoculation of a pn reactor at mainstream conditions a good recommendation would be to use granular sludge grown producing nitrite by treating side stream at high do concentrations operating at high do to produce the inoculum as done in bartrolí et al 2010 with do as high as 7 mg o2 l treating side stream wastewater i e with high bulk ammonium concentrations 50 100 mg n nh4 l would result in a thick aob layer this thick aob layer would enhance an initial overcapacity when lower do ca 1 mg o2 l is used in mainstream conditions to minimize the energy consumption the overcapacity of the inoculum would be of importance to buffer the effects of decreasing reactor temperatures towards the cold season therefore this could be a good start up strategy for two stage pn a in the main water line of wwtp this experimental study indicated how the trend for stratification of nitrifier guilds in granular sludge was happening at 15 c despite the maximum specific growth rate of aob is generally reported lower than that of nob this finding would indicate that the stratification is happening due to a cross feeding effect in other words the fact that the substrate of nob is produced by aob results in a stratified biofilm if there is enough substrate for aob i e ammonium is in excess as previously hypothesized by pérez et al 2009 possibly this stratification trend is enhanced at high temperature higher maximum growth rate for aob and due to the higher oxygen yield for aob i e higher maximum oxygen respiration rate qo2max 3 9 diagnose of stratification by in situ batch tests generally cryosectioning combined with fish is used to assess the stratification of microbial populations in lab scale research almstrand et al 2014 kouba et al 2014 poot et al 2016 however this technique is time consuming and costly a quick and cheap method to easily check if nitrifier guilds are mostly stratified could be the use of in situ batch tests the time course concentration of nitrate as obtained in the batch test of day 7 or 49 with an initial low nitrate production followed by a strong increase in the nitrate production rate when bulk ammonium concentration decreased is strongly indicative of a granular sludge with a high degree of stratification of the nitrifier guilds granular sludge or biofilms presenting a poor stratification of the nitrifier guilds would present a nitrate time course in the in situ batch test similar to that in fig 5a day 92 in which initial nitrate production rate is very similar to the nitrate production rate when ammonium is depleted however in situ batch tests are a disturbance to reactor operation the bulk ammonium concentration is allowed to become zero leading to nitrate production i e nob growth therefore it is advisable to use this diagnosis strategy not very frequently finally this methodology could be extrapolated to be used or slightly adapted to other similar cross feeding cases or to similar systems like for instance pn amx granules 4 conclusions continuous pn at 15 c with granular sludge derived from a 20 c culture initially lead to proliferation of nob in the granular sludge low nitrate effluent concentrations and stratification of nitrifier guilds were recovered by maintaining operational conditions with sufficient ammonium concentration to promote a faster growth of aob than that of nob batch tests can be easily used for diagnosis of both the required residual ammonium concentration for nob repression and the stratification of nitrifier guilds for a granular sludge with stratified nitrifier guilds with aob dominating in the external shell a higher residual ammonium concentration is required to repress nob activity at 15 c compared to that at 20 c ca 19 versus 7 mg n nh4 l at 15 and 20 c respectively therefore a high residual ammonium concentration should be assured at low temperatures acknowledgements we would like to thank china scholarship council for

19219,a lab scale partial nitritation granular sludge air lift reactor was operated in continuous mode treating low strength synthetic medium influent ca 50 mg n nh4 l granules were initially stratified with aob in the external shell and nob in the inner core at 20 c once temperature was decreased progressively from 20 c to 15 c nitrate production was initially observed during several weeks however by maintaining relatively high ammonium concentrations in the liquid ca 28 mg n nh4 l effluent nitrate concentrations in the reactor decreased in time and process performance was recovered batch tests were performed in the reactor at different conditions to understand the experimental results an existing one dimensional biofilm model was used to simulate batch tests and theoretically assess the impact of stratification dissolved oxygen do and short term effects of temperature on time course concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate this theoretical assessment served to develop an experimental methodology for the evaluation of in situ batch tests in the partial nitritation reactor these batch tests proved to be a powerful tool to easily monitor the extent of stratification of nitrifier guilds in granular sludge and to determine the required bulk ammonium concentration to minimize nitrite oxidation when nitrifier guilds were stratified in the granular sludge a higher bulk ammonium concentration was required to efficiently repress nob at lower temperature ca 19 versus 7 mg n nh4 l at 15 and 20 c respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords partial nitrification temperature nitrate oxidizing bacteria repression residual ammonium concentration biofilm 1 introduction due to the economic and environmental advantages compared to the conventional nitrification denitrification processes partial nitritation anammox pn a technology has been under development in the past decades reaching around 100 full scale installations in side stream conditions by 2014 lackner et al 2014 however the implementation of pn a technology for domestic wastewater treatment remains a challenge because of the low wastewater temperatures in winter and high c n ratios among others cao et al 2017 one stage pn a process encountered problems in long term operation as nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob tend to proliferate and nitrate accumulates which in turn results in a decrease of the overall nitrogen removal efficiency through the anammox amx process de clippeleir et al 2013 winkler et al 2011 for two stage processes stable pn has been demonstrated feasible at temperatures from 20 to 10 c and low c n ratios or without organic carbon isanta et al 2015 poot et al 2016 reino et al 2016 as well as adequate anammox performance at these conditions lotti et al 2014 reino et al 2018 main advantages of a two stage pn a removal processes are i control strategies for nob repression can be applied separately in the pn reactor and ii the separation of pn a and anammox processes avoids competition between amx and nob for nitrite two stage processes have been recently highlighted as a possible solution for attaining stable pn avoiding nob proliferation even at the unfavourable mainstream municipal wastewater treatment conditions hendrickx et al 2012 ma et al 2011 pérez et al 2015 at temperatures below 20 c the maximum specific growth rate μmax of nob is higher than that of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob hellinga et al 1998 hunik et al 1994 so it seems much more challenging to repress nob at these conditions currently strategies to control nob proliferation are based on the general assumption that nob have lower affinity for oxygen than aob liu and wang 2013 pérez et al 2009 thus operation at low dissolved oxygen do concentration has been commonly adopted as a strategy to accumulate nitrite blackburne et al 2008 sliekers et al 2002 third et al 2001 winkler et al 2011 however nob oxygen affinity reported in literature varies among different genera nowka et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 reino et al 2016 on top of that a recent study highlighted that colony size of nitrifying organisms in the sludge flocs or biofilm determines the apparent oxygen affinity picioreanu et al 2016 thus the intrinsic oxygen affinity which is strain dependent will overall play a minor role picioreanu et al 2016 another strategy that has been highlighted for successful nob repression is to control the ratio of oxygen to ammonium concentration bartrolí et al 2010 isanta et al 2015 reino et al 2016 short term effects of the bulk do ammonium ratio on the nitrate production were studied previously in poot et al 2016 the study was carried out with the same granular sludge pn reactor used in the present study stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular biofilm with aob dominated outer shell was reported at 20 c with a minimum ammonium effluent concentration of 2 5 mg n nh4 l for a dissolved oxygen concentration lower than 4 mg o2 l poot et al 2016 therefore for a given do concentration if enough ammonium was available the external aob layer would completely exhaust oxygen whereas nob occupying inner layers could not oxidise nitrite because of oxygen limitation however when residual ammonium concentration was too low below 2 5 mg n nh4 l the growth rate of aob slowed down resulting in less oxygen consumption by aob and more oxygen was available for nob which proliferated poot et al 2016 previous studies focused on the influence of residual ammonium on nob repression in long term operation isanta et al 2015 reino et al 2016 poot et al 2016 focused on the short term effect of residual ammonium at 20 c where the advantage on growth rate of aob compared to nob is rather small hellinga et al 1998 hunik et al 1994 here the residual ammonium concentration required for efficient nob repression was investigated at 15 c at this temperature nob were shown to exhibit a higher maximum specific growth rate than aob hellinga et al 1998 hunik et al 1994 the question remains if at 15 c the stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge persists despite the disadvantage of aob in terms of maximum specific growth rate the aim of this study was to further understand what are the key operating parameters and their specific roles in order to maintain stable pn thus numerical simulations were run with a biofilm model to assess how stratification do and temperature impact the stability of partial nitritation in a granular sludge airlift reactor an ad hoc methodology involving in situ batch tests was developed based on the simulations to investigate how nob repression is affected by i ammonium concentration ii temperature in the range 15 20 c iii do and iv stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge fish analysis of pottered and cryosectioned granules was used to correlate population dynamics and spatial distribution of aob and nob in the granular sludge with the operation and batch tests results 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor continuous operation an airlift reactor with 1 5l working volume performing partial nitrification was operated from day 0 153 inoculum start up and part of the operational period at 20 c were described in a previous paper poot et al 2016 to clarify that the reactor had been operating stable at 20 c phase v of the already published data poot et al 2016 was included as days 23 to 1 fig 1 a break is included to indicate that the reactor was stopped and moved to a new building the influent flow rate was controlled manually to keep an ammonium to oxygen ratio in the effluent adequate for partial nitritation as described previously bartrolí et al 2010 isanta et al 2015 pérez et al 2015 do and ph were followed online but not controlled air flow rate was regulated fig 1c with a mass flow controller 2 l min capacity brooks the netherlands temperature was controlled and regulated between 20 and 15 c with an external jacket the reactor ph was rather constant at 7 7 0 05 throughout the continuous operation period 2 2 wastewater synthetic wastewater was used with the same composition as

solution was adjusted to 6 to avoid precipitation with solid naoh 2 3 modelling study a previously developed mathematical model pérez et al 2014 was slightly modified in the present study to theoretically evaluate the key mechanisms impacting nob repression in a granular biofilm performing nitritation the model was used to simulate batch tests the simulations aimed to characterize the time course concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and dissolved oxygen do during a batch test when imposing either stratified or mixed nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge nitrate nitrite ammonium and oxygen were considered as soluble compounds particulate species were aob nob and inert biomass an average granule diameter of 1 mm and a biomass concentration of 1gvss l were used in the modelling study aquasim v 2 1d was used as simulation platform the model description equations and stoichiometric matrix can be found in supplementary information tables s1 s3 to study the impact of the stratification of nitrifier guilds the distribution of particulate species in the biofilm was imposed to represent two opposite scenarios i stratification of nitrifier guilds with aob dominating the external shell and nob in the inner layers as previously reported by poot et al 2016 see also fig 2 a ii mixed nitrifier guilds with aob and nob coexisting in the same biofilm layers fig 2b the chosen biomass profiles for the stratification of nitrifier guilds aimed to investigate how stratification of nitrifier guilds impacts the rates of ammonium oxidation and nitrate production during a batch test for the simulation of a batch test the initial ammonium and nitrite concentrations were assumed equal to 25 mg n l a constant aeration was set to obtain an initial do concentration of 3 mg o2 l or 2 mg o2 l in one of the simulations temperature was set to either 20 or 15 c depending on the simulation fig 3 which affects maximum specific growth rates and decay rates see equations s1 s4 2 3 1 effect of kinetics stoichiometry since the process is operated under oxygen limitation the key parameter to be taken into account to assess competition between aob and nob is the maximum oxygen respiration rate qo2max yo2 μmax this lumps the effect of maximum specific growth rate μmax affected by temperature with stoichiometry for oxygen oxygen yield see table 1 to assess the effect of the kinetics and stoichiometry assumed for aob and nob in the simulations additional simulations were run in three scenarios i same fitness with nob having the same kinetics than that of aob i e same maximum specific growth rate same half saturation coefficients and same oxygen yield therefore qo2max aob qo2max nob ii same kinetics i e same maximum specific growth rate same half saturation coefficients iii same maximum specific growth rate where the maximum specific growth rate of nob was set equal to that of aob fig s1 see details of the parameters used for each scenario in table 1 2 4 in situ batch tests along with following the reactor performance during continuous operation in situ batch tests were performed in the pn granular air lift reactor batch tests aimed to assess the impact of variable ammonium nitrite and nitrate on the ammonium and nitrite oxidation rates the experiments were carried out at different do concentrations and temperatures as done previously in the simulations to assess the impact of these variables on nob repression and the stratification of the nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge continuous operation was stopped by switching off the feeding pump temporarily while the batch experiment was performed during the batch test samples were withdrawn at different times from the top section of the reactor filtered and analysed as described in section 2 5 during the tests do and ph were not automatically controlled but measured on line when exploring the effects of do air flow rate was manually adjusted to achieve the targeted values if required this manipulation of the air flow rate was carried out for batch tests on days 92 111 and 153 2 5 physicochemical analysis samples were withdrawn from the reactor and filtered for daily measurements offline analysis for ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were carried out using hach lange cuvette kits dry weight tss which refers to the total solid mass per volume of mixture in reactor and volatile suspended solids vss which was assessed by subtracting the ash content from tss were determined according to standard methods apha 2012 2 6 procedure for in situ batch test evaluation here we propose a method to analyse the batch tests experimental data specifically developed to investigate how nob repression is affected by ammonium concentration temperature do and stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge the first step in the procedure is to calculate the rates of ammonium oxidation ammonium oxidation rate rnh4 and nitrate production nitrate production rate rno3 during the continuous reactor operation see equation 1 just before starting the in situ batch test the initial rates during the batch test were calculated based on linear regression minimizing the sum of squared errors using the first two sampled measurements and the averaged initial concentration measured during continuous operation additionally a maximum nitrate production rate maximum rno3 can be calculated also by linear regression when ammonium is fully depleted with the last three sampled measurements using the calculated rno3 during continuous operation and the maximum rno3 when ammonium is depleted two straight lines can be drawn using equation 2 starting from the initial and final nitrate concentrations respectively on the graph the measured points deviating from those lines can be easily identified see fig s2 for an example the slope obtained with the rno3 during continuous operation indicates from which point onwards nob repression is not as efficient as it was during the continuous operation see red solid line in fig 4 the slope obtained with the maximum rno3 indicates at which time point rno3 is maximum see dashed green line in fig 4 for a better comparison of rates the specific nitrate production rate qno3 was used equation 3 in table 2 during the batch test three periods are to be highlighted see light grey white and dark grey areas respectively in fig 4 assuming a well stratified granule with aob in the outer core and nob in the inner layers the following periods can be described nitrate production during oxygen limitation due to ammonia oxidation not enough oxygen is available for nob in the inner layers because the ammonium concentration is enough for aob to consume a large fraction of the oxygen before it reaches nob layers transition period a non linear nitrate production rate is observed with lower nitrate production rates at the higher ammonium concentrations the ammonium concentration observed at the start of this period indicates the minimum residual ammonium concentration required to minimize nitrate production rate i e to efficiently repress nob see fig s2 for an example maximum nitrate production after ammonium depletion no oxygen is consumed by aob thus oxygen reaches inner layers resulting in a maximum rno3 at the do concentration applied 1 r continuous q c n out c n in v l 2 c n t i r t i t 0 c n

fluorescence in situ hybridization fish fish was performed in both pottered biomass and cryosectioned granules the aim of pottered biomass was to assess relative abundances of populations in the granule whereas cryosectioning granules aimed to locate the distribution of different populations to obtain pottered biomass granules were disrupted by pottering washed in 1xpbs 3 times pbs ph 7 2 fixed 1 h in paraformaldehyde solution 4 paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer and stored in the freezer until further use the pottered cells were put onto pre coated slides and then immersed in 50 80 and 98 ethanol for 3min each granules cryosectioning technique was performed as previously described poot et al 2016 briefly granular sludge was taken from the upper section of reactor and was suspended in 1x pbs immediately for 3 h after that the sludge was washed with 1x pbs and fixed with paraformaldehyde solution for 1 h and stored in the freezer until further use a freeze microtome leica cm1990 was used to cut the granules at 25 c to obtain slices 10 15 μm thick the obtained slices were put onto pre coated slides and then immersed in 50 ethanol for 5min and in 98 ethanol for 5 s the pottered biomass was hybridized with eub338 aobmix nobmix and ntoga1424 oligonucleotide probes while the cryosectioned granules were hybridized with eub338 aobmix and nobmix see table s4 a zeiss axioplan 2 imaging microscope an axiocam mrm camera zeiss an ebq100 lamp for fluorescent light and the axiovision software were used to analyse the images 3 results discussion 3 1 reactor continuous operation the partial nitritation granular sludge reactor was previously operated at 20 c for 214 days with an average loading rate of 0 8 g n l d poot et al 2016 the last phase of the already published data is included in the present study for convenience day 23 to 1 to show that partial nitritation was stable at 20 c fig 1 in the present study partial nitrification at 20 c was maintained from day 0 8 the effluent concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in reactor were 24 2 25 1 and 0 9 0 1 mg n l respectively indicating that approximately half of the influent ammonium was converted to nitrite by aob low nitrate effluent 1 mg n no3 l was produced so an efficient nob repression was achieved from day 9 15 low effluent ammonium concentration was targeted ca 10 mg n nh4 l by decreasing influent flow rate which led to an accumulation of small amounts of nitrate ca 2 mg n no3 l this indicates that nob were still present and active in the granular sludge fig 1 a gradual acclimation of the biomass from 20 to 15 c was achieved by decreasing the operational temperature 2 c per week from day 16 40 the influent flow rate was adjusted to maintain an effluent ammonium concentration at ca 25 30 mg n nh4 l averaged effluent nitrogen concentration during this period remained rather constant at 26 4 21 2 and 1 6 0 7 mg n l for ammonium nitrite and nitrate respectively fig 1 the reactor was operated at 15 c from day 41 onwards with an average loading rate of 0 6 0 2 g n l d approximately 25 of the granular sludge from ca 2 to 1 5 g vss l was removed from the reactor at day 72 during the continuous operation at low temperature nitrate concentration in the effluent increased in time from ca 2 5 mg n no3 l up to maximum values of ca 9 mg n no3 l on day 111 fig 1 however from day 112 onwards effluent nitrate concentration started to decrease gradually to ca 4 mg n no3 l on day 153 when this study was ended fig 1 thus although nitrate production increased during the first period at 15 c days 41 111 low residual nitrate concentrations were obtained again simply by maintaining the operational conditions reasons for the recovery of low effluent nitrate concentrations are discussed sections 3 5 3 6 3 2 theoretical assessment of in situ batch tests through mathematical modelling theoretical analysis of the short term effects of temperature and do on process performance was carried out by mathematical modelling two different scenarios were imposed for the location of the nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge i stratification of nitrifier guilds in the biofilm fig 2a ii mixed nitrifier guilds fig 2b firstly the time course concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and do in a batch test were simulated at 20 c for a granular sludge reactor for both scenarios fig 2c and d when there is stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge with aob occupying the external granule shell as shown in fig 2a the time course concentration of nitrate switches from a phase at low nitrate production rate to a phase at high nitrate production rate fig 2c during the period with a low nitrate production rate ammonium is in excess and mainly nitritation is taking place then the switch to a high nitrate production rate is observed just after ammonium is depleted when oxygen can reach inner layers of the biofilm however the time course concentration of nitrate is different when both nitrifier guilds are mixed fig 2b with a relatively high nitrate production rate also before ammonium is depleted fig 2d consequently the fact that the nitrate production rate does not increase strongly until ammonium concentrations are rather low is indicative of a granular sludge with stratified nitrifier guilds with aob occupying the outer shell secondly the short term effect of temperature on the time course concentrations of ammonium nitrite nitrate and do was evaluated with the model for the first scenario in which nitrifier guilds are stratified in the granular sludge fig 2a the decrease in temperature from 20 to 15 c impacts the maximum growth rate of both populations aob and nob reducing their activity i e a decrease of the qo2max however in the model while at 20 c the maximum specific growth rate of aob and nob are considered equal see equations s1 s2 at 15 c there is a difference favouring nob i e μmax nob 0 56 d 1 μmax aob 0 48 d 1 at 15 c at a ph of 7 7 see table 1 the simulations indicated that the nitrate production rate before ammonium is depleted increased at decreasing temperatures in a stratified biofilm compare figs 2c and 3a therefore the suppression of nitrite oxidation activity at lower temperatures is more challenging as expected however it is a complex problem as temperature impacts not only the maximum specific growth rate but also the oxygen penetration depth at 15 c the overall aob activity decreases if compared to that at 20 c thus at 15 c less oxygen is consumed compared to consumption at 20 c in the aob shell leading to a deeper oxygen penetration in the biofilm see fig 3c thus the increase in nitrate production rate found in the simulations is not due to a higher specific growth rate of nob at 15 c but to a deeper oxygen penetration derived from the decrease in aob activity to confirm this reasoning and to rule out the contribution of the nob kinetics a new set of simulations was performed comparing four scenarios see table 1 i standard kinetics as already computed in fig 2a ii same fitness with fitness of nob equal to that used for aob in the standard kinetics i e same half saturation coefficient same maximum specific growth rate and same oxygen yield iii same kinetics with kinetics of nob equal to those used for aob in the standard kinetics i e same half saturation coefficient and maximum specific growth rate iv same μ max with maximum specific growth rate of nob equal to that used for aob in the standard kinetics the results obtained in the simulations demonstrated a marginal impact of nob fitness on the short term activity fig s1 the time course concentrations of nitrate and oxygen are almost unaffected by the nob kinetic parameter selection fig s1 thus what determines the increase of nitrate production rate at 15 c in the simulations is the decrease in aob activity in the external shell which directly impacts the oxygen penetration depth in turn resulting in more oxygen available for nob located in the inner layers overall this is the dominant effect on short term independently of the specific kinetics assumed for nob in other words the effect of the position of the nitrifier guilds overrides in this case the effects of kinetics and stoichiometry finally to study the impact of do an additional simulation was performed in which aeration was decreased to obtain an initial do concentration of 2 mg o2 l instead of 3 mg o2 l as in fig 3b the modelling results indicated a decrease of the oxygen penetration depth together with a decrease of the nitrate production rate see fig 3b and c note how the do profile affects the whole aob shell indicating that the activity of aob would overall be negatively impacted by the decrease in the bulk do decreasing the process performance interestingly the ammonium concentration required to keep a low nitrate production rate at 15 c and at 2 mg o2 l can be identified in fig 3b as ca 8 9 mg n nh4 l therefore rno3 was not affected by a decrease in the do concentration overall the theoretical study carried out with the model provides insight regarding the impact of kinetics do and temperature on a batch test in case of stratification of the nitrifier guilds the modelling data suggest that the extent of stratification of nitrifier guilds can be estimated from nitrification batch experiments with granular biomass which was the objective of the experiments in section 3 3 3 4 3 3 experimental assessment of the impact of residual bulk ammonium on nob repression at different temperatures to experimentally investigate the effect of temperature on nob repression in situ batch tests on day 7 and 49 of continuous operation were performed at 20 and 15 c respectively on both days nitrate concentrations during continuous operation were low indicating an efficient nob repression 2 and 4 mg n nh4 l at 20 and 15 c respectively see fig 1 initial do and ammonium concentrations were also comparable 3 and 2 5 mg o2 l at 20 and 15 c respectively see fig 1 table 2 the batch tests were analysed according to the proposed ad hoc methodology allowing for comparison between experiments the main results are presented in fig 4 table 2 both batch tests showed similar trends with an initial nitrate production rate similar to the rate observed during continuous operation red solid line in fig 4 at a low ammonium concentration the nitrate production rate increased green dashed line in fig 4 thus between the red solid and green dashed line in fig 4 a gradual increase in nitrate production rate was observed which was named transition period considering the stoichiometry of nitritation and diffusivities of oxygen and ammonium the nitritation process in the granular sludge is stoichiometrically limited by oxygen if the ratio of the bulk concentrations is below 3 go2 g n nh4 bartrolí et al 2010 pérez et al 2015 poot et al 2016 interestingly the change in the nitrate production rate can be observed at both temperatures 20 and 15 c see fig 4 well before reaching this stoichiometric threshold value highlighted in fig 4 with a vertical dash dot dot type line for instance at 20 c the required ammonium concentration to minimize the nitrate production rate can be estimated from fig 4a as 7 mg n nh4 l for a do concentration of 2 9 mg o2 l table 2 see fig s2 for more details which is indeed in agreement with the value determined by poot et al 2016 during continuous operation between 2 and 5 mg n nh4 l for do lower than 4 mg o2 l therefore the bulk ammonium concentration is kinetically limiting aob activity as previously demonstrated poot et al 2016 at 15 c this concentration strikingly increased to 19 mg n nh4 l for a do of 2 4 mg o2 l see table 2 and fig 4b this means that a higher ammonium concentration is required at lower temperatures for effective nob repression assuming a comparable distribution of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge this observation is in agreement with the theoretical simulations performed in section 3 2 in case of a granular sludge with stratified nitrifier guilds the simulations indicated that a decreased temperature affects the aob activity in the external shell leading to a higher oxygen penetration depth thus to avoid a high nitrate production higher ammonium concentrations are needed to promote higher consumption of oxygen by the external aob shell it is considered proven that the required ammonium concentration for efficient nob repression increased when the temperature decreased from 20 to 15 c fig 4 and table 2 however given the heterogeneity of the system the exact values are probably system dependent and difficult to be precisely determined in the batch test of day 149 fig 5 b nitrate production during continuous operation was equivalent to that measured in day 49 ca 5 mg n no3 l when performing the batch test in day 149 do was 1 mg o2 l 2 fold lower than in the batch of day 49 nevertheless the ammonium concentration at the start of the transition phase was ca 19 mg n nh4 l on day 149 comparable to the value measured on day 49 ca 19 mg n nh4 l see table 2 this suggested that the bulk ammonium concentration required for efficient nob repression is not much affected in the short or long term by a decrease in the do concentration the same trend was found by theoretical simulations compare fig 3 a with fig 3b 3 4 use of the time course concentration of do to determine the required bulk ammonium concentration for nob repression the increase in the time course for nitrate production rate assessed with the described ad hoc methodology is correlated to an increase in the time course concentration of do during the batch test see fig 4b and s3a therefore the bulk ammonium concentration required for efficient nob repression can be determined assessing the changes in the time course concentration of do during the in situ batch test fig s3b when do concentration increased 5 over the initial bulk do concentration value the bulk ammonium concentration was 7 16 and 16 mg n nh4 l for the batch tests performed in days 7 49 and 149 respectively see figs 4 and 5b this is in agreement with the results presented in table 2 which are based on the changes of the nitrate production rate there are two advantages when using the do concentration instead of the time course concentration of nitrate to determine the required bulk ammonium concentration for nob repression i do concentration is a rate measurement because it is the resultant from mass transfer and reaction aeration is continuous during the batch test whereas nitrate or ammonium concentration require slope estimation to identify kinetics ii the measurement of do concentration is often available online which might result in a more reliable estimation as more data points are available compared to the proposed method in section 2 6 which relies on ammonium and nitrate off line measurements however the selection of the threshold value of the change of do concentration has a direct impact on the obtained bulk ammonium concentration in this study a 5 change in the bulk do concentration was chosen as threshold value the rationale behind it can be found in the supplementary information 3 5 proper stratification rather than do plays a more important role when repressing nob a common strategy used for nob repression in biofilm like systems or granular sludge is operation at a limiting do concentration bartrolí et al 2010 garrido et al 1997 peng and zhu 2006 pérez et al 2004 picioreanu et al 1997 the bulk do concentration affects the oxygen penetration depth in case of a granular sludge with stratified nitrifier guilds a decrease in do concentration results in a decrease of nitrate production i e an increase of nitrite production during continuous operation however if the stratification of the nitrifier guilds is deteriorated and a fraction of nob are growing close to the granule surface i e close to the biofilm liquid interface decreasing do would have a reduced impact on nitrate production in other words the location of aob and nob in the granule influences the response in terms of nitrate production at decreasing do concentrations furthermore a lower do concentration would also imply overall lower conversion rates which would challenge the process performance during the period with increasing nitrate production in continuous reactor the bulk do concentration decreased from 2 2 to 1 2 mg o2 l days 40 45 and even to 1 mg o2 l days 58 70 still the effluent nitrate concentrations increased slightly this indicates that a fraction of nob was growing close to the biofilm liquid surface i e indicating deterioration of the stratification to further investigate this hypothesis the batch test of day 92 was performed at a lower do concentration 1 1 mg o2 l than that used during the continuous operation 2 2 mg o2 l at day 92 see fig 5a and table 2 on day 92 the nitrate accumulation during the continuous operation was rather high ca 9 mg n no3 l at 2 2 mg o2 l the results of the in situ batch test in day 92 table 2 fig 5a indicated how the nitrate production rate was not severely impacted by a decrease in do concentration specific nitrate production rate qno3 was measured as 3 mg n no3 gvss h in continuous operation at 2 2 mg o2 l whereas in the batch test qno3 was 3 mg n no3 gvss h at 1 1 mg o2 l see table 2 this comparable nitrate production rate despite the oxygen concentration was decreased by 50 could be explained by a not fully segregated growth of aob and nob resulting in nob colonies located close to the granule surface for comparison see the theoretical results obtained with the model in case of stratification of nitrifier guilds in the granular sludge compare fig 3a with 3b the assessment of the nitrifier guild locations in granular sludge has been shown to be possible by performing batch tests at a decreased do concentration compared to the continuous operation fig 5a also a strong switch of the time course of nitrate concentration was shown to be indicative of a stratified granule figs 2 and 4 as already suggested in previous sections when limiting the do concentration not only nob conversion is decreased but also aob overall conversion is affected that can challenge the overall process performance another application of in situ batch tests could be to optimize the do concentration applied during continuous operation aiming for maximization of the aob activity while nob activity is repressed for instance the short term impact of a higher do concentration was investigated using batch tests performed on days 111 and 153 fig s5 both batch tests were performed at higher do concentration ca 3 6 mg o2 l than that used during continuous operation 1 8 and 1 0 mg o2 l for day 111 and 153 respectively thus in both cases the increased do during the batch tests resulted in an initial rno3 higher than that measured during continuous operation independently of the putative location of the nitrifier guilds see red lines in fig s5 however these tests also showed that the qnh4 can be much higher than what it is actually being measured during continuous operation as an example on day 153 specific ammonium consumptions rate qnh4 during continuous operation was 5 mg n nh4 gvss h whereas during the initial phase of the batch tests it reached values of 11 mg n nh4 gvss h table 2 so there was an aob overcapacity that was not being used during continuous operation by performing batch tests at different do concentration the optimal operation at which high qnh4 is promoted while nob are efficiently repressed could be identified in summary location of the nitrifier guilds rather than do played an important role when determining the ratio of aob nob overall conversion rates strategies to minimize nob activity should be focused on combining both the optimization of the do concentration and sufficient excess of ammonium to enhance and maintain adequate stratification of the nitrifier guilds even though this will not allow for nob washout from the sludge in the short term even if their activity can effectively be repressed jemaat et al 2013 3 6 microbial population dynamics in order to investigate the population dynamics and link it to the reactor continuous operation and in situ batch tests results fish was performed using either pottered or cryosectioned granules first pottered samples from days 16 71 and 153 were fixed for fish analysis initially eub338 aobmix and nobmix probes table s4 were used fig s6 a c e in all three samples aob and nob were detected implying that nob and aob always coexisted in the granule throughout the period of continuous operation despite hardly any nitrite oxidation occurred over long periods furthermore eub338 and ntoga1424 table s4 were used to detect nitrotoga in the same samples as this genus was reported to develop in full scale wastewater treatment plants operating at low temperature 7 16 c lücker et al 2015 reino et al 2017 in samples fixed on day 16 and 153 no nitrotoga was detected fig s6 b f however in samples fixed on day 71 nitrotoga was detected even though in a small fraction fig s6d once aob and nob showed to be the predominant microbial community members in pottered samples eub338 aobmix and nobmix probes were used to stain cryosectioned granules from day 71 82 and 153 for visualisation of the distribution of aob and nob in the granular sludge fig 6 granules from day 71 and 82 had gaps on the surface layer most likely due to the cutting process for both samples most of the bacteria detected were aob and were located on the surface layer fig 6a and c nob were found both on the surface layer of the granule and in the inner core although few active clusters were detected fig 6b and d for a cryosectioned granule fixed on day 153 nob were mainly located inside of the granules while aob dominated the surface layer fig 6e and f however obtaining statistically solid evidence demonstrating that the stratification was deteriorated in days 71 and 82 only based on the analysis of fish pictures would require a large number of samples granules and fields per sample being analysed of course this would be a time consuming and costly task here we used the pictures obtained through fish coupled to confocal microscopy on cryosectioned granules just as indicative of the findings achieved with the in depth analysis of the experimental batch tests and the theoretical considerations discussed in view of the results obtained through mathematical modelling both nitrospira and nitrobacter genera were detected in the granular sludge before starting the operation here reported poot et al 2016 their relative abundances during the present study were not further investigated however after the period reported in this manuscript ca 150 days we found a very comparable response of the system through in situ batch tests at days 49 and 149 thus even if there were putative microbial population dynamics the operation or kinetic response of the system was comparable some nob species i e nitrotoga were not detected on day 153 whereas they were present on day 71 fig s6 d f both recovery of stratification and decay of nitrotoga correlated to the recovery of efficient nob repression although the cell numbers were so low that a solid conclusion could not be drawn 3 7 short long term effects of do concentration when lowering temperature the response of the reactor after decreasing the temperature presents a pattern known as inverse response inverse response is typical of processes in which two opposite additive effects simultaneously occur stephanopoulos 1984 one of the processes acts faster but the second slower one dominates the final response of the process when decreasing the temperature in the reactor there is a decrease of the ammonium oxidation rate which left more oxygen available to nob this is a rather fast response resulting in an increase of the nitrate production rate however the second slower process is that the higher do concentration in the aob layer would result in a thicker or denser aob layer in the granular sludge that could eventually deplete the oxygen preventing nitrite oxidation by nob occupying inner positions in the granule this slower process dominates the overall response of the system in the long term and this is possibly the reason why a stable nitritation recovered this overall response of the system is visible when analysing the reactor operation fig 1 the short term effects could be easily assessed by means of the in situ batch tests described here as a consequence if the operator could decide to decrease the do concentration to decrease nitrate production a smaller do concentration imposed would slow down the transient period towards stable nitritation the smaller do concentration imposed would impact the growth rate of aob at a lower do the time required to obtain a thicker or denser aob layer is expected to be longer so in that situation tolerating a transient nitrate production might be of interest for a fast recovery of the process performance in the long term 3 8 further implications of the findings the need for a higher ammonium concentration at low temperatures i e below 20 c to maintain stable nitritation i e efficient nob repression fits with a process strategy of a two stage n removal compared to one stage nitrogen removal where bulk ammonium must be low to accomplish with discharging limits two stage nitrogen removal allows for an ammonium concentration usually in a range 20 30 mg n nh4 l in the partial nitritation reactor however the stability of pn reactors requires of a biofilm structure in which nitrifier guilds are stratified with aob occupying the external shell picioreanu et al 2016 poot et al 2016 this study given the importance of the thickness of the aob layer for the process performance at low temperatures an overcapacity in terms of aob should be achieved maintained during the operation at high temperatures this overcapacity for ammonium oxidation is required to buffer the negative effects of temperature on aob activity as demonstrated with the experimental study in continuous operation fig 1 in situ batch tests fig 4 and with the aid of the mathematical model figs 2 and 3 s1 regarding the inoculation of a pn reactor at mainstream conditions a good recommendation would be to use granular sludge grown producing nitrite by treating side stream at high do concentrations operating at high do to produce the inoculum as done in bartrolí et al 2010 with do as high as 7 mg o2 l treating side stream wastewater i e with high bulk ammonium concentrations 50 100 mg n nh4 l would result in a thick aob layer this thick aob layer would enhance an initial overcapacity when lower do ca 1 mg o2 l is used in mainstream conditions to minimize the energy consumption the overcapacity of the inoculum would be of importance to buffer the effects of decreasing reactor temperatures towards the cold season therefore this could be a good start up strategy for two stage pn a in the main water line of wwtp this experimental study indicated how the trend for stratification of nitrifier guilds in granular sludge was happening at 15 c despite the maximum specific growth rate of aob is generally reported lower than that of nob this finding would indicate that the stratification is happening due to a cross feeding effect in other words the fact that the substrate of nob is produced by aob results in a stratified biofilm if there is enough substrate for aob i e ammonium is in excess as previously hypothesized by pérez et al 2009 possibly this stratification trend is enhanced at high temperature higher maximum growth rate for aob and due to the higher oxygen yield for aob i e higher maximum oxygen respiration rate qo2max 3 9 diagnose of stratification by in situ batch tests generally cryosectioning combined with fish is used to assess the stratification of microbial populations in lab scale research almstrand et al 2014 kouba et al 2014 poot et al 2016 however this technique is time consuming and costly a quick and cheap method to easily check if nitrifier guilds are mostly stratified could be the use of in situ batch tests the time course concentration of nitrate as obtained in the batch test of day 7 or 49 with an initial low nitrate production followed by a strong increase in the nitrate production rate when bulk ammonium concentration decreased is strongly indicative of a granular sludge with a high degree of stratification of the nitrifier guilds granular sludge or biofilms presenting a poor stratification of the nitrifier guilds would present a nitrate time course in the in situ batch test similar to that in fig 5a day 92 in which initial nitrate production rate is very similar to the nitrate production rate when ammonium is depleted however in situ batch tests are a disturbance to reactor operation the bulk ammonium concentration is allowed to become zero leading to nitrate production i e nob growth therefore it is advisable to use this diagnosis strategy not very frequently finally this methodology could be extrapolated to be used or slightly adapted to other similar cross feeding cases or to similar systems like for instance pn amx granules 4 conclusions continuous pn at 15 c with granular sludge derived from a 20 c culture initially lead to proliferation of nob in the granular sludge low nitrate effluent concentrations and stratification of nitrifier guilds were recovered by maintaining operational conditions with sufficient ammonium concentration to promote a faster growth of aob than that of nob batch tests can be easily used for diagnosis of both the required residual ammonium concentration for nob repression and the stratification of nitrifier guilds for a granular sludge with stratified nitrifier guilds with aob dominating in the external shell a higher residual ammonium concentration is required to repress nob activity at 15 c compared to that at 20 c ca 19 versus 7 mg n nh4 l at 15 and 20 c respectively therefore a high residual ammonium concentration should be assured at low temperatures acknowledgements we would like to thank china scholarship council for
