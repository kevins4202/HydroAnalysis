12600,in this study a copper ferrite decorated ceramic membrane cfcm for peroxymonosulfate pms activation was synthesized and the dual function of catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration on organics removal and fouling mitigation was systematically investigated characterization results demonstrated that the catalyst particles were uniformly anchored throughout the whole membrane the catalytic membrane exhibited significantly improved bisphenol a bpa degradation and humic acid ha retention compared to the conventional cm filtration so4 and 1o2 were considered to be the main reactive species for bpa removal in the cfcm pms system by quenching experiments and epr tests and two possible degradation pathways were proposed cfcm pms filtration showed superior antifouling property with reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistances membrane performance evaluation in bpa ha removal showed that the competition of ha for reactive radicals and the coverage of catalytic active sites by ha could lead to the decrease of bpa removal while the cake layer formed on membrane surface would increase ha retention in addition stable catalytic activity after 8 cycles high removal efficiency for various organic pollutants and low metals leaching revealed the excellent applicability of cfcm in wastewater treatments graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ceramic membrane copper ferrite pollutant degradation membrane fouling peroxymonosulfate oxidation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nowadays various hazardous organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals dyes pesticides and phenols are frequently detected in surface water 1 4 which has raised the worldwide concerns many of these emerging pollutants are resistant to natural degradation and therefore could jeopardize the safety of drinking water 5 membrane technologies have been widely used in purification of drinking water by intercepting most of the pollutants 6 among them ultrafiltration uf is highly developed because of the low energy consumption no chemical addition and high efficiency 7 8 compared with polymer membrane ceramic membrane cm has the advantages of high strength good chemical stability and lengthy life span which makes it popular in low pressure filtration 9 10 however the traditional cms often exhibits poor retention on small molecular organics and irreversible membrane fouling occurred in internal pores in practical application 11 12 to remedy the shortcomings of ceramic membranes the technology that integrates catalytic membrane filtration with peroxymonosulfate pms activation has recently gained increasing interests 1 13 various strong oxidizing species generated by pms activation can simultaneously improve the selectivity and fouling resistance of the membrane to pollutants 14 15 the catalytic membrane also avoids the difficulties of nanocatalysts agglomeration and recovery in common advanced oxidation processes aops 16 and more importantly mass transfer could be greatly promoted when reactants passing through the confined spacing of pore channels which results in the enhanced efficiency of pms activation and pollutants mineralization 17 18 for instance wang s group prepared a cuo decorated hollow fiber ceramic membrane for in situ pms activation 19 they found that the catalytic membrane exhibited good reusability and fouling resistance and the removal of various pollutants from surface water was significantly improved zhang et al developed a new cm with a nitrogen doped carbon ncs catalytic layer throughout the membrane 20 the mass transfer was facilitated by the confinement effect occurred in the functionalized pores during membrane filtration process thus the surface fouling and pore blocking were significantly alleviated in cm ncs pms system therefore the catalytic membrane filtration process integrating with pms oxidation is a very promising technology that deserves further study in the past few years the development of catalytic membranes has faced two main challenges 1 21 one is to prepare a stable membrane with high catalytic activity and the other is to elucidate the mechanism of fouling behaver and eliminate membrane fouling cobalt oxide as the most efficient catalyst for pms activation has been used to prepare catalytic membranes 22 23 however cobalt is highly toxic to the environment once it is leached from the solid phase so that alternative metals need to be explored 24 25 in replacement copper based catalysts are low toxicity and economy 26 recently copper ferrite cufe2o4 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for pms activation has been the focus of attention cufe2o4 is a spinel structure catalyst it is able to effectively activate pms while maintains structural stability during the catalytic oxidation process compared with other spinel catalysts like cuco2o4 and cofe2o4 cufe2o4 has a similar catalytic property and preparation method but its raw materials are cheaper and more readily available 27 miao et al reported a fast removal of atorvastatin in water using pms activated by cufe2o4 5 shih s group found that cufeo2 pms system was effective in degrading sulfadiazine a widely used veterinary and proposed a synergistic mechanism of fe and cu during the pms activation 28 therefore the combination of cufe2o4 and cm would be of great importance to improve the filtration and degradation properties although the mechanism of pollutant degradation by reactive oxygen species ros in cufe2o4 pms process has been investigated by previous researchers 29 30 there is still limited study on the synergistic influence of catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration on organics removal and fouling mitigation in cm pms system this work aims to thoroughly study the dual functions of filtration and catalytic oxidation of a new cufe2o4 tailored catalytic ceramic membrane cfcm firstly the cfcm was fabricated via a facile impregnation calcination strategy and the physical and chemical properties of cfcm were characterized and analyzed secondly the catalytic oxidation performance of cfcm was evaluated by the degradation of bisphenol a bpa and the degradation mechanism of pollutants in cfcm pms system was explored thirdly membrane fouling behaviors and antifouling properties of cfcm pms catalytic filtration in treating humic acid ha a typical natural organic matter was systematically investigated fourthly the stability of cfcm was evaluated and it was expected to achieve high catalytic activity while remain structurally stable during the catalytic oxidation process finally the removal of various pollutants in surface water was also performed this study will further promote the development of catalytic membrane filtration oxidation process for future successful application 2 experimental section 2 1 materials the commercial α al2o3 ceramic membranes used as substrates were supplied by huamo industry co ltd shanghai china and the details could be found in table s1 chemicals used in this work were provided in the supplementary information text s1 2 2 preparation of cfcm copper iron bimetallic oxides decorated ceramic membrane cfcm was simply fabricated via impregnation calcination process using a commercial α al2o3 flat sheet membrane as the substrate specifically the substrate was first cleaned by ultrasound and dried for later use simultaneously 200 ml impregnating solution was prepared by dissolving cupric nitrate 30 mm ferric nitrate and citric acid molar ratio of 1 2 3 6 in deionized water then the substrate was soaked into the resultant solution and sonicated for 10 min and placed at 25 c for 12 h after taking out and graining excess solution the membrane was calcinated at 400 c for 4 h in addition cuf2o4 particles were prepared with the same molar ratio of metal in the catalysts for characterization and comparation 2 3 membrane characterization the crystal structure of the cfcm was characterized using a bruker d8 x ray diffractometry xrd the membrane morphology and x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds element mapping were analyzed by a scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss the chemical states of elements were analyzed by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific zeta potential analyzer surpass 3 anton paar was used to determine the charge of membrane surface pore size distribution on membrane surface was measured by a porometer cfp 1500ae static contact angle measurements dsa 100 kruss were conducted to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface cyclic voltammetry cv of the catalysts was tested in 0 01 m kcl solution by a chi 760 electrochemical spectroscopy 2 4 performance evaluation membrane filtration catalytic performance and fouling experiments were performed through a bench scale dead end filtration system as demonstrated in fig 1 the ceramic membrane 16 cm2 was run in a submerged mode where water penetrated into the hollow channels through both sides of the membrane under transmembrane pressure the flow rate and operating pressure could be controlled by a peristaltic pump and the volume of the permeate solution was recorded by a digital balance water flux j lmh was determined according to eq 1 1 j v at where v l is the permeate water volume a m2 is the membrane effective area and t h is the filtration time another key performance indicator of membrane is pollutant rejection r which could be obtained from eq 2 2 r c f c p c f where cf and c p represent the concentration of feed and permeate solution respectively the catalytic efficiency of cfcm pms system was evaluated by bpa degradation 200 ml bpa solution was used as the feed solution during the filtration process and the effluent was returned permeate reflux mode first filter for 15 min with a permeate flux of 300 lmh then add the pms powder and start sampling every 5 min to evaluate the anti fouling properties ha aqueous solution 20 mg l was used as the feed the feed should be continuously supplemented to ensure the immersion of membrane the water flux was recorded by a digital balance under a constant pressure during the dead end filtration process regular filtration mode the membrane fouling resistances were evaluated using the resistance in series model 31 3 r t

resistance and irreversible fouling resistance j 0 j 1 and j 2 denote the pure water flux the water flux of fouled membrane and the water flux of cleaned membrane after hydraulic backwash p pa is the transmembrane pressure and μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity the fouled membrane after each test was backwashed using deionized water for 15 min under 0 1 mpa the flux j 0 j 1 and j 2 was determined periodically with an electronic balance to study the stability of cfcm for one membrane we conducted the catalytic degradation experiments for 8 repeated runs under the same conditions in each experiment 200 ml 10 mg l bpa was used as the feed solution and the pms concentration was 1 mm samples were taken after operating for 30 min to measure the removal of bpa and toc as well as the leaching concentration of metals besides when 1 cycle finished the membrane system was rinsed by 200 ml 1 mm pms solution and 1 l water and then used for the next cycle 2 5 analytical methods the analytical methods involved in this work were described in supplementary material text s4 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane characterization xrd characterization of the functionalized surface of cfcm was displayed in fig 2 the main diffraction pattern for cfcm was indexed to al2o3 pdf 78 2426 16 meanwhile three new peaks 30 2 35 6 62 6 were observed and could be attributed to copper ferrite cufe2o4 the cufe2o4 particles were also characterized as shown in fig 2b seven well defined peaks at 30 2 35 5 37 2 43 2 53 6 57 1 and 62 7 were well matched with the pdf 77 0010 for the cubic cufe2o4 spinel 32 the results indicated that cufe2o4 particles were successfully coated on the al2o3 substrate additional xps was conducted to further identify the elemental composition of membrane surface the full spectrum fig 3a of cfcm verified the existence of cu and fe atomic ratio of 1 00 2 14 demonstrating the successful impregnation of cufe2o4 fig 3b showed the high resolution spectrum of cu 2p and the main peaks of cu 2p1 2 at 952 8 ev and cu 2p3 2 at 932 9 ev were attributed to cu ii 33 meanwhile the dominate peaks of fe 2p1 2 at 723 6 ev and fe 2p3 2 at 710 8 ev verified the presence of fe iii fig 3c 34 fig 3d revealed that the al 2p spectrum contains two sub peaks at 73 8 ev and 74 2 ev however the al 2p in cm fig s1 was only one peak at 73 9 ev which could be readily assigned to al o al as the composition of the membrane surface is al2o3 the comparative results show that the al o al and al o fe cu bonds are probably existed in the surface of cfcm 22 34 hence the al o fe cu bonds in cfcm were beneficial to reduce the leaching of metal ions a significant color change of the ceramic membrane was observed after the fabrication procedure fig 4a and b compared with the pristine cm the surface morphology of cfcm changed significantly as it was coated by a thin layer of cufe2o4 particles the sem characterization of cross section showed that the separation layer of cfcm became more compact after cufe2o4 impregnation fig 4c and d moreover eds mappings of cfcm further revealed that cufe2o4 catalysts were evenly distributed on the membrane surface and also found uniformly within membrane pore structures fig s2 pore size distribution of cm and cfcm were also compared it can be seen from fig 4e that the surface pore size of cfcm shrank significantly after cufe2o4 coating by weighing the pristine cm and cfcm the average catalyst load on cfcm was calculated as 4 25 mg cm2 the contact angles ca of cm and cfcm were measured and the results were shown in fig s3 after coating by cufe2o4 the ca of cfcm decreased from 51 7 to 28 3 indicating that the surface hydrophilicity of cfcm was improved this may be attributed to the abundant hydroxyl groups me oh on the surface of cufe2o4 particles 22 35 in addition the electrostatic properties of cfcm and the substrate were evaluated by measuring the zeta potentials of membrane surfaces fig s3 showed that zeta potentials of the two membranes declined with the increase of ph value the point of zero charge ph pzc of the substrates and cfcm were 6 5 and 8 2 respectively 3 2 evaluation of membrane filtration properties in this study the membrane filtration properties were investigated with the feed solution containing 30 mg l bpa and 20 mg l ha as shown in fig 5 the water flux of cfcm declined about 20 3 compared to the pristine cm this may be mainly attributed to the loading of cufe2o4 catalysts on surface and internal pore walls of cfcm which increased the fluid resistance on the other hand ha retention of cfcm dramatically raised from 36 7 to 83 1 due to the shrinkage of surface pore size fig 4e these indicated that the cufe2o4 modification could effectively improve the membrane separation performance for macromolecules however bpa rejection rate of both membranes was as low as approximate 6 0 which was mainly due to the adsorption of pollutants by the membranes rather than retention therefore the removal of small molecular organics needs to be combined with advanced oxidation process 3 3 catalytic properties of cfcm in bpa degradation to investigated the catalytic properties of cfcm the experiments of bpa degradation by cfcm pms system were conducted fig 6a showed that the removal rate was about 13 0 in 30 min for the pristine cm while it increased to 83 4 for cfcm when pms was added this indicated that the effect of membrane adsorption and pms direct oxidation was negligible bpa removal should be mainly due to the oxidative degradation by pms activated with cfcm in addition the removal rate of bpa by cufe2o4 was achieved as 67 0 with a catalysts dosage of 0 5 g l in contrast the removal efficiency of bpa in cfcm pms system reached nearly 90 which was much higher than that of cufe2o4 pms system considering that the amount of catalyst on the membrane surface is approximately equivalent to 0 25 g l in solution the catalytic membrane could greatly promote the removal efficiency of pollutants which may be due to the enhanced mass transfer during the forced filtration process 34 the influence of ph value pms dosage and pollutant concentration on bpa removal efficiency were further investigated fig 6b showed that the catalytic activity of cfcm was relatively high at ph 6 8 while it decreased sharply with ph value further increasing to 11 0 or reducing to 3 0 similar results of pms activation by cufe2o4 nano particles were reported by li 36 and jiang 37 as we know the pms species pka1 0 and pka2 9 4 is highly dependent on the solution ph besides the pka of bpa is 9 6 and the ph pzc of cfcm was measured as 8 2 fig s4 thus when the ph value was blow 8 2 the surface of membrane was positively charged promoting its interreaction with hso5 and increasing the bpa removal rate once the ph value was above 9 6 the electrostatic repulsion between bpa2 negatively charged cfcm and so5 2 would hinder reaction besides it was reported that abundant h ph 4 0 might inhibit the radicals of oh and so4 38 therefore the optimal ph range of cfcm pms system was 6 8 in this experiment fig 6c demonstrated that increasing the pms concentration from 1 mm to 2 mm could remarkably improve the bpa degradation efficiency but it was suppressed when the pms dose is further increased to 5 mm although pms is the source of free radicals excess pms will trigger a competitive reaction of free radicals which has a negative impact on pollutant degradation 39 on the contrary fig 6d showed that the removal of bpa declined with the increase of initial bpa concentration besides several catalytic membranes in literature were compared with cfcm on pollutants removal which were listed in table s2 in comparison cfcm has shown relatively excellent performance and can effectively activate pms for organics removal the epr tests in fig s5 showed that four reactive oxygen species oh so4 o2 and 1o2 were generated during the bpa degradation process furthermore quenching experiments were conducted to determine which active oxygen played a major role in the degradation of bpa fig s6a showed that the removal efficiency of bpa reduced by 60 0 with the introduction of meoh while the effect of tba scavenger of oh was not remarkable this indicated that so4 contributed greatly to bpa degradation than oh and the effect of oh was negligible in addition the removal rate decreased only 22 3 with the adding of 5 mm p bq scavenger of o2 indicating that the direct degradation of bpa by o2 is limited as o2 existed in the reaction system it probably converted to 1o2 subsequently after generation 40 as predicted the removal of bpa gradually declined to 25 2 with l histidine increasing to 20 mm suggesting that 1o2 played an important role in the degradation of bpa by cfcm pms system therefore so4 and 1o2 were considered to be the main reactive species for bpa removal in the cfcm pms system in addition fig s7 showed that even 100 bpa was removed when the pms dosage was 1 mm and bpa concentrate was 10 mg l the toc removal rate was only about 60 this indicated that bpa was mostly oxidized to smaller molecules rather than completely mineralized into h2o and co2 therefore lc ms was applied to determine the intermediates generated during the filtration oxidation process table s3 and fig s8 then the degradation pathways of bpa in cfcm pms system were speculated in fig 6e including molecular rearrangement i and fracture of cc bond between the phenyls ii in pathway i bpa was first attacked by 1o2 and the benzene ring was broken by the single electron addition then the molecule was rearranged to form a cyclohex 2 5 dien 1 one 41 a could be gradually oxidized and decomposed into b p benzoquinone by free radicals in pathway ii free radicals so4 tended to attack the isopropyl connecting two phenyls because of the increased electron density of aromatic rings by electron donating hydroxyl group 42 the disintegration of bpa caused by β scission of isopropyl produced c phenol and d 4 isopropenylphenol d could be further oxidized to e 4 hydroxyacetophenone and f p hydroquinone 3 4 anti fouling properties of cfcm in ha removal membrane fouling caused by ha which is the most ubiquitous natural organic matter is a crucial problem to address in surface or wastewater water filtration process 43 in this work commercial ha of 20 mg l aqueous solution was used as the model foulant and the fouling behaviors were studied in cfcm pms system fig 7a illustrated the specific flux j j 0 changes of the pristine cm and cfcm during the filtration process in the first 60 min without pms the j j 0 of the membranes decreased significantly to 0 54 and 0 60 for cfcm and the pristine cm respectively the more severe flux loss of cfcm than cm was mainly due the shrinkage of pore size after cufe2o4 coating which was more likely to cause clogging membrane pores by ha with the addition of pms with various concentrations the j j 0 of cm still tended to decline slowly and dropped to 0 26 after operating for 240 min this suggested that the membrane fouling of cm could not be efficiently alleviated with the present of pms because the pristine cm was unable to effectively activate pms for organics degradation however the specific flux of cfcm gradually recovered with the adding of pms and 80 of the initial flux was achieved when 2 mm pms was added in the feed solution the significant increase of j j 0 was principally because of the in situ elimination of membrane fouling by cfcm pms system similar results were reported by wang et al that cuo modified hollow fiber ceramic membranes achieved superior fouling resistance 19 besides toc of the permeate solution was measured to further evaluate the ha removal efficiency permeate samples were taken at time intervals of 55 min 115 min 175 min and 235 min corresponding to fig 7a as depicted in fig 7b toc removal by cm improved remarkably with the continuous filtration this was mainly due to the increasingly serious membrane fouling in the cm pms system more and more ha accumulated on the membrane surface and internal pores which hindered the subsequent transmembrane transport of ha whereas toc removal by cfcm slightly declined from 74 4 to 65 7 with the increase of pms from 0 to 2 0 mm this could be explained by the fact that more ha accumulated on the membrane was degraded with the increase of pms concentration therefore resulting in more mineralization products of small molecules which could penetrate through the membrane 44 45 these incompletely mineralized by products leaded to the decrease of toc removal rate the flux decline curves of cfcm under pms concentration of 1 mm were illustrated in fig 7c it is obvious that the water flux could be restored to some extent after backwashing in each filtration cycle the flux decline of cfcm terminated at 76 3 71 9 and 69 5 of the initial flux during the 3 cycles which was much better than that of cm the results indicated that the modification by cufe2o4 could effectively alleviate the decrease of water flux in addition the calculated membrane fouling resistances were shown in fig 7d results indicated that more reversible and irreversible fouling occurred on cm than cfcm the r r and r ir of cm reached to 0 96 1011 m 1 and 1 07 1011 m 1 in the first cycle respectively while the r r and r ir of cfcm was 0 55 1011 m 1 and 0 69 1011 m 1 besides the total resistance r t of cfcm increased with the continuance of filtration cycles and the increment of r t was mainly attributed to the r ir based on the above analysis the synergistic oxidation filtration process in cfcm pms system achieved excellent anti fouling properties for ha containing water treatment in addition the fluorescence spectrum was applied to determine the fluorescent organics in both feed and permeate sides it can be seen from fig 8a that two typical fluorescence peaks marked as a and b of ha were detected the fluorophores a at ex em 290 310 440 480 nm and fluorophores b at ex em 380 400 465 475 nm were related to the carboxylic like and phenolic like structure in ha molecules respectively 46 47 without pms addition the fluorophores a and fluorophores b could be removed by 52 3 and 66 8 by cfcm filtration while only 26 8 and 35 6 of a and b removal were achieved by cm this was consistent with the rejection rate of ha by cfcm and cm fig 5 when pms 1 mm was added in the feed during membrane filtration the removal performance of both a and b by cfcm was apparently improved fig 8e probably owing to the fact that ha was oxidized by the ros produced by pms activation during the filtration process 3 5 membrane performance in bpa ha removal in this part the catalytic and separation performance of membranes were evaluated at pms concentration of 1 mm when ha and bpa were coexisted in the feed solution samples from the permeate tank were taken at certain intervals to measure the concentration of bpa and ha fig 9a and b showed that the bpa removal rate declined from around 71 1 10 min to 42 6 90 min for cfcm while the removal of ha slightly increased after filtration for 60 min suggesting the existence of membrane fouling the reduced bpa removal rate was believed to be caused by the competition of ha for reactive radicals and the coverage of the catalytic active sites 16 the increase of ha removal was due to the retention by cake layer formed on membrane surface sem images of the fouled membrane surface after operation for 120 min were shown in fig 9c in comparison with the dense cake layer on cm only partial deposition of aggregated ha loose layer was observed on the surface of cfcm this further proved the superior anti fouling properties of cfcm in the integrated filtration and pms oxidation process 3 6 stability and applicability of cfcm the stability of cfcm was investigated by measuring the bpa removal and metal leaching after multiple runs fig 10a showed no apparent deterioration in catalytic efficiency after eight repeated runs and the removal rate of bpa and toc were remained above 90 and 55 indicating the membrane performance was highly stable with a slight decline 10 of bpa degradation and toc removal and after eight repeated cycles 30 min per cycle besides the leached cu and fe in permeate solution were detected with a concentration of 50 μg l and 100 μg l respectively which are far less than the allowable concentration in surface water stipulated by gb3838 2002 china 48 considering that the total amount of catalysts on the cfcm is 4 25 mg cm2 the leached cu and fe were 1 after 8 cycles the characterizations of used membranes were also conducted the xrd results in fig s9 showed that after 8 cycles the characteristic peaks of both cufe2o4 and al2o3 did not change indicating that the structure of cfcm is stable during the filtration oxidation process in addition cyclic voltammetry cv curves in fig s10 showed that the cufe2o4 catalysts had a similar current density before and after use and the current density is relatively high the obvious redox peak in cv curves also indicated that the cufe2o4 underwent rapid faradaic redox reactions which may be attributed to the synergy of fe and cu 49 50 this is beneficial for the cfcm to maintain a stable performance after multiple reuses therefore the excellent stability of cfcm makes it an efficient wastewater treatment technology with bright application prospect moreover the catalytic degradation experiments of cfcm were also performed to remove various organic pollutants such as phenol p nitrophenol pnp rhodamine b rhb and sulfamethoxazole smx added in surface water yangtze river wuhan china fig 10b showed the removal rate of 93 4 90 1 99 5 and 85 2 were achieved at pms dosage of 1 0 mm when 10 mg l phenol pnp rhb and smx existed in the feed respectively this suggested the excellent applicability and high efficiency of cfcm for real polluted water treatment 4 conclusion this work developed a cufe2o4 integrated catalytical ceramic membrane cfcm for pms activation and systematically investigated the impact of the integrated process on pollutants removal and membrane fouling alleviation the physicochemical properties of cfcm were characterized by sem eds xrd and xps results showed that the catalysts were uniformly coated on the membrane surface and within the internal pores the modification changed the morphology and resulted in the shrinkage of pore size and the improvement of membrane hydrophilicity the cfcm exhibited significantly improved bpa degradation nearly 100 and ha retention 83 4 compared to the pristine cm filtration quenching experiments and epr tests showed that so4 and 1o2 were the major reactive oxygen species responsible for bpa removal during cfcm pms filtration and the possible degradation pathways of bpa were proposed besides cfcm pms filtration showed superior antifouling property with reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistances whereas toc removal rate of cfcm slightly declined with the increase of pms concentration due to the mineralization products of small molecules after ha degradation penetrating through the membrane membrane performance evaluation in bpa ha removal showed that the competition of ha for reactive radicals and the coverage of catalytic active sites by ha could lead to the decrease of bpa removal while the cake layer formed on membrane surface would increase ha retention moreover cfcm remained excellent catalytic activity 90 after eight repeated runs and exhibited superior removal efficiency of various organics in natural water during the filtration oxidation process indicating the excellent applicability of cfcm for practical

with a nitrogen doped carbon ncs catalytic layer throughout the membrane 20 the mass transfer was facilitated by the confinement effect occurred in the functionalized pores during membrane filtration process thus the surface fouling and pore blocking were significantly alleviated in cm ncs pms system therefore the catalytic membrane filtration process integrating with pms oxidation is a very promising technology that deserves further study in the past few years the development of catalytic membranes has faced two main challenges 1 21 one is to prepare a stable membrane with high catalytic activity and the other is to elucidate the mechanism of fouling behaver and eliminate membrane fouling cobalt oxide as the most efficient catalyst for pms activation has been used to prepare catalytic membranes 22 23 however cobalt is highly toxic to the environment once it is leached from the solid phase so that alternative metals need to be explored 24 25 in replacement copper based catalysts are low toxicity and economy 26 recently copper ferrite cufe2o4 as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for pms activation has been the focus of attention cufe2o4 is a spinel structure catalyst it is able to effectively activate pms while maintains structural stability during the catalytic oxidation process compared with other spinel catalysts like cuco2o4 and cofe2o4 cufe2o4 has a similar catalytic property and preparation method but its raw materials are cheaper and more readily available 27 miao et al reported a fast removal of atorvastatin in water using pms activated by cufe2o4 5 shih s group found that cufeo2 pms system was effective in degrading sulfadiazine a widely used veterinary and proposed a synergistic mechanism of fe and cu during the pms activation 28 therefore the combination of cufe2o4 and cm would be of great importance to improve the filtration and degradation properties although the mechanism of pollutant degradation by reactive oxygen species ros in cufe2o4 pms process has been investigated by previous researchers 29 30 there is still limited study on the synergistic influence of catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration on organics removal and

specifically the substrate was first cleaned by ultrasound and dried for later use simultaneously 200 ml impregnating solution was prepared by dissolving cupric nitrate 30 mm ferric nitrate and citric acid molar ratio of 1 2 3 6 in deionized water then the substrate was soaked into the resultant solution and sonicated for 10 min and placed at 25 c for 12 h after taking out and graining excess solution the membrane was calcinated at 400 c for 4 h in addition cuf2o4 particles were prepared with the same molar ratio of metal in the catalysts for characterization and comparation 2 3 membrane

evaluation membrane filtration catalytic performance and fouling experiments were performed through a bench scale dead end filtration system as demonstrated in fig 1 the ceramic membrane 16 cm2 was run in a submerged mode where water penetrated into the hollow channels through both sides of the membrane under transmembrane pressure the flow rate and operating pressure could be controlled by a peristaltic pump and the volume of the permeate solution was recorded by a digital balance water flux j lmh was determined according to eq 1 1 j v at where v l is the permeate water volume a m2 is the membrane effective area and t h is the filtration time another key performance indicator of membrane is pollutant rejection r which could be obtained from eq 2 2 r c f c p c f where cf and c p represent the concentration of feed and permeate solution respectively the catalytic efficiency of cfcm pms system was evaluated by bpa degradation 200 ml bpa solution was used as the feed solution during the filtration process and the effluent was returned permeate reflux mode first filter for 15 min with a permeate flux of 300 lmh then add the pms powder and start sampling every 5 min to evaluate the anti fouling properties ha aqueous solution 20 mg l was used as the feed the feed should be continuously supplemented to ensure the immersion of membrane the water flux was recorded by a digital balance under a constant pressure during the dead end filtration process regular filtration mode the membrane fouling resistances were evaluated using the resistance in series model 31 3 r t

transmembrane pressure and μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity the fouled membrane after each test was backwashed using deionized water for 15 min under 0 1 mpa the flux j 0 j 1 and j 2 was determined periodically with an electronic balance to study the stability of cfcm for one membrane we conducted the catalytic degradation experiments for 8 repeated runs under the same conditions in each experiment 200 ml 10 mg l bpa was used as the feed solution and the pms concentration was 1 mm samples were taken after operating for 30 min to measure the removal of bpa and toc as well as the leaching concentration of metals besides when 1 cycle finished the membrane system was rinsed by 200 ml 1 mm pms solution and 1 l water and then used for the next cycle 2 5 analytical methods the analytical methods involved in this work were described in supplementary material text s4 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane characterization xrd characterization of the functionalized surface of cfcm was displayed in fig 2 the main diffraction pattern for cfcm was indexed to al2o3 pdf 78 2426 16 meanwhile three new peaks 30 2 35 6 62 6 were observed and could be attributed to copper ferrite cufe2o4 the cufe2o4 particles were also characterized as shown in fig 2b seven well defined peaks at 30 2 35 5 37 2 43 2 53 6 57 1 and 62 7 were well matched with the pdf 77 0010 for the cubic cufe2o4 spinel 32 the results indicated that cufe2o4 particles were successfully coated on the al2o3 substrate additional xps was conducted to further identify the elemental composition of membrane surface the full spectrum fig 3a of cfcm verified the existence of cu and fe atomic ratio of 1 00 2 14 demonstrating the successful impregnation of cufe2o4 fig 3b showed the high resolution spectrum of cu 2p and the main peaks of cu 2p1 2 at 952 8 ev and cu 2p3 2 at 932 9 ev were attributed to cu ii 33 meanwhile the dominate peaks of fe 2p1 2 at 723 6 ev and fe 2p3 2 at 710 8 ev verified the presence of fe iii fig 3c 34 fig 3d revealed that the al 2p spectrum contains two sub peaks at 73 8 ev and 74 2 ev however the al 2p in cm fig s1 was only one peak at 73 9 ev which could be readily assigned to al o al as the composition of the membrane surface is al2o3 the comparative results show that the al o al and al o fe cu bonds are probably existed in the surface of cfcm 22 34 hence the al o fe cu bonds in cfcm were beneficial to reduce the leaching of metal ions a significant color change of the ceramic membrane was observed after the fabrication procedure fig 4a and b compared with the pristine cm the surface morphology of cfcm changed significantly as it was coated by a thin layer of cufe2o4 particles the sem characterization of cross section showed that the separation layer of cfcm became more compact after cufe2o4 impregnation fig 4c and d moreover eds mappings of cfcm further revealed that cufe2o4 catalysts were evenly distributed on the membrane surface and also found uniformly within membrane pore structures fig s2 pore size distribution of cm and cfcm were also compared it can be seen from fig 4e that the surface pore size of cfcm shrank significantly after cufe2o4 coating by weighing the pristine cm and cfcm the average catalyst load on cfcm was calculated as 4 25 mg cm2 the contact angles ca of cm and cfcm were measured and the results were shown in fig s3 after coating by cufe2o4 the ca of cfcm decreased from 51 7 to 28 3 indicating that the surface hydrophilicity of cfcm was improved this may be attributed to the abundant hydroxyl groups me oh on the surface of cufe2o4 particles 22 35 in addition the electrostatic properties of cfcm and the substrate were evaluated by measuring the zeta potentials of membrane surfaces fig s3 showed that zeta potentials of the two membranes declined with the increase of ph value the point of zero charge ph pzc of the substrates and cfcm were 6 5 and 8 2 respectively 3 2 evaluation of membrane filtration properties in this study the membrane filtration properties were investigated with the feed solution containing 30 mg l bpa and 20 mg l ha as shown in fig 5 the water flux of cfcm declined about 20 3 compared to the pristine cm this may be mainly attributed to the loading of cufe2o4 catalysts on surface and internal pore walls of cfcm which increased the fluid resistance on the other hand ha retention of cfcm dramatically raised from 36 7 to 83 1 due to the shrinkage of surface pore size fig 4e these indicated that the cufe2o4 modification could effectively improve the membrane separation performance for macromolecules however bpa rejection rate of both membranes was as low as approximate 6 0 which was mainly due to the adsorption of pollutants by the membranes rather than retention therefore the removal of small molecular organics needs to be combined with advanced oxidation process 3 3 catalytic properties of cfcm in bpa degradation to investigated the catalytic properties of cfcm the experiments of bpa degradation by cfcm pms system were conducted fig 6a showed that the removal rate was about 13 0 in 30 min for the pristine cm while it increased to 83 4 for cfcm when pms was added this indicated that the effect of membrane adsorption and pms direct oxidation was negligible bpa removal should be mainly due to the oxidative degradation by pms activated with cfcm in addition the removal rate of bpa by cufe2o4 was achieved as 67 0 with a catalysts dosage of 0 5 g l in contrast the removal efficiency of bpa in cfcm pms system reached nearly 90 which was much higher than that of cufe2o4 pms system considering that the amount of catalyst on the membrane surface is approximately equivalent to 0 25 g l in solution the catalytic membrane could greatly promote the removal efficiency of pollutants which may be due to the enhanced mass transfer during the forced filtration process 34 the influence of ph value pms dosage and pollutant concentration on bpa removal efficiency were further investigated fig 6b showed that the catalytic activity of cfcm was relatively high at ph 6 8 while it decreased sharply with ph value further increasing to 11 0 or reducing to 3 0 similar results of pms activation by cufe2o4 nano particles were reported by li 36 and jiang 37 as we know the pms species pka1 0 and pka2 9 4 is highly dependent on the solution ph besides the pka of bpa is 9 6 and the ph pzc of cfcm was measured as 8 2 fig s4 thus when the ph value was blow 8 2 the surface of membrane was positively charged promoting its interreaction with hso5 and increasing the bpa removal rate once the ph value was above 9 6 the electrostatic repulsion between bpa2 negatively charged cfcm and so5 2 would hinder reaction besides it was reported that abundant h ph 4 0 might inhibit the radicals of oh and so4 38 therefore the optimal ph range of cfcm pms system was 6 8 in this experiment fig 6c demonstrated that increasing the pms concentration from 1 mm to 2 mm could remarkably improve the bpa degradation efficiency but it was suppressed when the pms dose is further increased to 5 mm although pms is the source of free radicals excess pms will trigger a competitive reaction of free radicals which has a negative impact on pollutant degradation 39 on the contrary fig 6d showed that the removal of bpa declined with the increase of initial bpa concentration besides several catalytic membranes in literature were compared with cfcm on pollutants removal which were listed in table s2 in comparison cfcm has shown relatively excellent performance and can effectively activate pms for organics removal the epr tests in fig s5 showed that four reactive oxygen species oh so4 o2 and 1o2 were generated during the bpa degradation process furthermore quenching experiments were conducted to determine which active oxygen played a major role in the degradation of bpa fig s6a showed that the removal efficiency of bpa reduced by 60 0 with the introduction of meoh while the effect of tba scavenger of oh was not remarkable this indicated that so4 contributed greatly to bpa degradation than oh and the effect of oh was negligible in addition the removal rate decreased only 22 3 with the adding of 5 mm p bq scavenger of o2 indicating that the direct degradation of bpa by o2 is limited as o2 existed in the reaction system it probably converted to 1o2 subsequently after generation 40 as predicted the removal of bpa gradually declined to 25 2 with l histidine increasing to 20 mm suggesting that 1o2 played an important role in the degradation of bpa by cfcm pms system therefore so4 and 1o2 were considered to be the main reactive species for bpa removal in the cfcm pms system in addition fig s7 showed that even 100 bpa was removed when the pms dosage was 1 mm and bpa concentrate was 10 mg l the toc removal rate was only about 60 this indicated that bpa was mostly oxidized to smaller molecules rather than completely mineralized into h2o and co2 therefore lc ms was applied to determine the intermediates generated during the filtration oxidation process table s3 and fig s8 then the degradation pathways of bpa in cfcm pms system were speculated in fig 6e including molecular rearrangement i and fracture of cc bond between the phenyls ii in pathway i bpa was first attacked by 1o2 and the benzene ring was broken by the single electron addition then the molecule was rearranged to form a cyclohex 2 5 dien 1 one 41 a could be gradually oxidized and decomposed into b p benzoquinone by free radicals in pathway ii free radicals so4 tended to attack the isopropyl connecting two phenyls because of the increased electron density of aromatic rings by electron donating hydroxyl group 42 the disintegration of bpa caused by β scission of isopropyl produced c phenol and d 4 isopropenylphenol d could be further oxidized to e 4 hydroxyacetophenone and f p hydroquinone 3 4 anti fouling properties of cfcm in ha removal membrane fouling caused by ha which is the most ubiquitous natural organic matter is a crucial problem to address in surface or wastewater water filtration process 43 in this work commercial ha of 20 mg l aqueous solution was used as the model foulant and the fouling behaviors were studied in cfcm pms system fig 7a illustrated the specific flux j j 0 changes of the pristine cm and cfcm during the filtration process in the first 60 min without pms the j j 0 of the membranes decreased significantly to 0 54 and 0 60 for cfcm and the pristine cm respectively the more severe flux loss of cfcm than cm was mainly due the shrinkage of pore size after cufe2o4 coating which was more likely to cause clogging membrane pores by ha with the addition of pms with various concentrations the j j 0 of cm still tended to decline slowly and dropped to 0 26 after operating for 240 min this suggested that the membrane fouling of cm could not be efficiently alleviated with the present of pms because the pristine cm was unable to effectively activate pms for organics degradation however the specific flux of cfcm gradually recovered with the adding of pms and 80 of the initial flux was achieved when 2 mm pms was added in the feed solution the significant increase of j j 0 was principally because of the in situ elimination of membrane fouling by cfcm pms system similar results were reported by wang et al that cuo modified hollow fiber ceramic membranes achieved superior fouling resistance 19 besides toc of the permeate solution was measured to further evaluate the ha removal efficiency permeate samples were taken at time intervals of 55 min 115 min 175 min and 235 min corresponding to fig 7a as depicted in fig 7b toc removal by cm improved remarkably with the continuous filtration this was mainly due to the increasingly serious membrane fouling in the cm pms system more and more ha accumulated on the membrane surface and internal pores which hindered the subsequent transmembrane transport of ha whereas toc removal by cfcm slightly declined from 74 4 to 65 7 with the increase of pms from 0 to 2 0 mm this could be explained by the fact that more ha accumulated on the membrane was degraded with the increase of pms concentration therefore resulting in more mineralization products of small molecules which could penetrate through the membrane 44 45 these incompletely mineralized by products leaded to the decrease of toc removal rate the flux decline curves of cfcm under pms concentration of 1 mm were illustrated in fig 7c it is obvious that the water flux could be restored to some extent after backwashing in each filtration cycle the flux decline of cfcm terminated at 76 3 71 9 and 69 5 of the initial flux during the 3 cycles which was much better than that of cm the results indicated that the modification by cufe2o4 could effectively alleviate the decrease of water flux in addition the calculated membrane fouling resistances were shown in fig 7d results indicated that more reversible and irreversible fouling occurred on cm than cfcm the r r and r ir of cm reached to 0 96 1011 m 1 and 1 07 1011 m 1 in the first cycle respectively while the r r and r ir of cfcm was 0 55 1011 m 1 and 0 69 1011 m 1 besides the total resistance r t of cfcm increased with the continuance of filtration cycles and the increment of r t was mainly attributed to the r ir based on the above analysis the synergistic oxidation filtration process in cfcm pms system achieved excellent anti fouling properties for ha containing water treatment in addition the fluorescence spectrum was applied to determine the fluorescent organics in both feed and permeate sides it can be seen from fig 8a that two typical fluorescence peaks marked as a and b of ha were detected the fluorophores a at ex em 290 310 440 480 nm and fluorophores b at ex em 380 400 465 475 nm were related to the carboxylic like and phenolic like structure in ha molecules respectively 46 47 without pms addition the fluorophores a and fluorophores b could be removed by 52 3 and 66 8 by cfcm filtration while only 26 8 and 35 6 of a and b removal were achieved by cm this was consistent with the rejection rate of ha by cfcm and cm fig 5 when pms 1 mm was added in the feed during membrane filtration the removal performance of both a and b by cfcm was apparently improved fig 8e probably owing to the fact that ha was oxidized by the ros produced by pms activation during the filtration process 3 5 membrane performance in bpa ha removal in this part the catalytic and separation performance of membranes were evaluated at pms concentration of 1 mm when ha and bpa were coexisted in the feed solution samples from the permeate tank were taken at certain intervals to measure the concentration of bpa and ha fig 9a and b showed that the bpa removal rate declined from around 71 1 10 min to 42 6 90 min for cfcm while the removal of ha slightly increased after filtration for 60 min suggesting the existence of membrane fouling the reduced bpa removal rate was believed to be caused by the competition of ha for reactive radicals and the coverage of the catalytic active sites 16 the increase of ha removal was due to the retention by cake layer formed on membrane surface sem images of the fouled membrane surface after operation for 120 min were shown in fig 9c in comparison with the dense cake layer on cm only partial deposition of aggregated ha loose layer was observed on the surface of cfcm this further proved the superior anti fouling properties of cfcm in the integrated filtration and pms oxidation process 3 6 stability and applicability of cfcm the stability of cfcm was investigated by measuring the bpa removal and metal leaching after multiple runs fig 10a showed no apparent deterioration in catalytic efficiency after eight repeated runs and the removal rate of bpa and toc were remained above 90 and 55 indicating the membrane performance was highly stable with a slight decline 10 of bpa degradation and toc removal and after eight repeated cycles 30 min per cycle besides the leached cu and fe in permeate solution were detected with a concentration of 50 μg l and 100 μg l respectively which are far less than the allowable concentration in surface water stipulated by gb3838 2002 china 48 considering that the total amount of catalysts on the cfcm is 4 25 mg cm2 the leached cu and fe were 1 after 8 cycles the characterizations of used membranes were also conducted the xrd results in fig s9 showed that after 8 cycles the characteristic peaks of both cufe2o4 and al2o3 did not change indicating that the structure of cfcm is stable during the filtration oxidation process in addition cyclic voltammetry cv curves in fig s10 showed that the cufe2o4 catalysts had a similar current density before and after use and the current density is relatively high the obvious redox peak in cv curves also indicated that the cufe2o4 underwent rapid faradaic redox reactions which may be attributed to the synergy of fe and cu 49 50 this is beneficial for the cfcm to maintain a stable performance after multiple reuses therefore the excellent stability of cfcm makes it an efficient wastewater treatment technology with bright application prospect moreover the catalytic degradation experiments of cfcm were also performed to remove various organic pollutants such as phenol p nitrophenol pnp rhodamine b rhb and sulfamethoxazole smx added in surface water yangtze river wuhan china fig 10b showed the removal rate of 93 4 90 1 99 5 and 85 2 were achieved at pms dosage of 1 0 mm when 10 mg l phenol pnp rhb and smx existed in the feed respectively this suggested the excellent applicability and high efficiency of cfcm for real polluted water treatment 4 conclusion this work developed a cufe2o4 integrated catalytical ceramic membrane cfcm for pms activation and systematically investigated the impact of the integrated process on pollutants removal and membrane fouling alleviation the physicochemical properties of cfcm were characterized by sem eds xrd and xps results showed that the catalysts were uniformly coated on the membrane surface and within the internal pores the modification changed the morphology and resulted in the shrinkage of pore size and the improvement of membrane hydrophilicity the cfcm exhibited significantly improved bpa degradation nearly 100 and ha retention 83 4 compared to the pristine cm filtration quenching experiments and epr tests showed that so4 and 1o2 were the major reactive oxygen species responsible for bpa removal during cfcm pms filtration and the possible degradation pathways of bpa were proposed besides cfcm pms filtration showed superior antifouling property with reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistances whereas toc removal rate of cfcm slightly declined with the increase of pms concentration due to the mineralization products of small molecules after ha degradation penetrating through the membrane membrane performance evaluation in bpa ha removal showed that the competition of ha for reactive radicals and the coverage of catalytic active sites by ha could lead to the decrease of bpa removal while the cake layer formed on membrane surface would increase ha retention moreover cfcm remained excellent catalytic activity 90 after eight repeated runs and exhibited superior removal efficiency of various organics in natural water during the filtration oxidation process indicating the excellent applicability of cfcm for practical

12601,in removing of suspended particles from wastewater settling methods becomes insufficient when the suspensions are diluted and contain fine ultrafine and colloidal particles in that case floating of suspended particles by applying floc flotation is faster than settling methods and the floated sludge contains higher solid content in this study the jameson flotation cell which is an improved version of induced air flotation was used to remove suspended particles flocculation flotation floc flotation methods were applied together to increase the efficiency of wastewater treatment some of the critical variables feed flow rate flotation duration and conditioning time that directly impact flotation performance were examined one of the most popular response surface methodologies rsm central composite design ccd which has three parameters and five levels was utilized to plan and conduct the experiments by measuring the residual turbidity of clarified water and particle removal recovery the efficacy of the floc flotation process in the jameson cell was assessed the results showed that flotation time and feed flow rate have a significant impact on both residual turbidity and flotation recovery than conditioning time interaction effects between feed flowrate and flotation time and between flotation time and conditioning time were also found significant in both responses the optimal condition that aiming the lowest turbidity while maximizing flotation recovery was identified the results of this study indicate that floc flotation applied with jameson cell is an effective method for removing very fine particles from extremely diluted concentrations keywords floc flotation jameson cell turbidity flotation recovery central composite design data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater from the mining metallurgical petroleum and chemical industries typically contains emulsified oils process chemicals organic pollutants suspended particles and other contaminants wastewater particles may include precious mineral particles that need to be retrieved as part of the processing of minerals 1 4 the water that fine colloidal particles discharge into or the reduced recirculation water in processing plants are contaminated the purity and quality of the recovered water are typically affected by suspended particles therefore faster solid water separation as well as improved water quality must result from the treatment of these effluents the separation methods used in wastewater treatment operations include filtration flotation and sedimentation the size of the particles that need to be removed determines which approach will be most effective therefore flocculation or coagulation treatments are frequently needed to increase particle size 3 5 coagulation and flocculation are wastewater treatment methods typically applied prior to sedimentation and filtration flocculation and coagulation methods are the processes of bringing together suspended grains in wastewater with the help of high molecular weight organic polymers flocculants or inorganic electrolytes and precipitating them quickly in coagulation the surface charges of the particles are neutralized and in flocculation a physical bridge is formed between the particles and they are brought together 5 the use of polymeric flocculants may help the particles settle but their effectiveness drastically declines if the suspensions are diluted or the particles in suspensions are ultrafine or colloidal range 6 however flotation is a more dependable method under certain circumstances for removing diluted suspensions having about 4 solids and greasy emulsions from wastewater 6 since the flotation rate constant depends on particle size there can be significant fluctuations in recovery for a given residence period in the flotation feed 7 the flotation recovery significantly decreases as the feed size rises beyond 150 μm or falls below 20 μm 8 10 the lower and upper particle size limitations are caused by respectively low collision probability and high detachment probability 9 11 12 fine and ultrafine particles have a low bubble particle collision efficiency making them difficult to float to enhance fine particle flotation the effectiveness of particle bubble collision must be improved 13 numerous experimental findings show that as bubble size is reduced the effectiveness of bubble particle collisions and the flotation rate both increase 9 13 14 in addition to the reduction of bubble size the increase of the apparent size of particle size is a widely used approach like carrier flotation 15 16 hydrodynamic aggregation 17 20 flocculation 21 22 acoustic aggregation 23 24 etc the removal of suspended particles from wastewater and mineral slurries has long been accomplished using flocculation and flotation methods 25 usually flocculation is a necessary step before treatment using natural or synthetic polymeric substances known as flocculants the flocculation process is used to form finely dispersed particles into aggregates or flocs various solid liquid separation methods use polymeric flocculants which have various structures 26 29 the process of floc flotation involves floating very small particles that have been flocculated or coagulated into aggregates when flocculated with a polymeric flocculant and delivered to a collector the flocs are hydrophobic enough to adhere to air bubbles this eliminates the problem of fine particle collision and attachment to air bubbles 30 35 as opposed to typical use in mineral processing where particles are selectively separated from suspension this approach aims to remove all particles and so does not need selection in wastewater treatment 6 25 36 the procedure in this instance is maximized by recovering the most clarified water with the fewest pollutants additionally the recovered sludge is frequently preferred to have a high solids content 6 therefore it is important to correctly alter the unique features and operational conditions of the flotation equipment used for this purpose several papers showed that the floatability of particles was affected by the contact angle and varied with particle size fraction 37 38 it was reported that there was a critical contact angle below which the particles could not be floated when the recovery and contact angle of quartz particles having different particle sizes were taken into account 38 quartz particles recovered more from flotation as the contact angle raised and particles with a size range of 0 5 to 5 μm floated quickly when the contact angle exceeded 500 in another research muganda et al 37 found that the critical contact angle was approximately 71 for fine chalcopyrite particles 20 μm but that the critical contact angle raised with increasing particle size for particles exceeding 75 μm 37 smaller bubbles and higher contact angles improved flotation for both very big and very fine quartz particles according to gontijo et al s findings 38 as seen either reducing the bubble diameter or increasing the particle size improves the floatability of fine particles in this context flocculants can increase the particle size whereas electro flotation dissolved air flotation induced air flotation hydrodynamic cavitation and microbubble generators can produce smaller bubbles 39 with the usage of the jameson cell which is an improved version of induced air flotation iaf the former can be achieved by flocculation and the latter requirement is supplied by the cell therefore it combines these two main requirements for the removal of suspended fine particles successfully since the jameson cell can produce smaller bubbles than mechanical flotation devices and quicker flotation rates it exhibits exceptionally good results for the recovery of fine particles from dilute suspensions due to its technological advantages since its inception in 1983 around 350 jameson flotation cells have been installed worldwide for several industrial applications including coal copper zinc and lead due to its benefits over traditional flotation techniques 40 it may generate very small bubbles with a diameter of 300 600 μm on average or 360 950 μm mean sauter diameter as opposed to a mean sauter diameter of 2000 3000 μm in a conventional mechanical cell or column flotations 41 removal of small particles algae oil droplets phosphorus soil remediation and lipids from wastes 42 43 and organics recovery 44 is another application of jameson cells a license to utilize a modified form of the jameson flotation cell technology for wastewater treatment was granted in 1994 43 despite its effectiveness in mineral processing its application to the treatment of wastewater is still not widespread limited application of jameson cell in wastewater treatment was reported in the literature 42 46 in a previous investigation taşdemir and co workers 45 employed the jameson cell to treat quartz sample size fractions of 53 38 μm 38 20 μm and 20 μm with three different solid ratios 0 06 0 1 and 0 5 to assess the efficacy of turbidity reduction the results for the larger sizes were somewhat successful the effectiveness of turbidity reduction was shown to be much higher when compared to particles smaller than 20 μm the solid ratio s impact on the efficiency of turbidity removal for all size fractions was also identified and it declined with decreasing particle concentrations in the literature there are several research studies aiming to establish the best operating conditions of jameson cell parameters by applying the design of experiments doe and some statistical models the jameson cell was optimized for fine coal cleaning by mohanty and honaker 47 utilizing the box behnken experimental design they explored how the product s combustible recovery ash and total sulphur levels and separation efficiency were affected by frother concentration superficial froth height gas velocity and wash water rate by using multiple linear and piecewise linear regression analyses taşdemir et al 48 evaluated the effects of the jameson cell s downcomer nozzle free jet dimensions and the ratio of air feed flowrate on gas hold up in a laboratory setting taşdemir et al 49 employed a multiple linear and piecewise linear regression model to show how the jameson cell s jet velocity nozzle diameter and jet length affect air entrainment and flow boundary characteristics niedoba et al 50 increased copper ore flotation in a jameson cell more recently by utilizing taxonomic methods however modeling and optimization of the floc flotation process parameters in the jameson cell for turbidity reduction and flotation recovery from suspended particles have not been studied in any published papers it is important to establish and optimize the jameson cell s optimum operating conditions with regard to well known key variables before using it in the floc flotation process to remove suspended fine particles the current work intends to reduce this gap by emphasizing feed flowrate flotation time and conditioning time that may affect the floc flotation performance of jameson cells additional parameters such as collector dosage flocculant dosage ph and frother dosage which may also be crucial for this procedure have been also investigated and are now being examined elsewhere this study aims to assess the appropriateness of jameson flotation cells in cleaning synthetic wastewater created using quartz as the pollutant material the tests were conducted using pure quartz with a screen size of 20 μm and a central composite design based on three factors and five levels to examine the effects of feed flow rate flotation time and conditioning time on the residual turbidity and flotation recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 material the quartz sample was supplied from çine aydın region in turkey the sample used in the studies was crushed ground in a ball mill and screened by a 20 μm screen malvern mastersizer 2000 particle size analyser was used to evaluate the volumetric size distribution of the sample and the results are displayed in fig 1 it was found that 90 of the sample s particle diameter was 28 27 μm and that 50 of the solid particles in the suspension had diameters 13 23 μm the chemical composition of the quartz sample was determined using x ray fluorescence xrf and the mineralogical analysis of the particles was evaluated using x ray diffraction xrd fig 2 and table 1 respectively provide the xrd and xrf data fig 2 shows that the sample mainly consists of quartz as shown by the xrd examination according to the xrf data the sample is made up of 95 56 sio2 and 2 36 al2o3 table 1 2 2 floc flotation in jameson cell

into contact and aggregate quickly as a result of the fast mixing velocity and huge interfacial area the separation tank cell where bubbles and particles come into touch again and separate from the pulp in the pulp zone of the separation tank the aerated mixture moves from the downcomer the froth zone where the particles which are attached to bubbles and entrained in the froth are removed throughout the experiments the solution parameters of the wastewater were held constant slurry volume in conditioning tank 20 l ph 8 solid ratio 0 06 collector dosage 500 g t frother dosage 30 ppm anionic flocculant dosage 100 g t the suspension s initial turbidity value was determined as 220 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit table 3 the general flowsheet of the current research is summarized in fig 4 each jameson cell floc flotation experiment began with the complete dispersion of the low concentrated slurry in the feed tank for 10 min at 700 rpm the slurry was then conditioned with an aeromine 3030c collector at 500 rpm for predefined conditioning time values in accordance with the ccd design followed by 30 ppm of af65 frother at 500 rpm for an additional 2 min in a conventional floc flotation application of the jameson cell flocculant and untreated water are both delivered simultaneously into the top of the downcomer 42 in this study before the slurry is fed into the downcomer fig 3 a flocculant is introduced to the conditioning tank by slowing the stirring rate in order to consider the effects of flocculation time the 20 l slurry was then mixed for an extra one minute at 300 rpm after being given 100 g t of spp 508 flocculant the combined slurry was then pumped at a fixed feed rate in by the ccd design to a 3 mm downcomer nozzle with a constant jet length of 3 cm air bubbles are highly helpful during flocculation because they are retained within the flocs that are produced due to their collaboration the aggregated particles float independently of the surface characteristics ensuring buoyancy the separation tank which functions as a disengagement zone receives all of the flocs and trapped bubbles within the flocs after they have descended to the bottom of the downcomer in the separating tank aerated floc formations in the sludge float to the top and are removed from there until the conclusion of the predetermined flotation duration which accordance with the ccd design the leftover water was fed back into the conditioning tank in a closed circuit after finishing each experiment the residual turbidity of clarified water was measured using an hf scientific turbidimeter in units of ntu and the flotation recovery was calculated by filtering drying and weighing the floating material 2 3 central composite design of experiments central composite experiment design ccd which is one of the most popular response surface methodologies 54 was used in the experiment design and execution there are three phases in this process the process begins with statistically planned experiments after which the coefficients and outcomes of the resulting mathematical model are calculated the model was then validated the best scenario providing the lowest residual turbidity and the highest flotation recovery was identified and this scenario is tested designing and evaluating of experiments were carried out by using the trial versions of design expert 7 0 and 13 0 software the formula n 2 k 2 k n 0 in the ccd was used to determine how many tests are necessary when the number of parameters is 5 54 where n is the total number of experiments n 0 is the number of trials carried out at the parameter centers and k is the number of variables this study had 17 experiments in all with the centre points being performed three times table 4 provides both coded and actual values of the tested parameters in the ccd the feed flow rate a varied between 4 5 and 8 5 l min the flotation time b varied between 60 and 300 s and the conditioning time c varied between 60 and 540 s as indicated in table 4 the response variables were the flotation recovery and the residual turbidity value ntu table 5 displays the floc flotation experimental settings in the jameson cell using the 3 factors and 5 levels ccd as well as the resulting values of residual turbidity and flotation recovery 3 results and discussion after doing the ccd experiments in randomized order we attempted to analyse the design outcomes if the responses data required a data transformation the box cox plots were produced after the second order models for residual turbidity and flotation recovery responses were run fig 5 according to fig 5 the optimal lambda value is 0 04 for turbidity whereas the present lambda value is 1 the fact that this number exceeds the confidence intervals suggests that the turbidity data needs to undergo a logarithmic adjustment the box cox plot of flotation recovery on the other hand reveals that its best lambda value is 1 99 whilst its current lambda value is 1 however no data processing is required for flotation recovery because its lambda value is within the confidence range fig 5 after applying the logarithmic transformation on residual turbidity generated box cox plot is displayed in fig 6 as seen the current lambda value was zero which was quite near to the best lambda value of 0 04 and it is within the confidence intervals 3 1 statistical analysis the experimental results obtained based on the ccd are depicted in table 5 a summary of the fitted model statistics based on the linear 2fi interactive quadratic and cubic regression models are summarized in table 6 for the residual turbidity and in table 7 for the flotation recovery the design expert software suggested the quadratic models for both residual turbidity and flotation recovery in the model statistics of tables 6 and 7 the models focus on maximizing the adjusted r 2 and the predicted r 2 as seen the adjusted r 2 values of the quadratic model for the residual turbidity table 6 and cubic model for the flotation recovery table 7 are higher than the other models these indicate that the models should include the interaction terms 55 in addition in spite of the quadratic model the recommended by design expert for flotation recovery was found to be significant and the lack of fit value was also significant p 0 0352 0 05 table 7 however the response model can be trustworthy if the model is significant p 0 05 it s the lack of fit should be insignificant p 0 05 the r 2 is 0 9 and the adjusted r 2 is 0 8 56 58 when the researcher faces the relevance of a fitted second order model s lack of fit while establishing the correlation between the input and response variables sequential third order response surface designs are useful 59 sequential third order response surface designs are helpful when a researcher must consider the implications of a fitted second order model s lack of fit 59 therefore a third order model which includes linear quadratic cubic and significant interaction factors was used to re analyse the flotation recovery data 3 2 evaluation of anova table for residual turbidity and flotation recovery the analysis of variance anova tables are presented in table 8 for residual turbidity and in table 9 for flotation recovery in the tables model terms are significant at the 95 confidence level when prob f values are 0 05 statistically significant model terms at a 95 confidence level were shown as bold in tables 8 and 9 table 8 displays anova table for the reduced log transformed residual turbidity response following the exclusion of the irrelevant model factors the quadratic model is significant as evidenced by the model f value of 40 27 at 95 confidence level the f value of the model is just 0 01 likely to happen due to noise the significant model parameters were a b ab bc b 2 and c 2 the model parameters which have p values higher than 0 100 are insignificant the f value of 1 67 indicates that the lack of fit is negligible p 0 4213 in comparison to the pure error a 42 13 chance exists that noise will result in a substantial lack of fit value eq 1 was developed for the residual turbidity using coded variables and without the impact of the ac term due to their hierarchical influence the c and a 2 terms which are similarly insignificant in the quadratic model at the 95 significance level are included in the model table 8 provides evidence that the significance degree of the significant terms is ranked in the following order flotation time b the interaction between flotation time and conditioning time bc the linear impact of feed flow rate a feed flow rate and flotation time interaction ab the quadratic effect of flotation time b 2 and quadratic effect of conditioning time c 2 the model is capable of explaining 97 58 r 2 of the total variations in residual turbidity as a function of the factors under investigation the adjusted r 2 of 0 9515 is almost the same as the predicted r 2 of 0 9758 1 log y turbidity 1 25 0 05 a 0 12 b 0 0041 c 0 061 ab 0 094 bc 0 021 a 2 0 045 b 2 0 042 c 2 the anova table of the reduced third order model fitted is given in table 9 for flotation recovery table 9 indicates the insignificance of lack of fit p 0 1533 0 05 the model developed is significant at a 5 significance level p 0 0004 0 05 as seen clearly the main effects of feed flow rate a and flotation time b second order effects of flotation time b 2 and conditioning time c 2 second order interaction between flotation time and conditioning recovery bc third order interaction between feed flowrate and flotation time a 2 b and triple interaction between feed flowrate flotation time and conditioning time abc are significant model terms for flotation recovery following reduced cubic eq 2 was determined using the third order model to improve the lack of fit after the irrelevant terms were removed and the hierarchically effective terms were added as can be observed there are additional interaction terms that have a total of three exponents in the simplified cubic model abc a 2 b and a 2 c it is possible to refer to these interaction terms as a heterogeneous third order model 59 eq 2 could explain the total variance of 99 50 2 y recovery 82 47 6 65 a 8 13 b 1 03 c 0 12 ab 0 58 ac 1 70 bc 0 84 a 2 3 45 b 2 1 18 c 2 1 83 abc 3 13 a 2 b 1 38 a 2 c fig 7 depicts the residual turbidity and flotation recovery that was observed and that was predicted by eqs 1 and 2 respectively they demonstrate a great match between the estimated and real turbidity fig 7a and flotation recovery fig 7b values fig 7a and b indicate that the proposed models were appropriate for assessing residual turbidity and flotation recovery as responses 3 3 effects of main factors on residual turbidity and flotation recovery according to tables 8 and 9 both the residual turbidity and flotation recovery are primarily affected by the first order of feed flow rate a flotation time b second order of flotation time b 2 and conditioning time c 2 while interactions between feed flow rate and flotation time ab and flotation time and conditioning time bc also have a significant impact fig 8 shows the perturbation plots which examine the individual effects of the parameters visually by altering one factor while the other factors are kept constant the flotation time is more significant than the other parameters for the residual turbidity the turbidity is affected quadratically by every parameter in general turbidity diminishes fig 8a and flotation recovery increases fig 8b quadratic manner as flotation time increases if the flotation period is prolonged unfloated flocs will float which reduces residual turbidity and increases the flotation recovery when the feed flowrate increased a quadratic increase in residual turbidity and a linear increase in flotation recovery were observed the increased feed flow rate may cause flocculated particles to break apart increasing the supernatant turbidity compared to other factors the conditioning time had less influence on both residual turbidity and flotation recovery 3 4 effects of factors interactions on residual turbidity and flotation recovery the cubic plots in fig 9 illustrate the combined actions of three independent factors on turbidity fig 9a and flotation recovery fig 9b increasing the feed flowrate a at high levels of flotation time b and at low or high levels of conditioning time had essentially little effect on the turbidity c however increasing input flow rate a led to an increase in turbidity at low flotation time levels b and at high or low conditioning levels c high levels of flotation time b high levels of feed flow rate a and low levels of conditioning time c produced the lowest turbidity of 13 40 ntu when the jameson cell was run at high levels of feed flow rate a low levels of flotation time b and conditioning time c the turbidity reached the maximum value of 47 71 ntu on the other hand increasing feed flow rate a at all levels of flotation time b and conditioning time c had a favorable influence on flotation recovery whether flotation time is low or high increasing conditioning time improves recovery similar to this recovery rises with increasing conditioning time at both low and high feed flow rates with the exception of high flotation times with longer conditioning times and higher feed flow rates the recovery declined from 91 91 to 88 51 the strong triple interaction between the three factors abc may be responsible for this table 9 the three low level factors yielded a minimum recovery of 64 02 the highest recovery 91 91 was feasible at the high level of flotation time and feed flow rate and at the low level of conditioning time as shown in fig 9b in a previous work 46 enhanced floating duration increased the effectiveness of particle removal recovery and decreased the residual turbidity of flocculated marble waste particles in jameson flotation cell 3 5 optimization for residual turbidity and flotation recovery the overlay plot shown in fig 10 was utilized to identify the optimum process conditions achieving the lowest supernatant turbidity and highest flotation recovery both residual turbidity and flotation recovery were primarily influenced by the feed flow rate and flotation duration the overlay plot s minimum and maximum allowable turbidity values were set at 13 5 and 15 ntu respectively and the flotation recovery value was set at 87 in the yellow area of fig 10 the overlay plot depicts the floc flotation process conditions in the jameson cell when the turbidity is between 13 5 and 15 ntu with a flotation recovery of 87 in this graph the yellow region represents the ideal point which has a minimum turbidity of 13 54 ntu and a maximum flotation recovery of 91 98 this optimization research showed that a desirability value of 0 9539 may be achieved with minimal residual turbidity and maximum flotation recovery of around 13 54 ntu and 91 98 respectively the design expert software determined that a feed flowrate of 7 7 l min a flotation time of 251 s and a conditioning time of 178 s were the optimum process condition for the floc flotation in the jameson cell according to tables 8 and 9 there are significant interactions that affect both residual turbidity and flotation recovery between flotation time b and the other two variables in order to gain a better understanding of the interaction effects between the input parameters 3d plots for the measured responses residual turbidity and flotation recovery were drawn based on the model equations developed the 3d plots on the interaction effects of two input parameters were shown for feed flow rate a and flotation time b in fig 11 and for the flotation time b and conditioning time c in fig 12 in these plots the remaining parameter was held constant at its optimized level the 3d plots shown in fig 11 present the interaction effect of feed flow rate a and flotation time b on residual turbidity and flotation recovery at an optimized level of conditioning time of 178 s fig 11 indicates that when the conditioning time was kept constant at its optimum value of 178 s the residual turbidity was almost not changed but flotation recovery reached its maximum by increasing the feed flow rate at the optimal flotation time of 251 s however if the flotation time was reduced to 109 s residual turbidity reached maximum and flotation recovery also decreased at the optimal feed flow rate of 7 7 l min some important operating parameters affect the other critical parameters and hence flotation recovery in the jameson cell it will be feasible to ascertain how various operational factors impact the effectiveness of particle collection by looking into the collecting mechanisms within the downcomer the downcomer s design functioning and particle collection may all be optimized with the usage of this information 41 for example simply increasing the feed flowrate increases the jet velocity and air entrainment rate also increases and also the jet length in the jameson cell the jet velocity rises when the feed flow rate to the downcomer is increased 48 in this study the jet length was kept constant as 3 cm in the experiments at constant jet length as the feed flow rate increases the jet velocity and air quantity entered into the downcomer increase hence the air entrainment rate and hold up also increase by increasing the jet velocity 48 the jet velocity that is produced when the feed flow rate is changed affects the downcomer and separation tank residence time in addition the bubble size increased with increased jet velocity 41 and the residence time of flocculated particles in the downcomer and in the separation tank decreased due to the higher rising velocity of larger bubbles as the air rate in a jameson cell downcomer is raised the height of the bubble mixture and consequently the residence duration decrease 51 as a result faster flotation is achieved and the flotation recovery increases even at lower flotation times fig 11 in addition higher air rates by raising the jet velocity increase the energy input into the downcomer and cause an increase in turbulence this gives particles a very high chance of colliding and attaching and improves the flotation recovery for coarse particles it also leads to a higher chance of detachment 60 in the case of flocculated particles turbidity removal efficiency decreased while increasing the feed flow rate at low flotation time while higher turbulence does stimulate particle and bubble collision in the downcomer the flotation recovery increases with increasing jet velocity due to increased feed flow rate however higher turbulence also promotes particle detachment therefore some of the flocculated particles might be broken and the residual turbidity increased at low flotation time by increasing the feed flow rate fig 11 if the flotation time is prolonged these particles might find to attach to air bubbles again hence flotation efficiency in terms of turbidity removal and recovery increased as seen in fig 11 it appears that attachment and detachment of flocculated particles were in balance under the optimal flotation condition where the feed flow rate of 7 7 l min flotation time of 251 s and 178 s of conditioning time fig 12 shows the 3d plots for the relationship between flotation time b and conditioning time c at an optimum feed flow rate of 7 7 l min the duration of flotation has an impact on the retention time of the flocculated particles in the jameson cell the least hydrophobic particles require more time to be returned to the product stream whereas the strongest hydrophobic particles may be floated in the lowest retention period 61 as can be seen in fig 12 at the low level of conditioning time increasing the flotation time led to an improvement in both residual turbidity and flotation recovery in the jameson cell when the flotation duration was increased from 109 s to 251 s at low levels of conditioning time and flotation time both residual turbidity and flotation recovery decreased substantially at the low level of flotation time increasing conditioning time had a positive effect on the turbidity of clarified water and flotation recovery at the high level of conditioning time both turbidity removal efficiency and flotation recovery were much lesser than those obtained at a low level of conditioning time the lowest residual turbidity and the highest flotation recovery were obtained at the low level of conditioning time and at the high level of flotation time this result indicates that hydrodynamic conditions and longer residence time in the jameson cell are more effective during the floc flotation of suspended particles in an amine quartz system henwood 62 reported that changes in conditioning time have no measurable effect on flotation recovery in addition to the rapid diffuse and fast reaction of amine molecules henwood 62 suggested dual function of amines collector and frother is responsible for this effect over conditioning may have caused hydrophobic agglomeration of quartz particles because of the amines rapid adsorption rate on the quartz surface the increased weight of the flocculated particles may therefore enhance the likelihood that flocculated quartz particles may detach from bubbles leading to higher residual turbidity and reduced flotation recovery in the case of floc flotation quartz with amine and anionic flocculant however somasundaran and lee 63 reported that interactions between polymers and surfactants have a large impact on the process s performance the increased flotation recovery is dependent to a larger extent on the anionic polymer s salting out of the amine due to its greater affinity for hydration and to a lesser extent on the development of an amine anionic polymer complex by electrostatic interaction between an anionic polymer and an amine may improve quartz flotation recovery 63 fig 13 for residual turbidity and flotation recovery presents perturbation plots that aid in comparing the effects of all factors at optimized points according to fig 13 altering the value of a factor toward its optimal point has an impact on both residual turbidity fig 13a and flotation recovery fig 13b from the point of minimum turbidity the residual turbidity increased drastically with decreasing flotation time b significantly increased with increasing conditioning time c and nearly did not change with lowering feed flow rate a on the other hand a reduction in flotation recovery was the result of parameter departure from the optimal point both the feed flow rate a and the flotation period b had a remarkably similar effect when both were reduced from their ideal levels and reduced flotation recovery on the other hand as conditioning time increased the flotation recovery slightly declined c two confirmation experiments were conducted to verify the optimal circumstances test results revealed that the flotation recovery was 91 5 and the residual turbidity was 13 93 ntu this score represents that the models proposed have a high level of accuracy 4 cost estimation and comparison in recent years it has been seen that various methods including flotation membrane separation and filtration can be successfully applied in removing fine particles from wastewater in addition to sedimentation with coagulation flocculation however numerous studies have also been conducted on the treatment methods and their cost estimates 64 70 in general the cost comparison of methods can vary depending on the equipment utilized wastewater type and flow rate difference in design and operational parameters of the many systems type and amount of chemicals added an overall comparison of specific costs of different unit processes such as sedimentation flotation and filtration coagulation physical biological treatment is given in table 10 it is seen that the flotation method is more expensive than the sedimentation method but may have a higher treatment performance with low residence times fast throughput and high efficiency the capital and operating costs of flotation systems for the treatment of wastewater can vary significantly depending on a number of factors including the type of flotation system being used e g dissolved air flotation daf or induced air flotation iaf the flow rate and characteristics of the wastewater being treated the level of treatment required and the location and type of facility where the system will be installed in general the capital cost of a flotation system can include the cost of purchasing the equipment itself as well as any associated infrastructure or ancillary equipment required for its operation operating costs can include the cost of energy maintenance and repair and consumables such as chemicals and replacement parts it is difficult to estimate the capital and operating costs of the jameson flotation cell without more information about the specific application and requirements of the cell however there have been a few research conducted on performance and cost analysis clayton 70 made project cost estimates for recovering organic from the raffinate by using jameson cell clayton 70 stated that a jameson cell capital cost requiring all equipment and site preparation is about 100 per gallon us minute 18 35 per m3 day to be treated wastewater this includes electrical pumping site preparation piping equipment and installation in addition the organic recovery cost has been determined as 0 14 m3 for 1000 gpm feeding capacity hadley et al 71 estimated the cost analysis of the jameson cell to be used in the recovery of fine coal jameson cell model 6000 10 was selected for a 9000 gpm flow rate and is priced at 159 500 including remote instrumentation and controls clean coal production cost was determined as 0 73 mmbtu 0 028 m3 based on above information it is estimated that the capital and operating costs of the jameson flotation cell for a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 1000 m3 day may be approximately 50 000 150 000 and 0 2 1 1 m3 respectively daf is the most widely used flotation method especially for the removal of suspended particles and oils from wastewater hanafy and nabih 66 have stated that the estimated costs of coagulation and daf for 1000 m3 day at 200 mg l oil input concentration the total construction investment is 500 000 and the operational cost per m3 of wastewater is 0 22 woodward et al 67 mentioned that a daf plant to treat 1200 gpm of poultry processing waste was constructed at a cost of approximately 75 000 the daily operational costs were 141 the net operating cost per 1000 gal was 0 07 in another study the operating costs of the system which includes coagulation flocculation settling and filtration units are given as 0 25 1 50 m3 69 the cost of ultrafiltration treatment for metalworking and fatty acid industry effluent was 2 65 and 2 8 m3 64 68 according to pelendridou et al s investigation 72 into the feasibility of coagulation flocculation for the treatment of oily wastewater the operating cost of coagulation was between 0 43 and 2 0 m3 in general daf can be characterized as a high retention time process leading to large equipment sizes using small quantities of air in contrast to iaf however due because a feed pump is required as auxiliary equipment jameson cell is frequently relatively cost competitive in most cost components the cell contains minimal spare components no moving parts and is easy to use and maintain it has a compact size low capital cost low power consumption low maintenance costs low residence times and fast throughput 43 5 conclusions the use and optimization of response surface modeling based on central composite design allowed for the evaluation of the impacts of feed flow rate flotation time and conditioning time on the floc flotation success for residual turbidity and flotation recovery in the jameson flotation cell process the second order model was determined to describe best the residual turbidity since it was significant and its lack of fit was negligible for the flotation recovery a third order model that was statistically meaningful and did not suffer from lack of fit was developed chancing the feed flow rate which affects the jet velocity air quantity residence time and turbulence in the downcomer of jameson cell altered the hydrodynamic conditions in the downcomer it was shown that in addition to feed flowrate flotation time was found to be much more significant than the conditioning time on the floc flotation efficiency for the removal of suspended particles from diluted suspensions in addition to their individual effects double interactions between feed flow rate and flotation time and flotation time and conditioning time on both response and triple interaction of the factors on the flotation recovery were significant on flotation recovery optimization studies aiming for the lowest residual turbidity and maximum flotation recovery showed that the best combinations of the parameters were found to be feed flow rate of 7 7 l min flotation duration of 251 s and conditioning time of 178 s with a forecast of 13 54 ntu supernatant turbidity and 91 98 flotation recovery at this condition the probability of attachment and detachment of flocculated particles was in balance both flotation recovery and residual turbidity were adversely impacted if the parameters were off optimal the flotation recovery was significantly lowered and the residual turbidity was raised as flotation duration was shortened from the ideal point the flotation recovery declined significantly when the feed flowrate dropped below its optimal point while the residual turbidity was little impacted longer conditioning times from the optimal point had a greater negative impact on residual turbidity and a somewhat smaller negative impact on flotation recovery additional tests conducted to validate the ideal condition yielded outcomes that were remarkably consistent with those predicted the two developed mathematical models may be utilized conveniently to estimate optimum floc flotation process conditions in the jameson cell for the flotation recovery as well as residual turbidity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

12601,in removing of suspended particles from wastewater settling methods becomes insufficient when the suspensions are diluted and contain fine ultrafine and colloidal particles in that case floating of suspended particles by applying floc flotation is faster than settling methods and the floated sludge contains higher solid content in this study the jameson flotation cell which is an improved version of induced air flotation was used to remove suspended particles flocculation flotation floc flotation methods were applied together to increase the efficiency of wastewater treatment some of the critical variables feed flow rate flotation duration and conditioning time that directly impact flotation performance were examined one of the most popular response surface methodologies rsm central composite design ccd which has three parameters and five levels was utilized to plan and conduct the experiments by measuring the residual turbidity of clarified water and particle removal recovery the efficacy of the floc flotation process in the jameson cell was assessed the results showed that flotation time and feed flow rate have a significant impact on both residual turbidity and flotation recovery than conditioning time interaction effects between feed flowrate and flotation time and between flotation time and conditioning time were also found significant in both responses the optimal condition that aiming the lowest turbidity while maximizing flotation recovery was identified the results of this study indicate that floc flotation applied with jameson cell is an effective method for removing very fine particles from extremely diluted concentrations keywords floc flotation jameson cell turbidity flotation recovery central composite design data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater from the mining metallurgical petroleum and chemical industries typically contains emulsified oils process chemicals organic pollutants suspended particles and other contaminants wastewater particles may include precious mineral particles that need to be retrieved as part of the processing of minerals 1 4 the water that fine colloidal particles discharge into or the reduced recirculation water in processing plants are contaminated the purity and quality of the recovered water are typically affected by suspended particles therefore faster solid water separation as well as improved water quality must result from the treatment of these effluents the separation methods used in wastewater treatment operations include filtration flotation and sedimentation the size of the particles that need to be removed determines which approach will be most effective therefore flocculation or coagulation treatments are frequently needed to increase particle size 3 5 coagulation and flocculation are wastewater treatment methods typically applied prior to sedimentation and filtration flocculation and coagulation methods are the processes of bringing together suspended grains in wastewater with the help of high molecular weight organic polymers flocculants or inorganic electrolytes and precipitating them quickly in coagulation the surface charges of the particles are neutralized and in flocculation a physical bridge is formed between the particles and they are brought together 5 the use of polymeric flocculants may help the particles settle but their effectiveness drastically declines if the suspensions are diluted or the particles in suspensions are ultrafine or colloidal range 6 however flotation is a more dependable method under certain circumstances for removing diluted suspensions having about 4 solids and greasy emulsions from wastewater 6 since the flotation rate constant depends on particle size there can be significant fluctuations in recovery for a given residence period in the flotation feed 7 the flotation recovery significantly decreases as the feed size rises beyond 150 μm or falls below 20 μm 8 10 the lower and upper particle size limitations are caused by respectively low collision probability and high detachment probability 9 11 12 fine and ultrafine particles have a low bubble particle collision efficiency making them difficult to float to enhance fine particle flotation the effectiveness of particle bubble collision must be improved 13 numerous experimental findings show that as bubble size is reduced the effectiveness of bubble particle collisions and the flotation rate both increase 9 13 14 in addition to the reduction of bubble size the increase of the apparent size of particle size is a widely used approach like carrier flotation 15 16 hydrodynamic aggregation 17 20 flocculation 21 22 acoustic aggregation 23 24 etc the removal of suspended particles from wastewater and mineral slurries has long been accomplished using flocculation and flotation methods 25 usually flocculation is a necessary step before treatment using natural or synthetic polymeric substances known as flocculants the flocculation process is used to form finely dispersed particles into aggregates or flocs various solid liquid separation methods use polymeric flocculants which have various structures 26 29 the process of floc flotation involves floating very small particles that have been flocculated or coagulated into aggregates when flocculated with a polymeric flocculant and delivered to a collector the flocs are hydrophobic enough to adhere to air bubbles this eliminates the problem of fine particle collision and attachment to air bubbles 30 35 as opposed to typical use in mineral processing where particles are selectively separated from suspension this approach aims to remove all particles and so does not need selection in wastewater treatment 6 25 36 the procedure in this instance is maximized by recovering the most clarified water with the fewest pollutants additionally the recovered sludge is frequently preferred to have a high solids content 6 therefore it is important to correctly alter the unique features and operational conditions of the flotation equipment used for this purpose several papers showed that the floatability of particles was affected by the contact angle and varied with particle size fraction 37 38 it was reported that there was a critical contact angle below which the particles could not be floated when the recovery and contact angle of quartz particles having different particle sizes were taken into account 38 quartz particles recovered more from flotation as the contact angle raised and particles with a size range of 0 5 to 5 μm floated quickly when the contact angle exceeded 500 in another research muganda et al 37 found that the critical contact angle was approximately 71 for fine chalcopyrite particles 20 μm but that the critical contact angle raised with increasing particle size for particles exceeding 75 μm 37 smaller bubbles and higher contact angles improved flotation for both very big and very fine quartz particles according to gontijo et al s findings 38 as seen either reducing the bubble diameter or increasing the particle size improves the floatability of fine particles in this context flocculants can increase the particle size whereas electro flotation dissolved air flotation induced air flotation hydrodynamic cavitation and microbubble generators can produce smaller bubbles 39 with the usage of the jameson cell which is an improved version of induced air flotation iaf the former can be achieved by flocculation and the latter requirement is supplied by the cell therefore it combines these two main requirements for the removal of suspended fine particles successfully since the jameson cell can produce smaller bubbles than mechanical flotation devices and quicker flotation rates it exhibits exceptionally good results for the recovery of fine particles from dilute suspensions due to its technological advantages since its inception in 1983 around 350 jameson flotation cells have been installed worldwide for several industrial applications including coal copper zinc and lead due to its benefits over traditional flotation techniques 40 it may generate very small bubbles with a diameter of 300 600 μm on average or 360 950 μm mean sauter diameter as opposed to a mean sauter diameter of 2000 3000 μm in a conventional mechanical cell or column flotations 41 removal of small particles algae oil droplets phosphorus soil remediation and lipids from wastes 42 43 and organics recovery 44 is another application of jameson cells a license to utilize a modified form of the jameson flotation cell technology for wastewater treatment was granted in 1994 43 despite its effectiveness in mineral processing its application to the treatment of wastewater is still not widespread limited application of jameson cell in wastewater treatment was reported in the literature 42 46 in a previous investigation taşdemir and co workers 45 employed the jameson cell to treat quartz sample size fractions of 53 38 μm 38 20 μm and 20 μm with three different solid ratios 0 06 0 1 and 0 5 to assess the efficacy of turbidity reduction the results for the larger sizes were somewhat successful the effectiveness of turbidity reduction was shown to be much higher when compared to particles smaller than 20 μm the solid ratio s impact on the efficiency of turbidity removal for all size fractions was also identified and it declined with decreasing particle concentrations in the literature there are several research studies aiming to establish the best operating conditions of jameson cell parameters by applying the design of experiments doe and some statistical models the jameson cell was optimized for fine coal cleaning by mohanty and honaker 47 utilizing the box behnken experimental design they explored how the product s combustible recovery ash and total sulphur levels and separation efficiency were affected by frother concentration superficial froth height gas velocity and wash water rate by using multiple linear and piecewise linear regression analyses taşdemir et al 48 evaluated the effects of the jameson cell s downcomer nozzle free jet dimensions and the ratio of air feed flowrate on gas hold up in a laboratory setting taşdemir et al 49 employed a multiple linear and piecewise linear regression model to show how the jameson cell s jet velocity nozzle diameter and jet length affect air entrainment and flow boundary characteristics niedoba et al 50 increased copper ore flotation in a jameson cell more recently by utilizing taxonomic methods however modeling and optimization of the floc flotation process parameters in the jameson cell for turbidity reduction and flotation recovery from suspended particles have not been studied in any published papers it is important to establish and optimize the jameson cell s optimum operating conditions with regard to well known key variables before using it in the floc flotation process to remove suspended fine particles the current work intends to reduce this gap by emphasizing feed flowrate flotation time and conditioning time that may affect the floc flotation performance of jameson cells additional parameters such as collector dosage flocculant dosage ph and frother dosage which may also be crucial for this procedure have been also investigated and are now being examined elsewhere this study aims to assess the appropriateness of jameson flotation cells in cleaning synthetic wastewater created using quartz as the pollutant material the tests were conducted using pure quartz with a screen size of 20 μm and a central composite design based on three factors and five levels to examine the effects of feed flow rate flotation time and conditioning time on the residual turbidity and flotation recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 material the quartz sample was supplied from çine aydın region in turkey the sample used in the studies was crushed ground in a ball mill and screened by a 20 μm screen malvern mastersizer 2000 particle size analyser was used to evaluate the volumetric size distribution of the sample and the results are displayed in fig 1 it was found that 90 of the sample s particle diameter was 28 27 μm and that 50 of the solid particles in the suspension had diameters 13 23 μm the chemical composition of the quartz sample was determined using x ray fluorescence xrf and the mineralogical analysis of the particles was evaluated using x ray diffraction xrd fig 2 and table 1 respectively provide the xrd and xrf data fig 2 shows that the sample mainly consists of quartz as shown by the xrd examination according to the xrf data the sample is made up of 95 56 sio2 and 2 36 al2o3 table 1 2 2 floc flotation in jameson cell with assistance from prof dr greame jameson a laboratory style jameson cell shown in fig 3 with a 3 mm nozzle diameter 25 mm downcomer diameter 170 cm length 145 mm cell diameter and 70 cm plunge depth was produced at the university of newcastle in australia and installed at the mineral processing laboratory of eskişehir osmangazi university in turkey table 2 lists the general features of the jameson cell utilized in the tests during the floc flotation experiments in the jameson cell a continuous recycling method was employed the unfloated materials were feedback to the conditioner tank and then pumped back to the jameson cell fig 3 there are three primary areas that make up the jameson cell 51 53 the downcomer when bubbles and particles first come into contact a high pressure jet is produced when feed pulp is forced through an aperture plate into the downcomer air that has been naturally aspirated is sheared by the descending jet of liquid before being entrained particles come into contact and aggregate quickly as a result of the fast mixing velocity and huge interfacial area the separation tank cell where bubbles and particles come into touch again and separate from the pulp in the pulp zone of the separation tank the aerated mixture moves from the downcomer the froth zone where the particles which are attached to bubbles and entrained in the froth are removed throughout the experiments the solution parameters of the wastewater were held constant slurry volume in conditioning tank 20 l ph 8 solid ratio 0 06 collector dosage 500 g t frother dosage 30 ppm anionic flocculant dosage 100 g t the suspension s initial turbidity value was determined as 220 ntu nephelometric turbidity unit table 3 the general flowsheet of the current research is summarized in fig 4 each jameson cell floc flotation experiment began with the complete dispersion of the low concentrated slurry in the feed tank for 10 min at 700 rpm the slurry was then conditioned with an aeromine 3030c collector at 500 rpm for predefined conditioning time values in accordance with the ccd design followed by 30 ppm of af65 frother at 500 rpm for an additional 2 min in a conventional floc flotation application of the jameson cell flocculant and untreated water are both delivered simultaneously into the top of the downcomer 42 in this study before the slurry is fed into the downcomer fig 3 a flocculant is introduced to the conditioning tank by slowing the stirring rate in order to consider the effects of flocculation time the 20 l slurry was then mixed for an extra one minute at 300 rpm after being given 100 g t of spp 508 flocculant the combined slurry was then pumped at a fixed feed rate in by the ccd design to a 3 mm downcomer nozzle with a constant jet length of 3 cm air bubbles are highly helpful during flocculation because they are retained within the flocs that are produced due to their collaboration the aggregated particles float independently of the surface characteristics ensuring buoyancy the separation tank which functions as a disengagement zone receives all of the flocs and trapped bubbles within the flocs after they have descended to the bottom of the downcomer in the separating tank aerated floc formations in the sludge float to the top and are removed from there until the conclusion of the predetermined flotation duration which accordance with the ccd design the leftover water was fed back into the conditioning tank in a closed circuit after finishing each experiment the residual turbidity of clarified water was measured using an hf scientific turbidimeter in units of ntu and the flotation recovery was calculated by filtering drying and weighing the floating material 2 3 central composite design of experiments central composite experiment design ccd which is one of the most popular response surface methodologies 54 was used in the experiment design and execution there are three phases in this process the process begins with statistically planned experiments after which the coefficients and outcomes of the resulting mathematical model are calculated the model was then validated the best scenario providing the lowest residual turbidity and the highest flotation recovery was identified and this scenario is tested designing and evaluating of experiments were carried out by using the trial versions of design expert 7 0 and 13 0 software the formula n 2 k 2 k n 0 in the ccd was used to determine how many tests are necessary when the number of parameters is 5 54 where n is the total number of experiments n 0 is the number of trials carried out at the parameter centers and k is the number of variables this study had 17 experiments in all with the centre points being performed three times table 4 provides both coded and actual values of the tested parameters in the ccd the feed flow rate a varied between 4 5 and 8 5 l min the flotation time b varied between 60 and 300 s and the conditioning time c varied between 60 and 540 s as indicated in table 4 the response variables were the flotation recovery and the residual turbidity value ntu table 5 displays the floc flotation experimental settings in the jameson cell using the 3 factors and 5 levels ccd as well as the resulting values of residual turbidity and flotation recovery 3 results and discussion after doing the ccd experiments in randomized order we attempted to analyse the design outcomes if the responses data required a data transformation the box cox plots were produced after the second order models for residual turbidity and flotation recovery responses were run fig 5 according to fig 5 the optimal lambda value is 0 04 for turbidity whereas the present lambda value is 1 the fact that this number exceeds the confidence intervals suggests that the turbidity data needs to undergo a logarithmic adjustment the box cox plot of flotation recovery on the other hand reveals that its best lambda value is 1 99 whilst its current lambda value is 1 however no data processing is required for flotation recovery because its lambda value is within the confidence range fig 5 after applying the logarithmic transformation on residual turbidity generated box cox plot is displayed in fig 6 as seen the current lambda value was zero which was quite near to the best lambda value of 0 04 and it is within the confidence intervals 3 1 statistical analysis the experimental results obtained based on the ccd are depicted in table 5 a summary of the fitted model statistics based on the linear 2fi interactive quadratic and cubic regression models are summarized in table 6 for the residual turbidity and in table 7 for the flotation recovery the design expert software suggested the quadratic models for both residual turbidity and flotation recovery in the model statistics of tables 6 and 7 the models focus on maximizing the adjusted r 2 and the predicted r 2 as seen the adjusted r 2 values of the quadratic model for the residual turbidity table 6 and cubic model for the flotation recovery table 7 are higher than the other models these indicate that the models should include the interaction terms 55 in addition in spite of the quadratic model the recommended by design expert for flotation recovery was found to be significant and the lack of fit value was also significant p 0 0352 0 05 table 7 however the response model can be trustworthy if the model is significant p 0 05 it s the lack of fit should be insignificant p 0 05 the r 2 is 0 9 and the adjusted r 2 is 0 8 56 58 when the researcher faces the relevance of a fitted second order model s lack of fit while establishing the correlation between the input and response variables sequential third order response surface designs are useful 59 sequential third order response surface designs are helpful when a researcher must consider the implications of a fitted second order model s lack of fit 59 therefore a third order model which includes linear quadratic cubic and significant interaction factors was used to re analyse the flotation recovery data 3 2 evaluation of anova table for residual turbidity and flotation recovery the analysis of variance anova tables are presented in table 8 for residual turbidity and in table 9 for flotation recovery in the tables model terms are significant at the 95 confidence level when prob f values are 0 05 statistically significant model terms at a 95 confidence level were shown as bold in tables 8 and 9 table 8 displays anova table for the reduced log transformed residual turbidity response following the exclusion of the irrelevant model factors the quadratic model is significant as evidenced by the model f value of 40 27 at 95 confidence level the f value of the model is just 0 01 likely to happen due to noise the significant model parameters were a b ab bc b 2 and c 2 the model parameters which have p values higher than 0 100 are insignificant the f value of 1 67 indicates that the lack of fit is negligible p 0 4213 in comparison to the pure error a 42 13 chance exists that noise will result in a substantial lack of fit value eq 1 was developed for the residual turbidity using coded variables and without the impact of the ac term due to their hierarchical influence the c and a 2 terms which are similarly insignificant in the quadratic model at the 95 significance level are included in the model table 8 provides evidence that the significance degree of the significant terms is ranked in the following order flotation time b the interaction between flotation time and conditioning time bc the linear impact of feed flow rate a feed flow rate and flotation time interaction ab the quadratic effect of flotation time b 2 and quadratic effect of conditioning time c 2 the model is capable of explaining 97 58 r 2 of the total variations in residual turbidity as a function of the factors under investigation the adjusted r 2 of 0 9515 is almost the same as the predicted r 2 of 0 9758 1 log y turbidity 1 25 0 05 a 0 12 b 0 0041 c 0 061 ab 0 094 bc 0 021 a 2 0 045 b 2 0 042 c 2 the anova table of the reduced third order model fitted is given in table 9 for flotation recovery table 9 indicates the insignificance of lack of fit p 0 1533 0 05 the model developed is significant at a 5 significance level p 0 0004 0 05 as seen clearly the main effects of feed flow rate a and flotation time b second order effects of flotation time b 2 and conditioning time c 2 second order interaction between flotation time and conditioning recovery bc third order interaction between feed flowrate and flotation time a 2 b and triple interaction between feed flowrate flotation time and conditioning time abc are significant model terms for flotation recovery following reduced cubic eq 2 was determined using the third order model to improve the lack of fit after the irrelevant terms were removed and the hierarchically effective terms were added as can be observed there are additional interaction terms that have a total of three exponents in the simplified cubic model abc a 2 b and a 2 c it is possible to refer to these interaction terms as a heterogeneous third order model 59 eq 2 could explain the total variance of 99 50 2 y recovery 82 47 6 65 a 8 13 b 1 03 c 0 12 ab 0 58 ac 1 70 bc 0 84 a 2 3 45 b 2 1 18 c 2 1 83 abc 3 13 a 2 b 1 38 a 2 c fig 7 depicts the residual turbidity and flotation recovery that was observed and that was predicted by eqs 1 and 2 respectively they demonstrate a great match between the estimated and real turbidity fig 7a and flotation recovery fig 7b values fig 7a and b indicate that the proposed models were appropriate for assessing residual turbidity and flotation recovery as responses 3 3 effects of main factors on residual turbidity and flotation recovery according to tables 8 and 9 both the residual turbidity and flotation recovery are primarily affected by the first order of feed flow rate a flotation time b second order of flotation time b 2 and conditioning time c 2 while interactions between feed flow rate and flotation time ab and flotation time and conditioning time bc also have a significant impact fig 8 shows the perturbation plots which examine the individual effects of the parameters visually by altering one factor while the other factors are kept constant the flotation time is more significant than the other parameters for the residual turbidity the turbidity is affected quadratically by every parameter in general turbidity diminishes fig 8a and flotation recovery increases fig 8b quadratic manner as flotation time increases if the flotation period is prolonged unfloated flocs will float which reduces residual turbidity and increases the flotation recovery when the feed flowrate increased a quadratic increase in residual turbidity and a linear increase in flotation recovery were observed the increased feed flow rate may cause flocculated particles to break apart increasing the supernatant turbidity compared to other factors the conditioning time had less influence on both residual turbidity and flotation recovery 3 4 effects of factors interactions on residual turbidity and flotation recovery the cubic plots in fig 9 illustrate the combined actions of three independent factors on turbidity fig 9a and flotation recovery fig 9b increasing the feed flowrate a at high levels of flotation time b and at low or high levels of conditioning time had essentially little effect on the turbidity c however increasing input flow rate a led to an increase in turbidity at low flotation time levels b and at high or low conditioning levels c high levels of flotation time b high levels of feed flow rate a and low levels of conditioning time c produced the lowest turbidity of 13 40 ntu when the jameson cell was run at high levels of feed flow rate a low levels of flotation time b and conditioning time c the turbidity reached the maximum value of 47 71 ntu on the other hand increasing feed flow rate a at all levels of flotation time b and conditioning time c had a favorable influence on flotation recovery whether flotation time is low or high increasing conditioning time improves recovery similar to this recovery rises with increasing conditioning time at both low and high feed flow rates with the exception of high flotation times with longer conditioning times and higher feed flow rates the recovery declined from 91 91 to 88 51 the strong triple interaction between the three factors abc may be responsible for this table 9 the three low level factors yielded a minimum recovery of 64 02 the highest recovery 91 91 was feasible at the high level of flotation time and feed flow rate and at the low level of conditioning time as shown in fig 9b in a previous work 46 enhanced floating duration increased the effectiveness of particle removal recovery and decreased the residual turbidity of flocculated marble waste particles in jameson flotation cell 3 5 optimization for residual turbidity and flotation recovery the overlay plot shown in fig 10 was utilized to identify the optimum process conditions achieving the lowest supernatant turbidity and highest flotation recovery both residual turbidity and flotation recovery were primarily influenced by the feed flow rate and flotation duration the overlay plot s minimum and maximum allowable turbidity values were set at 13 5 and 15 ntu respectively and the flotation recovery value was set at 87 in the yellow area of fig 10 the overlay plot depicts the floc flotation process conditions in the jameson cell when the turbidity is between 13 5 and 15 ntu with a flotation recovery of 87 in this graph the yellow region represents the ideal point which has a minimum turbidity of 13 54 ntu and a maximum flotation recovery of 91 98 this optimization research showed that a desirability value of 0 9539 may be achieved with minimal residual turbidity and maximum flotation recovery of around 13 54 ntu and 91 98 respectively the design expert software determined that a feed flowrate of 7 7 l min a flotation time of 251 s and a conditioning time of 178 s were the optimum process condition for the floc flotation in the jameson cell according to tables 8 and 9 there are significant interactions that affect both residual turbidity and flotation recovery between flotation time b and the other two variables in order to gain a better understanding of the interaction effects between the input parameters 3d plots for the measured responses residual turbidity and flotation recovery were drawn based on the model equations developed the 3d plots on the interaction effects of two input parameters were shown for feed flow rate a and flotation time b in fig 11 and for the flotation time b and conditioning time c in fig 12 in these plots the remaining parameter was held constant at its optimized level the 3d plots shown in fig 11 present the interaction effect of feed flow rate a and flotation time b on residual turbidity and flotation recovery at an optimized level of conditioning time of 178 s fig 11 indicates that when the conditioning time was kept constant at its optimum value of 178 s the residual turbidity was almost not changed but flotation recovery reached its maximum by increasing the feed flow rate at the optimal flotation time of 251 s however if the flotation time was reduced to 109 s residual turbidity reached maximum and flotation recovery also decreased at the optimal feed flow rate of 7 7 l min some important operating parameters affect the other critical parameters and hence flotation recovery in the jameson cell it will be feasible to ascertain how various operational factors impact the effectiveness of particle collection by looking into the collecting mechanisms within the downcomer the downcomer s design functioning and particle collection may all be optimized with the usage of this information 41 for example simply increasing the feed flowrate increases the jet velocity and air entrainment rate also increases and also the jet length in the jameson cell the jet velocity rises when the feed flow rate to the downcomer is increased 48 in this study the jet length was kept constant as 3 cm in the experiments at constant jet length as the feed flow rate increases the jet velocity and air quantity entered into the downcomer increase hence the air entrainment rate and hold up also increase by increasing the jet velocity 48 the jet velocity that is produced when the feed flow rate is changed affects the downcomer and separation tank residence time in addition the bubble size increased with increased jet velocity 41 and the residence time of flocculated particles in the downcomer and in the separation tank decreased due to the higher rising velocity of larger bubbles as the air rate in a jameson cell downcomer is raised the height of the bubble mixture and consequently the residence duration decrease 51 as a result faster flotation is achieved and the flotation recovery increases even at lower flotation times fig 11 in addition higher air rates by raising the jet velocity increase the energy input into the downcomer and cause an increase in turbulence this gives particles a very high chance of colliding and attaching and improves the flotation recovery for coarse particles it also leads to a higher chance of detachment 60 in the case of flocculated particles turbidity removal efficiency decreased while increasing the feed flow rate at low flotation time while higher turbulence does stimulate particle and bubble collision in the downcomer the flotation recovery increases with increasing jet velocity due to increased feed flow rate however higher turbulence also promotes particle detachment therefore some of the flocculated particles might be broken and the residual turbidity increased at low flotation time by increasing the feed flow rate fig 11 if the flotation time is prolonged these particles might find to attach to air bubbles again hence flotation efficiency in terms of turbidity removal and recovery increased as seen in fig 11 it appears that attachment and detachment of flocculated particles were in balance under the optimal flotation condition where the feed flow rate of 7 7 l min flotation time of 251 s and 178 s of conditioning time fig 12 shows the 3d plots for the relationship between flotation time b and conditioning time c at an optimum feed flow rate of 7 7 l min the duration of flotation has an impact on the retention time of the flocculated particles in the jameson cell the least hydrophobic particles require more time to be returned to the product stream whereas the strongest hydrophobic particles may be floated in the lowest retention period 61 as can be seen in fig 12 at the low level of conditioning time increasing the flotation time led to an improvement in both residual turbidity and flotation recovery in the jameson cell when the flotation duration was increased from 109 s to 251 s at low levels of conditioning time and flotation time both residual turbidity and flotation recovery decreased substantially at the low level of flotation time increasing conditioning time had a positive effect on the turbidity of clarified water and flotation recovery at the high level of conditioning time both turbidity removal efficiency and flotation recovery were much lesser than those obtained at a low level of conditioning time the lowest residual turbidity and the highest flotation recovery were obtained at the low level of conditioning time and at the high level of flotation time this result indicates that hydrodynamic conditions and longer residence time in the jameson cell are more effective during the floc flotation of suspended particles in an amine quartz system henwood 62 reported that changes in conditioning time have no measurable effect on flotation recovery in addition to the rapid diffuse and fast reaction of amine molecules henwood 62 suggested dual function of amines collector and frother is responsible for this effect over conditioning may have caused hydrophobic agglomeration of quartz particles because of the amines rapid adsorption rate on the quartz surface the increased weight of the flocculated particles may therefore enhance the likelihood that flocculated quartz particles may detach from bubbles leading to higher residual turbidity and reduced flotation recovery in the case of floc flotation quartz with amine and anionic flocculant however somasundaran and lee 63 reported that interactions between polymers and surfactants have a large impact on the process s performance the increased flotation recovery is dependent to a larger extent on the anionic polymer s salting out of the amine due to its greater affinity for hydration and to a lesser extent on the development of an amine anionic polymer complex by electrostatic interaction between an anionic polymer and an amine may improve quartz flotation recovery 63 fig 13 for residual turbidity and flotation recovery presents perturbation plots that aid in comparing the effects of all factors at optimized points according to fig 13 altering the value of a factor toward its optimal point has an impact on both residual turbidity fig 13a and flotation recovery fig 13b from the point of minimum turbidity the residual turbidity increased drastically with decreasing flotation time b significantly increased with increasing conditioning time c and nearly did not change with lowering feed flow rate a on the other hand a reduction in flotation recovery was the result of parameter departure from the optimal point both the feed flow rate a and the flotation period b had a remarkably similar effect when both were reduced from their ideal levels and reduced flotation recovery on the other hand as conditioning time increased the flotation recovery slightly declined c two confirmation experiments were conducted to verify the optimal circumstances test results revealed that the flotation recovery was 91 5 and the residual turbidity was 13 93 ntu this score represents that the models proposed have a high level of accuracy 4 cost estimation and comparison in recent years it has been seen that various methods including flotation membrane separation and filtration can be successfully applied in removing fine particles from wastewater in addition to sedimentation with coagulation flocculation however numerous studies have also been conducted on the treatment methods and their cost estimates 64 70 in general the cost comparison of methods can vary depending on the equipment utilized wastewater type and flow rate difference in design and operational parameters of the many systems type and amount of chemicals added an overall comparison of specific costs of different unit processes such as sedimentation flotation and filtration coagulation physical biological treatment is given in table 10 it is seen that the flotation method is more expensive than the sedimentation method but may have a higher treatment performance with low residence times fast throughput and high efficiency the capital and operating costs of flotation systems for the treatment of wastewater can vary significantly depending on a number of factors including the type of flotation system being used e g dissolved air flotation daf or induced air flotation iaf the flow rate and characteristics of the wastewater being treated the level of treatment required and the location and type of facility where the system will be installed in general the capital cost of a flotation system can include the cost of purchasing the equipment itself as well as any associated infrastructure or ancillary equipment required for its operation operating costs can include the cost of energy maintenance and repair and consumables such as chemicals and replacement parts it is difficult to estimate the capital and operating costs of the jameson flotation cell without more information about the specific application and requirements of the cell however there have been a few research conducted on performance and cost analysis clayton 70 made project cost estimates for recovering organic from the raffinate by using jameson cell clayton 70 stated that a jameson cell capital cost requiring all equipment and site preparation is about 100 per gallon us minute 18 35 per m3 day to be treated wastewater this includes electrical pumping site preparation piping equipment and installation in addition the organic recovery cost has been determined as 0 14 m3 for 1000 gpm feeding capacity hadley et al 71 estimated the cost analysis of the jameson cell to be used in the recovery of fine coal jameson cell model 6000 10 was selected for a 9000 gpm flow rate and is priced at 159 500 including remote instrumentation and controls clean coal production cost was determined as 0 73 mmbtu 0 028 m3 based on above information it is estimated that the capital and operating costs of the jameson flotation cell for a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 1000 m3 day may be approximately 50 000 150 000 and 0 2 1 1 m3 respectively daf is the most widely used flotation method especially for the removal of suspended particles and oils from wastewater hanafy and nabih 66 have stated that the estimated costs of coagulation and daf for 1000 m3 day at 200 mg l oil input concentration the total construction investment is 500 000 and the operational cost per m3 of wastewater is 0 22 woodward et al 67 mentioned that a daf plant to treat 1200 gpm of poultry processing waste was constructed at a cost of approximately 75 000 the daily operational costs were 141 the net operating cost per 1000 gal was 0 07 in another study the operating costs of the system which includes coagulation flocculation settling and filtration units are given as 0 25 1 50 m3 69 the cost of ultrafiltration treatment for metalworking and fatty acid industry effluent was 2 65 and 2 8 m3 64 68 according to pelendridou et al s investigation 72 into the feasibility of coagulation flocculation for the treatment of oily wastewater the operating cost of coagulation was between 0 43 and 2 0 m3 in general daf can be characterized as a high retention time process leading to large equipment sizes using small quantities of air in contrast to iaf however due because a feed pump is required as auxiliary equipment jameson cell is frequently relatively cost competitive in most cost components the cell contains minimal spare components no moving parts and is easy to use and maintain it has a compact size low capital cost low power consumption low maintenance costs low residence times and fast throughput 43 5 conclusions the use and optimization of response surface modeling based on central composite design allowed for the evaluation of the impacts of feed flow rate flotation time and conditioning time on the floc flotation success for residual turbidity and flotation recovery in the jameson flotation cell process the second order model was determined to describe best the residual turbidity since it was significant and its lack of fit was negligible for the flotation recovery a third order model that was statistically meaningful and did not suffer from lack of fit was developed chancing the feed flow rate which affects the jet velocity air quantity residence time and turbulence in the downcomer of jameson cell altered the hydrodynamic conditions in the downcomer it was shown that in addition to feed flowrate flotation time was found to be much more significant than the conditioning time on the floc flotation efficiency for the removal of suspended particles from diluted suspensions in addition to their individual effects double interactions between feed flow rate and flotation time and flotation time and conditioning time on both response and triple interaction of the factors on the flotation recovery were significant on flotation recovery optimization studies aiming for the lowest residual turbidity and maximum flotation recovery showed that the best combinations of the parameters were found to be feed flow rate of 7 7 l min flotation duration of 251 s and conditioning time of 178 s with a forecast of 13 54 ntu supernatant turbidity and 91 98 flotation recovery at this condition the probability of attachment and detachment of flocculated particles was in balance both flotation recovery and residual turbidity were adversely impacted if the parameters were off optimal the flotation recovery was significantly lowered and the residual turbidity was raised as flotation duration was shortened from the ideal point the flotation recovery declined significantly when the feed flowrate dropped below its optimal point while the residual turbidity was little impacted longer conditioning times from the optimal point had a greater negative impact on residual turbidity and a somewhat smaller negative impact on flotation recovery additional tests conducted to validate the ideal condition yielded outcomes that were remarkably consistent with those predicted the two developed mathematical models may be utilized conveniently to estimate optimum floc flotation process conditions in the jameson cell for the flotation recovery as well as residual turbidity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

12602,water distribution systems wdss leverage the recent technological advancements in sensor technologies and cyber physical systems cpss for better processing distribution and delivery of clean water given the digital nature of cpss they can be vulnerable to different kinds of cyber threats especially in cases where adversaries can conceal the state of the attack if an adversary state or non

significant digital transformation to enable data driven monitoring and utility operations control the addition of cyber elements aims to make these cpss systems more effective however that comes with a trade off systems become increasingly vulnerable to security and safety threats 2 4 for instance the recent targeting of infrastructure in ukraine reminds us of the risk of attacks on critical infrastructure including cyberattacks on wdss according to unicef as of may 1 4 million people in eastern ukraine were without access to safe water from public water systems 1 1 www peopleinneed net in ukraine we are supplying water to tens of thousands of people 8921gp we are supplying water to tens of thousands of people in eastern ukraine another example in 2013 hackers seized control of a small florida dam that released unprocessed water to nearby communities 4 besides that on february 5th 2021 a florida water treatment plant in oldsmar fl was compromised the hacker altered the levels of sodium hydroxide in the water a chemical that would severely damage any human tissue it touches 5 this event suggests that current wds control utility operations are mainly exposed and continuously vulnerable to attackers requiring sophisticated learning algorithms that can estimate the system s state detect inconsistencies and outliers and mitigate the harm done by such events ai has numerous advantages for detecting anomalies in wdss including those caused by cyberattacks which are harder for humans to detect than kinetic attacks wds human observers cannot detect all anomalies and even when they become aware of an anomaly they often misinterpret it the frailties of human beings in interpreting data from complex systems have been cataloged by sociologist charles perrow in an important book 6 about the causes of nuclear accidents the same kinds of human shortcomings in interpreting complex data are evident in after action reports about the deepwater horizon oil spill which among other things recommend increased use of ai to prevent future spills 7 humans have created systems that are too complex for them to monitor effectively and they need help from ai but the potential applications of the technologies that the authors describe are not limited to cyberattacks and wdss many sewage spills result from leaks in antiquated underground systems that can go undetected for example in july 2020 an old pipe broke in new haven connecticut no one noticed until a citizen saw raw sewage on the street the next morning and called the authorities two million

critical infrastructure that ought to be safe secure and reliable in delivering water for all intended purposes despite the stochastic nature of the wdss operational processes many artificial intelligence ai algorithms can help with early attack prediction or anomaly detection 8 attack detection models using ai require data representing the physical structure and the temporal behaviors of the wdss a wds consists of a network of reservoirs pumps storage tanks pipes junctions valves and taps usually spread across a geographical dimension in most cases the models are developed using data streams from scada systems to classify if the system is running safely or not scada collects real time distributed field data measurements including water flow rates pump status and pressure sensor readings then transmits them measurements to a central server because of the complex interdependencies among different nodes dl models are better suited to computationally represent the system 9 machine learning ml models including ensemble learning models are a good choice for small and simple networks 10 however the increasing number of nodes in a network such as in wdss creates non linear relationships among them according to sikder et al 10 dl models can capture non linear relationships in a distributed network system more effectively when compared to ml models therefore our work aims to address the security of wdss by building robust and generalized dl models despite the recent advancements in computing technology wds has security flaws because of its dependency on decade old network devices therefore an attacker can easily eavesdrop on the communication between the network and the central control system additionally adversaries can send malicious attacks by spoofing sensor measurements concealing the intended attacks from the operators sight 11 these attacks are also known as concealed attacks fortunately such attacks have a digital and physical footprint in the network such as sensor value deviation from the norm or water flow rate changes during high demand hours statistically these abnormal events can be considered anomalies which a suitable learning algorithm can detect for instance what if the attacker conceals these anomalies or sensor measurements by sending replay attacks a replay attack 12 occurs when a cyber criminal eavesdrops on secure network communication intercept and delay signals to misdirect the receiver in stealthy attacks 13 since attackers conceal the physical layer it becomes difficult to detect these attacks by using anomaly detection based models for example taormina et al 14 presented difficulties associated with ml algorithms to detect concealed attacks in wdss in comparison with dl algorithms dl algorithms are key for estimations in such complex ecosystems the batadal data that we use here consist of a wds operator for c town public utility cpu with anomalous low or overflowing tank levels showing up during stealthy attacks 8 1 2 background of cybersecurity in wds advanced wdss constitute tens or hundreds of internet of things iots devices including sensors and actuators this complex connectivity makes the system vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks 15 cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated via minimally perturbed signals that go unnoticed to a human operator or a traditional expert system 15 therefore intelligent algorithms such as dl are deemed necessary for detecting cyberattacks 16 cyber attacks on water distribution systems can take many forms according to a survey paper 3 one type is data poisoning in which an attacker alters or corrupts data in a system to cause it to malfunction or present incorrect outcomes another type is ransomware in which an attacker encrypts a system s data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key other types of attacks on water distribution systems include denial of service attacks i e an attacker floods a system with traffic to prevent legitimate users from accessing it and unauthorized access where an attacker gains access to a system without permission these attacks can have serious consequences on water treatment and supply including contamination disruption of service and financial loss to the wds dl algorithms can be trained on large amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a cyber attack for example an ai algorithm can be trained to recognize network traffic patterns typical of a denial of service attack and then use this information to block similar traffic in the future 17 ai based intrusion detection systems ids are also used to detect and prevent cyber attacks on water distribution systems these systems can use a combination of ai algorithms and rule based systems to detect unusual activity in the network moreover ai can be used to optimize the security of water distribution systems by automating many of the tasks that are currently performed manually for example ai based systems can automatically update security configurations and patch vulnerabilities reducing the risk of successful attacks 3 it is important to note that the use of ai in cybersecurity research for water distribution systems is still in its early stages 3 and more research is needed to understand these technologies capabilities and limitations fully however ai s potential to enhance these systems security is significant and it is expected that the use of ai in cybersecurity for water distribution systems will continue to grow 1 3 our contribution dl models make decisions based on either a black box environment or a non deterministic approach without assessing robustness and generalizability dl models deployment stage becomes unreliable we address these two key components robustness and generalizability and present the deep h 2 o framework that consists of two models tgcn with attention a supervised model and hcae an unsupervised model key contributions are the following the study uses tgcn with attention and hcae models to identify cybersecurity threats in wds considering both time sequential and non sequential aspects tgcn with attention captures spatial correlations in graph data and global temporal dynamics understands complex interdependencies among sensor readings and leverages graph convolutional network gcn 18 19 gated recurrent unit gru 20 attention mechanism 21 22 19 and robust manalanobis distance rmd 23 for anomaly detection tgcn with attention provided better performance than the baseline tgcn model hcae uses a dimensionality reduction technique ann based dl architecture custom hidden layers and constraints for a robust and well generalized model that achieves an improved attack classification performance when compared to baseline ae models the study assesses both models using original and synthetically generated samples compares the performance of the supervised and unsupervised models and justifies which model is better during a cyber physical attack in a wds to check for generalizability and robustness a synthetic test dataset is generated using gan 24 in the manuscript we introduce the following three research hypotheses 1 research question 1 ai assurance how do ai assurance 25 constraints such as layer customization attention and rmd improve models performance 2 research question 2 data poisoning can models generalizability in wdss be tested using poisoned data generated by gans 3 research question 3 feature localization how can the two models localize features based on embedded and learned representations in a given feature space i e in a water system our study presents a novel approach for detecting cyber physical attacks in wds using tgcn with attention and hcae models we incorporate ai assurance methods 26 and constraints to improve the performance of these models we also evaluate the models on both original and synthetic datasets and compare their performance using various evaluation metrics such as f1 score precision recall and time to detection our results show that both models can detect attacks in a wds with high accuracy and efficiency tgcn with attention and hcae models can be promising approaches for detecting cyber physical attacks in wds we also explain attack localization by identifying the attacked node during attack windows in a time efficient manner the rest of the paper is structured as follows we present related works in section 2 we introduce methods in section 3 specifically tgcn with attention and then hcae then we describe our experimental design for the study in section 4 section 5 provides results and explanations finally section 6 presents our concluding remarks 2 related work given the constantly growing use of cpss the uses of ai in cpss in various applications also grow 27 28 29 this section discusses the related dl approaches for cpss especially multivariate time series data we provide related works for supervised and unsupervised models in cpss and present adversarial data generation approaches using gans finally we present wds security works using ai methods 2 1 temporal graph convolutional network tgcn architecture was first designed and developed by zhao et al 30 for traffic prediction in 2018 the model helps to capture spatial and temporal relationships in feature space it consists of gcns and grus which allow it to learn complex topological structures to capture spatial dependencies and the dynamic changes in the data to capture temporal dependencies in 2020 zhu et al 31 proposed architecture on top of tgcn with an attention mechanism this attention mechanism improves prediction accuracy by adjusting the importance of different time points and assembling global temporal information we transfer this knowledge from their study and adopt an attention mechanism in the wdss to improve forecasting to our best knowledge neither zhao et al s 30 nor zhu et al s 31 architecture has been applied to wds before in another study covert et al 32 succeeded in creating a different architecture of tgcn in 2019 for automatic seizure detection unlike the tgcn architecture proposed by zhao et al 30 their approach consists of several spatio temporal convolutional stc layers the stc layer does not contain any gru but a 1 dimensional convolution to each of its input sequences 32 stc layer operates on the input sequences in a way that allows the graph topology to be maintained at each layer it then refers to the adjacency matrix of structural time series to aggregate neighboring features 32 this architecture is then applied for cyber physical attack detection on the batadal dataset 33 with good results compared to the benchmark values tsiami et al 33 proposed a one stage prediction based algorithm that uses covert et al s tgcn for sensor prediction and md for anomaly detection although the results are promising the model can still be potentially improved by replacing the md metric with the rmd metric 2 2 autoencoder the use of dl methods for anomaly detection has recently achieved improvements in learning high dimensional datasets 34 to eliminate outliers and noise without prior knowledge a deep ae can be a helpful model 35 a book 36 on outlier detection discusses how aes are a natural choice for outlier detection since they are often used to reduce multidimensional datasets the ae model presented at 35 discovers high quality nonlinear features this approach includes splitting the input data into two sets to increase the robustness of the model the work results show good performance since they distinguish between random anomalies and other structured corruptions in cps data sun et al 37 proposed a novel sparse representation framework that learns dictionaries based on the latent space of variational autoencoder vae this framework addresses the limitation of most existing algorithms that can handle large scale and high dimensional data their proposed model can obtain hidden information and extract more high level features by playing the role of dimensionality reduction another work 38 addresses unsupervised anomaly detection on high dimensional data this work aims to address the limitation in existing unsupervised anomaly detection approaches that suffer from decoupled model learning with conflicting optimization goals this paper presented a deep autoencoding gaussian model dagmm for unsupervised anomaly detection dagmm optimizes the deep autoencoder and mixture model parameters jointly to help with the parameter learning of the mixture model this joint optimization helps the autoencoder further reduce reconstruction errors our study focuses on ae reconstruction error reduction and attack detection performance maximization 2 3 generative adversarial networks generative models including gans provide a way to learn deep representations without extensively annotating training data 24 the inspiration for this idea comes from the two player sum game between neural networks where they balance each other out with gains and losses gan consists of a generator and discriminator the generator captures the potential distribution of real samples to generate new samples and the discriminator determines which samples are fake by discriminating which of the generated samples are real samples as accurately as possible 39 gan models are necessary for many dl applications such as security data augmentation and privacy preservation one work 39 stated that generative models understand data perspective using real data to fit the distribution parameters and produce new data using the learned distribution another paper 40 explained the gan framework by applying a range of benchmark datasets they used noise merely on the bottom layer of the generator network they claimed the samples resulting from their estimation method have somewhat high variance and produce competitive samples compared to the generative models in the literature their work did not require interference during the learning allowing them to incorporate various functions into the model however the model has disadvantages the discriminator must be synchronized well with the generator to avoid the probability of placing the generator in a small area of data space furthermore zhou 41 introduced gan on the batadal datasets to create a virtual testbed for wdss their approach computes the membership distance between the dimensions and then divides the dimensions with a small distance into a group then they obtained a larger quantity of attack sample control data by expanding the attack sample another paper 42 addresses the imbalanced and missing sample data used for intrusion detection systems idss to defend against cps attacks they proposed to generate synthetic samples using gans so the ids gets trained using them as well as the originals their results showed improvements in attack detection and model stabilization however they did not provide any direction for balancing data classes in our study we generate synthetic balanced data using gan for testing our models generalizability 2 4 security for wdss the security aspects of water distribution have a wide variety of potential solutions kadosh et al 43 presented a one classifier approach to detect attacks in wdss their approach uses a support vector data description svdd algorithm to classify normal vs anomalous behavior min et al 44 proposed an ann based dl algorithm to detect cyber attacks taormina et al 14 developed an approach that uses aes to detect and localize intrusion attacks in a wd zou et al 45 proposed an event detection model to detect and mitigate water contamination in their approach they proposed a hybrid model that comprises an ann and a support vector machine svm to detect the contamination events bagherzadeh et al 46 evaluated the effects of different feature selection methods on enhancing the model prediction performance of total nitrogen in wastewater treatment plants furthermore they analyzed the importance of different characteristics namely time climate hydraulic flow and wastewater characteristics in predicting energy consumption 47 their study suggested that the gradient boosting machine algorithm exhibits a better performance in forecasting energy consumption when compared to other ml algorithms mehrani et al 48 proposed a hybrid model that combines a mechanistic model and ml model to predict the liquid n20 concentrations their results suggest that a hybrid model that combines a mechanistic model and an artificial neural network ann model performs better with limited availability of data additionally a significant amount of work has been reported on approaches to detect attacks in cps used in water treatment plants 49 furthermore yoong et al 50 designed an ml framework that can detect physical and software generated anomalies in continuous water treatment plants without false alarms adepu et al 15 designed and developed an expert system distributed attack detection dad that detects physical anomalies of a plant in real time operations this study is a succession of a prior work of adepu et al 51 where they developed an anomaly detection framework based on physical invariants derived for each stage of the plant design macas et al 52 claimed that present water treatment plants are complex and their spatio temporal relations need to be explored further the authors presented an unsupervised framework for anomaly detection called attention based convolutional lstm encoder decoder convlstm ed to capture temporal dependencies in another study zizzo et al 53 developed an adversarial attacker model that can compromise a subset of sensors and validate existing anomaly detection models in their study the attacker manipulates the detector by hiding its presence similarly anthi et al 54 generated adversarial samples using the jacobian based saliency map attack and explored how adversarial learning can target the supervised models testing anomaly detection performance using an adversarial attacker model is a popular approach in wdss however based on our search applying gans as adversaries for testing the generalizability of the attack detection models in wdss is a novel study 3 deep h 2 o deep h 2 o fig 1 consists of two main parts 1 tgcn with attention and 2 hcae the supervised model tgcn with attention performs well with time series samples and offers contextual anomaly detection it is more aligned with the batadal case study where sensor relations in the distribution system require comprehensive monitoring additionally we expect that a wds end user i e operator might require ai models that consider the data samples as non time series for specific application requirements for example missing data thus we propose hcae an unsupervised model that works well with non sequential data samples this section presents the design of tgcn with attention and hcae models discusses concealed attack detection in a wds we discuss the design choice of gan to generate poisoned data fig 1 presents the high level overview of our proposed deep h 2 o framework that contains all the models together we present all three models consecutively and their respective outcome selection processes 3 1 c town data description batadal case study the batadal competition simulates an intrusion attack in a fictional c town fig 2a the wds in c town experiences anomalous behavior concealed attacks in its hydraulic components the wds in c town consists of 429 pipes 388 junctions 7 storage tanks 11 pumps 5 valves and a reservoir participants from the competition developed algorithms that detect attacks in the shortest time possible the algorithms aim to accurately detect true attacks i e fewer false alarms and locate nodes when the system has been altered during an attack 8 in c town the seven tanks guarantee water distribution and storage across the nodes t1 t7 c town s wds does not have abnormalities due to seasonal changes resulting in a fixed rate of water consumption a scada system collects data from the components of c town and work cohesively anomalous behaviors are shown using labeled physical abnormalities tables a 5 and b 6 that lead to harmful behaviors in the wds such as an overflow of a tank spotting these anomalies as quickly as possible will ensure the wds does not suffer from preventable damage the water levels of the seven water tanks determine the operations of components in the five pumping stations s1 s5 where one valve and eleven pumps are distributed also nine programmable logic controllers plcs are located near their control components these plcs can send information about their statuses such as on or off the flow rate information passes through them as well as suctions and discharges pressures to the scada system since they are connected to the water level sensors valves and pumps however most plcs receive information from other plcs instead of being connected to the water level sensors and components directly involved with the control logic batadal simulation consists of three datasets all the used data and model codes are available in the following github repository 3 github com ai vtrc deeph2o 3 dataset 1 dataset 1 consists of time series samples over a period of 12 months the instances in this dataset are recorded during normal operation hours with no attacks it has 44 features with 8 762 samples dataset 2 table a 5 consists of samples recorded over a period of three months april to june 2016 the samples in dataset 2 have 44 features the dataset consists of 4178 instances including the normal and attack samples dataset 3 this dataset also has 44 features including the attack labels with 2090 samples from tables a 5 and b 6 it is evident that both dataset 2 and dataset 3 contains a different type of attack samples table b 6 contains three months of data from january 2017 to april 2017 3 2 supervised deep learning tgcn with attention this section explains the mechanism of tgcn with attention rmd and the attack detection topology tsiami et al 33 proposed tgcn for the batadal competition since their model is not publicly available we developed our baseline tgcn model influenced by tsiami s model architecture we discuss the hyper parameter choices in the design section 4 2 1 supervised model design next we apply tgcn with attention as a supervised prediction based algorithm where rmd is used for detecting outliers 3 2 1 attention temporal graph convolutional network a structural wds multivariate time series dataset has a form x a when x ε ℝ n p contains n dimensional observation for p different sequences and x i denotes the systems values at time i we use a static graph technique since the number of dimensions n n is the number of nodes does not change over time a ε 0 1 p p is the adjacency matrix of the p sequences in tgcn with attention we apply gcn and gru to capture spatial and temporal dependencies respectively presented in the form of graph data furthermore we apply an attention mechanism to capture global variation in the structural data fig 3 shows the high level architecture of tgcn with the attention mechanism each method working principle is discussed in the following subsections spatial dependence modeling we consider wds as structural graph data where we consider each pump as a node and water flow rates as edges between nodes gcns are semi supervised models that can process graph structure and capture spatial dependencies in the wds graph structure recent works have shown that gcns have achieved significant progress in applications such as image classification 18 fraud detection 55 and social analysis 56 gcns have spectrum and spatial domain convolutions 18 19 details about gcn can be found in tsiami s 33 paper temporal dependence modeling the batadal dataset is considered a set of time series samples for supervised modeling a dl technique is introduced such as gru 20 for temporal dependence modeling there exist other popular techniques for capturing temporal data such as recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm 57 rnn is simple and effective for time series modeling but it has limitations in long term forecasting due to gradient vanishing or gradient explosion 58 lstm and gru are both proved 57 to be more efficient than rnn in long term memory modeling they use similar gated mechanisms which allows them to perform similar tasks 59 however gru has a simpler architecture than lstm gru is more light weighted fewer gates than lstm and trains faster than lstm 19 further details about gru can be found in zhu s 19 global variation modeling attention mechanism has been proven to be successful in image capturing generation 21 and recommendation systems 22 it is applied because the supervised model is expected to capture the global variation trends for better accurate forecasting it can learn the importance of sensors values information at every time stamp 19 here we use a context vector to express the global variation trends of sensors values for future sensors values prediction given a time series x i i 1 2 n where n is the length of the time series the attention technique process the data in four steps firstly the hidden states h i i 1 2 n at different moment are calculated using grus and expressed as h h 1 h 2 h n next we introduce a multilayer perceptron as attention score model to weigh the importance of each hidden state 19 later the attention function calculates the context vector c t which can express the global sensors variation information lastly output results are obtained using the context vector we present the eqs 1 3 of the attention mechanism as follows 1 e i w 2 w 1 h b 1 b 2 2 α i exp e i σ k 1 n exp e k 3 c t σ i 1 n α i h i the attention mechanism feeds hidden state h i at each timestamp also known as weight calculation and calculates outputs after two hidden layers a softmax function calculates the logits α i using eq 1 where w 1 and b 1 and w 2 and b 2 are the weight and bias pairs of the first layer the second layer respectively 19 eqs 2 and 3 show the calculation of the global sensor s variation values of the context vector combining these three methods we arrive at the tgcn with attention framework which can be represented as follows eqs 4 7 4 u t σ w u gc a x t h t 1 b u 5 r t σ w r gc a x t h t 1 b r 6 c t tanh w c gc a x t r t h t 1 b c 7 h t u t h t 1 1 u t c t where n sensors data are inputted into the tgcn with attention model to obtain n hidden state h that covered spatio temporal characteristics h t n h t 1 h t u t and r t represent update and reset gates at time t in eqs 4 and 5 respectively c t is the stored content at the current moment in eq 6 h t is the output state at moment t and w and b are the weight and deviation in the training process in eq 7 the hidden states are inputted into the attention mechanism to determine the context vector that represents the global distribution variation information for a given wds the weights of each hidden state h are calculated via softmax using a multilayer perceptron then the forecasting results are processed using a fully connected layer gcn has to ability to encode the topological structures including pump and water flow information by determining the relationship between a node sensor to its surrounding sensors 33 additionally gru determines sensors values at the current time stamp by using the hidden state at the previous time stamp and the sensor s values at the current time stamp as input finally the attention mechanism re weighs the influence of historical time series object states and captures the global variation trends of wdss states for accurate forecasting 3 2 2 attack detection stage tgcn with attention is capable of classifying whether a wds is under attack or no attack our study presents the wds network dataset as a graph with nodes tanks junctions and pumps linked with edges pipes then the recorded readings are defined as structural time series that has the form x a when x ε ℝ n p contains n dimensional observation for p different sequences and x i denotes the systems values at time i a ε 0 1 p p is the adjacency matrix of the p sequences by representing the input dataset in such a form the model learns while capturing the spatio temporal dependence among the feature space we develop the attack detection algorithm algorithm 1 in two stages first we train the model to predict the scada measurement under normal no attack conditions then we calculate the rmd distance metric and calibrate the model to classify all samples as no attack or attack 3 2 3 ai assurance methods for supervised deep learning for this stage we explore ai assurance methods such as attention and rmd to improve the performance of the base model tgcn tgcn can capture the spatio temporal of the time series objects however the history of the data points is re weighted with the addition of attention hence this attention mechanism can capture the global variation trends of time series values for better forecasting accuracy algorithm 1 tgcn tgcn with attention training and testing inputs dataset x and model arguments including ni nh cf activation execute robust concealed attack detection and localization 1 initialize the tgcn tgcn with attention with pre processed dataset x 2 for k 1 2 3 4 n train in training set do 3 pass sample through encoding latent representation and decoding layers eqs 10 11 12 4 use adam optimizer to minimize loss function eq 13 5 return ae parameters θ 6 select threshold θ th 7 for k 1 2 3 4 n test in testing set do 8 pass sample through encoding latent representation and decoding layers eqs 10 11 12 9 return reconstructions errors e r 10 apply threshold θ threshold on reconstructions errors e r for anomaly detection and localization next we apply the outlier detection metric for the wds system many distance metrics are available for outlier detection in multivariate time series datasets including euclidean distance md and rmd md is more effective than euclidean distance due to the use of a covariance matrix to calculate the distance between data points and the center while detecting outliers according to the distribution pattern of the data points 10 60 in brief the covariance matrix in md indicates how variables vary together on the other hand euclidean distance does consider the data points distribution pattern which may assign some abnormal points as outliers and vice versa md carries two desired characteristics it incorporates the dependencies between the prediction error at each sensor which is helpful for combined unusual prediction errors and it allows developers to tune a single global anomaly threshold instead of an individual threshold 33 given a gaussian distributed data the squared md between data x i to the center of the distribution is eq 8 8 d μ σ x i 2 x i μ t σ 1 x i μ where μ is the mean and σ is the covariance matrix of the data points one drawback of md is that its covariance matrix is highly sensitive to outliers which is not preferable if the data is noisy the minimum covariance determinant mcd estimator proposed by p j rousseuw was introduced as a more robust covariance estimator 61 the idea behind mcd is to find the data points in which empirical covariance has the smallest determinant thus giving a pure subset of data points from which to compute standards estimates of the mean and the covariance matrix 61 the application of mcd to md generates the rmd which assures an improved concise outlier detection hence we calculate the rmd measure for multivariate time series outlier detection 3 2 4 prediction and calibration of supervised deep learning we divide the supervised dl model s attack detection and calibration processes 33 into three stages fig 4 in the first stage we preprocess and normalize data and train the tgcn with attention model with the normal training dataset labeled as no attack given the recorded scada measurements of n prior time steps a window of a fixed size n 1 rolls over the time series dataset with a step size of 1 each window s first n measurements are the input to tgcn with attention while the final n 1 data points are the target outputs next stage after training tgcn with attention we pass the validation set x val through the model for prediction y val since we pick normal samples for the training and the validation set we assume that the prediction errors e y y at each sensor are roughly gaussian distributed hence we apply the squared md eq 8 afterward we estimate the robust covariance matrix to calculate the rmd values the squared md is essentially the sum of p independent standard normal variables thus it follows a chi squared distribution with p degrees of freedom 23 during this stage the predicted errors from the normal training dataset have lower rmd values when compared to the threshold as in eq 9 than the anomalous ones the anomalies are detected at timestep i when 9 d μ σ x i 2 i l i th here d μ σ x i 2 i l i is the mean squared rmd in a window of length l and th is the cut off threshold the calibration process is required to obtain the concise threshold th and l we select the thresholds by testing different values for the two parameters in a holdout set with few attack data points and calculate the algorithm s performance with the s function eq 27 in the third and final stage we select parameter values such that it maximizes the rank s function on an unseen testing dataset finally we localize attacked features such as pumps sensors and valves after classifying the timestamps that contain attack data points 3 3 unsupervised deep learning hcae this section discusses the unsupervised wdss attack detection framework the mechanism of ae and its revised version hcae we apply ae as a reconstruction based algorithm that performs dimensionality reduction and reconstructs the original input the outcome from ae and hcae are reconstruction errors difference between output and input data which identify physical anomalies from the feature space fig 5 shows a fully connected ann based ae and its components wds data are fed to the ae and hcae models the models classify the inputs as either normal or anomalous samples based on a threshold 3 3 1 auto encoder aes have been a widely adopted dl method for the last couple of decades for both dimensionality reduction and feature engineering 62 we develop our baseline ae model by adopting taormina s 14 ae model additional information about the design of our baseline ae model is discussed in the unsupervised model design section 4 2 2 the network is divided into two parts an encoder function h f x and a decoder function x g f x aes can be generalized as stochastic mappings of p encoder h x and p decoder x h where h is a hidden layer h f x that presents a code and is used to characterize the input multi layer perceptrons mlp 63 form aes with an input layer an output layer and multiple hidden layers mathematically an encoder and decoder can be written as eqs 10 12 10 ϕ x ℱ 11 ψ ℱ x 12 ϕ ψ arg min ϕ ψ x ψ ϕ x 2 where eqs 10 and 11 represent encoder and decoder functionality respectively eq 12 represents loss of the ae input data x is transformed into a compressed representation ℱ and reconstructed as x again the objective of an ae is to minimize the reconstruction errors eqs 13 and 14 which yields a better reconstruction of the input set x 13 ℒ x x x x 2 14 ℒ x x x σ w σ wx b b 2 reconstruction errors are usually minimized using stochastic gradient descent sgd 64 a potent optimization tool for many dl applications however our study applies the adam optimizer another powerful stochastic optimization method that outperforms sgd 65 an anomaly detection system is expected to produce minimal false alarms as false alarms are associated with expensive maintenance operations fig 5 represents an ann based ae despite having fine tuned hyper parameters ae suffers from non determinism during training resulting in a higher reconstruction error a higher reconstruction error can result in an increased number of false positives thus affecting the detector s performance 66 as ae algorithms automatically learn features by performing feature engineering for dimensionality reduction they tend to learn different features at each time 62 this pattern of learning is suitable for systems where feature importance is unknown for instance thousands of sensor values in a water distribution system complex and difficult feature space to human perception however such a non deterministic learning pattern might not be suitable for a wds we expect a wds model to provide if possible zero false alarms because of expensive maintenance operations to address these issues we revise ae architecture and form hcae thus solving the non determinism problem of ae by further reducing reconstruction errors and improving attack detection performance by reducing false positives 3 3 2 high confidence autoencoder hcae hcae is a modified version of baseline ae we developed hcae by applying assurance methods eqs 15 18 to ae improving the attack detection performance compared to the ae baseline we use hcae to represent input features in a manifold space that generates minimum reconstruction errors while decoding and recreating the input features to minimize the reconstruction errors the practitioners currently follow a trial and error based method and optimize hyperparameters over multiple iterations this approach is empirical reducing the reconstruction errors is time consuming and computationally expensive in a complex wds we apply a combination of neural network layer constraints for the model and achieve deterministic learning which results in a manifold representation that yields minimum reconstruction errors this strategy ensures learning a set of expected features from the training data each time resulted reconstruction errors yield better feature representation and attack detection performance 67 we present our experimental results in the context of a wds how a set of constraints yields minimal reconstruction errors and robust attack detection algorithm 2 presents both algorithms including baseline ae and hcae training steps for attack detection in water systems 3 3 3 ai assurance constraints for the auto encoder recent advancements in dl apis including keras 4 4 github com fchollet keras tensorflow 5 5 github com tensorflow and pythorch 6 6 github com pytorch pytorch expedite aes development more than ever nevertheless a lack of a clear understanding of the fundamental properties of dimensionality reduction leads to a complex and inferior model thus it is crucial to understand and adopt the basic properties of dimensionality reduction in aes we present multiple custom layer constraints and apply them to facilitate dimensionality reduction in a wds hcae is effective for tuning and optimizing hyperparameters algorithm 2 baseline ae and hcae training and testing inputs dataset x model arguments including ni nh cf activation and customized layers execute robust concealed attack detection and localization 1 initialize ae hcae with pre processed dataset x 2 this step is applicable for hcae apply constraints on encoder and decoder layers using a combination of tied weights eq 15 orthogonal weights eq 16 uncorrelated features eq 17 unit norm eq 18 3 for k 1 2 3 4 n train in training set do 4 pass sample through encoding latent representation and decoding layers eqs 10 11 12 5 use adam optimizer to minimize loss function eq 13 6 return ae parameters θ params 7 select threshold θ th 8 for k 1 2 3 4 n test in testing set do 9 pass sample through encoding latent representation and decoding layers eqs 10 11 12 10 return reconstructions errors e r 11 apply threshold θ th on reconstructions errors e r for anomaly detection and localization in order to improve the aes detection performance we apply the following set of constraints 1 tied weights tied weights 68 ensure equal weights for both encoder and decoder this constraint also ensures easy learning especially pca like dimensionality reduction and regularization however they do not always perform well on complex non linear models again tied weight constraint is not always necessary to continually improve the representation if reconstruction errors are reasonable the coding generates orthogonal latent features for given data such representation is helpful in dimensionality reduction and eventually for anomaly detection in a multi layer ae weights vectors of layer l from an encoder and a decoder are transposed as eq 15 15 w l w l t 2 orthogonal weights each weight vector is independent therefore the weights of each encoding layer are orthogonal the orthogonality constraints 69 act as regularization for the ae mathematically orthogonality condition for ae can be presented as 16 w encoder t w encoder i on applying this constraint penalizes non orthogonal weights depending on the dataset the user can choose either orthogonal or non orthogonal weights thus the application of this constraint is conditioned on regularization 3 uncorrelated features if the output of the encoder is orthogonal latent representations must be uncorrelated 70 hence the output of the ae must have eq 17 17 correlation o encoder i o encoder j 0 i j 4 unit norm the weights of each layer must have unit norms 71 this property helps to control exploding and vanishing gradients unit norm constraint eq 18 must be allied to all the layers of the ae 18 j 1 p w ij 2 1 i 1 k these four constraints eqs 15 18 during model development ensure the model does not create a sub optimal decision boundary they ensure the creation of a well posed ae while constructing a high confident wds model unit norm and orthogonality solve regularization problems especially for aes when ae learns from a training set but does not represent a test set well also tide weight can reduce the number of parameters as a regularization technique here the unit norm constraint addresses exploding gradients issue by bounding gradients into a finite value additionally orthogonality resolves the vanishing gradients problem by assigning fewer nonzero weights so only informative weights stand out thus only these nonzero weights flow information during backpropagation and resolve the vanishing gradient issue 68 69 70 71 when we apply these four constraints eqs 15 18 while designing hcae we hypothesize the model will not converge to a suboptimal point to test our hypothesis we compare the results before and after using these four constraints observe if attack detection performance f1 score is improved from the baseline ae 14 we use the batadal dataset for training and testing our models later in the manuscript we present adversarial testing using a gan to observe if the model can detect attacks from synthetically generated poisoned datasets previously unseen data with a different distribution 3 3 4 attack detection and calibration stages of hcae hcae is capable of classifying whether the wdss are under attack or no attack by investigating each sample nonetheless the direct classification technique becomes erroneous with a small and imbalanced dataset because ae requires a large dataset to learn the representation however with hcae s deterministic learning we hypothesize the hcae can detect attacks with minimum false positives we test our hypothesis by training both ae and hcae with the same imbalanced data and evaluate with total false positives for each model unlike the supervised algorithm tgcn with attention we present data streams with non sequential representation next x is defined as x ε ℝ n m which contains n dimensional observation for m different features and x i denotes the systems values at time i the attack detection process is divided into two stages fig 6 in stage one we create custom hcae layers by following eqs 15 18 we ensure the model always yields minimum reconstruction errors and maximum binary classification performance f1 score by observing the model performance on multiple hyperparameter sets later in stage two data are preprocessed and normalized to have the maximal absolute value of each attribute applied to all three provided datasets after that we train the hcae model with the normal training dataset labeled no attack we split the training dataset into training x train y train and validation x val y val set we apply early stopping a regularization scheme when the model converges and starts to over fit on the training dataset during each epoch we compute loss eq 15 the squared of the reconstruction errors r e x x minimize them using adam optimizer after both ae and hcae models are well trained we select threshold θ th in an empirical fashion for that the range of average reconstruction errors among all features in a sample is observed and summed up then we set the threshold based on the final range estimation as shown in the following eq 19 19 θ th max f x m x x m for n training samples the calibration process is crucial to derive a concise threshold θ th for testing the model on new samples if a test object is classified as attack we localize the features associated with attacked attributes such as pumps sensors and valves using reconstruction errors for the hcae model we select hyperparameters that result in the best model s performance f1 score our objective is to compare the performance of hcae ae with constraints with the ae model without constraints to facilitate a fair comparison between hcae and ae models we retrain taormina s ae model using the same hyperparameters of the hcae model we refer to the retrained ae model as the baseline ae model 3 4 synthetic wdss attack data generation unlike other dl based attack detection approaches that require significant domain knowledge and passive awareness of the attacked model 72 gans are proven to be effective in generating realistic attack samples poisoned data 73 with minimal information about either the domain or the dl model we use gan 40 for synthetic data generation gan network learns feature statistics of a given dataset for generating a new set of synthetic data a generator produces the synthetic samples in the gan network and a discriminator evaluates them the generator learns by mapping latent feature space to a data distribution of particular interest discriminator maximizes its objective by learning how to distinguish original samples from the generated fake samples the generator aims to minimize the discriminator s objective by fooling it into thinking otherwise fake samples as real ones for instance while generating a synthetic image set gan keeps the similar statistics of generated images set from the training set hence those generated images look superficially similar to human perception during the training phase both generator and discriminator play a minimax game where a bi level optimization is performed to train the gan network in our study the generator learns the distribution of training samples x and maps data space as g z θ g where g is differentiable with respect to parameters θ g then discriminator investigates if the data comes from the training samples and not from the generator itself we train the discriminator to specify between original and generated samples from the generator correctly both the discriminator and the generator take participation in a minimax game which is represented as a value function as v g d as eq 20 20 min g max d v d g e x p data x log d x e z p z z log 1 d g z here the generator is trained to maximize logd x and minimize log 1 d g z in a numerical and iterable fashion this gan approach generates synthetic poisoned data for the wdss system we assess both supervised and unsupervised models on these synthetic data for generalization study 4 experimental design this section presents the three research questions and discusses the selection of hyperparameters and metrics used in our experiments in our experiments supervised learning models are trained using two datasets dataset 1 and dataset 2 as unsupervised learning requires no attack samples for training the unsupervised models are trained with dataset 1 no attack samples both the supervised and the unsupervised models are evaluated using dataset 3 we use total of 492 attack samples from dataset 3 to train the gan model for synthetic data generation experiments are conducted to answer the following three research questions presented in section 1 2 4 1 experimental models design this section discusses the hyperparameter settings for tgcn tgcn with attention hcae ae and gan this section presents the optimized hyperparameters set to train and evaluate the models we also list all alternative hyperparameter values that are used to randomly search for the best models in appendix c table c 7 4 1 1 supervised model design we pre process the time series data as graph data and normalize them during normalization we perform standard minimum maximum scaling ranges from 0 to 1 the graph data can be represented as an adjacency matrix along with node data fig 2b illustrates the node s information and locations in c town s wds network the adjacency matrix is constructed of the provided 31 nodes note that only one type of attribute is reported for each node in the network except the pump nodes that have two different measurements status and flow of water we keep a single attribute for each node and exclude the binary pump status where the numerical flow rate is preserved the supervised models tgcn baseline and tgcn with attention are implemented using pytorch and scikit learn api 7 7 github com scikit learn scikit learn the models are trained on a cpu with intel core i5 10th gen we have tested both models with multiple iterations with different hyperparameter sets to obtain one for tgcn we choose an adam optimizer algorithm with a learning rate of 0 01 for tgcn with attention we choose an adam optimizer learning rate of 0 005 then we utilize rectified linear unit relu as an activation function for both models the batch size selected for both models is 16 and 128 respectively from each batch we take sequences of length n n 8 hours from the training inputs x train and targets y train we use the optimizer to minimize the mean squared error mse loss while selecting optimal hyperparameters we focus on maximizing performance metrics including precision recall f1 score accuracy and specificity to train both tgcn and tgcn with attention models we use the no attack samples dataset 1 and split them into training and validation sets with a 75 25 ratio then we train both models for 10 times with 1000 epochs each time a threshold th is fine tuned using the holdout set dataset 2 to maximize the ranking s score on the holdout set 4 1 2 unsupervised model design we pre process the data before inputting them to the ae and the hcae the pre processing step includes normalization and removing null samples from the data for normalization we perform standard minimum maximum scaling ranges from 0 to 1 both ae baseline and hcae models are implemented using scikit learn api and are trained on a cpu with intel core i5 10th gen we use adam optimizer with learning rate 0 0001 a decay factor of 0 5 and β 1 β 2 0 9 0 99 additionally 500 epochs are selected with a minibatch size of 32 the design of hcae differs from baseline ae in the design of the hidden layer definition early stopping is applied with patience 3 for better regularization here the patience parameter ensures convergence when the training loss and validation loss don t change for three consecutive epochs and the training is marked complete we are compressing input features using an under complete autoencoder architecture and both models compression factor is selected as 2 5 thus we get the number of neurons in each layer as following encoder layers l 0 l 1 l 2 43 34 25 bottleneck layer l 3 17 and decoder layer as l 4 l 5 l 6 25 34 43 eqs 15 18 represent ai assurance constraints including tide weights orthogonal weights uncorrelated features and unit norms constraints which are applied to the ae we pick a combination of these constraints and apply them to the hidden layers our goal is to obtain a meaningful and uncorrelated latent representation a prerequisite for dimensionality reduction we empirically select optimal hyperparameters for the ae and the hcae models and maximize binary classification performance scores including precision recall f1 score accuracy and specificity dataset 1 is used during model training and dataset 3 is used for model testing finally we select threshold θ th by following an empirical approach we plot the f1 scores for baseline ae and hcae models for dataset 3 against a threshold range from 96 percentile to 100 percentile of their average reconstruction errors fig 7 we observe that both models reach a maximum f1 score at 98 5 percentile hence we choose θ th 0 985 as the model s threshold 4 1 3 gan model settings a gan 24 is used to generate poisoned data in our experiments all 492 attack samples from the test dataset dataset 3 are provided as input to the gan network for training the generator the prior noise dimension is set as 32 the prior noise dimension and class labels are mapped into hidden layers layer dimension 128 with a rectified linear unit relu activation function for output a sigmoid function is selected as the last activation layer for the discriminator unit we choose an adam optimizer to minimize the loss function of the generator with a learning rate of 1e 5 additionally we pick a minibatch of size 128 and 200 epochs and set β 1 β 2 0 5 0 9 for the optimizer the poisoned dataset is generated by synthesizing only the attack samples from the test set dataset 3 then the generated samples are randomly placed in the same test set dataset 3 again the synthetic dataset is conditioned to balance the number of samples in both classes testing a model with a balanced dataset helps us to evaluate the dl model s generalization ability hence the poisoned dataset used in our experiments consists of 984 samples with 492 attack samples and 492 no attack samples 4 2 model performance metrics we use multiple performance metrics from the batadal competition to evaluate the model s ability to detect a threat in the shortest possible amount of time in addition to this we also use additional five metrics namely accuracy precision recall specificity and f1 score to measure the performance of a binary classifier 4 2 1 time to detection score s ttd time to detection is the difference between ground truth attack start time t o eq 21 and algorithm detection start time t d 21 0 s ttd t d t 0 δ t the attack is indicated by δt a smaller ttd indicates that an algorithm has an improved detection performance during an ongoing attack additionally the detection rate is associated with recall or sensitivity which is otherwise referred as the true positive rate tpr and it is represented in eq 22 additionally precision what proportion of positive identifications was actually correct is represented in eq 23 22 sensitivity recall tpr tp tp fn 23 precision tp tp fp here fn is the number of false negatives and tp is the number of true positives tpr is determined by the ratio of the correct attack classifications and the total number of attacks detected by the algorithm including tp and fn additionally we leverage true negative rate tnr or specificity metric to check false alarms by the models and it is defined as eq 24 24 specificity tnr tn fp tn tn is the number of true negatives and fp is the number of false positives tnr is determined by the ratio of the number of correct classifications for safe conditions without attack and the number of total classifications for safe conditions including fp and tn 4 2 2 binary classification metric f1 score eqs 22 and 23 are also known as recall and precision respectively in addition to accuracy and ranking we calculate the f1 score using eq 25 that accounts for both precision and recall 25 f 1 score 2 precision recall precision recall training a dl model with an imbalanced dataset and evaluating its performance using the accuracy metric can be misleading 74 in such cases an f1 score is preferred over accuracy as the f1 score represents a harmonic mean of precision and recall 4 2 3 classification performance score s clf to compare with the other state of the art detection algorithms eqs 22 and 24 are merged as classification performance score s clf eq 26 the mean of eqs 22 and 24 26 s clf tpr tnr 2 this score s clf represents detection as well as false negative alarms additionally this score is relevant to the f1 score which is appropriate for problems with binary classification the score can result in a 0 or 1 where 1 indicates a perfect classification 4 2 4 ranking score s time to detection s ttd and classification performance score s clf metrics can be merged further into a single ranking score as eq 27 27 s γ s ttd 1 γ s clf according to the batadal competition γ is set to 0 5 to ensure the weight of the early detection and the accuracy are equally adjusted 8 5 deep h 2 o results this section presents the results of the three research questions presented prior rq1 rq3 5 1 rq1 ai assurance 5 1 1 supervised detection results table 1 presents the attack detection performance of both supervised and unsupervised models among the two supervised models results suggest that the tgcn with attention model performs better in attack detection in wds with the introduction of attention and rmd assurance methods the tgcn with attention model results in a significant improvement in recall and f1 score performance metrics out of the five metrics presented in table 1 we observe an improvement in precision recall f1 score and accuracy by 7 6 22 1 15 5 and 4 7 respectively precision recall and specificity metrics improve from baseline tgcn to tgcn with attention in terms of detecting attacks in wds results indicate that both the tgcn model baseline and tgcn with attention model successfully detect all seven attacks nevertheless we notice fig 8a b c d that the baseline model tgcn has a higher number of false positives compared to tgcn with attention model we believe that the introduction of assurance methods attention and rmd improves the tgcn with attention model and minimizes the number of false positives this is also reflected in the model s performance with an improved f1 and precision score compared to its baseline overall our results suggest that tgcn with attention model performs better than tgcn baseline 5 1 2 unsupervised detection results to study the impact of the assurance constraints eqs 15 18 on hcae we present the model performance with and without assurance constraints in table 1 not all four constraints bring optimal performance but a combination of these constraints achieves better classification and dimensionality reduction performance than the baseline ae model from table 1 we observe that sensitivity specificity accuracy and f1 score improve significantly with assurance constraints applied to the ae also we observe that precision is increased because hcae learns the imbalanced data batadal dataset is unbalanced better than ae fig 9 presents the attack detection performance of the unsupervised models the test dataset dataset 3 consists of seven different attacks all seven attacks are classified as attack by both ae and hcae models fig 9a and b present all seven attacks detected by the ae model and the hcae model respectively as fig 9a illustrates in addition to detecting all seven attacks the ae model results in 21 sets of false alarms on the contrary the hcae model results in a single false alarm fig 9b the result suggests that hcae learns the complex interdependencies between the features during concealed attacks hence performing better than ae in detecting the attacks table 4 presents the performance metrics including the ranking score s although both hcae and ae time to detection performance is identical 94 7 the classification performance ranking score s of the hcae has significantly improved than the baseline ae from the table we observe that classification performance has been improved from 80 to 92 similarly tpr also improved from 60 4 to 86 5 a significant increase this performance improvement is expected as hcae learns the complex relationships between features in a deterministic scheme whereas ae learns them in a non deterministic approach 5 2 rq2 data poisoning in this sub section we present the performance of both supervised and unsupervised models on poisoned data table 2 presents the attack detection performance on synthetic poisoned data generated using gan results fig 10a b c d suggest the supervised models perform poorly with poisoned data more specifically for tgcn we observe by comparing tables 1 and 2 that the attack detection performance of the model is decreased by more than 50 across all five metrics similar to the baseline model tgcn with attention model behaves poorly results suggest on average a 65 reduction in performance across all five metrics the poor performance of supervised models on the poisoned data can be explained as follows the tgcn and tgcn with attention models learn the behavior of a wds by embedding the spatio temporal structure of the wds in other words they learn to detect attacks based on the sequential information inferred from the dataset during the training process as the attacks are randomly distributed across the poisoned dataset gan data both the supervised models fail to detect the attacks resulting in poor performance on the contrary to supervised models we observe that the ae and hcae unsupervised models perform well fig 11a b c d on the poisoned data in some cases results suggest the performance of both unsupervised models is better on poisoned data table 2 than their performance on the test dataset table 1 this improved performance can be attributed to the fact that ae and hcae models treat the training samples as non sequential data and the data are randomly placed with poisoned samples hence they can detect the randomly distributed attacks from the poisoned dataset effectively 5 3 rq3 feature localization in this sub section we present the model s ability to identify the features impacted by an attack feature localization we perform feature localization by estimating the deviation of the features from the no attack dataset distribution the results presented so far suggest that the model customized with ai assurance methods and constraints performs better than their respective baseline model hence for feature localization we limit our evaluation to two models tgcn with attention and hcae table 3 presents the localization results for supervised and unsupervised models the localized feature that matches the ground truth is highlighted in bold for tgcn with attention model to localize the impacted features during an attack we compare the mean squared error of the network from the testing set of its corresponding maximum error from the validation set 25 of dataset 1 the supervised model can successfully localize five attacked nodes among the seven attacks while failing to localize attacked nodes for attack 9 and attack 13 next we present the feature localization performance of the unsupervised model to localize the impacted features we select the features with the highest number of deviations from the threshold θ th by estimating their mean squared error during a predicted attack we pick the top features for which reconstruction errors deviate most from the threshold θ th overall the results indicate that the modified models can successfully localize various attacks including alteration of thresholds signals and meter readings furthermore we observe that tgcn with attention localizes the attacked features with a minimal number of false positives fp among the two models false positives are estimated for each attack category by subtracting the set of total nodes detected by the model in that category from the set of ground truths for example consider attack 12 in which the readings of l t2 are altered while both the models successfully localize the feature l t2 the tgcn with attention model in addition to identifying l t2 also identifies two additional features as potentially attacked in contrast hcae models identify additional eight nodes within the proximity as potentially attacked features this is because the neighbor nodes show similar behavior during normal operations and therefore during an attack the model predicts those neighbor nodes are highly likely to be attacked 5 4 deep h 2 o model sensitivity analysis in this section we evaluate the attack detection outcomes of both supervised and unsupervised models using shapley values shapley values are the outcome of a game theoretic approach that explain the output of any ml model in literature variance based sensitivity analysis is a popular approach that explains black box models primarily sobol based methods are gaining traction 75 however this approach has one major limitation it cannot explain localized observations in our work we are more concerned with local observation explanations than global ones since the models detect attacks from different nodes and time points in a wds therefore we elected to use deep explainer 8 8 github com slundberg shap an enhanced approach from shapley additive explanations shap library similar to kernel shap it approximates the conditional expectations of shap values using a selection of background samples in this analysis we provide all seven categories of attack samples separately generate shap values and plot the scaled shap values ranging from 0 to 100 in fig 12 this figure represents local feature importance during the attack detection by the models from the figure we can observe that feature localization table 3 and deep explainer provide similar insights about the model s outcome by observing fig 12 it becomes evident that the model gives less attention to deactivated nodes from the training set dataset 1 including pu3 pu5 pu6 pu9 and pu11 while giving much more importance to the flow of pumps that worked during the training set additionally we observe that all tanks were given attention during all seven categories because they are always active in the training set one shortcoming of both models is that they could not learn the relationships among junctions because of the imbalance of the training dataset most influential junctions got prioritized by the model over less participating ones therefore model attack localization was incorrect during attacks 9 and 13 l t2 and l t7 weren t detected because other junctions got more attention including p j280 p j289 p j300 when compared to ground truth nodes v2 and pu10 pu11 5 5 comparison with batadal models next we compare the attack classification performance of our models with the top performing models from the batadal competition to maintain consistency in our evaluation all the models are evaluated using the test dataset dataset 3 table 4 presents the comparison results where our models are highlighted in bold the results indicate both the unsupervised and supervised model exhibits better performance hcae unsupervised model with a ranking score of 0 933 is ranked 3 whereas tgcn with attention achieves 0 845 and ranks eighth among the models from the batadal competition although our models do not achieve the highest ranking they are superior compared to the top two models for the following reasons 1 the top ranked model is physics based and hence it is not relevant to compare with our model an ai based model 2 the second ranked model although an ai based model might not perform well detecting attacks on previously unseen data on the contrary our models are scalable and demonstrate a better attack detection performance on unseen data results indicate that adding the ai assurance methods to the tgcn model improves its overall performance compared to the baseline model s 0 754 tgcn with attention model achieves a better score s 0 845 additionally we observe that the time to detection s ttd has improved significantly the baseline model achieves 0 735 whereas the tgcn with attention model achieves 0 839 a higher s ttd is significant in the context of wds an improved s ttd score indicates that the tgcn with attention model can swiftly identify an attack at the earliest compared to its baseline model for unsupervised models both hcae and ae baseline achieve an identical score for time to detection s ttd 0 947 however we observe that the hcae model has an improved tpr score 0 865 compared to its baseline 0 604 this results in the hcae model achieving a ranking score s 0 933 substantially higher than its baseline s 0 873 furthermore a higher tpr indicates that the model detects most attack samples thus improving the trustworthiness of the model during deployment both tgcn with attention and hcae models achieve a better ranking score compared to their respective baseline models 6 discussions 6 1 water laws and public policy environmental and water laws govern our nation s water air waste and other natural components most of the time and due to the public s lack of awareness or attention voters are usually drawn to water and environmental issues after wide scale incidents of environmental damage such as the flint water crisis 9 9 https www michigan gov mdhhs inside mdhhs legal flint water settlement and its effects on safe drinking water in the state the clean water act cwa establishes the basic rules and benchmarks for regulating quality standards and discharging pollutants into the waters of the united states the work presented in this manuscript aims to provide preventive measures for the health of water treatment plants against the rising dangers of cyber attacks deep h 2 o is instrumental in governing cyber components of a water facility providing recommendations to wdss operators on when and where the attack occurs and validating against water policies and environmental protection agency epa regulations this project continues as a collaboration with wdss in northern virginia and the district of columbia dc to deploy deep h 2 o at local facilities and aim to expand it to other wdss as well conclusions and future work items are presented next 6 2 conclusions and future work this manuscript presents deep h 2 o a novel cyber attack detection framework for wdss deep h 2 o applies ai assurance to two dl architectures tgcn with attention and hcae and compares their performance improvement over their baseline models for tgcn with attention model supervised model it has been observed that applying ai assurance including attention and rmd with tgcn improves the model s attack detection accuracy similarly for hcae unsupervised model applying ai assurance including tide weights orthogonality constraints and other constraints improves detection accuracy and f1 score of the hcae model compared to ae the performance of both supervised and unsupervised models on poisoned data has been evaluated for the supervised model compared to its performance on the test dataset it has been observed that most of the metrics decrease significantly the supervised model struggles to perform i e to detect an attack if there is randomness in the dataset unlike the supervised model that performs poorly on poisoned data our result indicates that the predictive performance of the unsupervised model hcae is similar for the test data and the poisoned gan data no significant drop in the model s performance has been observed to explain this phenomenon the unsupervised model learns uncorrelated feature representation in the latent dimension and does not learn the sequential attributes hence the model can identify randomness in the poisoned data result suggests that the hcae model has better generalizability among the two models the unsupervised model hcae performs better in terms of ranking score and time to detection score also hcae is well generalized and regularized while detecting attacked samples on the batadal test set this improved classification performance and recall values make hcae a better choice for deployment in the wds the study uses multiple performance metrics including time to detection score classification score ranking score precision recall accuracy and f1 score to measure the model s performance the f1 score improvement is focused on the various metrics because of the heavily imbalanced batadal dataset therefore this particular case the f1 score becomes an important metric that considers model attack prediction errors and accounts for the type of errors by taking the harmonic mean of precision and recall that is only if both precision and recall values are high the f1 score gets higher in this study a higher f1 score indicates higher attack and no attack harmonic class detection additionally the unsupervised model outperforms the supervised model for wds including a better f1 score the unsupervised model is a one class classification method that generalizes well regardless of the water systems spatio temporal structure making the model simpler than tgcn with attention additionally the unsupervised model does not require labeling an expensive and time consuming activity in the model development process the ability of both supervised and unsupervised models in feature localization has been evaluated localizing a feature is tedious for both models during a concealed attack although the results are not highly accurate they are promising and vital for wds for instance both models can identify attacked node s or neighboring nodes during an attack further refining the model hyper parameters by applying a grid search technique can improve the performance and result in better feature localization results which is a potential future work the sensitivity analysis of two models showed that less important or sensitive variables were inactive in the training set while active components were the most influential during a cyber attack however some common junctions had high sensitivity or importance flags due to imbalanced training data additionally the extension of this work can be the following 1 the gan used in these experiments to generate synthetic data fails to replicate the time series information from the original dataset the attack samples are generated merely using gan consequently the next plan is to use timegan 76 a variant of gan to generate sequential time series synthetic data consisting of both attack and non attack samples and test the performance of dl models on the time series synthetic data 2 a large metropolitan city can have multiple wdss across various locations within the metroplex a bad actor can start a concealed attack on one of the wds and continue to spread the attack across all locations to swiftly detect and prevent such attacks federated learning fl techniques 77 can be adapted to learn from the initial concealed attack and leverage that information to prevent future attacks of similar nature across other wdss furthermore using the real time data collected from the wdss to retrain the dl model can significantly improve the detection performance of the model however given the geographically distributed nature of wdss it is essential to preserve the privacy of the real time data collected from the wdss therefore the plan is to use fl techniques to guarantee data and model privacy 3 training and deploying a dl model across different wdss is challenging as the threshold might vary across different wdss locations this is further complicated by a set of different operations across wdss another interesting idea is to explore context learning 72 to enable dl models to be context aware such as population and weather and efficiently detect attacks that vary based on different thresholds furthermore training and evaluation of the deep h 20 framework using real world wds datasets 10 10 https itrust sutd edu sg such as water distribution wadi dataset and secure water treatment swat is a future task lastly a plan to develop approaches that explain the model s outcomes to water plant operators could be a great study which would result in higher adoption rates and increased trustworthiness 25 of such frameworks at water facilities in the united states declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

12602,water distribution systems wdss leverage the recent technological advancements in sensor technologies and cyber physical systems cpss for better processing distribution and delivery of clean water given the digital nature of cpss they can be vulnerable to different kinds of cyber threats especially in cases where adversaries can conceal the state of the attack if an adversary state or non state actor successfully compromises a wds that could result in major destructive consequences to water quality public health and agricultural irrigation this paper presents empirical artificial intelligence ai based methods for detecting such concealed attacks in wds we present two deep learning dl models temporal graph convolutional network tgcn with attention a supervised learning model and high confidence auto encoder hcae an unsupervised learning model tgcn adopts attention and robust mahalanobis distance rmd metrics for robust and generalizable forecasting performance hcae uses customized hidden layers to improve classification performance compared to state of the art approaches experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed models using the battle of the attack detection algorithms batadal dataset founded on a supervisory control and data acquisition scada infrastructure additionally we assess the performance of the two models against synthetically poisoned data generated from a generative adversarial network gan both attack detection models show superior accuracy with attack detection localization and overall robustness against data poisoning the results suggest that both the supervised and unsupervised models perform better attack detection with a ranking score of 0 845 and 0 933 respectively results also indicate that among the two models the unsupervised model performs better in detecting poisoned data accuracy 0 992 and has better generalizability experimental results are recorded evaluated and discussed graphical abstract cyber attacks detection in water distribution systems unlabelled image keywords water distribution systems ai assurance anomaly detection concealed attacks deep learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recent unprecedented ai and sensor technology advancements are transforming all domains including wdss with industrial revolution 4 0 wds 1 is undergoing a significant digital transformation to enable data driven monitoring and utility operations control the addition of cyber elements aims to make these cpss systems more effective however that comes with a trade off systems become increasingly vulnerable to security and safety threats 2 4 for instance the recent targeting of infrastructure in ukraine reminds us of the risk of attacks on critical infrastructure including cyberattacks on wdss according to unicef as of may 1 4 million people in eastern ukraine were without access to safe water from public water systems 1 1 www peopleinneed net in ukraine we are supplying water to tens of thousands of people 8921gp we are supplying water to tens of thousands of people in eastern ukraine another example in 2013 hackers seized control of a small florida dam that released unprocessed water to nearby communities 4 besides that on february 5th 2021 a florida water treatment plant in oldsmar fl was compromised the hacker altered the levels of sodium hydroxide in the water a chemical that would severely damage any human tissue it touches 5 this event suggests that current wds control utility operations are mainly exposed and continuously vulnerable to attackers requiring sophisticated learning algorithms that can estimate the system s state detect inconsistencies and outliers and mitigate the harm done by such events ai has numerous advantages for detecting anomalies in wdss including those caused by cyberattacks which are harder for humans to detect than kinetic attacks wds human observers cannot detect all anomalies and even when they become aware of an anomaly they often misinterpret it the frailties of human beings in interpreting data from complex systems have been cataloged by sociologist charles perrow in an important book 6 about the causes of nuclear accidents the same kinds of human shortcomings in interpreting complex data are evident in after action reports about the deepwater horizon oil spill which among other things recommend increased use of ai to prevent future spills 7 humans have created systems that are too complex for them to monitor effectively and they need help from ai but the potential applications of the technologies that the authors describe are not limited to cyberattacks and wdss many sewage spills result from leaks in antiquated underground systems that can go undetected for example in july 2020 an old pipe broke in new haven connecticut no one noticed until a citizen saw raw sewage on the street the next morning and called the authorities two million gallons of untreated sewage spilled into long island sound over the next several days 2 2 www nhregister com news article save the sound investigating after 15396322 php 1 1 motivation wdss are a critical infrastructure that ought to be safe secure and reliable in delivering water for all intended purposes despite the stochastic nature of the wdss operational processes many artificial intelligence ai algorithms can help with early attack prediction or anomaly detection 8 attack detection models using ai require data representing the physical structure and the temporal behaviors of the wdss a wds consists of a network of reservoirs pumps storage tanks pipes junctions valves and taps usually spread across a geographical dimension in most cases the models are developed using data streams from scada systems to classify if the system is running safely or not scada collects real time distributed field data measurements including water flow rates pump status and pressure sensor readings then transmits them measurements to a central server because of the complex interdependencies among different nodes dl models are better suited to computationally represent the system 9 machine learning ml models including ensemble learning models are a good choice for small and simple networks 10 however the increasing number of nodes in a network such as in wdss creates non linear relationships among them according to sikder et al 10 dl models can capture non linear relationships in a distributed network system more effectively when compared to ml models therefore our work aims to address the security of wdss by building robust and generalized dl models despite the recent advancements in computing technology wds has security flaws because of its dependency on decade old network devices therefore an attacker can easily eavesdrop on the communication between the network and the central control system additionally adversaries can send malicious attacks by spoofing sensor measurements concealing the intended attacks from the operators sight 11 these attacks are also known as concealed attacks fortunately such attacks have a digital and physical footprint in the network such as sensor value deviation from the norm or water flow rate changes during high demand hours statistically these abnormal events can be considered anomalies which a suitable learning algorithm can detect for instance what if the attacker conceals these anomalies or sensor measurements by sending replay attacks a replay attack 12 occurs when a cyber criminal eavesdrops on secure network communication intercept and delay signals to misdirect the receiver in stealthy attacks 13 since attackers conceal the physical layer it becomes difficult to detect these attacks by using anomaly detection based models for example taormina et al 14 presented difficulties associated with ml algorithms to detect concealed attacks in wdss in comparison with dl algorithms dl algorithms are key for estimations in such complex ecosystems the batadal data that we use here consist of a wds operator for c town public utility cpu with anomalous low or overflowing tank levels showing up during stealthy attacks 8 1 2 background of cybersecurity in wds advanced wdss constitute tens or hundreds of internet of things iots devices including sensors and actuators this complex connectivity makes the system vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks 15 cyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated via minimally perturbed signals that go unnoticed to a human operator or a traditional expert system 15 therefore intelligent algorithms such as dl are deemed necessary for detecting cyberattacks 16 cyber attacks on water distribution systems can take many forms according to a survey paper 3 one type is data poisoning in which an attacker alters or corrupts data in a system to cause it to malfunction or present incorrect outcomes another type is ransomware in which an attacker encrypts a system s data and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key other types of attacks on water distribution systems include denial of service attacks i e an attacker floods a system with traffic to prevent legitimate users from accessing it and unauthorized access where an attacker gains access to a system without permission these attacks can have serious consequences on water treatment and supply including contamination disruption of service and financial loss to the wds dl algorithms can be trained on large amounts of data to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a cyber attack for example an ai algorithm can be trained to recognize network traffic patterns typical of a denial of service attack and then use this information to block similar traffic in the future 17 ai based intrusion detection systems ids are also used to detect and prevent cyber attacks on water distribution systems these systems can use a combination of ai algorithms and rule based systems to detect unusual activity in the network moreover ai can be used to optimize the security of water distribution systems by automating many of the tasks that are currently performed manually for example ai based systems can automatically update security configurations and patch vulnerabilities reducing the risk of successful attacks 3 it is important to note that the use of ai in cybersecurity research for water distribution systems is still in its early stages 3 and more research is needed to understand these technologies capabilities and limitations fully however ai s potential to enhance these systems security is significant and it is expected that the use of ai in cybersecurity for water distribution systems will continue to grow 1 3 our contribution dl models make decisions based on either a black box environment or a non deterministic approach without assessing robustness and generalizability dl models deployment stage becomes unreliable we address these two key components robustness and generalizability and present the deep h 2 o framework that consists of two models tgcn with attention a supervised model and hcae an unsupervised model key contributions are the following the study uses tgcn with attention and hcae models to identify cybersecurity threats in wds considering both time sequential and non sequential aspects tgcn with attention captures spatial correlations in graph data and global temporal dynamics understands complex interdependencies among sensor readings and leverages graph convolutional network gcn 18 19 gated recurrent unit gru 20 attention mechanism 21 22 19 and robust manalanobis distance rmd 23 for anomaly detection tgcn with attention provided better performance than the baseline tgcn model hcae uses a dimensionality reduction technique ann based dl architecture custom hidden layers and constraints for a robust and well generalized model that achieves an improved attack classification performance when compared to baseline ae models the study assesses both models using original and synthetically generated samples compares the performance of the supervised and unsupervised models and justifies which model is better during a cyber physical attack in a wds to check for generalizability and robustness a synthetic test dataset is generated using gan 24 in the manuscript we introduce the following three research hypotheses 1 research question 1 ai assurance how do ai assurance 25 constraints such as layer customization attention and rmd improve models performance 2 research question 2 data poisoning can models generalizability in wdss be tested using poisoned data generated by gans 3 research question 3 feature localization how can the two models localize features based on embedded and learned representations in a given feature space i e in a water system our study presents a novel approach for detecting cyber physical attacks in wds using tgcn with attention and hcae models we incorporate ai assurance methods 26 and constraints to improve the performance of these models we also evaluate the models on both original and synthetic datasets and compare their performance using various evaluation metrics such as f1 score precision recall and time to detection our results show that both models can detect attacks in a wds with high accuracy and efficiency tgcn with attention and hcae models can be promising approaches for detecting cyber physical attacks in wds we also explain attack localization by identifying the attacked node during attack windows in a time efficient manner the rest of the paper is structured as follows we present related works in section 2 we introduce methods in section 3 specifically tgcn with attention and then hcae then we describe our experimental design for the study in section 4 section 5 provides results and explanations finally section 6 presents our concluding remarks 2 related work given the constantly growing use of cpss the uses of ai in cpss in various applications also grow 27 28 29 this section discusses the related dl approaches for cpss especially multivariate time series data we provide related works for supervised and unsupervised models in cpss and present adversarial data generation approaches using gans finally we present wds security works using ai methods 2 1 temporal graph convolutional network tgcn architecture was first designed and developed by zhao et al 30 for traffic prediction in 2018 the model helps to capture spatial and temporal relationships in feature space it consists of gcns and grus which allow it to learn complex topological structures to capture spatial dependencies and the dynamic changes in the data to capture temporal dependencies in 2020 zhu et al 31 proposed architecture on top of tgcn with an attention mechanism this attention mechanism improves prediction accuracy by adjusting the importance of different time points and assembling global temporal information we transfer this knowledge from their study and adopt an attention mechanism in the wdss to improve forecasting to our best knowledge neither zhao et al s 30 nor zhu et al s 31 architecture has been applied to wds before in another study covert et al 32 succeeded in creating a different architecture of tgcn in 2019 for automatic seizure detection unlike the tgcn architecture proposed by zhao et al 30 their approach consists of several spatio temporal convolutional stc layers the stc layer does not contain any gru but a 1 dimensional convolution to each of its input sequences 32 stc layer operates on the input sequences in a way that allows the graph topology to be maintained at each layer it then refers to the adjacency matrix of structural time series to aggregate neighboring features 32 this architecture is then applied for cyber physical attack detection on the batadal dataset 33 with good results compared to the benchmark values tsiami et al 33 proposed a one stage prediction based algorithm that uses covert et al s tgcn for sensor prediction and md for anomaly detection although the results are promising the model can still be potentially improved by replacing the md metric with the rmd metric 2 2 autoencoder the use of dl methods for anomaly detection has recently achieved improvements in learning high dimensional datasets 34 to eliminate outliers and noise without prior knowledge a deep ae can be a helpful model 35 a book 36 on outlier detection discusses how aes are a natural choice for outlier detection since they are often used to reduce multidimensional datasets the ae model presented at 35 discovers high quality nonlinear features this approach includes splitting the input data into two sets to increase the robustness of the model the work results show good performance since they distinguish between random anomalies and other structured corruptions in cps data sun et al 37 proposed a novel sparse representation framework that learns dictionaries based on the latent space of variational autoencoder vae this framework addresses the limitation of most existing algorithms that can handle large scale and high dimensional data their proposed model can obtain hidden information and extract more high level features by playing the role of dimensionality reduction another work 38 addresses unsupervised anomaly detection on high dimensional data this work aims to address the limitation in existing unsupervised anomaly detection approaches that suffer from decoupled model learning with conflicting optimization goals this paper presented a deep autoencoding gaussian model dagmm for unsupervised anomaly detection dagmm optimizes the deep autoencoder and mixture model parameters jointly to help with the parameter learning of the mixture model this joint optimization helps the autoencoder further reduce reconstruction errors our study focuses on ae reconstruction error reduction and attack detection performance maximization 2 3 generative adversarial networks generative models including gans provide a way to learn deep representations without extensively annotating training data 24 the inspiration for this idea comes from the two player sum game between neural networks where they balance each other out with gains and losses gan consists of a generator and discriminator the generator captures the potential distribution of real samples to generate new samples and the discriminator determines which samples are fake by discriminating which of the generated samples are real samples as accurately as possible 39 gan models are necessary for many dl applications such as security data augmentation and privacy preservation one work 39 stated that generative models understand data perspective using real data to fit the distribution parameters and produce new data using the learned distribution another paper 40 explained the gan framework by applying a range of benchmark datasets they used noise merely on the bottom layer of the generator network they claimed the samples resulting from their estimation method have somewhat high variance and produce competitive samples compared to the generative models in the literature their work did not require interference during the learning allowing them to incorporate various functions into the model however the model has disadvantages the discriminator must be synchronized well with the generator to avoid the probability of placing the generator in a small area of data space furthermore zhou 41 introduced gan on the batadal datasets to create a virtual testbed for wdss their approach computes the membership distance between the dimensions and then divides the dimensions with a small distance into a group then they obtained a larger quantity of attack sample control data by expanding the attack sample another paper 42 addresses the imbalanced and missing sample data used for intrusion detection systems idss to defend against cps attacks they proposed to generate synthetic samples using gans so the ids gets trained using them as well as the originals their results showed improvements in attack detection and model stabilization however they did not provide any direction for balancing data classes in our study we generate synthetic balanced data using gan for testing our models generalizability 2 4 security for wdss the security aspects of water distribution have a wide variety of potential solutions kadosh et al 43 presented a one classifier approach to detect attacks in wdss their approach uses a support vector data description svdd algorithm to classify normal vs anomalous behavior min et al 44 proposed an ann based dl algorithm to detect cyber attacks taormina et al 14 developed an approach that uses aes to detect and localize intrusion attacks in a wd zou et al 45 proposed an event detection model to detect and mitigate water contamination in their approach they proposed a hybrid model that comprises an ann and a support vector machine svm to detect the contamination events bagherzadeh et al 46 evaluated the effects of different feature selection methods on enhancing the model prediction performance of total nitrogen in wastewater treatment plants furthermore they analyzed the importance of different characteristics namely time climate hydraulic flow and wastewater characteristics in predicting energy consumption 47 their study suggested that the gradient boosting machine algorithm exhibits a better performance in forecasting energy consumption when compared to other ml algorithms mehrani et al 48 proposed a hybrid model that combines a mechanistic model and ml model to predict the liquid n20 concentrations their results suggest that a hybrid model that combines a mechanistic model and an artificial neural network ann model performs better with limited availability of data additionally a significant amount of work has been reported on approaches to detect attacks in cps used in water treatment plants 49 furthermore yoong et al 50 designed an ml framework that can detect physical and software generated anomalies in continuous water treatment plants without false alarms adepu et al 15 designed and developed an expert system distributed attack detection dad that detects physical anomalies of a plant in real time operations this study is a succession of a prior work of adepu et al 51 where they developed an anomaly detection framework based on physical invariants derived for each stage of the plant design macas et al 52 claimed that present water treatment plants are complex and their spatio temporal relations need to be explored further the authors presented an unsupervised framework for anomaly detection called attention based convolutional lstm encoder decoder convlstm ed to capture temporal dependencies in another study zizzo et al 53 developed an adversarial attacker model that can compromise a subset of sensors and validate existing anomaly detection models in their study the attacker manipulates the detector by hiding its presence similarly anthi et al 54 generated adversarial samples using the jacobian based saliency map attack and explored how adversarial learning can target the supervised models testing anomaly detection performance using an adversarial attacker model is a popular approach in wdss however based on our search applying gans as adversaries for testing the generalizability of the attack detection models in wdss is a novel study 3 deep h 2 o deep h 2 o fig 1 consists of two main parts 1 tgcn with attention and 2 hcae the supervised model tgcn with attention performs well with time series samples and offers contextual anomaly detection it is more aligned with the batadal case study where sensor relations in the distribution system require comprehensive monitoring additionally we expect that a wds end user i e operator might require ai models that consider the data samples as non time series for specific application requirements for example missing data thus we propose hcae an unsupervised model that works well with non sequential data samples this section presents the design of tgcn with attention and hcae models discusses concealed attack detection in a wds we discuss the design choice of gan to generate poisoned data fig 1 presents the high level overview of our proposed deep h 2 o framework that contains all the models together we present all three models consecutively and their respective outcome selection processes 3 1 c town data description batadal case study the batadal competition simulates an intrusion attack in a fictional c town fig 2a the wds in c town experiences anomalous behavior concealed attacks in its hydraulic components the wds in c town consists of 429 pipes 388 junctions 7 storage tanks 11 pumps 5 valves and a reservoir participants from the competition developed algorithms that detect attacks in the shortest time possible the algorithms aim to accurately detect true attacks i e fewer false alarms and locate nodes when the system has been altered during an attack 8 in c town the seven tanks guarantee water distribution and storage across the nodes t1 t7 c town s wds does not have abnormalities due to seasonal changes resulting in a fixed rate of water consumption a scada system collects data from the components of c town and work cohesively anomalous behaviors are shown using labeled physical abnormalities tables a 5 and b 6 that lead to harmful behaviors in the wds such as an overflow of a tank spotting these anomalies as quickly as possible will ensure the wds does not suffer from preventable damage the water levels of the seven water tanks determine the operations of components in the five pumping stations s1 s5 where one valve and eleven pumps are distributed also nine programmable logic controllers plcs are located near their control components these plcs can send information about their statuses such as on or off the flow rate information passes through them as well as suctions and discharges pressures to the scada system since they are connected to the water level sensors valves and pumps however most plcs receive information from other plcs instead of being connected to the water level sensors and components directly involved with the control logic batadal simulation consists of three datasets all the used data and model codes are available in the following github repository 3 github com ai vtrc deeph2o 3 dataset 1 dataset 1 consists of time series samples over a period of 12 months the instances in this dataset are recorded during normal operation hours with no attacks it has 44 features with 8 762 samples dataset 2 table a 5 consists of samples recorded over a period of three months april to june 2016 the samples in dataset 2 have 44 features the dataset consists of 4178 instances including the normal and attack samples dataset 3 this dataset also has 44 features including the attack labels with 2090 samples from tables a 5 and b 6 it is evident that both dataset 2 and dataset 3 contains a different type of attack samples table b 6 contains three months of data from january 2017 to april 2017 3 2 supervised deep learning tgcn with attention this section explains the mechanism of tgcn with attention rmd and the attack detection topology tsiami et al 33 proposed tgcn for the batadal competition since their model is not publicly available we developed our baseline tgcn model influenced by tsiami s model architecture we discuss the hyper parameter choices in the design section 4 2 1 supervised model design next we apply tgcn with attention as a supervised prediction based algorithm where rmd is used for detecting outliers 3 2 1 attention temporal graph convolutional network a structural wds multivariate time series dataset has a form x a when x ε ℝ n p contains n dimensional observation for p different sequences and x i denotes the systems values at time i we use a static graph technique since the number of dimensions n n is the number of nodes does not change over time a ε 0 1 p p is the adjacency matrix of the p sequences in tgcn with attention we apply gcn and gru to capture spatial and temporal dependencies respectively presented in the form of graph data furthermore we apply an attention mechanism to capture global variation in the structural data fig 3 shows the high level architecture of tgcn with the attention mechanism each method working principle is discussed in the following subsections spatial dependence modeling we consider wds as structural graph data where we consider each pump as a node and water flow rates as edges between nodes gcns are semi supervised models that can process graph structure and capture spatial dependencies in the wds graph structure recent works have shown that gcns have achieved significant progress in applications such as image classification 18 fraud detection 55 and social analysis 56 gcns have spectrum and spatial domain convolutions 18 19 details about gcn can be found in tsiami s 33 paper temporal dependence modeling the batadal dataset is considered a set of time series samples for supervised modeling a dl technique is introduced such as gru 20 for temporal dependence modeling there exist other popular techniques for capturing temporal data such as recurrent neural network rnn and long short term memory lstm 57 rnn is simple and effective for time series modeling but it has limitations in long term forecasting due to gradient vanishing or gradient explosion 58 lstm and gru are both proved 57 to be more efficient than rnn in long term memory modeling they use similar gated mechanisms which allows them to perform similar tasks 59 however gru has a simpler architecture than lstm gru is more light weighted fewer gates than lstm and trains faster than lstm 19 further details about gru can be found in zhu s 19 global variation modeling attention mechanism has been proven to be successful in image capturing generation 21 and recommendation systems 22 it is applied because the supervised model is expected to capture the global variation trends for better accurate forecasting it can learn the importance of sensors values information at every time stamp 19 here we use a context vector to express the global variation trends of sensors values for future sensors values prediction given a time series x i i 1 2 n where n is the length of the time series the attention technique process the data in four steps firstly the hidden states h i i 1 2 n at different moment are calculated using grus and expressed as h h 1 h 2 h n next we introduce a multilayer perceptron as attention score model to weigh the importance of each hidden state 19 later the attention function calculates the context vector c t which can express the global sensors variation information lastly output results are obtained using the context vector we present the eqs 1 3 of the attention mechanism as follows 1 e i w 2 w 1 h b 1 b 2 2 α i exp e i σ k 1 n exp e k 3 c t σ i 1 n α i h i the attention mechanism feeds hidden state h i at each timestamp also known as weight calculation and calculates outputs after two hidden layers a softmax function calculates the logits α i using eq 1 where w 1 and b 1 and w 2 and b 2 are the weight and bias pairs of the first layer the second layer respectively 19 eqs 2 and 3 show the calculation of the global sensor s variation values of the context vector combining these three methods we arrive at the tgcn with attention framework which can be represented as follows eqs 4 7 4 u t σ w u gc a x t h t 1 b u 5 r t σ w r gc a x t h t 1 b r 6 c t tanh w c gc a x t r t h t 1 b c 7 h t u t h t 1 1 u t c t where n sensors data are inputted into the tgcn with attention model to obtain n hidden state h that covered spatio temporal characteristics h t n h t 1 h t u t and r t represent update and reset gates at time t in eqs 4 and 5 respectively c t is the stored content at the current moment in eq 6 h t is the output state at moment t and w and b are the weight and deviation in the training process in eq 7 the hidden states are inputted into the attention mechanism to determine the context vector that represents the global distribution variation information for a given wds the weights of each hidden state h are calculated via softmax using a multilayer perceptron then the forecasting results are processed using a fully connected layer gcn has to ability to encode the topological structures including pump and water flow information by determining the relationship between a node sensor to its surrounding sensors 33 additionally gru determines sensors values at the current time stamp by using the hidden state at the previous time stamp and the sensor s values at the current time stamp as input finally the attention mechanism re weighs the influence of historical time series object states and captures the global variation trends of wdss states for accurate forecasting 3 2 2 attack detection stage tgcn with attention is capable of classifying whether a wds is under attack or no attack our study presents the wds network dataset as a graph with nodes tanks junctions and pumps linked with edges pipes then the recorded readings are defined as structural time series that has the form x a when x ε ℝ n p contains n dimensional observation for p different sequences and x i denotes the systems values at time i a ε 0 1 p p is the adjacency matrix of the p sequences by representing the input dataset in such a form the model learns while capturing the spatio temporal dependence among the feature space we develop the attack detection algorithm algorithm 1 in two stages first we train the model to predict the scada measurement under normal no attack conditions then we calculate the rmd distance metric and calibrate the model to classify all samples as no attack or attack 3 2 3 ai assurance methods for supervised deep learning for this stage we explore ai assurance methods such as attention and rmd to improve the performance of the base model tgcn tgcn can capture the spatio temporal of the time series objects however the history of the data points is re weighted with the addition of attention hence this attention mechanism can capture the global variation trends of time series values for better forecasting accuracy algorithm 1 tgcn tgcn with attention training and testing inputs dataset x and model arguments including ni nh cf activation execute robust concealed attack detection and localization 1 initialize the tgcn tgcn with attention with pre processed dataset x 2 for k 1 2 3 4 n train in training set do 3 pass sample through encoding latent representation and decoding layers eqs 10 11 12 4 use adam optimizer to minimize loss function eq 13 5 return ae parameters θ 6 select threshold θ th 7 for k 1 2 3 4 n test in testing set do 8 pass sample through encoding latent representation and decoding layers eqs 10 11 12 9 return reconstructions errors e r 10 apply threshold θ threshold on reconstructions errors e r for anomaly detection and localization next we apply the outlier detection metric for the wds system many distance metrics are available for outlier detection in multivariate time series datasets including euclidean distance md and rmd md is more effective than euclidean distance due to the use of a covariance matrix to calculate the distance between data points and the center while detecting outliers according to the distribution pattern of the data points 10 60 in brief the covariance matrix in md indicates how variables vary together on the other hand euclidean distance does consider the data points distribution pattern which may assign some abnormal points as outliers and vice versa md carries two desired characteristics it incorporates the dependencies between the prediction error at each sensor which is helpful for combined unusual prediction errors and it allows developers to tune a single global anomaly threshold instead of an individual threshold 33 given a gaussian distributed data the squared md between data x i to the center of the distribution is eq 8 8 d μ σ x i 2 x i μ t σ 1 x i μ where μ is the mean and σ is the covariance matrix of the data points one drawback of md is that its covariance matrix is highly sensitive to outliers which is not preferable if the data is noisy the minimum covariance determinant mcd estimator proposed by p j rousseuw was introduced as a more robust covariance estimator 61 the idea behind mcd is to find the data points in which empirical covariance has the smallest determinant thus giving a pure subset of data points from which to compute standards estimates of the mean and the covariance matrix 61 the application of mcd to md generates the rmd which assures an improved concise outlier detection hence we calculate the rmd measure for multivariate time series outlier detection 3 2 4 prediction and calibration of supervised deep learning we divide the supervised dl model s attack detection and calibration processes 33 into three stages fig 4 in the first stage we preprocess and normalize data and train the tgcn with attention model with the normal training dataset labeled as no attack given the recorded scada measurements of n prior time steps a window of a fixed size n 1 rolls over the time series dataset with a step size of 1 each window s first n measurements are the input to tgcn with attention while the final n 1 data points are the target outputs next stage after training tgcn with attention we pass the validation set x val through the model for prediction y val since we pick normal samples for the training and the validation set we assume that the prediction errors e y y at each sensor are roughly gaussian distributed hence we apply the squared md eq 8 afterward we estimate the robust covariance matrix to calculate the rmd values the squared md is essentially the sum of p independent standard normal variables thus it follows a chi squared distribution with p degrees of freedom 23 during this stage the predicted errors from the normal training dataset have lower rmd values when compared to the threshold as in eq 9 than the anomalous ones the anomalies are detected at timestep i when 9 d μ σ x i 2 i l i th here d μ σ x i 2 i l i is the mean squared rmd in a window of length l and th is the cut off threshold the calibration process is required to obtain the concise threshold th and l we select the thresholds by testing different values for the two parameters in a holdout set with few attack data points and calculate the algorithm s performance with the s function eq 27 in the third and final stage we select parameter values such that it maximizes the rank s function on an unseen testing dataset finally we localize attacked features such as pumps sensors and valves after classifying the timestamps that contain attack data points 3 3 unsupervised deep learning hcae this section discusses the unsupervised wdss attack detection framework the mechanism of ae and its revised version hcae we apply ae as a reconstruction based algorithm that performs dimensionality reduction and reconstructs the original input the outcome from ae and hcae are reconstruction errors difference between output and input data which identify physical anomalies from the feature space fig 5 shows a fully connected ann based ae and its components wds data are fed to the ae and hcae models the models classify the inputs as either normal or anomalous samples based on a threshold 3 3 1 auto encoder aes have been a widely adopted dl method for the last couple of decades for both dimensionality reduction and feature engineering 62 we develop our baseline ae model by adopting taormina s 14 ae model additional information about the design of our baseline ae model is discussed in the unsupervised model design section 4 2 2 the network is divided into two parts an encoder function h f x and a decoder function x g f x aes can be generalized as stochastic mappings of p encoder h x and p decoder x h where h is a hidden layer h f x that presents a code and is used to characterize the input multi layer perceptrons mlp 63 form aes with an input layer an output layer and multiple hidden layers mathematically an encoder and decoder can be written as eqs 10 12 10 ϕ x ℱ 11 ψ ℱ x 12 ϕ ψ arg min ϕ ψ x ψ ϕ x 2 where eqs 10 and 11 represent encoder and decoder functionality respectively eq 12 represents loss of the ae input data x is transformed into a compressed representation ℱ and reconstructed as x again the objective of an ae is to minimize the reconstruction errors eqs 13 and 14 which yields a better reconstruction of the input set x 13 ℒ x x x x 2 14 ℒ x x x σ w σ wx b b 2 reconstruction errors are usually minimized using stochastic gradient descent sgd 64 a potent optimization tool for many dl applications however our study applies the adam optimizer another powerful stochastic optimization method that outperforms sgd 65 an anomaly detection system is expected to produce minimal false alarms as false alarms are associated with expensive maintenance operations fig 5 represents an ann based ae despite having fine tuned hyper parameters ae suffers from non determinism during training resulting in a higher reconstruction error a higher reconstruction error can result in an increased number of false positives thus affecting the detector s performance 66 as ae algorithms automatically learn features by performing feature engineering for dimensionality reduction they tend to learn different features at each time 62 this pattern of learning is suitable for systems where feature importance is unknown for instance thousands of sensor values in a water distribution system complex and difficult feature space to human perception however such a non deterministic learning pattern might not be suitable for a wds we expect a wds model to provide if possible zero false alarms because of expensive maintenance operations to address these issues we revise ae architecture and form hcae thus solving the non determinism problem of ae by further reducing reconstruction errors and improving attack detection performance by reducing false positives 3 3 2 high confidence autoencoder hcae hcae is a modified version of baseline ae we developed hcae by applying assurance methods eqs 15 18 to ae improving the attack detection performance compared to the ae baseline we use hcae to represent input features in a manifold space that generates minimum reconstruction errors while decoding and recreating the input features to minimize the reconstruction errors the practitioners currently follow a trial and error based method and optimize hyperparameters over multiple iterations this approach is empirical reducing the reconstruction errors is time consuming and computationally expensive in a complex wds we apply a combination of neural network layer constraints for the model and achieve deterministic learning which results in a manifold representation that yields minimum reconstruction errors this strategy ensures learning a set of expected features from the training data each time resulted reconstruction errors yield better feature representation and attack detection performance 67 we present our experimental results in the context of a wds how a set of constraints yields minimal reconstruction errors and robust attack detection algorithm 2 presents both algorithms including baseline ae and hcae training steps for attack detection in water systems 3 3 3 ai assurance constraints for the auto encoder recent advancements in dl apis including keras 4 4 github com fchollet keras tensorflow 5 5 github com tensorflow and pythorch 6 6 github com pytorch pytorch expedite aes development more than ever nevertheless a lack of a clear understanding of the fundamental properties of dimensionality reduction leads to a complex and inferior model thus it is crucial to understand and adopt the basic properties of dimensionality reduction in aes we present multiple custom layer constraints and apply them to facilitate dimensionality reduction in a wds hcae is effective for tuning and optimizing hyperparameters algorithm 2 baseline ae and hcae training and testing inputs dataset x model arguments including ni nh cf activation and customized layers execute robust concealed attack detection and localization 1 initialize ae hcae with pre processed dataset x 2 this step is applicable for hcae apply constraints on encoder and decoder layers using a combination of tied weights eq 15 orthogonal weights eq 16 uncorrelated features eq 17 unit norm eq 18 3 for k 1 2 3 4 n train in training set do 4 pass sample through encoding latent representation and decoding layers eqs 10 11 12 5 use adam optimizer to minimize loss function eq 13 6 return ae parameters θ params 7 select threshold θ th 8 for k 1 2 3 4 n test in testing set do 9 pass sample through encoding latent representation and decoding layers eqs 10 11 12 10 return reconstructions errors e r 11 apply threshold θ th on reconstructions errors e r for anomaly detection and localization in order to improve the aes detection performance we apply the following set of constraints 1 tied weights tied weights 68 ensure equal weights for both encoder and decoder this constraint also ensures easy learning especially pca like dimensionality reduction and regularization however they do not always perform well on complex non linear models again tied weight constraint is not always necessary to continually improve the representation if reconstruction errors are reasonable the coding generates orthogonal latent features for given data such representation is helpful in dimensionality reduction and eventually for anomaly detection in a multi layer ae weights vectors of layer l from an encoder and a decoder are transposed as eq 15 15 w l w l t 2 orthogonal weights each weight vector is independent therefore the weights of each encoding layer are orthogonal the orthogonality constraints 69 act as regularization for the ae mathematically orthogonality condition for ae can be presented as 16 w encoder t w encoder i on applying this constraint penalizes non orthogonal weights depending on the dataset the user can choose either orthogonal or non orthogonal weights thus the application of this constraint is conditioned on regularization 3 uncorrelated features if the output of the encoder is orthogonal latent representations must be uncorrelated 70 hence the output of the ae must have eq 17 17 correlation o encoder i o encoder j 0 i j 4 unit norm the weights of each layer must have unit norms 71 this property helps to control exploding and vanishing gradients unit norm constraint eq 18 must be allied to all the layers of the ae 18 j 1 p w ij 2 1 i 1 k these four constraints eqs 15 18 during model development ensure the model does not create a sub optimal decision boundary they ensure the creation of a well posed ae while constructing a high confident wds model unit norm and orthogonality solve regularization problems especially for aes when ae learns from a training set but does not represent a test set well also tide weight can reduce the number of parameters as a regularization technique here the unit norm constraint addresses exploding gradients issue by bounding gradients into a finite value additionally orthogonality resolves the vanishing gradients problem by assigning fewer nonzero weights so only informative weights stand out thus only these nonzero weights flow information during backpropagation and resolve the vanishing gradient issue 68 69 70 71 when we apply these four constraints eqs 15 18 while designing hcae we hypothesize the model will not converge to a suboptimal point to test our hypothesis we compare the results before and after using these four constraints observe if attack detection performance f1 score is improved from the baseline ae 14 we use the batadal dataset for training and testing our models later in the manuscript we present adversarial testing using a gan to observe if the model can detect attacks from synthetically generated poisoned datasets previously unseen data with a different distribution 3 3 4 attack detection and calibration stages of hcae hcae is capable of classifying whether the wdss are under attack or no attack by investigating each sample nonetheless the direct classification technique becomes erroneous with a small and imbalanced dataset because ae requires a large dataset to learn the representation however with hcae s deterministic learning we hypothesize the hcae can detect attacks with minimum false positives we test our hypothesis by training both ae and hcae with the same imbalanced data and evaluate with total false positives for each model unlike the supervised algorithm tgcn with attention we present data streams with non sequential representation next x is defined as x ε ℝ n m which contains n dimensional observation for m different features and x i denotes the systems values at time i the attack detection process is divided into two stages fig 6 in stage one we create custom hcae layers by following eqs 15 18 we ensure the model always yields minimum reconstruction errors and maximum binary classification performance f1 score by observing the model performance on multiple hyperparameter sets later in stage two data are preprocessed and normalized to have the maximal absolute value of each attribute applied to all three provided datasets after that we train the hcae model with the normal training dataset labeled no attack we split the training dataset into training x train y train and validation x val y val set we apply early stopping a regularization scheme when the model converges and starts to over fit on the training dataset during each epoch we compute loss eq 15 the squared of the reconstruction errors r e x x minimize them using adam optimizer after both ae and hcae models are well trained we select threshold θ th in an empirical fashion for that the range of average reconstruction errors among all features in a sample is observed and summed up then we set the threshold based on the final range estimation as shown in the following eq 19 19 θ th max f x m x x m for n training samples the calibration process is crucial to derive a concise threshold θ th for testing the model on new samples if a test object is classified as attack we localize the features associated with attacked attributes such as pumps sensors and valves using reconstruction errors for the hcae model we select hyperparameters that result in the best model s performance f1 score our objective is to compare the performance of hcae ae with constraints with the ae model without constraints to facilitate a fair comparison between hcae and ae models we retrain taormina s ae model using the same hyperparameters of the hcae model we refer to the retrained ae model as the baseline ae model 3 4 synthetic wdss attack data generation unlike other dl based attack detection approaches that require significant domain knowledge and passive awareness of the attacked model 72 gans are proven to be effective in generating realistic attack samples poisoned data 73 with minimal information about either the domain or the dl model we use gan 40 for synthetic data generation gan network learns feature statistics of a given dataset for generating a new set of synthetic data a generator produces the synthetic samples in the gan network and a discriminator evaluates them the generator learns by mapping latent feature space to a data distribution of particular interest discriminator maximizes its objective by learning how to distinguish original samples from the generated fake samples the generator aims to minimize the discriminator s objective by fooling it into thinking otherwise fake samples as real ones for instance while generating a synthetic image set gan keeps the similar statistics of generated images set from the training set hence those generated images look superficially similar to human perception during the training phase both generator and discriminator play a minimax game where a bi level optimization is performed to train the gan network in our study the generator learns the distribution of training samples x and maps data space as g z θ g where g is differentiable with respect to parameters θ g then discriminator investigates if the data comes from the training samples and not from the generator itself we train the discriminator to specify between original and generated samples from the generator correctly both the discriminator and the generator take participation in a minimax game which is represented as a value function as v g d as eq 20 20 min g max d v d g e x p data x log d x e z p z z log 1 d g z here the generator is trained to maximize logd x and minimize log 1 d g z in a numerical and iterable fashion this gan approach generates synthetic poisoned data for the wdss system we assess both supervised and unsupervised models on these synthetic data for generalization study 4 experimental design this section presents the three research questions and discusses the selection of hyperparameters and metrics used in our experiments in our experiments supervised learning models are trained using two datasets dataset 1 and dataset 2 as unsupervised learning requires no attack samples for training the unsupervised models are trained with dataset 1 no attack samples both the supervised and the unsupervised models are evaluated using dataset 3 we use total of 492 attack samples from dataset 3 to train the gan model for synthetic data generation experiments are conducted to answer the following three research questions presented in section 1 2 4 1 experimental models design this section discusses the hyperparameter settings for tgcn tgcn with attention hcae ae and gan this section presents the optimized hyperparameters set to train and evaluate the models we also list all alternative hyperparameter values that are used to randomly search for the best models in appendix c table c 7 4 1 1 supervised model design we pre process the time series data as graph data and normalize them during normalization we perform standard minimum maximum scaling ranges from 0 to 1 the graph data can be represented as an adjacency matrix along with node data fig 2b illustrates the node s information and locations in c town s wds network the adjacency matrix is constructed of the provided 31 nodes note that only one type of attribute is reported for each node in the network except the pump nodes that have two different measurements status and flow of water we keep a single attribute for each node and exclude the binary pump status where the numerical flow rate is preserved the supervised models tgcn baseline and tgcn with attention are implemented using pytorch and scikit learn api 7 7 github com scikit learn scikit learn the models are trained on a cpu with intel core i5 10th gen we have tested both models with multiple iterations with different hyperparameter sets to obtain one for tgcn we choose an adam optimizer algorithm with a learning rate of 0 01 for tgcn with attention we choose an adam optimizer learning rate of 0 005 then we utilize rectified linear unit relu as an activation function for both models the batch size selected for both models is 16 and 128 respectively from each batch we take sequences of length n n 8 hours from the training inputs x train and targets y train we use the optimizer to minimize the mean squared error mse loss while selecting optimal hyperparameters we focus on maximizing performance metrics including precision recall f1 score accuracy and specificity to train both tgcn and tgcn with attention models we use the no attack samples dataset 1 and split them into training and validation sets with a 75 25 ratio then we train both models for 10 times with 1000 epochs each time a threshold th is fine tuned using the holdout set dataset 2 to maximize the ranking s score on the holdout set 4 1 2 unsupervised model design we pre process the data before inputting them to the ae and the hcae the pre processing step includes normalization and removing null samples from the data for normalization we perform standard minimum maximum scaling ranges from 0 to 1 both ae baseline and hcae models are implemented using scikit learn api and are trained on a cpu with intel core i5 10th gen we use adam optimizer with learning rate 0 0001 a decay factor of 0 5 and β 1 β 2 0 9 0 99 additionally 500 epochs are selected with a minibatch size of 32 the design of hcae differs from baseline ae in the design of the hidden layer definition early stopping is applied with patience 3 for better regularization here the patience parameter ensures convergence when the training loss and validation loss don t change for three consecutive epochs and the training is marked complete we are compressing input features using an under complete autoencoder architecture and both models compression factor is selected as 2 5 thus we get the number of neurons in each layer as following encoder layers l 0 l 1 l 2 43 34 25 bottleneck layer l 3 17 and decoder layer as l 4 l 5 l 6 25 34 43 eqs 15 18 represent ai assurance constraints including tide weights orthogonal weights uncorrelated features and unit norms constraints which are applied to the ae we pick a combination of these constraints and apply them to the hidden layers our goal is to obtain a meaningful and uncorrelated latent representation a prerequisite for dimensionality reduction we empirically select optimal hyperparameters for the ae and the hcae models and maximize binary classification performance scores including precision recall f1 score accuracy and specificity dataset 1 is used during model training and dataset 3 is used for model testing finally we select threshold θ th by following an empirical approach we plot the f1 scores for baseline ae and hcae models for dataset 3 against a threshold range from 96 percentile to 100 percentile of their average reconstruction errors fig 7 we observe that both models reach a maximum f1 score at 98 5 percentile hence we choose θ th 0 985 as the model s threshold 4 1 3 gan model settings a gan 24 is used to generate poisoned data in our experiments all 492 attack samples from the test dataset dataset 3 are provided as input to the gan network for training the generator the prior noise dimension is set as 32 the prior noise dimension and class labels are mapped into hidden layers layer dimension 128 with a rectified linear unit relu activation function for output a sigmoid function is selected as the last activation layer for the discriminator unit we choose an adam optimizer to minimize the loss function of the generator with a learning rate of 1e 5 additionally we pick a minibatch of size 128 and 200 epochs and set β 1 β 2 0 5 0 9 for the optimizer the poisoned dataset is generated by synthesizing only the attack samples from the test set dataset 3 then the generated samples are randomly placed in the same test set dataset 3 again the synthetic dataset is conditioned to balance the number of samples in both classes testing a model with a balanced dataset helps us to evaluate the dl model s generalization ability hence the poisoned dataset used in our experiments consists of 984 samples with 492 attack samples and 492 no attack samples 4 2 model performance metrics we use multiple performance metrics from the batadal competition to evaluate the model s ability to detect a threat in the shortest possible amount of time in addition to this we also use additional five metrics namely accuracy precision recall specificity and f1 score to measure the performance of a binary classifier 4 2 1 time to detection score s ttd time to detection is the difference between ground truth attack start time t o eq 21 and algorithm detection start time t d 21 0 s ttd t d t 0 δ t the attack is indicated by δt a smaller ttd indicates that an algorithm has an improved detection performance during an ongoing attack additionally the detection rate is associated with recall or sensitivity which is otherwise referred as the true positive rate tpr and it is represented in eq 22 additionally precision what proportion of positive identifications was actually correct is represented in eq 23 22 sensitivity recall tpr tp tp fn 23 precision tp tp fp here fn is the number of false negatives and tp is the number of true positives tpr is determined by the ratio of the correct attack classifications and the total number of attacks detected by the algorithm including tp and fn additionally we leverage true negative rate tnr or specificity metric to check false alarms by the models and it is defined as eq 24 24 specificity tnr tn fp tn tn is the number of true negatives and fp is the number of false positives tnr is determined by the ratio of the number of correct classifications for safe conditions without attack and the number of total classifications for safe conditions including fp and tn 4 2 2 binary classification metric f1 score eqs 22 and 23 are also known as recall and precision respectively in addition to accuracy and ranking we calculate the f1 score using eq 25 that accounts for both precision and recall 25 f 1 score 2 precision recall precision recall training a dl model with an imbalanced dataset and evaluating its performance using the accuracy metric can be misleading 74 in such cases an f1 score is preferred over accuracy as the f1 score represents a harmonic mean of precision and recall 4 2 3 classification performance score s clf to compare with the other state of the art detection algorithms eqs 22 and 24 are merged as classification performance score s clf eq 26 the mean of eqs 22 and 24 26 s clf tpr tnr 2 this score s clf represents detection as well as false negative alarms additionally this score is relevant to the f1 score which is appropriate for problems with binary classification the score can result in a 0 or 1 where 1 indicates a perfect classification 4 2 4 ranking score s time to detection s ttd and classification performance score s clf metrics can be merged further into a single ranking score as eq 27 27 s γ s ttd 1 γ s clf according to the batadal competition γ is set to 0 5 to ensure the weight of the early detection and the accuracy are equally adjusted 8 5 deep h 2 o results this section presents the results of the three research questions presented prior rq1 rq3 5 1 rq1 ai assurance 5 1 1 supervised detection results table 1 presents the attack detection performance of both supervised and unsupervised models among the two supervised models results suggest that the tgcn with attention model performs better in attack detection in wds with the introduction of attention and rmd assurance methods the tgcn with attention model results in a significant improvement in recall and f1 score performance metrics out of the five metrics presented in table 1 we observe an improvement in precision recall f1 score and accuracy by 7 6 22 1 15 5 and 4 7 respectively precision recall and specificity metrics improve from baseline tgcn to tgcn with attention in terms of detecting attacks in wds results indicate that both the tgcn model baseline and tgcn with attention model successfully detect all seven attacks nevertheless we notice fig 8a b c d that the baseline model tgcn has a higher number of false positives compared to tgcn with attention model we believe that the introduction of assurance methods attention and rmd improves the tgcn with attention model and minimizes the number of false positives this is also reflected in the model s performance with an improved f1 and precision score compared to its baseline overall our results suggest that tgcn with attention model performs better than tgcn baseline 5 1 2 unsupervised detection results to study the impact of the assurance constraints eqs 15 18 on hcae we present the model performance with and without assurance constraints in table 1 not all four constraints bring optimal performance but a combination of these constraints achieves better classification and dimensionality reduction performance than the baseline ae model from table 1 we observe that sensitivity specificity accuracy and f1 score improve significantly with assurance constraints applied to the ae also we observe that precision is increased because hcae learns the imbalanced data batadal dataset is unbalanced better than ae fig 9 presents the attack detection performance of the unsupervised models the test dataset dataset 3 consists of seven different attacks all seven attacks are classified as attack by both ae and hcae models fig 9a and b present all seven attacks detected by the ae model and the hcae model respectively as fig 9a illustrates in addition to detecting all seven attacks the ae model results in 21 sets of false alarms on the contrary the hcae model results in a single false alarm fig 9b the result suggests that hcae learns the complex interdependencies between the features during concealed attacks hence performing better than ae in detecting the attacks table 4 presents the performance metrics including the ranking score s although both hcae and ae time to detection performance is identical 94 7 the classification performance ranking score s of the hcae has significantly improved than the baseline ae from the table we observe that classification performance has been improved from 80 to 92 similarly tpr also improved from 60 4 to 86 5 a significant increase this performance improvement is expected as hcae learns the complex relationships between features in a deterministic scheme whereas ae learns them in a non deterministic approach 5 2 rq2 data poisoning in this sub section we present the performance of both supervised and unsupervised models on poisoned data table 2 presents the attack detection performance on synthetic poisoned data generated using gan results fig 10a b c d suggest the supervised models perform poorly with poisoned data more specifically for tgcn we observe by comparing tables 1 and 2 that the attack detection performance of the model is decreased by more than 50 across all five metrics similar to the baseline model tgcn with attention model behaves poorly results suggest on average a 65 reduction in performance across all five metrics the poor performance of supervised models on the poisoned data can be explained as follows the tgcn and tgcn with attention models learn the behavior of a wds by embedding the spatio temporal structure of the wds in other words they learn to detect attacks based on the sequential information inferred from the dataset during the training process as the attacks are randomly distributed across the poisoned dataset gan data both the supervised models fail to detect the attacks resulting in poor performance on the contrary to supervised models we observe that the ae and hcae unsupervised models perform well fig 11a b c d on the poisoned data in some cases results suggest the performance of both unsupervised models is better on poisoned data table 2 than their performance on the test dataset table 1 this improved performance can be attributed to the fact that ae and hcae models treat the training samples as non sequential data and the data are randomly placed with poisoned samples hence they can detect the randomly distributed attacks from the poisoned dataset effectively 5 3 rq3 feature localization in this sub section we present the model s ability to identify the features impacted by an attack feature localization we perform feature localization by estimating the deviation of the features from the no attack dataset distribution the results presented so far suggest that the model customized with ai assurance methods and constraints performs better than their respective baseline model hence for feature localization we limit our evaluation to two models tgcn with attention and hcae table 3 presents the localization results for supervised and unsupervised models the localized feature that matches the ground truth is highlighted in bold for tgcn with attention model to localize the impacted features during an attack we compare the mean squared error of the network from the testing set of its corresponding maximum error from the validation set 25 of dataset 1 the supervised model can successfully localize five attacked nodes among the seven attacks while failing to localize attacked nodes for attack 9 and attack 13 next we present the feature localization performance of the unsupervised model to localize the impacted features we select the features with the highest number of deviations from the threshold θ th by estimating their mean squared error during a predicted attack we pick the top features for which reconstruction errors deviate most from the threshold θ th overall the results indicate that the modified models can successfully localize various attacks including alteration of thresholds signals and meter readings furthermore we observe that tgcn with attention localizes the attacked features with a minimal number of false positives fp among the two models false positives are estimated for each attack category by subtracting the set of total nodes detected by the model in that category from the set of ground truths for example consider attack 12 in which the readings of l t2 are altered while both the models successfully localize the feature l t2 the tgcn with attention model in addition to identifying l t2 also identifies two additional features as potentially attacked in contrast hcae models identify additional eight nodes within the proximity as potentially attacked features this is because the neighbor nodes show similar behavior during normal operations and therefore during an attack the model predicts those neighbor nodes are highly likely to be attacked 5 4 deep h 2 o model sensitivity analysis in this section we evaluate the attack detection outcomes of both supervised and unsupervised models using shapley values shapley values are the outcome of a game theoretic approach that explain the output of any ml model in literature variance based sensitivity analysis is a popular approach that explains black box models primarily sobol based methods are gaining traction 75 however this approach has one major limitation it cannot explain localized observations in our work we are more concerned with local observation explanations than global ones since the models detect attacks from different nodes and time points in a wds therefore we elected to use deep explainer 8 8 github com slundberg shap an enhanced approach from shapley additive explanations shap library similar to kernel shap it approximates the conditional expectations of shap values using a selection of background samples in this analysis we provide all seven categories of attack samples separately generate shap values and plot the scaled shap values ranging from 0 to 100 in fig 12 this figure represents local feature importance during the attack detection by the models from the figure we can observe that feature localization table 3 and deep explainer provide similar insights about the model s outcome by observing fig 12 it becomes evident that the model gives less attention to deactivated nodes from the training set dataset 1 including pu3 pu5 pu6 pu9 and pu11 while giving much more importance to the flow of pumps that worked during the training set additionally we observe that all tanks were given attention during all seven categories because they are always active in the training set one shortcoming of both models is that they could not learn the relationships among junctions because of the imbalance of the training dataset most influential junctions got prioritized by the model over less participating ones therefore model attack localization was incorrect during attacks 9 and 13 l t2 and l t7 weren t detected because other junctions got more attention including p j280 p j289 p j300 when compared to ground truth nodes v2 and pu10 pu11 5 5 comparison with batadal models next we compare the attack classification performance of our models with the top performing models from the batadal competition to maintain consistency in our evaluation all the models are evaluated using the test dataset dataset 3 table 4 presents the comparison results where our models are highlighted in bold the results indicate both the unsupervised and supervised model exhibits better performance hcae unsupervised model with a ranking score of 0 933 is ranked 3 whereas tgcn with attention achieves 0 845 and ranks eighth among the models from the batadal competition although our models do not achieve the highest ranking they are superior compared to the top two models for the following reasons 1 the top ranked model is physics based and hence it is not relevant to compare with our model an ai based model 2 the second ranked model although an ai based model might not perform well detecting attacks on previously unseen data on the contrary our models are scalable and demonstrate a better attack detection performance on unseen data results indicate that adding the ai assurance methods to the tgcn model improves its overall performance compared to the baseline model s 0 754 tgcn with attention model achieves a better score s 0 845 additionally we observe that the time to detection s ttd has improved significantly the baseline model achieves 0 735 whereas the tgcn with attention model achieves 0 839 a higher s ttd is significant in the context of wds an improved s ttd score indicates that the tgcn with attention model can swiftly identify an attack at the earliest compared to its baseline model for unsupervised models both hcae and ae baseline achieve an identical score for time to detection s ttd 0 947 however we observe that the hcae model has an improved tpr score 0 865 compared to its baseline 0 604 this results in the hcae model achieving a ranking score s 0 933 substantially higher than its baseline s 0 873 furthermore a higher tpr indicates that the model detects most attack samples thus improving the trustworthiness of the model during deployment both tgcn with attention and hcae models achieve a better ranking score compared to their respective baseline models 6 discussions 6 1 water laws and public policy environmental and water laws govern our nation s water air waste and other natural components most of the time and due to the public s lack of awareness or attention voters are usually drawn to water and environmental issues after wide scale incidents of environmental damage such as the flint water crisis 9 9 https www michigan gov mdhhs inside mdhhs legal flint water settlement and its effects on safe drinking water in the state the clean water act cwa establishes the basic rules and benchmarks for regulating quality standards and discharging pollutants into the waters of the united states the work presented in this manuscript aims to provide preventive measures for the health of water treatment plants against the rising dangers of cyber attacks deep h 2 o is instrumental in governing cyber components of a water facility providing recommendations to wdss operators on when and where the attack occurs and validating against water policies and environmental protection agency epa regulations this project continues as a collaboration with wdss in northern virginia and the district of columbia dc to deploy deep h 2 o at local facilities and aim to expand it to other wdss as well conclusions and future work items are presented next 6 2 conclusions and future work this manuscript presents deep h 2 o a novel cyber attack detection framework for wdss deep h 2 o applies ai assurance to two dl architectures tgcn with attention and hcae and compares their performance improvement over their baseline models for tgcn with attention model supervised model it has been observed that applying ai assurance including attention and rmd with tgcn improves the model s attack detection accuracy similarly for hcae unsupervised model applying ai assurance including tide weights orthogonality constraints and other constraints improves detection accuracy and f1 score of the hcae model compared to ae the performance of both supervised and unsupervised models on poisoned data has been evaluated for the supervised model compared to its performance on the test dataset it has been observed that most of the metrics decrease significantly the supervised model struggles to perform i e to detect an attack if there is randomness in the dataset unlike the supervised model that performs poorly on poisoned data our result indicates that the predictive performance of the unsupervised model hcae is similar for the test data and the poisoned gan data no significant drop in the model s performance has been observed to explain this phenomenon the unsupervised model learns uncorrelated feature representation in the latent dimension and does not learn the sequential attributes hence the model can identify randomness in the poisoned data result suggests that the hcae model has better generalizability among the two models the unsupervised model hcae performs better in terms of ranking score and time to detection score also hcae is well generalized and regularized while detecting attacked samples on the batadal test set this improved classification performance and recall values make hcae a better choice for deployment in the wds the study uses multiple performance metrics including time to detection score classification score ranking score precision recall accuracy and f1 score to measure the model s performance the f1 score improvement is focused on the various metrics because of the heavily imbalanced batadal dataset therefore this particular case the f1 score becomes an important metric that considers model attack prediction errors and accounts for the type of errors by taking the harmonic mean of precision and recall that is only if both precision and recall values are high the f1 score gets higher in this study a higher f1 score indicates higher attack and no attack harmonic class detection additionally the unsupervised model outperforms the supervised model for wds including a better f1 score the unsupervised model is a one class classification method that generalizes well regardless of the water systems spatio temporal structure making the model simpler than tgcn with attention additionally the unsupervised model does not require labeling an expensive and time consuming activity in the model development process the ability of both supervised and unsupervised models in feature localization has been evaluated localizing a feature is tedious for both models during a concealed attack although the results are not highly accurate they are promising and vital for wds for instance both models can identify attacked node s or neighboring nodes during an attack further refining the model hyper parameters by applying a grid search technique can improve the performance and result in better feature localization results which is a potential future work the sensitivity analysis of two models showed that less important or sensitive variables were inactive in the training set while active components were the most influential during a cyber attack however some common junctions had high sensitivity or importance flags due to imbalanced training data additionally the extension of this work can be the following 1 the gan used in these experiments to generate synthetic data fails to replicate the time series information from the original dataset the attack samples are generated merely using gan consequently the next plan is to use timegan 76 a variant of gan to generate sequential time series synthetic data consisting of both attack and non attack samples and test the performance of dl models on the time series synthetic data 2 a large metropolitan city can have multiple wdss across various locations within the metroplex a bad actor can start a concealed attack on one of the wds and continue to spread the attack across all locations to swiftly detect and prevent such attacks federated learning fl techniques 77 can be adapted to learn from the initial concealed attack and leverage that information to prevent future attacks of similar nature across other wdss furthermore using the real time data collected from the wdss to retrain the dl model can significantly improve the detection performance of the model however given the geographically distributed nature of wdss it is essential to preserve the privacy of the real time data collected from the wdss therefore the plan is to use fl techniques to guarantee data and model privacy 3 training and deploying a dl model across different wdss is challenging as the threshold might vary across different wdss locations this is further complicated by a set of different operations across wdss another interesting idea is to explore context learning 72 to enable dl models to be context aware such as population and weather and efficiently detect attacks that vary based on different thresholds furthermore training and evaluation of the deep h 20 framework using real world wds datasets 10 10 https itrust sutd edu sg such as water distribution wadi dataset and secure water treatment swat is a future task lastly a plan to develop approaches that explain the model s outcomes to water plant operators could be a great study

12603,ammonia nitrogen is a crucial component of landfill leachate and a major factor in the eutrophication of aquatic bodies a novel approach was developed using the continuous flat sheet gas permeable membranes gpms reactor pretreatment to efficiently remove and recover ammonia nitrogen the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency reached 74 2 4 5 and 66 2 4 9 respectively when simulated nitrogenous wastewater and landfill leachate were treated under the following conditions influent flow rate 25 l d ph 11 0 temperature 25 c sulfuric acid absorption concentration 2 5 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity 70 ml min in addition nh4 2so4 i e a crucial ammonia resource was recovered efficiently and the flat sheet gpms exhibited stable hydrophobic properties specifically the combination of membrane pretreatment and biological treatment reduced the ammonia nitrogen concentration from 230 mg l with direct biological treatment only to 40 mg l with the removal efficiency benefitting from the increase in the chemical oxygen demand total ammonia nitrogen cod tan ratio of the leachate after membrane pretreatment furthermore microorganisms that are capable of ammonia nitrogen removal planktosalinus and rheinheimera were selectively enriched overall this study provides a practical method to enhance ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery for the treatment of wastewater containing high ammonia nitrogen concentrations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords gas permeable membranes ammonia nitrogen removal ammonium sulfate recovery landfill leachate biological treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to china s annual environmental report total municipal solid waste msw output has reached 242 million tons in 2019 1 more than half of the msw in china is disposed of in landfill 2 and waste leachate is readily generated during landfill processes resulting in secondary pollution 3 as the most common pollutant in landfill leachate ammonia nitrogen can easily cause water eutrophication 4 and is harmful to humans and the natural environment 5 therefore treating ammonia nitrogen in landfill leachate has attracted increasing attention to date biological treatment 6 has been widely applied for wastewater nitrogen removal because of its cost effectiveness and reusability however traditional biological treatment is unsatisfactory for treating old landfill leachate because of its highly unbalanced c n ratio and the bio toxicity of high ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the leachate 7 moreover the biodegradability of leachate is low and decreases as landfills age 8 which further contributes to failure of the sole biological treatment to meet treatment requirements 9 10 therefore more reliable approaches need to be developed to provide favorable conditions for biological treatment of landfill leachates in response to the research of waste to wealth and green recycling 11 12 the concept of ammonia nitrogen treatment has changed from removing ammonia nitrogen to recovering ammonia nitrogen air stripping is a common method for recovering ammonia nitrogen from wastewater however it has some problems such as high energy consumption and easy scaling 13 struvite precipitation is also an effective method for recovering ammonia nitrogen in the form of mgnh4po4 6h2o 14 however this method requires not only the use of chemicals to regulate ph but also the addition of large amounts of phosphate and magnesium salts to achieve precipitation and hence input costs may exceed the struvite value 15 some studies have reported that recycling ammonium from wastewater as ammonia fertilizer has potential significance for agriculture 16 18 with the widespread application of membrane technology in wastewater treatment membrane technology for ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery is gaining traction in industry a study of ammonia recovery from chicken manure using a nonporous tubular polydimethylsiloxane membrane maintained removal fluxes in the range of 1 22 1 48 g m2 day 19 microporous hollow fiber membranes have been demonstrated to effectively separate ammonia 20 however they are prone to pollution and blockage and require high pretreatment requirements which restricts their adoption and popularization 21 22 thus investigating membrane technologies with high ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency recovery efficiency and pollution resistance is essential this study proposes a practical method to enhance ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery via the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor pretreatment which combines membranes with traditional stripping and absorption processes first the optimal operating conditions for ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery were studied using simulated nitrogenous wastewater the performance of the flat sheet gpms was then verified in a real life application experiment to further illustrate this the efficiencies of ammonia nitrogen removal via direct biological treatment hereafter termed dbt and the combination of membrane pretreatment and biological treatment hereafter termed mt bt of landfill leachate were compared finally we elucidated the impact of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor pretreatment on the microbial community structure responsible for ammonia nitrogen removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 optimization of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor operating conditions 2 1 1 materials in this process simulated nitrogenous wastewater nh4cl solution with ammonia nitrogen concentration of 1000 mg l was selected as the influent sodium hydroxide was used to adjust the ph of the influent unless otherwise specified the continuous flat sheet gpms were provided by china haisum engineering co ltd and were composed of polyester fiber carbon fiber bamboo pulp fiber and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe a flat sheet gpms module was composed of a fixed square membrane frame inlet and outlet pipes and two pieces of flat sheet gpms the effective surface area of each flat sheet gpms was 169 cm2 two flat sheet gpms were glued to both sides of the membrane frame to form a sealed internal fluid passageway as part of the circulation line for the sulfuric acid absorption liquid the ammonia nitrogen containing wastewater flowed outside the membrane module and the acid absorption solution flowed inside the membrane module fig s1 under alkaline conditions the majority of the nitrogen in ammonia is transformed into free ammonia which is then absorbed by the acid solution in internal circulation into ammonium sulfate e g nh4 2so4 the contact angle morphological structures and infrared spectra of the membranes were measured 2 1 2 continuous flat sheet gpms reactor as shown in fig 1a the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor was composed of three 10 l reaction tanks in series a cock sample was placed at the bottom of each tank the influent was poured into a continuous flat sheet gpms reactor using a peristaltic pump each tank was equipped with two flat sheet gpms modules the inlet pipes of the modules were connected to the inlet valves at the bottom of the tanks and the six inlet valves were then connected to the main inlet pipe similarly the outlet pipes of the modules were connected to the outlet valves at the top of the modules and the six outlet valves were then connected to the main outlet pipe the sulfuric acid solution was added to the sulfuric acid absorption liquid tank circularly injected into the inside of the modules using the peristaltic pump and the main inlet pipes and then returned to the absorption liquid tank through the main outlet pipe the top of the reactor was sealed to prevent ammonia leakage a mechanical stirrer was used to control the stirring speed at 40 rpm and a heater was used to maintain a stable temperature on top of each tank 2 1 3 experimental methods single factor experiments were conducted to explore the effects of different process parameters on nitrogen removal such as the influent flow rate influent ph temperature sulfuric acid absorption concentration and sulfuric acid flow velocity the setting levels of the variables are listed in table 1 the experiment was terminated when the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the effluent was stable generally samples were withdrawn twice daily from the influent tanks i ii and iii effluent and sulfuric acid absorption liquid tank for chemical analyses the ammonia nitrogen concentration of all samples and the hydrogen ion concentration of the acid absorption solution samples were measured to explore the factors related to the acid absorption solution samples were collected four times a day from the acid absorption liquid tank to measure the ammonia nitrogen concentration 2 2 practical application of ammonia nitrogen removal from landfill leachate using the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor landfill leachate was used as influent to evaluate the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in actual wastewater the original landfill leachate was collected from a domestic waste landfill on maixin road songjiang district shanghai china and its ph was adjusted using sodium hydroxide followed by 18 h of settling the supernatant was used as the influent for the experiment the main characteristics of the supernatant after ph adjustment with sodium hydroxide were as follows ph 11 0 0 1 ammonia nitrogen concentration 942 9 33 2 mg l cod 741 1 9 7 mg l total nitrogen tn concentration 1250 2 26 5 mg l and total phosphorus tp concentration 7 8 0 5 mg l in this experiment we used the reactor shown in fig 1a under the optimal parameter conditions the top of the reactor was sealed to prevent ammonia leakage a mechanical stirrer was used to maintain the stirring speed at 40 rpm to alleviate the load pressure of landfill leachate on the flat sheet gpms at the beginning we adopted the method of water leaching and melting in the application experiment on landfill leachate because sulfuric acid was quickly used during the experiment it was necessary to add sulfuric acid for approximately 2 5 d to maintain the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency the experiment was terminated when the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the effluent was stable samples were taken twice a day from the influent tanks i ii and iii effluent and acid absorption liquid tank for chemical analyses the ammonia nitrogen concentration of all samples and the hydrogen ion concentration of the acid absorption solution samples were measured the tn and cod of the effluent were assayed at the end of each experiment after the experiments the contact angle morphological structures and infrared spectra of the membranes were measured 2 3 comparison of dbt and mt bt of landfill leachate the original landfill leachate and activated sludge were obtained from a domestic waste landfill on maixin road songjiang district shanghai china activated sludge was used as the seed sludge in the biological treatment reactors to evaluate the effect of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor pretreatment on subsequent biological treatment two wastewater types were used for subsequent biological treatment 1 the original landfill leachate for dbt and 2 the landfill leachate after pretreatment of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor membrane pretreatment as shown in section 2 2 the ph of both wastewater types was adjusted to 7 0 using sulfuric acid and the supernatant was used as an influent the biological treatment reactor included an anoxic tank tank a 10 8 l an oxic tank tank o 13 8 l and a sedimentation tank a schematic diagram of the ammonia nitrogen removal by the anaerobic oxic a o reactor is shown in fig 1b tank a was mixed by mechanical stirring which was beneficial for maintaining the dissolved oxygen concentration at 0 0 5 mg l for denitrification tank o was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and aeration device to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration at 3 4 mg l for nitrification a sedimentation tank was used for the precipitation and effluent the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids was controlled at 3194 6 56 9 mg l in tank a and 3365 6 65 5 mg l in tank o the heaters controlled the temperature of tank a at 25 c and tank o at 30 c the ph was adjusted using sulfuric acid 3 m and sodium hydroxide 10 m to maintain the ph of tanks a and o at 7 0 and 7 5 respectively in this experiment the seed sludge hereafter termed ctrl was precultured in the respective wastewater for several days under the conditions described above without water inflow or outflow the influent was then poured into tank a through a peristaltic pump the hydraulic retention time of the a o process was set to 8 d the internal sludge return ratio from tank o to tank a was set to 3 and the sludge from the sedimentation tank was returned to tank a at regular intervals every day to reduce sludge loss the experiment was terminated when the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the effluent was relatively stable the ammonia nitrogen content was measured daily and the cod tn and tp contents were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment ctrl and slurry samples were collected from the biological treatment reactors at the end of the experiments for microbial community structure analysis samples from tanks a and o in the dbt were termed dbt a and dbt o respectively samples from tanks a and o in the mt bt were termed mt bt a and mt bt o respectively 2 4 analytical methods all determination and analysis methods in this

biotechnology co ltd shanghai china using the illumina miseq system illumina miseq usa 2 5 calculation formulas in the flat sheet gpms reactor treatment the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was calculated by eq 1 ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the tanks i ii and iii was calculated by eq 2 1 η c 0 c 4 c 0 100 where c 0 and c 4 are the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent and effluent respectively mg l 2 η n c n 1 c n c n 1 100 where c n 1and c n are the influent ammonia nitrogen concentration in tank n and effluent ammonia nitrogen concentration in tank n 1 respectively mg l the mass transfer coefficient of landfill leachate treated by flat gpms can be expressed by the mass transfer coefficient of nh3 and the total mass transfer coefficient k can be obtained by the mass transfer equation eq 3 3 k q ln c 0 c t a where q c 0 c t and a is the inflow rate of leachate m3 s the initial ammonia nitrogen concentration the instantaneous ammonia nitrogen

influent effluent tank a and tank o respectively mg l 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of different operating conditions on the performance of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor 3 1 1 effect of influent flow rate the effect of the influent flow rate on ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor was studied under the following operating conditions ph 11 5 temperature 30 c sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration 10 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity 70 ml min as shown in fig 2a with an increase in the influent flow rate from 20 to 25 l d the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was stabilized at a similar level 85 0 2 1 and 83 6 0 6 respectively whereas the mass transfer coefficient increased to the maximum value 3 6 10 6 m s when the influent flow rate further increased to 35 l d the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency and mass transfer coefficient rapidly decreased to 67 9 2 1 and 3 2 10 6 m s respectively this was consistent with a previous study showing that an increase in the influent flow rate of wastewater with a high ammonia nitrogen concentration strengthens the impact load on the flat membrane and affects the mass transfer coefficient 23 leading to an unsatisfactory ammonia nitrogen removal effect note that the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the sulfuric acid absorption solution was higher at an influent flow rate of 25 l d than that at 20 l d after 45 h of reaction 5617 45 12 89 mg l and 5138 79 4 29 mg l respectively fig s3a in unit time the amount of ammonia gas entering the absorption solution through the membrane increased with an increase in the influent flow rate therefore considering the timeliness of wastewater treatment and the ammonia nitrogen recovery rate an influent flow rate of 25 l d was selected 3 1 2 effect of influent ph under the operating conditions of an influent flow rate of 25 l d temperature of 30 c sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration of 10 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity of 70 ml min when the influent ph increased from 10 0 to 11 0 the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency rapidly increased from 68 5 6 3 to 82 8 1 5 and the mass transfer coefficient increased from 2 3 10 6 to 3 6 10 6 m s fig 2b however the removal efficiency and mass transfer coefficient only slightly increased with further ph increases with an increase in ph the free ammonia content in the liquid increased the partial pressure increased and the mass transfer force also increased which was more conducive to ammonia removal 23 24 however the free ammonia content in the liquid reached 99 5 when the ph of wastewater reached 11 0 25 therefore further increasing the ph to 11 5 had minimal effect on promoting the conversion of ionized ammonium salt to free ammonia in addition no significant difference in ammonia resource recovery was observed between ph 11 0 and 11 5 conditions fig s3b therefore the optimal influent ph value was determined to be 11 0 3 1 3 effect of temperature according to the results shown in fig 2c under the operating conditions of an influent flow rate of 25 l d ph of 11 0 sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration of 10 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity of 70 ml min the total ammonia nitrogen removal rate increased from 61 6 3 8 to 66 8 5 2 and mass transfer coefficient increased from 1 9 10 6 to 2 2 10 6 m s as the temperature increased from 20 c to 25 c subsequently the removal rate and mass transfer coefficient exhibited minimal changes with the increase in temperature theoretically a higher temperature is more conducive to the overflow of free ammonia which is one of the key reasons why temperature also plays a vital role in ammonia nitrogen formation 26 however the experimental results indicated that the temperature ranging from 20 to 35 c had no significant effect on the ammonia nitrogen recovery efficiency considering energy consumption it was considered appropriate to adjust the temperature to 25 c 3 1 4 effect of sulfuric acid absorption concentration the basic operating conditions were as follows influent flow rate 25 l d ph 11 0 temperature 25 c and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity 70 ml min as seen in fig 2d the maximum total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency 76 6 2 1 and mass transfer coefficient 2 7 10 6 m s were observed at a sulfuric acid absorption concentration of 2 5 however the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency gradually decreased as the reaction time increased fig s2d which was supported by the hydrogen ion concentration fig s4a and ammonia nitrogen concentration in the sulfuric acid absorption liquid fig s3d at the beginning of the reaction the hydrogen ion concentration in the absorption liquid decreased rapidly whereas the ammonia nitrogen concentration increased rapidly when the reaction time was further prolonged the rate of decrease in the hydrogen ion concentration was reduced in addition to recover a high purity ammonium sulfate solution a sulfuric acid solution with a low concentration fraction is preferred 27 it should be pointed out that the hydrogen ion concentration was exhausted after 3 d of reaction resulting in poor nitrogen removal therefore it is necessary to add new sulfuric acid to the acid absorption liquid tank before the hydrogen ion is exhausted and ensure that the hydrogen ion concentration is maintained at 2 5 to achieve high ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency 3 1 5 effect of sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity the basic operating conditions were as follows influent flow rate 25 l d ph 11 0 temperature 25 c and sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration 2 5 as shown in fig 2e when the sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity was 70 ml min the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency 74 2 4 5 and mass transfer coefficient 2 7 10 6 m s were similar to the values at 140 ml min 73 9 0 6 and 2 7 10 6 m s respectively which were significantly higher than those at 35 ml min 60 3 2 1 and 1 8 10 6 m s respectively these results showed that when the flow rate reached a particular value the flow rate of the acid absorption liquid had minimal effect on the ammonia nitrogen removal performance of the gpms this was consistent with other research results 28 30 that showed that the mass transfer resistance measured in the membrane can be ignored therefore the optimal sulfuric acid flow velocity was determined to be 70 ml min in conclusion the optimal conditions for total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor were as follows influent flow rate 25 l d ph 11 0 temperature 25 c sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration 2 5 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity 70 ml min the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency reached 74 2 4 5 with a mass transfer coefficient of 2 7 10 6 m s which was similar to the efficiency 75 9 obtained through batch experiments in previous research 29 3 2 efficient ammonia nitrogen recovery from actual wastewater via the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor the initial experiment in this study demonstrated that significant ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency could be obtained through the treatment of simulated nitrogenous wastewater using a continuous flat sheet gpms reactor landfill leachate was treated as actual wastewater to examine the feasibility of effective ammonia nitrogen removal as illustrated in fig 3a the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent was stable at 942 9 33 2 mg l when the ph was adjusted using sodium hydroxide the ammonia nitrogen concentrations were stabilized at around 708 3 60 4 498 3 45 8 345 2 38 3 and 306 1 29 0 mg l in tanks i ii and iii and effluent respectively after 2 5 d of operation which indicated that the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency decreased gradually with the increase in the number of reaction tanks the final total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor may be up to 66 2 4 9 similar to a previous study 29 the cod of the landfill leachate slightly decreased from 741 1 9 7 to 724 2 1 7 mg l after the operation and the median cod tan ratio of the leachate significantly increased from 0 59 to 1 23 the results implied that the utilization of a continuous flat sheet gpms reactor was conducive to reducing the input of carbon sources and the economic cost in subsequent biological processes moreover the hydrogen ions in the absorption liquid were almost completely exhausted every 2 5 d fig 3b which explained the fluctuation in the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the three tanks and effluent in contrast nh4 2so4 i e an important ammonia resource was efficiently recovered during the operation and the corresponding ammonia nitrogen concentration in the absorption liquid exhibited relatively rapid accumulation in the first 6 d and then stabilized at approximately 12 000 mg l previous gas permeable membrane operations resulted in higher total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency 79 80 however these required a longer hydraulic retention time 7 d 31 or higher temperature 70 c 32 the sem images are shown in fig 4 a comparison of fig 4a 1 and a 2 shows that the membrane pores were partially blocked after the treatment of landfill leachate nevertheless as shown in fig 4a 3 the membrane performance gradually recovered after soaking in 0 5 mol l hydrochloric acid for 30 min this is in good agreement with a previous study showing that ptfe has significant antifouling properties and that its original properties are easily restored after acid soaking 29 as shown in fig 4b the contact angle of the membrane decreased from 136 to 120 after the experiment and was maintained at 120 after soaking indicating that the membrane was hydrophobic this prevented deterioration of the hydrophobicity of the composite material the ft ir spectra of the flat sheet gas permeable membrane are shown in fig 5 ft ir analysis revealed that both membranes had bands at 1202 1148 638 and 554 cm 1 the 1202 and 1148 cm 1 bands were assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the cf2 bond of ptfe respectively 33 the peaks at 638 and 554 cm 1 are attributed to the swing of the cf2 group 34 previous studies demonstrated that the cf2 bond is responsible for the hydrophobicity of the composite material 35 the intensities of the peaks at 1202 1148 and 638 cm 1 decreased after the experiment these results are consistent with the decrease in the contact angle shown in fig 4 simultaneously no peak was observed for co 1700 cm 1 in the membranes before the experiment which caused the hydrophilic behaviors 35 after the experiment the spectrum of the membranes exhibited a slight band around 1700 cm 1 corresponding to co this may have been an additional reason for the decreased contact angle based on the above results the flat sheet gpms maintained a stable performance 3 3 ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency after mt bt 3 3 1 dbt of landfill leachate the ammonia nitrogen concentration in tank a increased abnormally in the first 7 d of dbt as shown in fig 6a this may have been related to the biological toxicity of high ammonia nitrogen concentrations 36 with extension of the treatment time the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the influent tank a tank o and effluent gradually decreased conversely the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the dbt tank a and tank o gradually increased and eventually reached 61 0 0 8 50 5 0 1 and 31 0 1 2 respectively it should be noted that although biological treatment could eventually achieve ammonia nitrogen removal the operation time was excessive 3 3 2 biological treatment of landfill leachate after membrane pretreatment the landfill leachate after membrane pretreatment was used for subsequent biological treatment as shown in fig 3a the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the landfill leachate decreased from 942 9 33 2 mg l to 306 1 29 0 mg l after being subjected to the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent of the subsequent biological treatment was stable at 251 3 5 2 mg l fig 6b the ammonia nitrogen concentration in tank a decreased sharply after 3 d of operation and eventually reached 52 8 8 0 mg l after 7 d furthermore the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in tank o and effluent remained at 40 mg l and the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the biological treatment reached 93 3 2 0 interestingly the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was as high as 98 2 0 7 after mt bt 3 3 3 microbial community structures analysis environmental conditions influenced bacterial growth which inevitably resulted in community shifts and changes in bacterial abundance as shown in table s1 the alpha diversity index increased in the order of ctrl dbt mt bt thus it could be inferred that membrane pretreatment was beneficial for increasing microbial richness and diversity microbial community variations were observed at the phylum and genus levels fig 7 proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in all samples ctrl 30 0 dbt a 44 8 dbt o 45 0 mt bt a 34 2 and mt bt o 38 5 and was dominant in the microbial nitrogen removal process the relative abundance of proteobacteria after mt bt mt bt a and mt bt o was lower than that in the dbt samples dbt a and dbt o which was related to the influent concentration of ammonia nitrogen in wastewater 37 it has been reported that planctomycetes and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the a o process 38 39 no significant differences in the relative abundance of planctomycetes were observed among the samples whereas the relative abundances of bacteroidetes in mt bt a 20 6 and mt bt o 18 4 were significantly higher than those in the ctrl 0 01 dbt a 6 9 and dbt o 5 4 which was consistent with the higher ammonia nitrogen removal rate figs 6

which is capable of removing nitrate in dbt a dbt o mt bt a and mt bt o were much higher than that in the ctrl a similar observation was reported in the literature on the two stage anammox process for advanced treatment of wastewater containing high ammonium concentrations 3 defluviicoccus which dominated in ctrl 7 7 dbt a 7 3 and dbt o 10 2 was responsible for carbon storage 40 this may have been due to the low cod tan ratio of the influent during the dbt the unique genera in mt bt a and mt bt o i e planktosalinus and rheinheimera were conducive to ammonia nitrogen removal which was in agreement with the higher ammonia nitrogen removal rates figs 6 and s5 ammonia monooxygenase amo encoded by amo gene and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao encoded by hao gene are two key enzymes involved in the ammonia oxidation process in autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria 41 in the ammoxidation process amo oxidizes ammonia to hydroxylamine followed by hao catalyzed hydroxylamine to no2 to achieve ammonia conversion 42 according to the functional gene prediction data the relative abundances of amo during nitrification were 6 2 10 6 ctrl 1 4 10 5 dbt o and 2 1 10 5 mt bt o the relative abundance of hao showed similar characteristics 5 3 10 6 ctrl 5 0 10 5 dbt o and 5 5 10 5 mt bt o which was consistent with the results reported above figs 6 and 7 as shown in fig s6 principal coordinate analysis was performed to assess the differences in microbial communities that were present in different reactors similarly to that shown in fig 7 the mt bt samples were close together and were far away from the ctrl and dbt samples indicating significant differences in the bacterial community structure between the samples pco1 and pco2 explained 70 3 and 23 respectively of the total changes in the bacterial community structure 4 conclusions the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor was mostly influenced by the influent flow rate ph temperature sulfuric acid absorption concentration and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency reached 66 2 4 9 and efficient ammonia nitrogen recovery was obtained when wastewater with a high ammonia nitrogen concentration was treated under the optimized conditions more importantly the flat sheet gpms maintained a stable performance additionally the membrane pretreatment effectively balanced the cod tan ratio of wastewater which was conducive to reducing the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the effluent from the subsequent biological treatment

12603,ammonia nitrogen is a crucial component of landfill leachate and a major factor in the eutrophication of aquatic bodies a novel approach was developed using the continuous flat sheet gas permeable membranes gpms reactor pretreatment to efficiently remove and recover ammonia nitrogen the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency reached 74 2 4 5 and 66 2 4 9 respectively when simulated nitrogenous wastewater and landfill leachate were treated under the following conditions influent flow rate 25 l d ph 11 0 temperature 25 c sulfuric acid absorption concentration 2 5 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity 70 ml min in addition nh4 2so4 i e a crucial ammonia resource was recovered efficiently and the flat sheet gpms exhibited stable hydrophobic properties specifically the combination of membrane pretreatment and biological treatment reduced the ammonia nitrogen concentration from 230 mg l with direct biological treatment only to 40 mg l with the removal efficiency benefitting from the increase in the chemical oxygen demand total ammonia nitrogen cod tan ratio of the leachate after membrane pretreatment furthermore microorganisms that are capable of ammonia nitrogen removal planktosalinus and rheinheimera were selectively enriched overall this study provides a practical method to enhance ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery for the treatment of wastewater containing high ammonia nitrogen concentrations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords gas permeable membranes ammonia nitrogen removal ammonium sulfate recovery landfill leachate biological treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to china s annual environmental report total municipal solid waste msw output has reached 242 million tons in 2019 1 more than half of the msw in china is disposed of in landfill 2 and waste leachate is readily generated during landfill processes resulting in secondary pollution 3 as the most common pollutant in landfill leachate ammonia nitrogen can easily cause water eutrophication 4 and is harmful to humans and the natural environment 5 therefore treating ammonia nitrogen in landfill leachate has attracted increasing attention to date biological treatment 6 has been widely applied for wastewater nitrogen removal because of its cost effectiveness and reusability however traditional biological treatment is unsatisfactory for treating old landfill leachate because of its highly unbalanced c n ratio and the bio toxicity of high ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the leachate 7 moreover the biodegradability of leachate is low and decreases as landfills age 8 which further contributes to failure of the sole biological treatment to meet treatment requirements 9 10 therefore more reliable approaches need to be developed to provide favorable conditions for biological treatment of landfill leachates in response to the research of waste to wealth and green recycling 11 12 the concept of ammonia nitrogen treatment has changed from removing ammonia nitrogen to recovering ammonia nitrogen air stripping is a common method for recovering ammonia nitrogen from wastewater however it has some problems such as high energy consumption and easy scaling 13 struvite precipitation is also an effective method for recovering ammonia nitrogen in the form of mgnh4po4 6h2o 14 however this method requires not only the use of chemicals to regulate ph but also the addition of large amounts of phosphate and magnesium salts to achieve precipitation and hence input costs may exceed the struvite value 15 some studies have reported that recycling ammonium from wastewater as ammonia fertilizer has potential significance for agriculture 16 18 with the widespread application of membrane technology in wastewater treatment membrane technology for ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery is gaining traction in industry a study of ammonia recovery from chicken manure using a nonporous tubular polydimethylsiloxane membrane maintained removal fluxes in the range of 1 22 1 48 g m2 day 19 microporous hollow fiber membranes have been demonstrated to effectively separate ammonia 20 however they are prone to pollution and blockage and require high pretreatment requirements which restricts their adoption and popularization 21 22 thus investigating membrane technologies with high ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency recovery efficiency and pollution resistance is essential this study proposes a practical method to enhance ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery via the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor pretreatment which combines membranes with traditional stripping and absorption processes first the optimal operating conditions for ammonia nitrogen removal and recovery were studied using simulated nitrogenous wastewater the performance of the flat sheet gpms was then verified in a real life application experiment to further illustrate this the efficiencies of ammonia nitrogen removal via direct biological treatment hereafter termed dbt and the combination of membrane pretreatment and biological treatment hereafter termed mt bt of landfill leachate were compared finally we elucidated the impact of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor pretreatment on the microbial community structure responsible for ammonia nitrogen removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 optimization of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor operating conditions 2 1 1 materials in this process simulated nitrogenous wastewater nh4cl solution with ammonia nitrogen concentration of 1000 mg l was selected as the influent sodium hydroxide was used to adjust the ph of the influent unless otherwise specified the continuous flat sheet gpms were provided by china haisum engineering co ltd and were composed of polyester fiber carbon fiber bamboo pulp fiber and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe a flat sheet gpms module was composed of a fixed square membrane frame inlet and outlet pipes and two pieces of flat sheet gpms the effective surface area of each flat sheet gpms was 169 cm2 two flat sheet gpms were glued to both sides of the membrane frame to form a sealed internal fluid passageway as part of the circulation line for the sulfuric acid absorption liquid the ammonia nitrogen containing wastewater flowed outside the membrane module and the acid absorption solution flowed inside the membrane module fig s1 under alkaline conditions the majority of the nitrogen in ammonia is transformed into free ammonia which is then absorbed by the acid solution in internal circulation into ammonium sulfate e g nh4 2so4 the contact angle morphological structures and infrared spectra of the membranes were measured 2 1 2 continuous flat sheet gpms reactor as shown in fig 1a the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor was composed of three 10 l reaction tanks in series a cock sample was placed at the bottom of each tank the influent was poured into a continuous flat sheet gpms reactor using a peristaltic pump each tank was equipped with two flat sheet gpms modules the inlet pipes of the modules were connected to the inlet valves at the bottom of the tanks and the six inlet valves were then connected to the main inlet pipe similarly the outlet pipes of the modules were connected to the outlet valves at the top of the modules and the six outlet valves were then connected to the main outlet pipe the sulfuric acid solution was added to the sulfuric acid absorption liquid tank circularly injected into the inside of the modules using the peristaltic pump and the main inlet pipes and then returned to the absorption liquid tank through the main outlet pipe the top of the reactor was sealed to prevent ammonia leakage a mechanical stirrer was used to control the stirring speed at 40 rpm and a heater was used to maintain a stable temperature on top of each tank 2 1 3 experimental methods single factor experiments were conducted to explore the effects of different process parameters on nitrogen removal such as the influent flow rate influent ph temperature sulfuric acid absorption concentration and sulfuric acid flow velocity the setting levels of the variables are listed in table 1 the experiment was terminated when the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the effluent was stable generally samples were withdrawn twice daily from the influent tanks i ii and iii effluent and sulfuric acid absorption liquid tank for chemical analyses the ammonia nitrogen concentration of all samples and the hydrogen ion concentration of the acid absorption solution samples were measured to explore the factors related to the acid absorption solution samples were collected four times a day from the acid absorption liquid tank to measure the ammonia nitrogen concentration 2 2 practical application of ammonia nitrogen removal from landfill leachate using the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor landfill leachate was used as influent to evaluate the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in actual wastewater the original landfill leachate was collected from a domestic waste landfill on maixin road songjiang district shanghai china and its ph was adjusted using sodium hydroxide followed by 18 h of settling the supernatant was used as the influent for the experiment the main characteristics of the supernatant after ph adjustment with sodium hydroxide were as follows ph 11 0 0 1 ammonia nitrogen concentration 942 9 33 2 mg l cod 741 1 9 7 mg l total nitrogen tn concentration 1250 2 26 5 mg l and total phosphorus tp concentration 7 8 0 5 mg l in this experiment we used the reactor shown in fig 1a under the optimal parameter conditions the top of the reactor was sealed to prevent ammonia leakage a mechanical stirrer was used to maintain the stirring speed at 40 rpm to alleviate the load pressure of landfill leachate on the flat sheet gpms at the beginning we adopted the method of water leaching and melting in the application experiment on landfill leachate because sulfuric acid was quickly used during the experiment it was necessary to add sulfuric acid for approximately 2 5 d to maintain the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency the experiment was terminated when the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the effluent was stable samples were taken twice a day from the influent tanks i ii and iii effluent and acid absorption liquid tank for chemical analyses the ammonia nitrogen concentration of all samples and the hydrogen ion concentration of the acid absorption solution samples were measured the tn and cod of the effluent were assayed at the end of each experiment after the experiments the contact angle morphological structures and infrared spectra of the membranes were measured 2 3 comparison of dbt and mt bt of landfill leachate the original landfill leachate and activated sludge were obtained from a domestic waste landfill on maixin road songjiang district shanghai china activated sludge was used as the seed sludge in the biological treatment reactors to evaluate the effect of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor pretreatment on subsequent biological treatment two wastewater types were used for subsequent biological treatment 1 the original landfill leachate for dbt and 2 the landfill leachate after pretreatment of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor membrane pretreatment as shown in section 2 2 the ph of both wastewater types was adjusted to 7 0 using sulfuric acid and the supernatant was used as an influent the biological treatment reactor included an anoxic tank tank a 10 8 l an oxic tank tank o 13 8 l and a sedimentation tank a schematic diagram of the ammonia nitrogen removal by the anaerobic oxic a o reactor is shown in fig 1b tank a was mixed by mechanical stirring which was beneficial for maintaining the dissolved oxygen concentration at 0 0 5 mg l for denitrification tank o was equipped with a mechanical stirrer and aeration device to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration at 3 4 mg l for nitrification a sedimentation tank was used for the precipitation and effluent the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids was controlled at 3194 6 56 9 mg l in tank a and 3365 6 65 5 mg l in tank o the heaters controlled the temperature of tank a at 25 c and tank o at 30 c the ph was adjusted using sulfuric acid 3 m and sodium hydroxide 10 m to maintain the ph of tanks a and o at 7 0 and 7 5 respectively in this experiment the seed sludge hereafter termed ctrl was precultured in the respective wastewater for several days under the conditions described above without water inflow or outflow the influent was then poured into tank a through a peristaltic pump the hydraulic retention time of the a o process was set to 8 d the internal sludge return ratio from tank o to tank a was set to 3 and the sludge from the sedimentation tank was returned to tank a at regular intervals every day to reduce sludge loss the experiment was terminated when the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the effluent was relatively stable the ammonia nitrogen content was measured daily and the cod tn and tp contents were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment ctrl and slurry samples were collected from the biological treatment reactors at the end of the experiments for microbial community structure analysis samples from tanks a and o in the dbt were termed dbt a and dbt o respectively samples from tanks a and o in the mt bt were termed mt bt a and mt bt o respectively 2 4 analytical methods all determination and analysis methods in this

biotechnology co ltd shanghai china using the illumina miseq system illumina miseq usa 2 5 calculation formulas in the flat sheet gpms reactor treatment the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was calculated by eq 1 ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the tanks i ii and iii was calculated by eq 2 1 η c 0 c 4 c 0 100 where c 0 and c 4 are the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent and effluent respectively mg l 2 η n c n 1 c n c n 1 100 where c n 1and c n are the influent ammonia nitrogen concentration in tank n and effluent ammonia nitrogen concentration in tank n 1 respectively mg l the mass transfer coefficient of landfill leachate treated by flat gpms can be expressed by the mass transfer coefficient of nh3 and the total mass transfer coefficient k can be obtained by the mass transfer equation eq 3 3 k q ln c 0 c t a where q c 0 c t and a is the inflow rate of leachate m3 s the initial ammonia nitrogen concentration the instantaneous ammonia nitrogen

influent effluent tank a and tank o respectively mg l 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of different operating conditions on the performance of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor 3 1 1 effect of influent flow rate the effect of the influent flow rate on ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor was studied under the following operating conditions ph 11 5 temperature 30 c sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration 10 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity 70 ml min as shown in fig 2a with an increase in the influent flow rate from 20 to 25 l d the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was stabilized at a similar level 85 0 2 1 and 83 6 0 6 respectively whereas the mass transfer coefficient increased to the maximum value 3 6 10 6 m s when the influent flow rate further increased to 35 l d the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency and mass transfer coefficient rapidly decreased to 67 9 2 1 and 3 2 10 6 m s respectively this was consistent with a previous study showing that an increase in the influent flow rate of wastewater with a high ammonia nitrogen concentration strengthens the impact load on the flat membrane and affects the mass transfer coefficient 23 leading to an unsatisfactory ammonia nitrogen removal effect note that the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the sulfuric acid absorption solution was higher at an influent flow rate of 25 l d than that at 20 l d after 45 h of reaction 5617 45 12 89 mg l and 5138 79 4 29 mg l respectively fig s3a in unit time the amount of ammonia gas entering the absorption solution through the membrane increased with an increase in the influent flow rate therefore considering the timeliness of wastewater treatment and the ammonia nitrogen recovery rate an influent flow rate of 25 l d was selected 3 1 2 effect of influent ph under the operating conditions of an influent flow rate of 25 l d temperature of 30 c sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration of 10 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity of 70 ml min when the influent ph increased from 10 0 to 11 0 the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency rapidly increased from 68 5 6 3 to 82 8 1 5 and the mass transfer coefficient increased from 2 3 10 6 to 3 6 10 6 m s fig 2b however the removal efficiency and mass transfer coefficient only slightly increased with further ph increases with an increase in ph the free ammonia content in the liquid increased the partial pressure increased and the mass transfer force also increased which was more conducive to ammonia removal 23 24 however the free ammonia content in the liquid reached 99 5 when the ph of wastewater reached 11 0 25 therefore further increasing the ph to 11 5 had minimal effect on promoting the conversion of ionized ammonium salt to free ammonia in addition no significant difference in ammonia resource recovery was observed between ph 11 0 and 11 5 conditions fig s3b therefore the optimal influent ph value was determined to be 11 0 3 1 3 effect of temperature according to the results shown in fig 2c under the operating conditions of an influent flow rate of 25 l d ph of 11 0 sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration of 10 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity of 70 ml min the total ammonia nitrogen removal rate increased from 61 6 3 8 to 66 8 5 2 and mass transfer coefficient increased from 1 9 10 6 to 2 2 10 6 m s as the temperature increased from 20 c to 25 c subsequently the removal rate and mass transfer coefficient exhibited minimal changes with the increase in temperature theoretically a higher temperature is more conducive to the overflow of free ammonia which is one of the key reasons why temperature also plays a vital role in ammonia nitrogen formation 26 however the experimental results indicated that the temperature ranging from 20 to 35 c had no significant effect on the ammonia nitrogen recovery efficiency considering energy consumption it was considered appropriate to adjust the temperature to 25 c 3 1 4 effect of sulfuric acid absorption concentration the basic operating conditions were as follows influent flow rate 25 l d ph 11 0 temperature 25 c and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity 70 ml min as seen in fig 2d the maximum total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency 76 6 2 1 and mass transfer coefficient 2 7 10 6 m s were observed at a sulfuric acid absorption concentration of 2 5 however the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency gradually decreased as the reaction time increased fig s2d which was supported by the hydrogen ion concentration fig s4a and ammonia nitrogen concentration in the sulfuric acid absorption liquid fig s3d at the beginning of the reaction the hydrogen ion concentration in the absorption liquid decreased rapidly whereas the ammonia nitrogen concentration increased rapidly when the reaction time was further prolonged the rate of decrease in the hydrogen ion concentration was reduced in addition to recover a high purity ammonium sulfate solution a sulfuric acid solution with a low concentration fraction is preferred 27 it should be pointed out that the hydrogen ion concentration was exhausted after 3 d of reaction resulting in poor nitrogen removal therefore it is necessary to add new sulfuric acid to the acid absorption liquid tank before the hydrogen ion is exhausted and ensure that the hydrogen ion concentration is maintained at 2 5 to achieve high ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency 3 1 5 effect of sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity the basic operating conditions were as follows influent flow rate 25 l d ph 11 0 temperature 25 c and sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration 2 5 as shown in fig 2e when the sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity was 70 ml min the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency 74 2 4 5 and mass transfer coefficient 2 7 10 6 m s were similar to the values at 140 ml min 73 9 0 6 and 2 7 10 6 m s respectively which were significantly higher than those at 35 ml min 60 3 2 1 and 1 8 10 6 m s respectively these results showed that when the flow rate reached a particular value the flow rate of the acid absorption liquid had minimal effect on the ammonia nitrogen removal performance of the gpms this was consistent with other research results 28 30 that showed that the mass transfer resistance measured in the membrane can be ignored therefore the optimal sulfuric acid flow velocity was determined to be 70 ml min in conclusion the optimal conditions for total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency in the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor were as follows influent flow rate 25 l d ph 11 0 temperature 25 c sulfuric acid absorption solution concentration 2 5 and sulfuric acid absorption flow velocity 70 ml min the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency reached 74 2 4 5 with a mass transfer coefficient of 2 7 10 6 m s which was similar to the efficiency 75 9 obtained through batch experiments in previous research 29 3 2 efficient ammonia nitrogen recovery from actual wastewater via the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor the initial experiment in this study demonstrated that significant ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency could be obtained through the treatment of simulated nitrogenous wastewater using a continuous flat sheet gpms reactor landfill leachate was treated as actual wastewater to examine the feasibility of effective ammonia nitrogen removal as illustrated in fig 3a the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent was stable at 942 9 33 2 mg l when the ph was adjusted using sodium hydroxide the ammonia nitrogen concentrations were stabilized at around 708 3 60 4 498 3 45 8 345 2 38 3 and 306 1 29 0 mg l in tanks i ii and iii and effluent respectively after 2 5 d of operation which indicated that the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency decreased gradually with the increase in the number of reaction tanks the final total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor may be up to 66 2 4 9 similar to a previous study 29 the cod of the landfill leachate slightly decreased from 741 1 9 7 to 724 2 1 7 mg l after the operation and the median cod tan ratio of the leachate significantly increased from 0 59 to 1 23 the results implied that the utilization of a continuous flat sheet gpms reactor was conducive to reducing the input of carbon sources and the economic cost in subsequent biological processes moreover the hydrogen ions in the absorption liquid were almost completely exhausted every 2 5 d fig 3b which explained the fluctuation in the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the three tanks and effluent in contrast nh4 2so4 i e an important ammonia resource was efficiently recovered during the operation and the corresponding ammonia nitrogen concentration in the absorption liquid exhibited relatively rapid accumulation in the first 6 d and then stabilized at approximately 12 000 mg l previous gas permeable membrane operations resulted in higher total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency 79 80 however these required a longer hydraulic retention time 7 d 31 or higher temperature 70 c 32 the sem images are shown in fig 4 a comparison of fig 4a 1 and a 2 shows that the membrane pores were partially blocked after the treatment of landfill leachate nevertheless as shown in fig 4a 3 the membrane performance gradually recovered after soaking in 0 5 mol l hydrochloric acid for 30 min this is in good agreement with a previous study showing that ptfe has significant antifouling properties and that its original properties are easily restored after acid soaking 29 as shown in fig 4b the contact angle of the membrane decreased from 136 to 120 after the experiment and was maintained at 120 after soaking indicating that the membrane was hydrophobic this prevented deterioration of the hydrophobicity of the composite material the ft ir spectra of the flat sheet gas permeable membrane are shown in fig 5 ft ir analysis revealed that both membranes had bands at 1202 1148 638 and 554 cm 1 the 1202 and 1148 cm 1 bands were assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the cf2 bond of ptfe respectively 33 the peaks at 638 and 554 cm 1 are attributed to the swing of the cf2 group 34 previous studies demonstrated that the cf2 bond is responsible for the hydrophobicity of the composite material 35 the intensities of the peaks at 1202 1148 and 638 cm 1 decreased after the experiment these results are consistent with the decrease in the contact angle shown in fig 4 simultaneously no peak was observed for co 1700 cm 1 in the membranes before the experiment which caused the hydrophilic behaviors 35 after the experiment the spectrum of the membranes exhibited a slight band around 1700 cm 1 corresponding to co this may have been an additional reason for the decreased contact angle based on the above results the flat sheet gpms maintained a stable performance 3 3 ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency after mt bt 3 3 1 dbt of landfill leachate the ammonia nitrogen concentration in tank a increased abnormally in the first 7 d of dbt as shown in fig 6a this may have been related to the biological toxicity of high ammonia nitrogen concentrations 36 with extension of the treatment time the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the influent tank a tank o and effluent gradually decreased conversely the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the dbt tank a and tank o gradually increased and eventually reached 61 0 0 8 50 5 0 1 and 31 0 1 2 respectively it should be noted that although biological treatment could eventually achieve ammonia nitrogen removal the operation time was excessive 3 3 2 biological treatment of landfill leachate after membrane pretreatment the landfill leachate after membrane pretreatment was used for subsequent biological treatment as shown in fig 3a the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the landfill leachate decreased from 942 9 33 2 mg l to 306 1 29 0 mg l after being subjected to the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor the ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent of the subsequent biological treatment was stable at 251 3 5 2 mg l fig 6b the ammonia nitrogen concentration in tank a decreased sharply after 3 d of operation and eventually reached 52 8 8 0 mg l after 7 d furthermore the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in tank o and effluent remained at 40 mg l and the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the biological treatment reached 93 3 2 0 interestingly the total ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was as high as 98 2 0 7 after mt bt 3 3 3 microbial community structures analysis environmental conditions influenced bacterial growth which inevitably resulted in community shifts and changes in bacterial abundance as shown in table s1 the alpha diversity index increased in the order of ctrl dbt mt bt thus it could be inferred that membrane pretreatment was beneficial for increasing microbial richness and diversity microbial community variations were observed at the phylum and genus levels fig 7 proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in all samples ctrl 30 0 dbt a 44 8 dbt o 45 0 mt bt a 34 2 and mt bt o 38 5 and was dominant in the microbial nitrogen removal process the relative abundance of proteobacteria after mt bt mt bt a and mt bt o was lower than that in the dbt samples dbt a and dbt o which was related to the influent concentration of ammonia nitrogen in wastewater 37 it has been reported that planctomycetes and bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the a o process 38 39 no significant differences in the relative abundance of planctomycetes were observed among the samples whereas the relative abundances of bacteroidetes in mt bt a 20 6 and mt bt o 18 4 were significantly higher than those in the ctrl 0 01 dbt a 6 9 and dbt o 5 4 which was consistent with the higher ammonia nitrogen removal rate figs 6 and s5 at the genus level urania 1b 19 marine sediment group was the predominant genus in all samples ctrl 28 6 dbt a 22 7 dbt o 26 7 mt bt a 22 7 and mt bt o 21 8 the relative abundance of arenimonas which is capable of removing nitrate in dbt a dbt o mt bt a and mt bt o were much higher than that in the ctrl a similar observation was reported in the literature on the two stage anammox process for advanced treatment of wastewater containing high ammonium concentrations 3 defluviicoccus which dominated in ctrl 7 7 dbt a 7 3 and dbt o 10 2 was responsible for carbon storage 40 this may have been due to the low cod tan ratio of the influent during the dbt the unique genera in mt bt a and mt bt o i e planktosalinus and rheinheimera were conducive to ammonia nitrogen removal which was in agreement with the higher ammonia nitrogen removal rates figs 6 and s5 ammonia monooxygenase amo encoded by amo gene and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao encoded by hao gene are two key enzymes involved in the ammonia oxidation process in autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria 41 in the ammoxidation process amo oxidizes ammonia to hydroxylamine followed by hao catalyzed hydroxylamine to no2 to achieve ammonia conversion 42 according to the functional gene prediction data the relative abundances of amo during nitrification were 6 2 10 6 ctrl 1 4 10 5 dbt o and 2 1 10 5 mt bt o the relative abundance of hao showed similar characteristics 5 3 10 6 ctrl 5 0 10 5 dbt o and 5 5 10 5 mt bt o which was consistent with the results reported above figs 6 and 7 as shown in fig s6 principal coordinate analysis was performed to assess the differences in microbial communities that were present in different reactors similarly to that shown in fig 7 the mt bt samples were close together and were far away from the ctrl and dbt samples indicating significant differences in the bacterial community structure between the samples pco1 and pco2 explained 70 3 and 23 respectively of the total changes in the bacterial community structure 4 conclusions the ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency of the continuous flat sheet gpms reactor was mostly influenced by the influent flow rate

12604,recently palladium is widely used in electronics catalysis electroplating and fuel cells the recovery of precious metals has become very important due to their scarcity and high price the adsorption method which is generally used in polymer inclusion membranes is both effective and simple because for that reason the retention and mechanism of chemicals were shown to be significantly influenced by precious metal adsorption on the membrane in this study polymer inclusion membranes were produced and characterized by using different base polymers carriers aliquat 336 trioctylamine toa and plasticizers 2 nitrophenyl octyl ether npoe the palladium adsorption capacities of the membranes were examined in detail in terms of different phs temperatures contact times and membrane contents the optimum ph was determined as 2 for all membranes in addition the temperatures and contact times of the membranes containing cellulose triacetate cta polyvinyl chloride pvc and

aliquat 40 toa and 40 pvdf 40 aliquat 20 npoe for each base polymer keywords adsorption base polymer evaporation palladium polymer inclusion membrane data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction recently precious metals such as gold au silver ag and palladium pd are widely used in jewelry investment vehicles and industrial fields such as electronics catalysis electroplating and fuel cells 1 the recovery of these metals has become very important due to their scarcity and high price 2 it is often used in a variety of conventional and unconventional processes for recovering precious metals 3 conventional methods can be shown as the use of microorganisms 4 the application of biosorption based processes 5 the solvent extraction process ion exchange adsorption and electrolysis processes 6 leaching precipitation methods solvent extraction ion exchange and pressurized cyanide dissolution are the primary technologies used for pd recycling 7 however precious metal recovery by membrane processes has been used frequently in recent years although adsorption membrane processes have many advantages they also have some disadvantages membrane processes have grown in popularity more recently because they have the advantage of significantly decreasing chemical use as a result they are an intriguing environmentally friendly technology with the scale up potential to address real world separation issues 8 for these reasons a number of liquid membrane systems using hollow fiber supported and bulk emulsion supported liquid membranes have been reported solid dense membranes built of polymeric materials have been proposed as a way to achieve better carrier entrapment in order to address the stability issues caused by the leaching of the organic phase in supported liquid membrane slm settings this strategy has been used to remove palladium using activated composite acm hybrid polymeric plasticized ppm or polymer inclusion membranes pims 9 polymer inclusion membrane pim offers a new alternative in membrane processes due to its advantages these processes are not only simple in design easy to operate and environmentally friendly but also have high stability good mechanical properties and chemical resistance in addition they are thin and flexible compared to other membranes 2 10 three materials are primarily used in pim these are the plasticizer carrier and base polymer pim performance impacting factors include membrane composition base polymer carrier and plasticizer characteristics membrane shape and the chemistry of aqueous solution producing phases 11 according to the studies in the literature the effect of base polymers on transport differs according to the structure of the polymers 12 13 one of the most popular polymers in pim fabrication is cellulose triacetate cta which is strong cta is a polar polymer that can form highly oriented hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl and acetyl groups 16 it is extremely crystalline and rather weakly hydratable 11 studies have shown that cta is more hydrophilic 14 and its transport performance is better than other polymers 15 moreover another polymer is polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf which is a pure thermoplastic fluoropolymer it provides higher strength and is better suited for carriers it is a polymer with excellent chemical resistance and is very hydrophobic 16 the fact that the polymer has these properties has increased its use in the production of polymer inclusion membranes 17 in addition membranes were produced with pvdf polymer to increase the stability of pims in an environment where acid base conditions are high when the studies were examined membranes containing both pvdf polymer and pvc polymer were produced with aliquat 336 and it was observed that pvdf based membranes had higher extraction efficiency 18 pvc is the most extensively used polymer and it has excellent strength and flexibility as well as the ability to remain stable in both basic and acidic conditions 19 20 additionally it is an amorphous polymer with little hydration and low crystallinity 11 however the performance of membranes is impacted by pvc s molecular weight metals for instance are transferred more readily than membranes made of low molecular weight pvc 15 another material plasticizer is used to soften and increase the flexibility of the polymer in addition it makes metal species more chemically and mechanically stable and ensures their passage over the membrane 21 moreover 2 nitrophenyl octyl ether npoe was chosen as a good plasticizer as a result of the high dielectric constant of the npoe plasticizer and increasing the membrane performance 15 studies have shown that the transport rate increases as a result of the enhancement in the concentration of plasticizers 22 carriers which are another used material in production are generally used to transport the target material with pims 11 also carriers determine the selectivity durability and transfer rate of pim 23 as is known three properties are specified for the compatibility of carriers with base polymers 24 these are its extractant lipophilicity hydrogen bonding capacity and ability to participate in dipole dipole interactions 25 in the studies in the literature it has been observed that the carrier with the highest hydrogen bonding capacity or the ability to participate in dipole dipole interactions is aliquat 336 and aliquat 336 forms successful membranes with cta and pvc base polymers 26 due to its versatility and affordability aliquat 336 is a frequently used carrier in the fabrication of pims 27 when the literature studies were examined membranes with and without carriers were produced it was considered that both flux and convection enhanced as a result of increasing aliquat 336 concentration 22 28 according to the study of pośpiech et al the effect of using a carrier which was trioctylamine toa on the membrane has been investigated when he examined the membrane performance they observed the best result in the membrane containing toa carrier 2 using membranes as adsorbents is attracting more and more attention in recent years 29 the membrane processes have three mechanisms for the removal of precious metals which are adsorption size exclusion and charge repulsion 30 to obtain good yields of adsorption properties it is recommended that the adsorbent material provide a high selectivity 31 32 especially crown ethers are well known for their ability to form complexes by incorporating different metallic ions into their rings so the use of these materials as adsorbents has increased in the literature 33 as a result of the use of different materials the adsorption capacities of precious metals are increased for example as a result of using chitosan 34 the palladium adsorption capacity was 22 6 mg g while it was 20 mg g in the study using magnesium silicate 31 in another study a new adsorbent was produced by chemical modification of the amberlite xad7 polymer by functionalizing it with dibenzo 18 crown 6 ether and its palladium adsorption capacity was stated as 6 5 mg g 33 pims are particularly effective in adsorbing low metal concentrations 35 the adsorption method is both effective and simple because for that reason the retention and mechanism of chemicals were shown to be significantly impacted by their adsorption on the membrane the adsorption of the substance on the membrane must be considered when assessing a membrane s ability to retain hydrophobic substances 36 in this study the effect of polymers on the retention and recovery of precious metals using different pim was investigated this study was carried out to provide both economic gain and resource recovery pvc cta and pvdf polymers are used as base materials for membrane production that includes different carrier and plasticizer materials which are aliquat 336 npoe and toa after characterization studies of these membranes adsorption processes of the membranes were performed with prepared 10 ppm palladium feed solution from palladium standard solution for this reason the adsorption of palladium metal was investigated by changing the ph contact time temperature of the solutions and membrane types 2 materials and methodology 2 1 chemicals cta pvdf and pvc mw 80000 g mol were used as base polymers also chloroform dimethylacetamide dmac and tetrahydrofuran thf were used as solvents methyltrioctylammonium chloride mw 404 16 g mol and trioctylamine mw 353 67 g mol were used as carriers 2 nitrophenyl octyl ether mw 251 32 g mol was used as a plasticizer all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich to prepare the pims fig 1 nitric acid hno3 65 and sodium hydroxide naoh were used to understand chemical stability and were purchased from tekki̇m and merck the 1000 mg l of palladium solutions were purchased from cpa chem the seven compact ph meter was used to calibrate the ph of aqueous solutions 2 2 membrane preparation three different types of base polymers pvc cta and pvdf aliquat336 trioctylamine toa and npoe were mixed to prepare 18 different types of pims the 300 mg of materials were dissolved in a small volume 10 ml of solvents tetrahydrofuran thf for pvc chloroform for cta and n n dimethyl acetamide dmac for pvdf were used as solvents firstly the base polymer was dissolved in the solvent and then plasticizers and carriers were added to the solution while the solutions for pvc and cta base polymers were mixed at room temperature for 2 h the solution for pvdf base polymer was mixed for 2 h at 60 c then the mixture was poured into a 9 0 cm diameter glass ring that was set on a flat glass plate a filter paper and watch glass were used to cover the mixture which allowed the solvent to slowly evaporate for 24 h leaving behind a clear and flexible circular membrane the glass plate was sunk in the water bath to easily peel off the membranes were dried before analysis all membranes were shown in table 1 2 3 characterization the morphology and surface properties of pims were defined by the attenuated total reflection fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy atr ftir thickness contact angle and scanning electron microscope sem the atr ftir was used to understand the chemical functional groups of all prepared pims thickness was performed by mitutoyo digital micrometer the surface hydrophilicity of pims was measured by ksv attension theta model contact angle equipment in this method the contact angle is calculated within the first 5 s after the droplet s slump on the pims surface scanning electron microscopy fei quanta feg 250 model analysis was performed to determine the surface morphologies of pims inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry was used to measure the concentration of pd in the samples icp oes 7000 dv perkin elmer usa thermal gravimetry analysis tga is a thermal analysis technique in which weight changes in material are measured under programmed heating conditions with the tg dta device properties such as mass change decomposition temperature melting temperature glass transition tg temperature crystallization tc temperature and phase transformation temperatures of metal polymer and ceramic based materials can be determined measurements can be made up to 600 c in the device 2 4 stability studies the chemical stability of the pim was investigated in an acidic solution 1 m hno3 and a basic solution 0 05 m naoh 37 the one piece of pims was weighted and put into both of solutions they were mixed at 150 rpm for 24 h after that they were left and put on another plate to dry for 24 h then the membranes were weighted to understand the loss of mass the experiment was repeated three times 2 5 adsorption experiments palladium is one of the 10 rarest elements on earth in general they are found as 2 valence in their salts but they exist as pdcl4 2 or pdcl6 2 in acid solutions when the literature was examined different concentrations were found as the palladium concentration from the waste solutions obtained from electronic wastes for example while it is 10 ppm in tv card scrap 124 ppm in tv motherboard scrap and also 3 ppm in computer scrap it is 210 ppm in mobile phone scrap therefore by choosing a value such as 10 ppm this concentration will be increased in subsequent studies the reason why the ph was chosen between 1 and 5 is due to the fact that it exists in these two forms without disturbing its originality in those value ranges as can be seen in the fig 2 the reason for the absence of interaction is the use of standard solutions in the experiments one of the important parameters affecting membrane performance is the ph of the solution 38 to explain this the ph value range was changed between 1 00 and 5 00 at the end of 240 min a 10 ml sample was taken from the solution mixed at a constant temperature at 400 rpm and the experiment was carried out the effect of contact time and temperature on the adsorption of palladium metal was studied between 0 and 420 min using a pim in a flask containing 100 ml of the solution at four different temperatures which are 25 c 35 c 45 c and 55 c and with agitation at 400 rpm to determine the solution s residual metal ion concentration 10 ml of the solution was extracted at various time intervals temperature experiments of adsorption were carried out using heated mixers at 4 different temperatures during the experiment it was controlled and kept constant with both the thermometer and the indicator of the mixer the effect of changing the membrane content on adsorption was investigated for this the adsorption experiment was carried out by mixing the solutions at the ph temperature and contact times selected in the previous section at the end of the contact time 15 ml of solution was taken and analysis was performed all the adsorption experiments were repeated three times the adsorption capacity was calculated using the following equation which took into consideration the solution s concentration difference at the start and equilibrium 39 1 adsorption capacity q e c o c t v m where co and ct mg l were the metal ion concentrations before and after adsorption v was the volume of solution and m was the area of the membrane respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pim ftir spectroscopy was employed to characterize the chemical structures of all pims the functional groups and molecular structure of pims were shown in supplementary fig 1 and table 2 according to fig s1 oh bands at between 3380 and 3400 cm 1 ch bonding at between 2850 and 2930 cm 1 co stretching at between 1740 and 1750 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of cta base polymer 40 41 moreover ch bands at between 3300 and 2700 cm 1 cc bands at between 1680 and 1600 cm 1 and cn bands at between 1230 and 1020 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of pvdf base polymer 42 furthermore ccl bands at between 610 and 692 cm 1 ch bonding at 1425 cm 1 ch stretching at 2915 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of pvc base polymer 40 41 when toa addition has an oh bond between 3700 and 3550 cm 1 when aliquat336 was added it was observed that there were ch3 group bonds between 2926 and 2857 cm 1 and ammonium group bonds between 1467 and 1378 cm 1 apart from these bonds 43 when npoe was added the strong peaks located around 1550 and 1500 cm 1 are attributed to no groups 44 ftir spectroscopy was employed to characterize the chemical structures of all pims the functional groups and molecular structure of pims were shown in supplementary fig 1 and table 2 according to fig s1 oh bands at between 3380 and 3400 cm 1 ch bonding at between 2850 and 2930 cm 1 co stretching at between 1740 and 1750 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of cta base polymer 40 41 moreover ch bands at between 3300 and 2700 cm 1 cc bands at between 1680 and 1600 cm 1 and cn bands at between 1230 and 1020 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of pvdf base polymer 42 furthermore ccl bands at between 610 and 692 cm 1 ch bonding at 1425 cm 1 ch stretching at 2915 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of pvc base polymer 40 41 when toa addition has an oh bond between 3700 and 3550 cm 1 when aliquat336 was added it was observed that there were ch3 group bonds between 2926 and 2857 cm 1 and ammonium group bonds between 1467 and 1378 cm 1 apart from these bonds 43 when npoe was added the strong peaks located around 1550 and 1500 cm 1 are attributed to no groups 44 membrane hydrophilicity at different plasticizers and carriers was investigated by measuring the contact angle when a membrane is too hydrophilic it will dissolve in water and leach out the carrier when it is too hydrophobic it is susceptible to biofouling and low extraction efficiency the pim must thus be hydrophobic enough to prevent the carrier from leaching out and hydrophilic enough to increase the amount of time the membrane surface is in contact with the feed solution 37 table 3 shows the average contact angle values for different types of pims the membrane water contact angle depends on the nature of the polymer matrix and the additives incorporated in the pim carrier plasticizer 47 in addition to surface polarity it is clear that the surface topography of membranes can affect the water contact angle 48 the inclusion of carrier molecules in the cta polymer base can modify the water contact angle of obtained pims which is a parameter indicative of the membrane wettability 49 when all base polymer concentrations were decreased and the carrier concentrations were increased the contact angles were decreased also the contact angle of cta 3 was higher than cta 2 because of the addition of npoe this means the presence of npoe lowers the surface hydrophobicity of the cta film moreover the hydrophilicity of pvdf 2 was lower than pvdf 3 because of the addition of npoe also the hydrophilicity of pvc 2 was lower than pvc 3 because of the addition of npoe this means the presence of npoe increases the surface hydrophobicity of the pvdf and pvc film according to table 3 aliquat 336 was more hydrophilic than npoe aliquat 336 has hydrophilic ammonium groups 50 the contact angle of all membrane ids with the number 5 was higher than number 3 furthermore the contact angle of the cta 5 was higher than cta 3 the contact angle of the pvdf 5 was higher than pvdf 3 and also the contact angle of the pvc 5 was higher than pvc 3 this observation may be attributed to a possible higher polar nature of toa in comparison with other pims constituents 51 the increase in water contact angle of cta membranes when incorporating npoe as plasticizer due to the long chain alkyl hydrophobicity of npoe the incorporation of different carrier molecules extractants into the membrane results in a lower water contact angle demonstrating that the presence of aliquat 336 npoe or toa and modifier improved the wettability of the membrane surface 52 the analysis to examine the pores of the pims was performed with the porometer since the membranes that gave the best results in this study were pvc based their porometer results are given below table 4 and fig 3 the cross sectional sem images of the membranes were shown in fig 4 sem experiments were done to identify the surface morphology of the membranes when sem images were examined it was observed that the surface in contact with air was rough and some pores were formed due to solid liquid separation as a result of solvent evaporation 53 regarding the excessive plasticization of pvc as a result of the addition of aliquat 336 it can be said that the pores of the membranes are dense and the mass transfer resistance is high with excessive plasticization 54 in addition it was observed that the roughness of the membrane decreased when 2 npoe was used as a plasticizer 55 all membranes were dense 56 according to kuene et al 2020 it has been reported that the membrane morphology is highly dependent on the preparation method and dense membranes should be observed when the solvent evaporation method is used 37 57 while pvc and cta evaporated at room temperature to form a membrane pvdf evaporated at 50 c to form a membrane therefore there is a very different topography in sem images in addition this formation was observed as the polymer matrix since pvdf has a different structure compared to the others it is necessary to ensure that the membrane material is thermodynamically stable and does not degrade under temperature conditions the thermal stability of membranes is characterized by tga analysis 58 as a result of the analyzes it was observed that the degradation of cta occurred in two stages dehydrochlorination at 320 c and degradation of the remainder of the polymer at 380 c followed conversion to carbon dioxide and volatile hydrocarbons the final part of the weight loss is thermal decomposition of the cta from about 400 c and finally carbonization to ash at about 600 c moreover the first degradation temperature of the pvc membrane occurred at 200 c and is due to the separation of the hcl molecule from the chain the second thermal decomposition zone is around 400 c and is due to the complete degradation and charring of the polymer chain furthermore when the tga analysis of the pvdf membrane was examined it was observed that the material deteriorated over three steps the first decomposition step took place in the temperature range of 20 420 c between 420 and 450 c the highest mass loss of the material occurred with approximately 50 it was observed that the third mass loss step which started at 450 c continued despite the temperature reaching 600 c as a result of the addition of carrier and plasticizer each weight loss curve is clearly divided into three parts the first part of the weight loss below 180 c corresponds to the evaporation of the solvent the next steps are called weight loss relative to the added plasticizer and carrier it has also been observed that aliquat 336 has better thermal stability than other materials 3 2 stability studies the pim needs to be stable in terms of both chemistry and physics chemical stability is determined by a material s capacity to efficiently entrap a carrier inside a polymer matrix while minimizing leaching to the environment after application because each component has a unique set of physical and chemical characteristics it is crucial to take them into account while selecting the pim parameters for a particular application to measure a pims stability under certain environmental conditions its weight loss under such circumstances may be observed 37 the stability of the pims was investigated both basic 0 05 m naoh and acidic 1 m hno3 conditions were used for this this was accomplished by weighing the pims both before and after they were submerged in the solutions of 0 05 m naoh and 1 m hno3 the average mass percentage lost after exposure is presented in fig 5 the low and high mass loss in acidic and basic conditions is due to the chemical degradation of polymers the difference in degradation of these three different polymers depending on the ph is due to the different chemical bonds as a result of the experimental studies when the data of the membranes produced with different polymers were examined it was observed that the membranes with the pvdf polymer had the least stability and the membranes with the cta polymer had the highest stability this can be attributed to the polymer hydrolysis of cta and the good chemical stability of its matrix 25 however the change of these mass losses with the addition of carrier and plasticizer is due to the change of the membrane matrix with additives 59 also the variation of mass losses depends on the concentration of the solutes and the nature of the solute 50 also the tested pims tend to be more stable in acidic media than in basic media all pims of varied compositions were shown to be more stable in acidic settings than in basic ones this could be explained by the carrier aliquat 336 s positive charge which makes it possible for highly concentrated hydroxide oh anions from the naoh to interact with one another this activity exposes the carrier which then causes it to leak out of the membrane since hydronium cations h3o are abundant in the acidic solution and aliquat 336 is likewise cationic there will be little contact increasing the pim s stability 3 3 adsorption efficiency 3 3 1 the effect of ph to understand the palladium adsorbing capacity of pims experiments were carried out at different phs since the original ph of the palladium pd standard solutions was 0 64 the ph values of solutions were adjusted by adding hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh the change in pd adsorption capacity when the solution ph increases are shown in table 5 the optimum adsorption capacity of pd reached about 117 17 1512 12 and 1681 21 mg m2 at a solution ph 2 chosen for all subsequent experiments containing cta 0 pvc 0 and pvdf 0 base polymers respectively it is understood that raising the ph of the solution causes the pd to break down into chloro complexes pd is more stable at low ph levels thus when ph levels are raised fewer adsorbable pd species that already present in the solution also it was observed that the difference between the base polymers was due to the polymer matrix and the behavior of the polymer structure at different phs it is said that there is no deterioration in the membranes in solutions without adding acid and base and therefore they give the highest results they may therefore account for the declining adsorption capability 38 3 3 2 the effect of contact time and temperature the effect of contact time and temperature on pd adsorption was done in the range of 0 to 420 min and 25 c to 55 c as evident from fig 6 the increasing contact time had a positive effect on pd adsorption i e the adsorption capacity increased with increasing time and it reached equilibrium after 240 min it was observed that the adsorption capacity did not increase after this period coincided with the maximum adsorption capacity of the membrane the adsorption capacities of precious metals as a function of temperature are presented in fig 6 when the temperatures and contact times result for pd adsorption were examined it was observed that the adsorption capacities increased as the temperature increased in addition it was observed that increasing the contact times increased the adsorption capacity for the pims but there was no change in the adsorption percentage after a certain period it can be said that as the temperatures increase to a certain level the pores on the membrane surface expand and have more adsorbing capacity according to a study on how temperature affects the permeation properties of membranes when temperature rises the thermal expansion of the polymer causes the average pore size to grow and the pore density to decrease 60 the pores of the membranes increased with temperature the results are shown in fig 4 although they differ according to the polymer structure in addition it was observed that the maximum adsorption capacity for cta membranes pvc membranes and pvdf membranes was observed when the temperature was 35 c 55 c and 35 c respectively therefore these temperatures were chosen in the next pd experiments for all membranes 3 3 3 the effect of the type of membrane in the study in this section ph was determined as 2 and it was determined as 240 min 35 c for cta 0 90 min 55 c for pvc 0 and 180 min 35 c for pvdf 0 when the effect of membrane content on precious metal adsorption was examined in fig 7 it was observed that the adsorption of precious metal increased with the change of content the reason for this is both the addition of different carriers and the effect of compatibility of carrier and plasticizer in addition it was observed that the addition of aliquat336 adsorbed more pd compared to other additional materials and the adsorption capacity increased as the ratio increased however membrane stability and contact angle also significantly affected membrane performance when the table 3 is examined within the scope of contact angles while the bare membrane is hydrophobic the membrane become hydrophilic as a result of the addition of plasticizers and carriers in addition when the stabilities are examined the fact that pvdf deteriorates the most and pvc deteriorates the least is one of the most important factors affecting the membrane performance when all these are combined the performance of the membranes has been positively affected in addition the reason why the performance of pvc is higher than the others can be explained in this way 3 4 reusability performance one of the most important economic criteria for industrial application of synthesized pim is its reusability to reduce overall cost in this context the adsorption performance and stability of the synthesized pim were evaluated for repeated extractions to examine the adsorption efficiency of pim up to 10 cycles were done with the selected temperature ph and contact time samples were taken from the 10 ppm palladium solution prepared initially and then from the solution bottle after each cycle also the samples were removed and replaced with new solutions thus the continuity of the cycle is preserved the adsorption efficiency of pim was studied up to 10 cycles and a decrease was observed after the first cycle fig 8 similar results were obtained in other cycles starting from the 2nd cycle the reason for this sudden decrease is that the membrane uses most of its adsorptive capacity in the first cycle it has been reported in the literature and in our previous studies that the stability of pvc containing pim is not affected by exposure to acidic and basic environments 61 in this case exposure of the pim to acidic solution during processing did not cause any physical changes in the surface morphology and the adsorption efficiency remained similar after successive cycles therefore the results of the reusability of pims for palladium metal were found to be in agreement with the literature after the reusability tests sem images were examined on the surface as a result of the examination it was clearly seen that there was adsorption on the membrane surface especially after 40 000 magnifications fig 9 in addition it was observed that the temperature reduced the membrane pores this explains the reduction as a result of cycles as the temperature increased the pores became smaller and the adsorption capacity decreased 4 conclusion in this study pims with different contents were produced and characterized when the characterization results are examined ftir results were similar to the literature this shows that the membrane solutions are mixed homogeneously and production is achieved when the contact angles were examined it was observed that the membranes were more hydrophobic with the addition of npoe and aliquat was more hydrophilic than toa when the base polymers were examined the most hydrophobic pvdf containing membranes were the most hydrophilic cta containing membranes then the effect of the produced membranes on the pd adsorbent was investigated in the research part phs were examined first according to ph experiments the optimum ph was determined as 2 for all membranes after the ph was decided the contact time and temperature were determined the temperatures and contact times of the membranes containing cta pvc and pvdf were 35 c 240 min 55 c 90 min and 35 c 180 min respectively as a result of the determined parameters the pd adsorption capacities of each membrane were investigated as a result of this study the best results were 40 cta 20 aliquat 40 toa cta 4 40 pvc 20 aliquat 40 toa pvc 4 and 40 pvdf 40 aliquat 20 npoe pvdf 3 for each base polymer as a result of this study extraction experiments will be carried out by producing membranes containing different concentrations of carrier and plasticizer by using pvc base polymer which gives the best results and in the next experiments the stripping phase palladium concentration and carrier concentration will be changed future research on the large scale industrial manufacturing and use of pims which include automatic casting membranes and continuous larger scale extraction and back extraction system would be intriguing the study may potentially be focused on developing pims with a higher extraction rate and improved stability however to reduce the production of polymer waste it should also take environmental considerations into account and use alternative renewable and reusable polymeric materials the following is the supplementary data related to this article supplementary fig 1 the ftir results a for containing cta

potential to address real world separation issues 8 for these reasons a number of liquid membrane systems using hollow fiber supported and bulk emulsion supported liquid membranes have been reported solid dense membranes built of polymeric materials have been proposed as a way to achieve better carrier entrapment in order to address the stability issues caused by the leaching of the organic phase in supported liquid membrane slm settings this strategy has been used to remove palladium using activated composite acm hybrid polymeric plasticized ppm or polymer inclusion membranes pims 9 polymer inclusion membrane pim offers a new alternative in membrane processes due to its advantages these processes are not only simple in design easy to operate and environmentally friendly but also have high stability good mechanical properties and chemical resistance in addition they are thin and flexible compared to other membranes 2 10 three materials are primarily used in pim these are the plasticizer carrier and base polymer pim performance impacting factors include membrane composition base polymer carrier and plasticizer characteristics membrane shape and the chemistry of aqueous solution producing phases 11 according to the studies in the literature the effect of base polymers on transport differs according to the structure of the polymers 12 13 one of the most popular polymers in pim fabrication is cellulose triacetate cta which is strong cta is a polar polymer that can form highly oriented hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl and acetyl groups 16 it is extremely crystalline and rather weakly hydratable 11 studies have shown that cta is more hydrophilic 14 and its transport performance is better than other polymers 15 moreover another polymer is polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf which is a pure thermoplastic fluoropolymer it provides higher strength and is better suited for carriers it is a polymer with excellent chemical resistance and is very hydrophobic 16 the fact that the polymer has these properties has increased its use in the production of polymer inclusion membranes 17 in addition membranes were produced with pvdf polymer to increase the stability of pims in an environment where acid base conditions are high when the studies were examined membranes containing both pvdf polymer and pvc polymer were produced with aliquat 336 and it was observed that pvdf based membranes had higher extraction efficiency 18 pvc is the most extensively used polymer and it has excellent strength and flexibility as well as the ability to remain stable in both basic and acidic conditions 19 20 additionally it is an amorphous polymer with little hydration and low crystallinity 11 however the performance of membranes is impacted by pvc s molecular weight metals for instance are transferred more readily than membranes made of low molecular weight pvc 15 another material plasticizer is used to soften and increase the flexibility of the polymer in addition it makes metal species more chemically and mechanically stable and ensures their passage over the membrane 21 moreover 2 nitrophenyl octyl ether npoe was chosen as a good plasticizer as a result of the high dielectric constant of the npoe plasticizer and increasing the membrane performance 15 studies have shown that the transport rate increases as a result of the enhancement in the concentration of plasticizers 22 carriers which are another used material in production are generally used to transport the target material with pims 11 also carriers determine the selectivity durability and transfer rate of pim 23 as is known three properties are specified for the compatibility of carriers with base polymers 24 these are its extractant lipophilicity hydrogen bonding capacity and ability to participate in dipole dipole interactions 25 in the studies in the literature it has been observed that the carrier with the highest hydrogen bonding capacity or the ability to participate in dipole dipole interactions is aliquat 336 and aliquat 336 forms successful membranes with cta and pvc base polymers 26 due to its versatility and affordability aliquat 336 is a frequently used carrier in the fabrication of pims 27 when the literature studies were examined membranes with and without carriers were produced it was considered that both flux and convection enhanced as a result of increasing aliquat 336 concentration 22 28 according to the study of pośpiech et al the effect of using a carrier which was trioctylamine toa on the membrane has been investigated when he examined the membrane performance they observed the best result in the membrane containing toa carrier 2 using membranes as adsorbents is attracting more and more attention in recent years 29 the membrane processes have three mechanisms for the removal of precious metals which are adsorption size exclusion and charge repulsion 30 to obtain good yields of adsorption properties it is recommended that the adsorbent material provide a high selectivity 31 32 especially crown ethers are well known for their ability to form complexes by incorporating different metallic ions into their rings so the use of these materials as adsorbents has increased in the literature 33 as a result of the use of different materials the adsorption capacities of precious metals are increased for example as a result of using chitosan 34 the palladium adsorption capacity was 22 6 mg g while it was 20 mg g in the study using magnesium silicate 31 in another study a new adsorbent was produced by chemical modification of the amberlite xad7 polymer by functionalizing it with dibenzo 18 crown 6 ether and its palladium adsorption capacity was stated as 6 5 mg g 33 pims are particularly effective in adsorbing low metal concentrations 35 the adsorption method is both effective and simple because for that reason the retention and mechanism of chemicals were shown to be significantly impacted by their adsorption on the membrane the adsorption of the substance on the membrane must be considered when assessing a membrane s ability to retain hydrophobic substances 36 in this study the effect of polymers on the retention and recovery of precious metals using different pim was investigated this study was carried out to provide both economic gain and resource recovery pvc cta and pvdf polymers are used as base materials for membrane production that includes different carrier and plasticizer materials which are aliquat 336 npoe and toa after characterization studies of these membranes adsorption processes of the membranes were performed with prepared 10 ppm palladium feed solution from palladium standard solution for this reason the adsorption of palladium metal was investigated by changing the ph contact time temperature of the solutions and membrane types 2 materials and methodology 2 1 chemicals cta pvdf and pvc mw 80000 g mol were used as base polymers also chloroform dimethylacetamide dmac and tetrahydrofuran thf were used as solvents methyltrioctylammonium chloride mw 404 16 g mol and trioctylamine mw 353 67 g mol were used as carriers 2 nitrophenyl octyl ether mw 251 32 g mol was used as a plasticizer all chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich to prepare the pims fig 1 nitric acid hno3 65 and sodium hydroxide naoh were used to understand chemical stability and were purchased from tekki̇m and merck the 1000 mg l of palladium solutions were purchased from cpa chem the seven compact ph meter was used to calibrate the ph of aqueous solutions 2 2 membrane preparation three different types of base polymers pvc cta and pvdf aliquat336 trioctylamine toa and npoe were mixed to prepare 18 different types of pims the 300 mg of materials were dissolved in a small volume 10 ml of solvents tetrahydrofuran thf for pvc chloroform for cta and n n dimethyl acetamide dmac for pvdf were used as solvents firstly the base polymer was dissolved in the solvent and then plasticizers and carriers were added to the solution while the solutions for pvc and cta base polymers were mixed at room temperature for 2 h the solution for pvdf base polymer was mixed for 2 h at 60 c then the mixture was poured into a 9 0 cm diameter glass ring that was set on a flat glass plate a filter paper and watch glass were used to cover the mixture which allowed the solvent to slowly evaporate for 24 h leaving behind a clear and flexible circular membrane the glass plate was sunk in the water bath to easily peel off the membranes were dried before analysis all membranes were shown in table 1 2 3 characterization the morphology and surface properties of pims were defined by the attenuated total reflection fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy atr ftir thickness contact angle and scanning electron microscope sem the atr ftir was used to understand the chemical functional groups of all prepared pims thickness was performed by mitutoyo digital micrometer the surface hydrophilicity of pims was measured by ksv attension theta model contact angle equipment in this method the contact angle is calculated within the first 5 s after the droplet s slump on the pims surface scanning electron microscopy fei quanta feg 250 model analysis was performed to determine the surface morphologies of pims inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry was used to measure the concentration of pd in the samples icp oes 7000 dv perkin elmer usa thermal gravimetry analysis tga is a thermal analysis technique in which weight changes in material are measured under programmed heating conditions with the tg dta device properties such as mass change decomposition temperature melting temperature glass transition tg temperature crystallization tc temperature and phase transformation temperatures of metal polymer and ceramic based materials can be determined measurements can be made up to 600 c in the device 2 4 stability studies the chemical stability of the pim was investigated in an acidic solution 1 m hno3 and a basic solution 0 05 m naoh 37 the one piece of pims was weighted and put into both of solutions they were mixed at 150 rpm for 24 h after that they were left and put on another plate to dry for 24 h then the membranes were weighted to understand the loss of mass the experiment was repeated three times 2 5 adsorption experiments palladium is one of the 10 rarest elements on earth in general they are found as 2 valence in their salts but they exist as pdcl4 2 or pdcl6 2 in acid solutions when the literature was examined different concentrations were found as the palladium concentration from the waste solutions obtained from electronic wastes for example while it is 10 ppm in tv card scrap 124 ppm in tv motherboard scrap and also 3 ppm in computer scrap it is 210 ppm in mobile phone scrap therefore by choosing a value such as 10 ppm this concentration will be increased in subsequent studies the reason why the ph was chosen between 1 and 5 is due to the fact that it exists in these two forms without disturbing its originality in those value ranges as can be seen in the fig 2 the reason for the absence of interaction is the use of standard solutions in the experiments one of the important parameters affecting membrane performance is the ph of the solution 38 to explain this the ph value range was changed between 1 00 and 5 00 at the end of 240 min a 10 ml sample was taken from the solution mixed at a constant temperature at 400 rpm and the experiment was carried out the effect of contact time and temperature on the adsorption of palladium metal was studied between 0 and 420 min using a pim in a flask containing 100 ml of the solution at four different temperatures which are 25 c 35 c 45 c and 55 c and with agitation at 400 rpm to determine the solution s residual metal ion concentration 10 ml of the solution was extracted at various time intervals temperature experiments of adsorption were carried out using heated mixers at 4 different temperatures during the experiment it was controlled and kept constant with both the thermometer and the indicator of the mixer the effect of changing the membrane content on adsorption was investigated for this the adsorption experiment was carried out by mixing the solutions at the ph temperature and contact times selected in the previous section at the end of the contact time 15 ml of solution was taken and analysis was performed all the adsorption experiments were repeated three times the adsorption capacity was calculated using the following equation which took into consideration the solution s concentration difference at the start and equilibrium 39 1 adsorption capacity q e c o c t v m where co and ct mg l were the metal ion concentrations before and after adsorption v was the volume of solution and m was the area of the membrane respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of pim ftir spectroscopy was employed to characterize the chemical structures of all pims the functional groups and molecular structure of pims were shown in supplementary fig 1 and table 2 according to fig s1 oh bands at between 3380 and 3400 cm 1 ch bonding at between 2850 and 2930 cm 1 co stretching at between 1740 and 1750 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of cta base polymer 40 41 moreover ch bands at between 3300 and 2700 cm 1 cc bands at between 1680 and 1600 cm 1 and cn bands at between 1230 and 1020 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of pvdf base polymer 42 furthermore ccl bands at between 610 and 692 cm 1 ch bonding at 1425 cm 1 ch stretching at 2915 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of pvc base polymer 40 41 when toa addition has an oh bond between 3700 and 3550 cm 1 when aliquat336 was added it was observed that there were ch3 group bonds between 2926 and 2857 cm 1 and ammonium group bonds between 1467 and 1378 cm 1 apart from these bonds 43 when npoe was added the strong peaks located around 1550 and 1500 cm 1 are attributed to no groups 44 ftir spectroscopy was employed to characterize the chemical structures of all pims the functional groups and molecular structure of pims were shown in supplementary fig 1 and table 2 according to fig s1 oh bands at between 3380 and 3400 cm 1 ch bonding at between 2850 and 2930 cm 1 co stretching at between 1740 and 1750 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of cta base polymer 40 41 moreover ch bands at between 3300 and 2700 cm 1 cc bands at between 1680 and 1600 cm 1 and cn bands at between 1230 and 1020 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of pvdf base polymer 42 furthermore ccl bands at between 610 and 692 cm 1 ch bonding at 1425 cm 1 ch stretching at 2915 cm 1 are assigned to the typical characteristic of pvc base polymer 40 41 when toa addition has an oh bond between 3700 and 3550 cm 1 when aliquat336 was added it was observed that there were ch3 group bonds between 2926 and 2857 cm 1 and ammonium group bonds between 1467 and 1378 cm 1 apart from these bonds 43 when npoe was added the strong peaks located around 1550 and 1500 cm 1 are attributed to no groups 44 membrane hydrophilicity at different plasticizers and carriers was investigated by measuring the contact angle when a membrane is too hydrophilic it will dissolve in water and leach out the carrier when it is too hydrophobic it is susceptible to biofouling and low extraction efficiency the pim must thus be hydrophobic enough to prevent the carrier from leaching out and hydrophilic enough to increase the amount of time the membrane surface is in contact with the feed solution 37 table 3 shows the average contact angle values for different types of pims the membrane water contact angle depends on the nature of the polymer matrix and the additives incorporated in the pim carrier plasticizer 47 in addition to surface polarity it is clear that the surface topography of membranes can affect the water contact angle 48 the inclusion of carrier molecules in the cta polymer base can modify the water contact angle of obtained pims which is a parameter indicative of the membrane wettability 49 when all base polymer concentrations were decreased and the carrier concentrations were increased the contact angles were decreased also the contact angle of cta 3 was higher than cta 2 because of the addition of npoe this means the presence of npoe lowers the surface hydrophobicity of the cta film moreover the hydrophilicity of pvdf 2 was lower than pvdf 3 because of the addition of npoe also the hydrophilicity of pvc 2 was lower than pvc 3 because of the addition of npoe this means the presence of npoe increases the surface hydrophobicity of the pvdf and pvc film according to table 3 aliquat 336 was more hydrophilic than npoe aliquat 336 has hydrophilic ammonium groups 50 the contact angle of all membrane ids with the number 5 was higher than number 3 furthermore the contact angle of the cta 5 was higher than cta 3 the contact angle of the pvdf 5 was higher than pvdf 3 and also the contact angle of the pvc 5 was higher than pvc 3 this observation may be attributed to a possible higher polar nature of toa in comparison with other pims constituents 51 the increase in water contact angle of cta membranes when incorporating npoe as plasticizer due to the long chain alkyl hydrophobicity of npoe the incorporation of different carrier molecules extractants into the membrane results in a lower water contact angle demonstrating that the presence of aliquat 336 npoe or toa and modifier improved the wettability of the membrane surface 52 the analysis to examine the pores of the pims was performed with the porometer since the membranes that gave the best results in this study were pvc based their porometer results are given below table 4 and fig 3 the cross sectional sem images of the membranes were shown in fig 4 sem experiments were done to identify the surface morphology of the membranes when sem images were examined it was observed that the surface in contact with air was rough and some pores were formed due to solid liquid separation as a result of solvent evaporation 53 regarding the excessive plasticization of pvc as a result of the addition of aliquat 336 it can be said that the pores of the membranes are dense and the mass transfer resistance is high with excessive plasticization 54 in addition it was observed that the roughness of the membrane decreased when 2 npoe was used as a plasticizer 55 all membranes were dense 56 according to kuene et al 2020 it has been reported that the membrane morphology is highly dependent on the preparation method and dense membranes should be observed when the solvent evaporation method is used 37 57 while pvc and cta evaporated at room temperature to form a membrane pvdf evaporated at 50 c to form a membrane therefore there is a very different topography in sem images in addition this formation was observed as the polymer matrix since pvdf has a different structure compared to the others it is necessary to ensure that the membrane material is thermodynamically stable and does not degrade under temperature conditions the thermal stability of membranes is characterized by tga analysis 58 as a result of the analyzes it was observed that the degradation of cta occurred in two stages dehydrochlorination at 320 c and degradation of the remainder of the polymer at 380 c followed conversion to carbon dioxide and volatile hydrocarbons the final part of the weight loss is thermal decomposition of the cta from about 400 c and finally carbonization to ash at about 600 c moreover the first degradation temperature of the pvc membrane occurred at 200 c and is due to the separation of the hcl molecule from the chain the second thermal decomposition zone is around 400 c and is due to the complete degradation and charring of the polymer chain furthermore when the tga analysis of the pvdf membrane was examined it was observed that the material deteriorated over three steps the first decomposition step took place in the temperature range of 20 420 c between 420 and 450 c the highest mass loss of the material occurred with approximately 50 it was observed that the third mass loss step which started at 450 c continued despite the temperature reaching 600 c as a result of the addition of carrier and plasticizer each weight loss curve is clearly divided into three parts the first part of the weight loss below 180 c corresponds to the evaporation of the solvent the next steps are called weight loss relative to the added plasticizer and carrier it has also been observed that aliquat 336 has better thermal stability than other materials 3 2 stability studies the pim needs to be stable in terms of both chemistry and physics chemical stability is determined by a material s capacity to efficiently entrap a carrier inside a polymer matrix while minimizing leaching to the environment after application because each component has a unique set of physical and chemical characteristics it is crucial to take them into account while selecting the pim parameters for a particular application to measure a pims stability under certain environmental conditions its weight loss under such circumstances may be observed 37 the stability of the pims was investigated both basic 0 05 m naoh and acidic 1 m hno3 conditions were used for this this was accomplished by weighing the pims both before and after they were submerged in the solutions of 0 05 m naoh and 1 m hno3 the average mass percentage lost after exposure is presented in fig 5 the low and high mass loss in acidic and basic conditions is due to the chemical degradation of polymers the difference in degradation of these three different polymers depending on the ph is due to the different chemical bonds as a result of the experimental studies when the data of the membranes produced with different polymers were examined it was observed that the membranes with the pvdf polymer had the least stability and the membranes with the cta polymer had the highest stability this can be attributed to the polymer hydrolysis of cta and the good chemical stability of its matrix 25 however the change of these mass losses with the addition of carrier and plasticizer is due to the change of the membrane matrix with additives 59 also the variation of mass losses depends on the concentration of the solutes and the nature of the solute 50 also the tested pims tend to be more stable in acidic media than in basic media all pims of varied compositions were shown to be more stable in acidic settings than in basic ones this could be explained by the carrier aliquat 336 s positive charge which makes it possible for highly concentrated hydroxide oh anions from the naoh to interact with one another this activity exposes the carrier which then causes it to leak out of the membrane since hydronium cations h3o are abundant in the acidic solution and aliquat 336 is likewise cationic there will be little contact increasing the pim s stability 3 3 adsorption efficiency 3 3 1 the effect of ph to understand the palladium adsorbing capacity of pims experiments were carried out at different phs since the original ph of the palladium pd standard solutions was 0 64 the ph values of solutions were adjusted by adding hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh the change in pd adsorption capacity when the solution ph increases are shown in table 5 the optimum adsorption capacity of pd reached about 117 17 1512 12 and 1681 21 mg m2 at a solution ph 2 chosen for all subsequent experiments containing cta 0 pvc 0 and pvdf 0 base polymers respectively it is understood that raising the ph of the solution causes the pd to break down into chloro complexes pd is more stable at low ph levels thus when ph levels are raised fewer adsorbable pd species that already present in the solution also it was observed that the difference between the base polymers was due to the polymer matrix and the behavior of the polymer structure at different phs it is said that there is no deterioration in the membranes in solutions without adding acid and base and therefore they give the highest results they may therefore account for the declining adsorption capability 38 3 3 2 the effect of contact time and temperature the effect of contact time and temperature on pd adsorption was done in the range of 0 to 420 min and 25 c to 55 c as evident from fig 6 the increasing contact time had a positive effect on pd adsorption i e the adsorption capacity increased with increasing time and it reached equilibrium after 240 min it was observed that the adsorption capacity did not increase after this period coincided with the maximum adsorption capacity of the membrane the adsorption capacities of precious metals as a function of temperature are presented in fig 6 when the temperatures and contact times result for pd adsorption were examined it was observed that the adsorption capacities increased as the temperature increased in addition it was observed that increasing the contact times increased the adsorption capacity for the pims but there was no change in the adsorption percentage after a certain period it can be said that as the temperatures increase to a certain level the pores on the membrane surface expand and have more adsorbing capacity according to a study on how temperature affects the permeation properties of membranes when temperature rises the thermal expansion of the polymer causes the average pore size to grow and the pore density to decrease 60 the pores of the membranes increased with temperature the results are shown in fig 4 although they differ according to the polymer structure in addition it was observed that the maximum adsorption capacity for cta membranes pvc membranes and pvdf membranes was observed when the temperature was 35 c 55 c and 35 c respectively therefore these temperatures were chosen in the next pd experiments for all membranes 3 3 3 the effect of the type of membrane in the study in this section ph was determined as 2 and it was determined as 240 min 35 c for cta 0 90 min 55 c for pvc 0 and 180 min 35 c for pvdf 0 when the effect of membrane content on precious metal adsorption was examined in fig 7 it was observed that the adsorption of precious metal increased with the change of content the reason for this is both the addition of different carriers and the effect of compatibility of carrier and plasticizer in addition it was observed that the addition of aliquat336 adsorbed more pd compared to other additional materials and the adsorption capacity increased as the ratio increased however membrane stability and contact angle also significantly affected membrane performance when the table 3 is examined within the scope of contact angles while the bare membrane is hydrophobic the membrane become hydrophilic as a result of the addition of plasticizers and carriers in addition when the stabilities are examined the fact that pvdf deteriorates the most and pvc deteriorates the least is one of the most important factors affecting the membrane performance when all these are combined the performance of the membranes has been positively affected in addition the reason why the performance of pvc is higher than the others can be explained in this way 3 4 reusability performance one of the most important economic criteria for industrial application of synthesized pim is its reusability to reduce overall cost in this context the adsorption performance and stability of the synthesized pim were evaluated for repeated extractions to examine the adsorption efficiency of pim up to 10 cycles were done with the selected temperature ph and contact time samples were taken from the 10 ppm palladium solution prepared initially and then from the solution bottle after each cycle also the samples were removed and replaced with new solutions thus the continuity of the cycle is preserved the adsorption efficiency of pim was studied up to 10 cycles and a decrease was observed after the first cycle fig 8 similar results were obtained in other cycles starting from the 2nd cycle the reason for this sudden decrease is that the membrane uses most of its adsorptive capacity in the first cycle it has been reported in the literature and in our previous studies that the stability of pvc containing pim is not affected by exposure to acidic and basic environments 61 in this case exposure of the pim to acidic solution during processing did not cause any physical changes in the surface morphology and the adsorption efficiency remained similar after successive cycles therefore the results of the reusability of pims for palladium metal were found to be in agreement with the literature after the reusability tests sem images were examined on the surface as a result of the examination it was clearly seen that there was adsorption on the membrane surface especially after 40 000 magnifications fig 9 in addition it was observed that the temperature reduced the membrane pores this explains the reduction as a result of cycles as the temperature increased the pores became smaller and the adsorption capacity decreased 4 conclusion in this study pims with different contents were produced and characterized when the characterization results are examined ftir results were similar to the literature this shows that the membrane solutions are mixed homogeneously and production is achieved when the contact angles were examined it was observed that the membranes were more hydrophobic with the addition of npoe and aliquat was more hydrophilic than toa when the base polymers were examined the most hydrophobic pvdf containing membranes were the most hydrophilic cta containing membranes then the effect of the produced membranes on the pd adsorbent was investigated in the research part phs were examined first according to ph experiments the optimum ph was determined as 2 for all membranes after the ph was decided the contact time and temperature were determined the temperatures and contact times of the membranes containing cta pvc and pvdf were 35 c 240 min 55 c 90 min and 35 c 180 min respectively as a result of the determined parameters the pd adsorption capacities of each membrane were investigated as a result of this study the best results were 40 cta 20 aliquat 40 toa cta 4 40 pvc 20 aliquat 40 toa pvc 4 and 40 pvdf 40 aliquat 20 npoe pvdf 3 for each base polymer as a result of this study extraction experiments will be carried out by producing membranes containing different concentrations of carrier and plasticizer by using pvc base polymer which gives the best results and in the next experiments the stripping phase palladium concentration and carrier concentration will be changed future research on the large scale industrial manufacturing and use of pims which include automatic casting membranes and continuous larger scale extraction and back extraction system would be intriguing the study may potentially be focused on developing pims with a higher extraction rate and improved stability however to reduce the production of polymer waste it should also take environmental considerations into account and use alternative renewable and reusable polymeric materials the following is the supplementary data related to this article supplementary fig 1 the ftir results a for containing cta base polymer b for containing pvdf base polymer and c for containing pvc base polymer supplementary fig 1 supplementary data to this article can be found online at https doi org 10 1016 j jwpe 2023
