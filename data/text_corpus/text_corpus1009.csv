climatology centre data at monthly scale using 36 complete years of data record 1981 2016 global assessment results indicate that both chirp and chirps have negative biases 5 93 for chirp and 2 01 for chirps before 2000 while this systematic underestimation was effectively removed after 2000 global analyses also show that the gauge adjusted chirps estimates generally represent a substantial improvement over chirp due to gauge based bias correction with respect to regional statistics temporal analysis and intensity distribution the gauge adjusted chirps estimates agree well with gpcc and outperforms chirp over most regions such as the united states europe africa australia and south america however southeast china is an exception over this region chirps has a systematic overestimation

instruments such as rain gauges or indirectly using remote sensing techniques weather radars and satellite based sensors li et al 2013 tang et al 2015 rain gauges can provide precise precipitation measurements at the point scale but the orifice area for all of the worldwide operational rain gauges is very small and the uncertainty of gauge based measurements increases with distance from the gauge location huff 1970 kidd et al 2017 with regard to ground based weather radar it can provide high resolution and nearly continuous precipitation estimates but it is not available in many areas especially over mountainous areas still facing significant challenges dinku et al 2002 sharif et al 2002 earth observing satellites can provide timely frequent and reliable estimates of precipitation at the global scale while such global coverage is infeasible for traditional rain gauge networks or terrestrial weather radars tian et al 2009 xie and xiong 2011 kidd et al 2012 in 1997 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm led by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa was launched as a successor to trmm the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is an international network of satellites that aims to provide the next generation global observations of rain and snow the gpm core observatory satellite was successfully launched on february 28 2014 overall the implementation of these two science programs advanced our understanding of earth s water and energy cycle improved forecasting of extreme events and provided accurate and timely precipitation information to directly benefit society under the scientific auspices of both trmm and gpm program precipitation related satellite sensors and associated retrieval algorithms have experienced rapid development in the past 30 years to date a number of operational quasi global satellite precipitation products based on combined passive microwave pmw pmw calibrated infrared ir and merged pmw and ir estimates have been released to public with different spatial and temporal resolutions several quasi global products include trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap kubota et al 2007 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 and integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2014 however the shortage of low latency long record gridded rainfall products makes it difficult for scientists and analysts to place recent rainfall extremes in historical context funk et al 2015 most current operational satellite precipitation products cannot satisfy some users practical requirements with both relatively long periods of record and reasonably low latencies to fill this gap the scientists at the university of california santa barbara and the u s geological survey usgs developed two new quasi global 50 s 50 n satellite precipitation datasets the satellite only climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp and the gauge corrected climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps mainly based on the infrared cold cloud duration ccd observation funk et al 2014 2015 these two high resolution 0 05 0 05 product archives with daily pentadal and monthly precipitation dataset extend from 1981 to near present providing an adequate length of data record approximately 40 years and an average latency of about 2 days real time chirp estimates and 3 weeks post real time chirps products for their hydrometeorological users aadhar and mishra 2017 their algorithmic process incorporates satellite information in three ways 1 using satellite data to estimate high resolution precipitation climatologies 2 using ccd fields to calculate precipitation anomalies 3 using satellite precipitation fields to produce local distance decay functions finally the retrieval system produces three main components including the climate hazards group precipitation climatology chpclim the satellite only chirp and the gauge corrected chirps the chirps estimates have been preliminarily evaluated or validated over cyprus katsanos et al 2015 chile zambrano et al 2017 argentina rivera et al 2018 china bai et al 2018 northeast brazil paredes trejo et al 2017 northwest ethiopia ayehu et al 2018 south asia aadhar and mishra 2017 and latin america baez villanueva et al 2017 these regional evaluation results indicate that the chirps estimates agree well with ground observations from local rain gauge networks and have a quite promising performance especially for drought monitoring even some researchers have pointed out that chirps apparently outperformed persiann cdr another infrared based long term satellite precipitation product in northwest china e g gao et al 2018 however to the best of our knowledge there are still few studies aiming to intercompare chirp and chirps over the globe among few quasi global studies funk et al 2015 conducted an early evaluation of chirp and chirps on the domain 126 w 153 e employing gpcc as benchmarked baseline during the period of 2000 2010 their results suggest that chirp and chirps have quite similar precipitation distributions in the wet season moreover these two products seem to be particularly suitable for monitoring droughts in plain areas where the ccd precipitation estimates compare rather well to ground observations furthermore they found that both chirp and chirps have relatively lower systematic biases when compared with other four widely used precipitation model and observational products i e coupled forecast system cfs cpc unified interpolated gauge products cpcu european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf and trmm based tmpa 3b42 rt however their study domain focused on the semi global domain 126 w 153 e missing some areas like east asia and australia and their evaluation period excluded the period before 2000 given that the study required overlapping availability of multiple products chirp chirps cfs cpcu ecmwf and tmpa 3b42 rt therefore the aim of this study is to perform a global evaluation of both chirp and chirps benchmarked by the gauge based gpcc data using a time series of 36 years 1981 2016 the spatial distribution temporal variation and latitudinal profiles of errors are comprehensively investigated over the global land surface furthermore six representative validation regions including the united states europe southeast china africa australia and south america are selected to quantitatively compare their regional performance and intensity distribution the manuscript is organized by describing the datasets and evaluation methodology in section 2 section 3 presents results by comparing the precipitation estimates to gpcc gauges for the global domain for different time periods and as functions of latitude regions seasons and intensity distributions a discussion of results follows in section 4 and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 ground reference the global precipitation analysis products of global precipitation climatology centre gpcc are used as the ground reference to validate the performance of both chirp and chirps in this study gpcc is the global analysis of daily and monthly precipitation on the earth s land surface based on ground gauge observations gpcc provides users with accurate gridded precipitation estimates with high analysis quality fuchs et al 2009 many researchers selected gpcc as the ground reference in their validation studies because the gpcc datasets were produced by the largest number of collected precipitation records over the globe and their high data quality has been demonstrated maidment et al 2014 funk et al 2015 pour et al 2018 here we used the monthly data product gpcc v 2018 as the validation reference which employs the latest gpcc climatology as analysis background compared to the near real time product of gpcc the gpcc v 2018 has higher data accuracy and wider application range as documented in schneider et al 2018 the gpcc v 2018 data at 0 25 spatial resolution were made available starting from 1981 ftp ftp dwd de pub data gpcc thus we selected an overlapping time span 1981 2016 of the three gridded precipitation datasets gpcc v 2018 chirp and chirps as our study period 2 2 satellite precipitation 2 2 1 chirp chirp is a purely satellite derived precipitation product which provides outputs at daily pentadal and monthly temporal resolutions all of them have a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 quasi global coverage 50 n 50 s 180 w 180 e and a complete data record from 1981 to near present these datasets can be downloaded from the climate hazards group s official website available on ftp ftp chg ucsb edu pub org chg products chirp chirp primarily relies on the thermal infrared cold cloud duration tir ccd to produce precipitation estimates at first a fixed ccd of 235 k was used as a rain no rain discriminant threshold subsequently local linear regression relationships were derived from both pentadal tmpa 3b42 and pentadal ccd data for each month next the regression parameters were resampled onto a 0 05 0 05 grid and then a pentadal rainfall dataset was produced the pentadal rainfall estimates at each grid were divided by their 1981 2013 mean values and multiplied with the corresponding chpclim value to generate the final chirp estimates it is noted that all the chirp products can cover both global land and sea areas due to the global coverage of tir ccd observations 2 2 2 chirps the chirps product was initially designed to support the united states agency for international development famine early warning system network fews net for drought monitoring at large scales chirps uses several ground based gauge networks including global summary of day gsod global historical climate network ghen southern african science service center for climate change and adaptive land management sasscal and world meteorological organization s global telecommunication system gts into chirp using a modified inverse distance weighting algorithm funk et al 2015 chirps yields precipitation estimates over land areas with a lag of 1 3 weeks following the generation of chirp precipitation fields chirps also provides daily pentadal and monthly products which can be downloaded from the climate hazards group s official website available at ftp ftp chg ucsb edu pub org chg products chirps 2 0 here the latest monthly chirps version 2 0 dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 was used in our study 2 3 methods because of the different spatial resolution of satellite estimates 0 05 0 05 and ground observations 0 25 0 25 the first step in our data processing is to aggregate all precipitation datasets into the same spatial resolution the satellite precipitation products were aggregated to the same spatial resolution of gpcc using pixel averaging a method that has been widely applied in many studies sapiano et al 2008 duan et al 2016 gehne et al 2016 to measure the performance of the satellite precipitation estimates against ground observations we adopted four widely used statistical indices pearson correlation coefficient cc mean error me root mean square error rmse and relative bias bias these evaluation metrics were calculated as follows 1 c c i 1 n g i g s i s ì i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 m e 1 n i 1 n s i g i 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 4 b i a s i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i 100 where g i refers to gauge based reference gpcc and g is the average value of gauge observations s i and s represent the satellite precipitation estimates and their average value and n refers to the number of samples the cc is an indicator of the linear correlation between satellite precipitation and ground observations the me can be used to simply scale the average difference between the satellite precipitation and ground observations the rmse can give greater weight to larger errors relative to me the bias measures the systematic bias of satellite precipitation estimates 3 results 3 1 global evaluation of chirp and chirps 3 1 1 spatio temporal comparison a global map of mean annual precipitation difference between chirp and chirps against the ground reference of gpcc reveals the spatial distribution of systematic biases of the precipitation products fig 1 a and b from the global view chirps generally has lower relative bias than chirp over most land areas such as the united states europe africa australia and south america however these improvements are not realized everywhere as chirps appears to have more positive biases than chirp in southeast china in terms of the magnitude of biases both chirp and chirps have relatively better performances in the united states and europe however both products have relatively poor performance over mountainous regions and remote areas with sparse gauge observations for example both chirp and chirps exhibit significant biases over the brazilian plateau and the tibetplateau where orographic enhancements to precipitation are found prior studies suggest that it is difficult for geostationary infrared precipitation retrievals to adequately estimate orographic rain events over complex terrain tong et al 2014 yong et al 2015 as for the ungauged areas such as the central parts of australia and africa there are few rain stations collected by fao and ghcn which are two important inputs for the chpclim over those areas with sparse gauges the chpclim may have larger uncertainties which results in apparent biases of chirp and chirps against gpcc fig 1c shows the time series of global systematic biases of chirp and chirps for the past 36 years 1981 2016 here we only selected those grids that contain at least one gpcc station to compute the annual spatially averaged precipitation difference between two satellite precipitation products and the ground reference gpcc generally speaking chirps exhibits relatively lower biases than chirp during the entire evaluation period because of gauge based adjustment but interestingly we note that both chirp and chirps have strong negative biases prior to 2000 while the systematic underestimation is diminished after 2000 the me values of chirp and chirps from 1981 to 1999 are 54 58 mm 5 93 and 18 49 mm 2 01 respectively after 2000 their corresponding values of bias were reduced to 0 35 and 0 06 suggesting that the systematic negative biases were effectively removed 3 1 2 comparison at two different stages given the apparent change in the behavior of the biases around 2000 we separated the evaluation period into two stages i e stage i 1981 1999 and stage ii 2000 2016 the global distribution of annual mean precipitation difference between the two satellite precipitation products and gpcc over these two different periods is displayed in fig 2 it is clear that chirp during stage i generally has the most serious negative bias over the globe while such systematic bias is alleviated by the gauge adjustment in chirps especially over europe australia united states and south america fig 2a and b but this improvement is not evident everywhere such as in africa and asia after 2000 the phenomenon of systematic underestimation is not found in the global chirp and chirps distributions fig 2c and d relative to stage i chirp is significantly improved at stage ii particularly over the eastern united states and southern parts of south america even some apparent positive biases occur over europe and india by intercomparing fig 2c and d we find that chirps generally improves over chirp over most land areas across europe australia north america and south america due to the introduction of ground observations however southeastern china is an exception over this region the chirps estimates exhibit higher positive biases compared to the satellite only chirp 3 1 3 bias of latitudinal profile for chirp and chirps fig 3 depicts the latitudinal distribution of systematic bias bias of the chirp and chirps estimates against gpcc over land areas during the two different periods stage i and stage ii considering less land areas and rain gauges located beyond 40 s we mainly focus on the bias between 50 n to 40 s for stage i 1981 1999 chirp exhibits the most significant negative biases especially beyond 20 ns latitude band the gauge adjustment with chirps effectively reduces the systematic negative biases as compared to chirp particularly over the latitude band beyond 30 ns this is consistent with the aforementioned results which can be attributed to the significant improvements in europe india australia north america and south america refer to fig 2 as for stage ii 2000 2016 we note that the apparent improvement from chirp to chirps occurs between 15 s and 35 s at this latitude band the gauge adjustment works best and effectively mitigates the systematic negative biases particularly in australia and south america refer to fig 2 however there is little difference between chirps and chirp at other latitude bands specifically one can see that chirps overestimates the precipitation relative to chirp from 20 n to 30 n see shaded area in fig 3 this analysis suggests that some of the significant positive biases of chirps can be attributed to the land areas in southeast china 3 2 regional comparison between chirp and chirps up to this point we have directly evaluated and compared the precipitation estimates from chirp and chirps over the globe to further detect and understand the error features of these two satellite precipitation products six representative regions i e europe africa southeast china australia north america and south america with relatively dense station networks were selected to perform the seasonal analyses fig 4 here our analysis mainly focuses on the period of stage ii 2000 2016 due to the more negative biases of historical satellite data prior to 2000 3 2 1 seasonal characteristics fig 5 shows the seasonal biases of chirp and chirps against gpcc over six selected regions overall the chirps estimates have relatively smaller values of bias than the satellite only chirp for different seasons as expected taking europe for example fig 5a the bias decreases from 6 28 with chirp to 1 67 with chirps in summer however there is serious overestimation with chirps over southern china during the spring and summer months fig 5b the values of bias significantly rising from 0 17 and 0 68 of chirp to 7 34 and 7 50 of chirps for spring and summer respectively in addition there are relatively larger negative biases with chirps than with chirp in winter and spring season over europe itislikely that snow ice cover over this region results in inaccurate observations by the ground stations especially in winter hence caution should also be exercised when using the chirps data for the winter season over europe 3 2 2 regional statistics the scatter plots of average monthly precipitation of chirp and chirps versus gpcc for the six selected regions are displayed in fig 6 the data points of chirps are clustered more closely to the 1 1 line than those of chirp especially in the united states australia and south america fig 6c e and f apparently the gauge adjustment algorithm applied in chirps substantially reduces the systematic biases of satellite precipitation retrievals however the majority of the data points of chirps in southeast china are above the 1 1 line fig 6b indicating overestimation table 1 summarizes the statistical metrics of chirp and chirps against gpcc to quantify the regional performance of satellite precipitation estimates in general chirps has higher cc and lower rmse values compared to chirp in all the selected regions with respect to me and bias chirps outperforms chirp in europe africa australia and south america as for the united states the values of error and bias have a slight increase 0 45 from chirp to chirps this is probably because chirps did not significantly decrease the positive biases in spring summer and autumn while the negative biases in winter were effectively reduced for southeast china however the values of me and bias increased from 3 49 mm and 3 26 with chirp to 5 94 mm and 5 55 with chirps respectively these statistics can be explained by improvements of the negative biases in autumn and winter in going from chirp to chirps yet an introduction of large positive bias during the spring and summer months 3 2 3 intensity distribution the probability density function pdf is widely used to evaluate the quality of satellite precipitation estimates across the spectrum of rainfall intensities in this study the pdfs of the monthly precipitation for chirp chirps and gpcc during stage ii were calculated for the six selected regions as shown in fig 7 the intensity distributions reveals rainfall rate differences between the satellite based products that are most evident at medium high rain rates additionally it is worth noting that chirps exhibits a significant improvement relative to chirp over europe united states and perhaps australia fig 7a c and e as for africa and south america there is little difference between chirp and chirps even for middle and high rainfall rates their intensity distributions almost overlap with that of gpcc this is because of the relatively sparse ground gauges especially over the middle parts of these regions fig 7d and f in contrast over southeast china chirps obviously overestimates the precipitation at the middle and upper rain rates 128 512 mm month while chirp agrees with gpcc rather well fig 7b associated with the seasonal performance of chirps we conclude the overestimations of chirps in southeast china mainly occur in spring and summer months with the rain rate ranging from 128 mm month to 512 mm month 4 discussion it is interesting that both chirp and chirps have significant negative biases prior to 2000 considering the data inputs and retrieval algorithms we concluded that the systematic underestimation for both chirp and chirps before 2000 might be attributed to two major reasons first chirp employed the globally gridded satellite grisat tir observations from 1981 to 2008 and the climate prediction center dataset cpc tir observations from 2000 present altogether as the data sources although a single adjustment factor using the overlapping cpc tir data was applied to the grisat tir observations for removing the systematic bias the short overlapping time of only 9 years 2000 2008 seems to be insufficient for adjusting the long period grisat tir data from 1981 to 1999 19 years secondly chirp and chirps are produced by integrating the linear relationship between tmpa and tir ccd data from 2000 to 2013 it looks to be a reasonable relationship for precipitation estimates after 2000 however the limit of historical time series will likely contribute to a systematic bias of both chirp and chirps before 2000 in this study we found the gauge adjusted chirps estimates agree well with gpcc and outperforms chirp over most regions however chirps has an unexpected overestimation during 2000 2016 in southeast china as compared to the reference gauge dataset we infer some possible reasons 1 there are several gauge networks that comprise both the gpcc dataset and the chirps products however there are still differences with regard to station type and numbers in southeast china 2 the quality control procedures applied to chirps and gpcc are not the same for example the usgs developed a screening procedure for chirps to remove the impact of false zeroes in the data funk et al 2014 while gpcc performed its own systematic check for erroneous zero values schneider et al 2014 3 the gauge analysis algorithms used in chirps and gpcc are different chirps applied a modified inverse distance weighting algorithm to merge the station data while the gpcc product use a modified version of the empirical interpolation method of spheremap willmott et al 1985 therefore we consider that different data sources and production processes may lead to the significant overestimation of chirps as compared to gpcc in southeast china efforts are still needed for data producers and users to pinpoint the specific reasons over this region 5 conclusions in this study chirp and chirps monthly precipitation products were evaluated and intercompared using the gauge based gpcc product as a reference the spatial and temporal distribution of error and bias were evaluated over the globe quantitative assessments and analyses were then performed over six representative regions i e united states europe australia africa southeast china and south america our evaluation indicates that chirps generally provides improved rainfall estimates over most land areas during the evaluation period of 36 years relative to chirp due to the gauge based bias correction interestingly we found that both chirp and chirps have consistent negative biases before 2000 while such systematic underestimation seems to be effectively alleviated after 2000 this systematic bias might results from differences in data inputs from two thermal infrared tir products and moreover this difference was not effectively accounted for prior to 2000 it is also possible that the current retrieval algorithm which is based on a tmpa ccd relationship established by training data from 2000 to 2013 was not appropriate for datasets prior to 2000 chirps generally outperformed chirp precipitation over the globe with the exception of southeast china over this region chirps exhibits an unexpected overestimation suggesting that some positive biases might be introduced into the retrieval system when employing the ground based gauge information in the calibration process with respect to regional statistics seasonal characteristics and intensity distributions chirps agrees well with the gauge based gpcc and outperforms chirp over most global land areas such as the united states europe africa australia and south america however chirps overestimates precipitation by 5 55 over southeast china during the period of 2000 to 2016 especially for warm season months given the global long term error characteristics of chirp and chirp we suggest that the data users exercise caution when applying these two satellite precipitation estimates to accommodate their various research endeavors especially for the period before 2000 and over southeast china in summary we expect that the global assessment reported in this paper will provide a better understanding of chirp and chirps for both users and producers credit authorship

performance and intensity distribution the manuscript is organized by describing the datasets and evaluation methodology in section 2 section 3 presents results by comparing the precipitation estimates to gpcc gauges for the global domain for different time periods and as functions of latitude regions seasons and intensity distributions a discussion of results follows in section 4 and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 ground reference the global precipitation analysis products of global precipitation climatology centre gpcc are used as the ground reference to validate the performance of both chirp and chirps in this study gpcc is the global analysis of daily and monthly precipitation on the earth s land surface based on ground gauge observations gpcc provides users with accurate gridded precipitation estimates with high analysis quality fuchs et al 2009 many researchers selected gpcc as the ground reference in their validation studies because the gpcc datasets were produced by the largest number of collected precipitation records over the globe and their high data quality has been demonstrated maidment et al 2014 funk et al 2015 pour et al 2018 here we used the monthly data product gpcc v 2018 as the validation reference which employs the latest gpcc climatology as analysis background compared to the near real time product of gpcc the gpcc v 2018 has higher data accuracy and wider application range as documented in schneider et al 2018 the gpcc v 2018 data at 0 25 spatial resolution were made available starting from 1981 ftp ftp dwd de pub data gpcc thus we selected an overlapping time span 1981 2016 of the three gridded precipitation datasets gpcc v 2018 chirp and chirps as our study period 2 2 satellite precipitation 2 2 1 chirp chirp is a purely satellite derived precipitation product which provides outputs at daily pentadal and monthly temporal resolutions all of them have a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 quasi global coverage 50 n 50 s 180 w 180 e and a complete data record from 1981 to near present these datasets can be downloaded from the climate hazards group s official website available on ftp ftp chg ucsb edu pub org chg products chirp chirp primarily relies on the thermal infrared cold cloud duration tir ccd to produce precipitation estimates at first a fixed ccd of 235 k was used as a rain no rain discriminant threshold subsequently local linear regression relationships were derived from both pentadal tmpa 3b42 and pentadal ccd data for each month next the regression parameters were resampled onto a 0 05 0 05 grid and then a pentadal rainfall dataset was produced the pentadal rainfall estimates at each grid were divided by their 1981 2013 mean values and multiplied with the corresponding chpclim value to generate the final chirp estimates it is noted that all the chirp products can cover both global land and sea areas due to the global coverage of tir ccd observations 2 2 2 chirps the chirps product was initially designed to support the united states agency for international development famine early warning system network fews net for drought monitoring at large scales chirps uses several ground based gauge networks including global summary of day gsod global historical climate network ghen southern african science service center for climate change and adaptive land management sasscal and world meteorological organization s global telecommunication system gts into chirp using a modified inverse distance weighting algorithm funk et al 2015 chirps yields precipitation estimates over land areas with a lag of 1 3 weeks following the generation of chirp precipitation fields chirps also provides daily pentadal and monthly products which can be downloaded from the climate hazards group s official website available at ftp ftp chg ucsb edu pub org chg products chirps 2 0 here the latest monthly chirps version 2 0 dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 was used in our study 2 3 methods because of the different spatial resolution of satellite estimates 0 05 0 05 and ground observations 0 25 0 25 the first step in our data processing is to aggregate all precipitation datasets into the same spatial resolution the satellite precipitation products were aggregated to the same spatial resolution of gpcc using pixel averaging a method that has been widely applied in many studies sapiano et al 2008 duan et al 2016 gehne et al 2016 to measure the performance of the satellite precipitation estimates against ground observations we adopted four widely used statistical indices pearson correlation coefficient cc mean error me root mean square error rmse and relative bias bias these evaluation metrics were calculated as follows 1 c c i 1 n g i g s i s ì i 1 n g i g 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 m e 1 n i 1 n s i g i 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i g i 2 4 b i a s i 1 n s i g i i 1 n g i 100 where g i refers to gauge based reference gpcc and g is the average value of gauge observations s i and s represent the satellite precipitation estimates and their average value and n refers to the number of samples the cc is an indicator of the linear correlation between satellite precipitation and ground observations the me can be used to simply scale the average difference between the satellite precipitation and ground observations the rmse can give greater weight to larger errors relative to me the bias measures the systematic bias of satellite precipitation estimates 3 results 3 1 global evaluation of chirp and chirps 3 1 1 spatio temporal comparison a global map of mean annual precipitation difference between chirp and chirps against the ground reference of gpcc reveals the spatial distribution of systematic biases of the precipitation products fig 1 a and b from the global view chirps generally has lower relative bias than chirp over most land areas such as the united states europe africa australia and south america however these improvements are not realized everywhere as chirps appears to have more positive biases than chirp in southeast china in terms of the magnitude of biases both chirp and chirps have relatively better performances in the united states and europe however both products have relatively poor performance over mountainous regions and remote areas with sparse gauge observations for example both chirp and chirps exhibit significant biases over the brazilian plateau and the tibetplateau where orographic enhancements to precipitation are found prior studies suggest that it is difficult for geostationary infrared precipitation retrievals to adequately estimate orographic rain events over complex terrain tong et al 2014 yong et al 2015 as for the ungauged areas such as the central parts of australia and africa there are few rain stations collected by fao and ghcn which are two important inputs for the chpclim over those areas with sparse gauges the chpclim may have larger uncertainties which results in apparent biases of chirp and chirps against gpcc fig 1c shows the time series of global systematic biases of chirp and chirps for the past 36 years 1981 2016 here we only selected those grids that contain at least one gpcc station to compute the annual spatially averaged precipitation difference between two satellite precipitation products and the ground reference gpcc generally speaking chirps exhibits relatively lower biases than chirp during the entire evaluation period because of gauge based adjustment but interestingly we note that both chirp and chirps have strong negative biases prior to 2000 while the systematic underestimation is diminished after 2000 the me values of chirp and chirps from 1981 to 1999 are 54 58 mm 5 93 and 18 49 mm 2 01 respectively after 2000 their corresponding values of bias were reduced to 0 35 and 0 06 suggesting that the systematic negative biases were effectively removed 3 1 2 comparison at two different stages given the apparent change in the behavior of the biases around 2000 we separated the evaluation period into two stages i e stage i 1981 1999 and stage ii 2000 2016 the global distribution of annual mean precipitation difference between the two satellite precipitation products and gpcc over these two different periods is displayed in fig 2 it is clear that chirp during stage i generally has the most serious negative bias over the globe while such systematic bias is alleviated by the gauge adjustment in chirps especially over europe australia united states and south america fig 2a and b but this improvement is not evident everywhere such as in africa and asia after 2000 the phenomenon of systematic underestimation is not found in the global chirp and chirps distributions fig 2c and d relative to stage i chirp is significantly improved at stage ii particularly over the eastern united states and southern parts of south america even some apparent positive biases occur over europe and india by intercomparing fig 2c and d we find that chirps generally improves over chirp over most land areas across europe australia north america and south america due to the introduction of ground observations however southeastern china is an exception over this region the chirps estimates exhibit higher positive biases compared to the satellite only chirp 3 1 3 bias of latitudinal profile for chirp and chirps fig 3 depicts the latitudinal distribution of systematic bias bias of the chirp and chirps estimates against gpcc over land areas during the two different periods stage i and stage ii considering less land areas and rain gauges located beyond 40 s we mainly focus on the bias between 50 n to 40 s for stage i 1981 1999 chirp exhibits the most significant negative biases especially beyond 20 ns latitude band the gauge adjustment with chirps effectively reduces the systematic negative biases as compared to chirp particularly over the latitude band beyond 30 ns this is consistent with the aforementioned results which can be attributed to the significant improvements in europe india australia north america and south america refer to fig 2 as for stage ii 2000 2016 we note that the apparent improvement from chirp to chirps occurs between 15 s and 35 s at this latitude band the gauge adjustment works best and effectively mitigates the systematic negative biases particularly in australia and south america refer to fig 2 however there is little difference between chirps and chirp at other latitude bands specifically one can see that chirps overestimates the precipitation relative to chirp from 20 n to 30 n see shaded area in fig 3 this analysis suggests that some of the significant positive biases of chirps can be attributed to the land areas in southeast china 3 2 regional comparison between chirp and chirps up to this point we have directly evaluated and compared the precipitation estimates from chirp and chirps over the globe to further detect and understand the error features of these two satellite precipitation products six representative regions i e europe africa southeast china australia north america and south america with relatively dense station networks were selected to perform the seasonal analyses fig 4 here our analysis mainly focuses on the period of stage ii 2000 2016 due to the more negative biases of historical satellite data prior to 2000 3 2 1 seasonal characteristics fig 5 shows the seasonal biases of chirp and chirps against gpcc over six selected regions overall the chirps estimates have relatively smaller values of bias than the satellite only chirp for different seasons as expected taking europe for example fig 5a the bias decreases from 6 28 with chirp to 1 67 with chirps in summer however there is serious overestimation with chirps over southern china during the spring and summer months fig 5b the values of bias significantly rising from 0 17 and 0 68 of chirp to 7 34 and 7 50 of chirps for spring and summer respectively in addition there are relatively larger negative biases with chirps than with chirp in winter and spring season over europe itislikely that snow ice cover over this region results in inaccurate observations by the ground stations especially in winter hence caution should also be exercised when using the chirps data for the winter season over europe 3 2 2 regional statistics the scatter plots of average monthly precipitation of chirp and chirps versus gpcc for the six selected regions are displayed in fig 6 the data points of chirps are clustered more closely to the 1 1 line than those of chirp especially in the united states australia and south america fig 6c e and f apparently the gauge adjustment algorithm applied in chirps substantially reduces the systematic biases of satellite precipitation retrievals however the majority of the data points of chirps in southeast china are above the 1 1 line fig 6b indicating overestimation table 1 summarizes the statistical metrics of chirp and chirps against gpcc to quantify the regional performance of satellite precipitation estimates in general chirps has higher cc and lower rmse values compared to chirp in all the selected regions with respect to me and bias chirps outperforms chirp in europe africa australia and south america as for the united states the values of error and bias have a slight increase 0 45 from chirp to chirps this is probably because chirps did not significantly decrease the positive biases in spring summer and autumn while the negative biases in winter were effectively reduced for southeast china however the values of me and bias increased from 3 49 mm and 3 26 with chirp to 5 94 mm and 5 55 with chirps respectively these statistics can be explained by improvements of the negative biases in autumn and winter in going from chirp to chirps yet an introduction of large positive bias during the spring and summer months 3 2 3 intensity distribution the probability density function pdf is widely used to evaluate the quality of satellite precipitation estimates across the spectrum of rainfall intensities in this study the pdfs of the monthly precipitation for chirp chirps and gpcc during stage ii were calculated for the six selected regions as shown in fig 7 the intensity distributions reveals rainfall rate differences between the satellite based products that are most evident at medium high rain rates additionally it is worth noting that chirps exhibits a significant improvement relative to chirp over europe united states and perhaps australia fig 7a c and e as for africa and south america there is little difference between chirp and chirps even for middle and high rainfall rates their intensity distributions almost overlap with that of gpcc this is because of the relatively sparse ground gauges especially over the middle parts of these regions fig 7d and f in contrast over southeast china chirps obviously overestimates the precipitation at the middle and upper rain rates 128 512 mm month while chirp agrees with gpcc rather well fig 7b associated with the seasonal performance of chirps we conclude the overestimations of chirps in southeast china mainly occur in spring and summer months with the rain rate ranging from 128 mm month to 512 mm month 4 discussion it is interesting that both chirp and chirps have significant negative biases prior to 2000 considering the data inputs and retrieval algorithms we concluded that the systematic underestimation for both chirp and chirps before 2000 might be attributed to two major reasons first chirp employed the globally gridded satellite grisat tir observations from 1981 to 2008 and the climate prediction center dataset cpc tir observations from 2000 present altogether as the data sources although a single adjustment factor using the overlapping cpc tir data was applied to the grisat tir observations for removing the systematic bias the short overlapping time of only 9 years 2000 2008 seems to be insufficient for adjusting the long period grisat tir data from 1981 to 1999 19 years secondly chirp and chirps are produced by integrating the linear relationship between tmpa and tir ccd data from 2000 to 2013 it looks to be a reasonable relationship for precipitation estimates after 2000 however the limit of historical time series will likely contribute to a systematic bias of both chirp and chirps before 2000 in this study we found the gauge adjusted chirps estimates agree well with gpcc and outperforms chirp over most regions however chirps has an unexpected overestimation during 2000 2016 in southeast china as compared to the reference gauge dataset we infer some possible reasons 1 there are several gauge networks that comprise both the gpcc dataset and the chirps products however there are still differences with regard to station type and numbers in southeast china 2 the quality control procedures applied to chirps and gpcc are not the same for example the usgs developed a screening procedure for chirps to remove the impact of false zeroes in the data funk et al 2014 while gpcc performed its own systematic check for erroneous zero values schneider et al 2014 3 the gauge analysis algorithms used in chirps and gpcc are different chirps applied a modified inverse distance weighting algorithm to merge the station data while the gpcc product use a modified version of the empirical interpolation method of spheremap willmott et al 1985 therefore we consider that different data sources and production processes may lead to the significant overestimation of chirps as compared to gpcc in southeast china efforts are still needed for data producers and users to pinpoint the specific reasons over this region 5 conclusions in this study chirp and chirps monthly precipitation products were evaluated and intercompared using the gauge based gpcc product as a reference the spatial and temporal distribution of error and bias were evaluated over the globe quantitative assessments and analyses were then performed over six representative regions i e united states europe australia africa southeast china and south america our evaluation indicates that chirps generally provides improved rainfall estimates over most land areas during the evaluation period of 36 years relative to chirp due to the gauge based bias correction interestingly we found that both chirp and chirps have consistent negative biases before 2000 while such systematic underestimation seems to be effectively alleviated after 2000 this systematic bias might results from differences in data inputs from two thermal infrared tir products and moreover this difference was not effectively accounted for prior to 2000 it is also possible that the current retrieval algorithm which is based on a tmpa ccd relationship established by training data from 2000 to 2013 was not appropriate for datasets prior to 2000 chirps generally outperformed chirp precipitation over the globe with the exception of southeast china over this region chirps exhibits an unexpected overestimation suggesting that some positive biases might be introduced into the retrieval system when employing the ground based gauge information in the calibration process with respect to regional statistics seasonal characteristics and intensity distributions chirps agrees well with the gauge based gpcc and outperforms chirp over most global land areas such as the united states europe africa australia and south america however chirps overestimates precipitation by 5 55 over southeast china during the period of 2000 to 2016 especially for warm season months given the global long term error characteristics of chirp and chirp we suggest that the data users exercise caution when applying these two satellite precipitation estimates to accommodate their various research endeavors especially for the period before 2000 and over southeast china in summary we expect that the global assessment reported in this paper will provide a better understanding of chirp and chirps for both users and producers credit authorship

5046,to evaluate the performance of deep learning methods dl for reference evapotranspiration estimation and to assess the applicability of the developed dl models beyond the study areas where they were trained three popular dl models named deep neural network dnn temporal convolution neural network tcn and long short term memory neural network lstm were developed to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration eto using incomplete meteorological data in the northeast plain china the performances of the three dl models were compared to two classical machine learning models cml support vector machine svm and random forest rf and empirical equations including two temperature based hargreaves h and modified hargreaves mh three radiation based ritchie r priestley talor p and makkink m and two humidity based romanenko rom and schendel s empirical models in two strategies 1 all proposed models were trained tested and compared in each single weather station and 2 all weather stations were split into several groups using the k means method with their mean climatic characteristics then in each group stations took turns testing the proposed models which were trained by rest of the stations the results showed that 1 the coefficient of determination r2 values of the tcn and rf were 0 048 and 0 035 significantly higher than that of mh respectively and the relative root mean error rmse values of tcn and rf were substantially 0 096 and 0 074 mm d lower than that of mh indicating that tcn and rf performed better than empirical models in the first strategy and tcn and lstm exhibited an rmse that was significantly decreased by 0 069 and 0 079 mm d showing that tcn and lstm outperformed empirical models in the second strategy compared with the mh method 2 in both strategies compared with the ritchie r model tcn lstm dnn rf and svm increased r2 and decreased rmse significantly especially the tcn model 3 similarly tcn lstm dnn rf and svm models all augmented r2 and reduced rmse substantially in comparison to humidity based empirical models in both strategies especially the tcn model overall when temperature based features were available the tcn and lstm models performed markedly better than temperature based empirical models beyond the study areas and when radiation based or humidity based features were available all of the proposed dl and cml models outperformed radiation based or humidity based empirical equations beyond the study areas in which they were trained keywords reference evapotranspiration deep learning neural network temporal convolution neural network long short term memory neural network 1 introduction evapotranspiration et contains two processes evaporation from surfaces of soil and plants and transpiration from crops to the atmosphere it is essential for estimation of irrigation water requirements hydrological processes evaluation of agronomy systems etc shiri et al 2013 it is critical to predict et accurately to design irrigation plans and improve the water resource use efficiency ferreira et al 2019 the computing accuracy of et highly relies on reference evapotranspiration eto which is the evapotranspiration of a reference surface defined as a hypothetical grass with a uniform height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 improving the precision of the estimation of eto plays a vital role in computing et and therefore increasing the irrigation efficiency and agricultural water reuse feng et al 2016 shiri et al 2013 the fao 56 penman monteith pm based on the laws of energy balance and aerodynamics is the most commonly used method for computing eto and for the validation of the other eto approaches feng et al 2016 tabari et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 the pm method however requires many meteorological features such as the maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation which hinders its application especially in developing countries traore et al 2010 abdullah et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to explore a simpler model to estimate eto with a reasonable precision using fewer weather features to estimate reference crop evaporation with incomplete weather variables many researchers have embraced different empirical methods such as temperature based radiation based humidity based water budget based mass transfer based and pan based methods to compute eto among these models temperature based radiation based and humidity based models are frequently used to compute eto instead of the pm method when all meteorological features are not available priestley and taylor 1972 the temperature based hargreaves h and modified hargreaves mh method are commonly used to estimate eto because of their high precision and simplicity luo et al 2014 almorox et al 2015 evaluated the performance of 11 temperature based methods for estimating eto and found that the h method obtained the highest accuracy the radiation based models mainly include the priestley taylor pt markkink m and ritchie r equations feng et al 2016 assessed the performance of these three radiation based models for computing eto and showed that the accuracy of pt and r equations was higher than that of the m equation tabari et al 2012 also evaluated pt m r jensen haise and turc models for estimating eto and found that the performance of the r equation was the best among these models humidity based models like romanenko rom and schendel s equations are also models commonly used to calculate eto using humidity based weather features mehdizadeh et al 2017 djaman et al 2015 although some empirical models including h mh pt r rom and s equations exhibit an excellent performance for estimating eto their performance varied widely across regions djaman et al 2015 evaluated 16 empirical models for computing eto in which the complete weather data were not available and found that the empirical models were either overestimating or underestimating the eto therefore exploration and development improved models for estimating eto with a high precision using less meteorological data is needed in the last decades with the rapid development of computers computing ability and artificial intelligence theory computing eto using weather data has been considered a regression task that can be solved by some classical machine learning cml and deep learning dl models dou and yang 2018 kalteh 2016 abdullah et al 2015 assessed the extreme learning machine elm model for estimating eto and the results showed that the elm model had an excellent performance in modeling eto wen et al 2015 evaluated the support vector machine svm for predicting eto only by air temperature and radiation data and found that the performance of svm was better than that of the h and pt method many previous studies have demonstrated that machine learning like the artificial neural network ann svm elm and random forest rf can precisely predict eto and the performance of these classical machine learning models was better than that of empirical models szegedy et al 2013 kalteh 2016 karandish and šimůnek 2016 some previous studies have shown that svm and rf models could estimate eto with a higher accuracy than other cml models however svm and rf models have a relative shallow structure and do not capture temporal information fan et al 2018 saggi and jain 2019 feng et al 2017 in recent years deep learning models have been successfully applied in various domains and showed outstanding performances in both regression and classification problems bui et al 2020 lee et al 2020 kao et al 2020 typical deep learning models include the deep neural network dnn convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm wang et al 2020 compared the dnn models for subsurface flow forecasting and found that the performance of theory guided dnn better than that of traditional dnn model zhou et al 2017 proposed cnn models for tomato primary organ recognition and found that cnn models can precisely recognize the fruit flower and stem of the tomato in 2018 bai et al 2018 developed an improved convolutional network named temporal convolution network tcn compared with dnn and tcn models the lstm model has a chain like structure that can memory the past information and has an ability to deal with time series data zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 developed the lstm model to predict the dynamic of the water table depth in five sub areas of the hetao irrigation district in arid northwestern china the results showed that the lstm model achieved the best performance among the considered models above all dl models have achieved success in many domains however these models are rarely used in the domain of agriculture and hydrology let alone in predicting eto in addition almost all studies that adopted cml models to predict eto were testing the performance of these models for estimating eto in one test dataset alone which cannot show how good or bad machine learning models are therefore the performance of well trained machine learning models at a new meteorological station is not precise above all the specific aims of this study were 1 to develop three dl models dnn tnn and lstm and two classical machine learning models svm and rf for predicting eto in the northeast plain of china 2 to compare the performance of the three dl models with the two cml models and empirical equations in estimating eto with limited meteorological inputs and 3 to investigate their performance

algorithm compared with conventional bp neural networks the dnn model has more hidden layers enabling it to obtain a powerful ability for dealing with regression and classification tasks in many industries however more hidden layers also brought a vital shortcoming gradient vanishing the relu eq 14 active function was adopted in this study to overcome this problem an example of the dnn model used in this study was illustrated in fig 4 the dnn model has two main processes feed forward process and error backpropagation process the feed forward process is expressed as eq 15 and the error backpropagation process update of weights and bias is calculated by eqs 16 and 17 in this study the shape of input of dnn model was samples features and the python 3 6 software and tensorflow 2 0 package were adopted to build the dnn model in which three hidden layers with 20 neurons were established and the learning rate was 0 005 14 relu s x x 0 0 x 0 15 e t op w 4 relu w 3 relu w 2 relu w 1

respectively e η and wij are error learning rate and weight of i layer and j neuron respectively long term and short term memory neural network lstm a new form of recurrent neural network rnn is illustrated in fig 5 a fig 5b explained how lstm calculated the eto through 365 time series data as has been done in this study this chain like structure enables the lstm model to remember the information of the past making the lstm model performs excellently when dealing with time series problems from fig 5a one can see that there are three gates including forgetting gate input gate and output gate inside the lstm model the forgetting gate is expressed as eq 18 in this gate the output ht 1 of step t 1 and input of step t xt is mapped between 0 and 1 by sigmoid active function deciding amount of information that is to be forgotten the input gate selects the useful information from the output ht 1 of step t 1 and input of step t xt to upgrade control parameters ct 1 of t 1 step the calculation process is expressed as eq 19 to eq 21 the output gate is mainly to calculate the output by eq 22 and eq 23 in this study the time step was 365 steps meaning that the output of t step was decided information of the previous 365 days and thus the dimension of input of lstm model was samples 365 features the lstm models were built by the tensorflow 2 0 package in python 3 6 software 18 f t sigmiod w f h t 1 u f x t b f 19 i t sigmiod w i h t 1 u i x t b i 20 c t tanh w c h t 1 u c x t b c 21 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 22 o t sigmoid w o h t 1 u o x t b o 23 h t o t tanh c t

parameter for step t ot is the output without the forgetting matrix and ht is the final output of step t 2 2 4 classical machine learning models the random forest rf model is an ensemble learning model in which the base models are decision trees the decision tree is a non parametric learning method used for classification and regression the goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules if then else decision rules inferred from the data features the typical structure is illustrated in fig 6 a the key process of creating a decision tree is to determine feature 1 feature 2 and so on information gain shown in eq 24 to eq 25 is a common index employed to choose feature 1 to feature n details of the decision tree algorithm are given in zhou 2018 in this study the rf models were written by the scikit learn package in python 3 6 24 gain d a e n t d v 1 v d v d e n t d v 25 e n t d k 1 y p k log 2 p k where gain d a is the information gain of feature a ent d is the information entropy of subset d ent dv is the information entropy of subset dv dv and d are the number of subset dv and d respectively and pk is a probability of k classification in d subset support vector machine svm achieved an excellent performance in many classification and regression tasks tabari et al 2012 ferreira et al 2019 in fact the svm model is a linear classifier which is linear line to solve the nonlinear problems the kernel function was applied eq 26 26 y w φ x b where y is the output w is the weight matrix b is the bias and φ x is the kernel function which maps the input feature space into a high dimensional feature space in this study the radial basis function was used as a kernel function for the svm model the aim of svm is to maximize the distance from the support vectors to line wφ x b 0 eq 27 and to decrease the influence of data noise achieve a soft margin in eq 27 the maximization of the distance is equal to minimization of the wtw therefore the aim function of svm is written as eq 28 27 distance max w φ x b w t w 28 min 1 2 w 2 c ξ i y i w φ x b 0 29 l w b α ξ 1 2 w 2 c ξ i i 1 n α i y i w t φ x b 1 where distance is the distance from the support vectors to line wφ x b 0 w is the weight matrix c is a parameter obtained by training and ξi represents slacking variables the eq 28 can be solved by langrange multiplier method eq 29 details of the calculation for svm are given in suykens and vandewalle 1999 in this study the svm models were written by the scikit learn package in python 3 6 2 3 data management and the development of models in this study to evaluate the performance of the proposed empirical and machine learning models for estimating eto using limited meteorological data three scenarios were evaluated 1 temperature based models using the daily minimum tmin maximum tmax and average temperature tmean and extraterrestrial radiation ra four input weather features which were the same as the input features of temperature based empirical equations 2 humidity based models using tmin tmax tmean ra and relative humidity rh five input weather features which were the same as the input features of humidity based empirical equations and 3 radiation based models using tmin tmax tmean ra and solar radiation rs five input weather features which were the same as the input features of radiation based empirical equations additionally the performance of temperature based models was compared with that of temperature based empirical methods the performance of humidity based models was compared with that of humidity based empirical methods and the performance of radiation based models was compared with that of radiation based empirical methods to further evaluate the performance of machine learning models for predicting eto in some areas which were not used to train models two strategies were adopted 1 all machine models were trained and tested in each weather station and 2 all weather stations were split into groups using the k means method a conventional clustering algorithm with their mean climatic characteristics table 1 then in each group each station took turns testing the proposed models which trained by the rest of the stations in the first strategy considering that the performance of the proposed models in one test dataset could not evaluate which model was better the daily values of meteorological features were randomly split into five sub datasets then four subsets were used to train the model which was then tested on the fifth one after that the t test was adopted to evaluate whether the performances of the proposed models exhibited significant differences in the second strategy cluster one had 4 weather stations and cluster two included 12 weather stations table 1 in each cluster stations took turns testing the proposed models trained by the rest of the stations then the t test was adopted to evaluate whether the performances of the proposed models displayed significant differences the daily average values of tmax tmin rh ra rs and eto from 1951 to 2018 for each meteorological station were available in this study these features were used to group all weather stations by the k means algorithm which is a standard clustering method with the advantage of being fast and straightforward zhou and zhao 2013 the k means method aims to partition n objects into k distinct and non overlapping clusters with the result being that each object belongs to the closest group using the k means algorithm includes several main processes such as first specifying the number of clusters k and then assigning each object to precisely one of the k clusters using the euclidean distance considering that selecting k is far from simple the silhouette coefficient was adopted to evaluate which k was the best the relationship between k and the silhouette coefficient is illustrated in fig 6b it shows that two clusters with a silhouette coefficient of 0 52 was the best choice in this study the result of the k means algorithm is shown in table 1 which shows that baicheng tongliao chifeng and chaoyang belonged to cluster 1 and the others belonged to cluster 2 to reduce the impacts of the absolute scare of the data on precision of models in predicting eto the input variables tmin tmax tmean ra rs and rh in each station were compressed between 0 and 1 by following equation feng et al 2016 30 x input x 0 x min x max x min where x0 is the actual value xmin is the minimum value and xmax is the maximum value 2 4 model performance and assessment the accuracy of all models was judged by two widely used indexes including the relative root mean error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 which were calculated by the following equations 31 rmse i n p i o i 2 n 32 r 2 i 1 n o i o avg p i p avg i 1 n o i o avg i 1 n p i p avg where pi and pavg are the predicted and average predicted value of eto mm d respectively and oi and oavg are the observed and average observed value of eto mm d 3 results 3 1 results of temperature based models the performance of proposed models in the first strategy is illustrated in fig 7 as seen from fig 7 the mean r2 of mh was 0 013 higher than that of h and the rmse was 0 025 mm d lower these results indicate that the mh model outperformed the h model therefore in this study the performance of temperature based tcn lstm dnn rf and svm was only compared with mh fig 7 shows that there was no significant difference in the r2 or rmse among mh lstm dnn and svm models this result reflects that in this study the accuracy of lstm dnn and svm was statistically almost the same as that of temperature based empirical models fig 7 also illustrates that the mean r2 values of tcn and rf were 0 831 and 0 818 which were 0 048 and 0 035 higher than that of mh respectively fig 7a and the rmse of tcn and rf were 0 755 and 0 777 mm d respectively which were 0 096 and 0 074 mm d lower than that of the mh model respectively fig 7b these results confirm that temperature based tcn and rf achieved a higher accuracy when predicting eto than the empirical method furthermore compared with rf tcn increased the r2 by 0 013 and decreased the rmse by 0 022 mm d indicating that the temperature based tcn model slightly outperformed rf the r2 and rmse values of all temperature based models in the second strategy are illustrated in fig 8 fig 8a shows that the r2 values of the tcn lstm dnn and rf model were 0 033 0 039 0 022 and 0 027 respectively and were substantially higher than that of mh in the second strategy respectively and the r2 of svm was statistically same as that of mh fig 8b shows that compared with the mh equation tcn and lstm significantly decreased the rmse by 0 069 and 0 079 mm d in the second strategy respectively and dnn rf and svm did not reduce rmse substantially indicating that tcn and lstm were better than dnn rf svm and mh models in estimating eto using temperature features in the second strategy above all the performances of those models in the second strategy reflect that when temperature features are given well trained tcn and lstm models can predict eto with an substantially higher accuracy than empirical models in other areas which have a similar climate to the sites wherein the tcn lstm and rf models were trained 3 2 results of radiation based models it can be seen from fig 9 that there was no significant difference in the r2 or rmse among m p and r models however the r2 of the r model was 0 014 and 0 019 higher and the rmse of the r model was 0 033 and 0 041 mm d lower than those of the m and p models respectively this result reflects that among the three radiation based empirical models the r model performed the best in general therefore in this study the performance of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm was only compared with r when radiation features were available the r2 values of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm were 0 052 0 052 0 075 0 055 and 0 042 higher than the r model respectively and the rmse values were 0 156 0 229 0 078 0 148 and 0 110 mm d lower respectively fig 9 this result indicates that radiation based dl and cml models all performed markedly better than radiation based empirical models in addition the r2 of lstm was significantly higher than that of tcn dnn and svm and slightly higher than that of rf and the rmse of lstm was substantially lower than that of dnn and svm and slightly lower than that of the tcn and rf model fig 9 indicating that the performance of lstm was significantly better than the dnn and svm model and slightly better than the rf and tcn model furthermore the accuracy of estimating eto with radiation features between the tcn and rf model was not significantly different at the p 0 05 probability level but numerically the average rmse of the tcn model was 0 08 mm d lower than that of the rf model above all when radiation features were given the lstm performed best the tcn second and the rf third for predicting eto in the northeast plain china for the second strategy the r2 and rmse values of all radiation based models are illustrated in fig 10 fig 10 shows that the r2 of the r model was 0 845 which was significantly lower than that of the tcn lstm dnn rf and svm model and the rmse of the r model was 0 722 mm d which was substantially higher than that of the tcn lstm dnn rf and svm model indicating that the well trained radiation based machine learning models outperformed the empirical methods in terms of estimating eto beyond areas wherein they were trained in addition the tcn and lstm model achieved the highest r2 0 917 and 0 905 respectively and lowest rmse 0 502 and 0 545 mm d respectively confirming that radiation based tcn and lstm predicted eto with a higher accuracy than dnn rf and svm did in the second strategy to conclude all five proposed dl and cml models can achieve a higher precision than empirical methods beyond the area in which they were trained and in these five models radiation based tcn and lstm performed the best 3 3 results of humidity based models fig 11 shows that the r2 of the rom model was 0 099 greater and the rmse was 0 210 mm d lesser than that of r model making the rom model better than the s model for predicting eto using humidity datasets therefore in this study the performance of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm was only compared with rom when humidity features were given the r2 values of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm were 0 100 0 077 0 083 0 093 and 0 091 higher than the rom model respectively and the rmse values were 0 246 0 189 0 193 0 223 and 0 217 mm d significantly lower respectively fig 11 this result indicates that humidity based dl and cml models performed better than radiation based empirical models on average the r2 values of rf and svm were 0 016 and 0 010 and 0 014 and 0 008 higher than those of lstm and dnn respectively and the rmse values were 0 034 and 0 031 mm d and 0 028 and 0 024 mm d lower respectively fig 11 this result confirms that the performances of rf and svm models were better than lstm and dnn when humidity features were available fig 11b also shows that the tcn model decreased the rmse by 0 023 and 0 029 mm d compared to the rf and svm model confirming that the tcn model outperformed the rf and svm model in predicting eto when humidity features were given above all all proposed humidity based machine models significantly outperformed the humidity based empirical models and among the dl and cml models the tcn model performed the best for the second strategy the r2 and rmse values of all humidity based models in the second strategy are shown in fig 12 from fig 12a one can see that the r2 values of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm were 0 906 0 890 0 905 0 902 and 0 899 in the second strategy respectively and were substantially higher than that of rom reflecting that the proposed dl and cml models fitted the dynamic of real eto better than the empirical humidity models fig 12b shows that the rmse of rom was substantially higher than those of the dl and cml models making humidity based dl and cml models better than empirical models in predicting eto beyond the area wherein dl and cml models were trained besides the rmse of the tcn model was 0 56 which was 0 054 0 023 0 026 and 0 03 mm d lower than those of lstm dnn rf and svm respectively this result reflects that humidity based tcn performed best in estimating eto above all when humidity features were available tcn lstm dnn rf and svm models could predict eto with a higher accuracy than empirical models beyond the area in which the tcn lstm dnn rf and svm models were trained especially the tcn model 4 discussion 4 1 performance of temperature based models the hargreaves method h is one of the most straightforward empirical formulas for calculating reference evapotranspiration and is widely used across the world due to its higher accuracy and low requirements for meteorological data allen et al 1998 in 2011 hu et al 2011 modified the h formula using the global optimization algorithm sce ua shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona in china then the modified hargreaves method mh obtained a better performance than the h method for calculating eto in china in this study the performance of mh with higher r2 and lower rmse values was better than the h equation this result agreed with the result obtained by feng et al 2016 who found that in a hilly area of sichuan province southeast china the precision of the mh equation in predicting eto was significantly higher than that of the h method in most studies the machine learning models increased the precision of calculating eto using temperature data wen et al 2015 gocic et al 2016 torres et al 2011 however in this study we found that temperature based lstm dnn and svm models did not improve the accuracy for estimating eto because the r2 and rmse values of them were almost the same statistically on the contrary feng et al 2016 reported that the dnn model had a better performance than the mh method tabari et al 2012 found that the results obtained with the svm models for eto estimation were better than those for empirical climate models ferreira et al 2019 also insisted that the temperature based dnn and svm with higher r2 and lower rmse values exhibited better performance when compared to h equations there are two explanations for this contrary result firstly in a sense the lower values of rmse or higher values of r2 cannot reflect that the dnn model performed better unless the lower value or higher value was significantly lower or higher nevertheless in those studies the authors tried to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and empirical models using the numerical value of r2 and rmse to measure the performance of models in one test dataset only secondly the performance of machine learning models varied widely by region chen et al 2020 although lstm dnn and svm did not perform significantly better than mh the performances of temperature based tcn and rf were markedly better than those of mh and temperature based tcn and slightly better than that of temperature based rf in this study similarly this result was obtained by feng et al 2017 who reported that temperature based rf performed well when modeling daily eto tcn performed slightly better than rf probably due to its causal and dilated convolutions bai et al 2018 this meant that tcn performed the best among the proposed deep learning models in predicting eto many studies on using machine learning models in modeling eto have included training and testing models in the same area so we do not know how they perform beyond the study area to solve this problem reis et al 2019 and ferreira et al 2019 grouped meteorological data from all stations and then used this pooled dataset to train models and test each station separately however in a sense this grouped meteorological data from all stations becomes a big weather station in which the datasets for training and testing are still from the same station therefore we still do not know anything about the performance of models beyond the meteorological station wherein they were trained in this study we applied the k means method to cluster all weather stations into two groups in each group we used one station to test models trained by the rest of the stations in this way meteorological data from each station were only used to test or train thus the performance of models beyond the training weather sites was obtained it is worth to note that in second strategy the training stations of those two groups were different 3 stations for first group and 11 stations for second group however in this study that may not affect the performance of proposed models there are two possible reasons 1 although the datasets for 3 stations were fewer than those from 11 stations for training deep learning models and classical machine models these two datasets were both enough because the layers of deep learning models were not too deep 2 to some extent more datasets result in better performance however in this study performances of all models were compared under the same conditions in this strategy temperature based tcn lstm and rf models exhibited markedly better performances for modeling eto 4 2 performance of radiation based models some researchers have reported that about 80 of the variation in eto can be explained by temperature and radiation priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 therefore radiation based empirical equations might achieve excellent performances for estimating eto in this study three radiation based empirical methods such as makkink ritchie and priestley taylor that are used widely feng et al 2016 tabari et al 2012 were selected to conduct a comparison with deep learning and classical machine learning models the results showed that all proposed radiation based deep learning and classical machine learning models were significantly better than the three radiation based empirical models similarly feng et al 2016 also reported that artificial neural networks ann had a higher precision for modeling eto than makkink ritchie and priestley taylor in sichuan province china wang 2019 evaluated the performance of dnn rf svm and three empirical equations makkink ritchie and priestley taylor method for predicting eto in shenyang liaoning province china and found that dnn rf and svm obtained a higher accuracy than empirical models the use of classical machine learning models such as ann rf and svm for estimating eto with limited weather features has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years and it has been found that classical machine learning models can perform better than empirical equations dou and yang 2018 yin et al 2017 feng et al 2017 however the dl models have scarcely been applied for estimating eto in this study we employed three typical and widely used deep learning models the tcn dnn and lstm model which have been proved to have a better performance in sequence tasks to model daily eto using radiation data the result showed that when radiation features were given the mean rmse of lstm was lower than that of dnn and svm and slightly lower than that of the tcn and rf model and the mean rmse of tcn was slightly lower than that of rf in general the reason for the better performance of the lstm and tcn model is probably that the inner structure of the lstm model meant that it could remember passing information and tcn s causal and dilated convolution layers also made it possible to remember previous information da silva et al 2019 bai et al 2018 chen et al 2020 shen 2018 in the second strategy in which the deep learning and classical machine learning model were trained and tested in different meteorological stations the precision of radiation based tcn lstm dnn rf and svm was significantly higher than that of empirical models for estimating eto this result indicates that radiation based deep learning models and classical machine learning models could perform better than empirical models beyond the weather stations in which they were trained it is worth mentioning that deep learning models tcn and lstm were better than classical learning machine models rf and svm in the second strategy 4 3 performance of humidity based models in this study the rmse of the humidity based rom equation was 0 190 lower than that of the humidity based s equation indicating that the accuracy of rom was higher than that of the s model ferreira et al 2019 also found a better performance of rom compared with s model it is worth mentioning that although compared with the temperature based equation the humidity based s model has one more weather feature input rh the performance of rom was only slightly better than that of the h and mh equations the performance of the s equation was even poorer than the performance of the h and mh equations similar results were obtained by kiafar et al 2017 who also found that compared with the s equation the h equation obtained higher precision in predicting eto the reason for this result was probably that the humidity based empirical formulas do not use extraterrestrial radiation as the input compared to the temperature based equations however for deep learning models and classical machine learning models adding rh as the input markedly improved the precision of estimating eto compared with temperature based deep learning models and classical machine learning models this result was like that obtained by ferreira et al 2019 who found that the precision of ann and svm models for modeling eto was improved by adding the humidity characteristic to the base of temperature characteristics it is reasonable that feeding more features to the machine learning models usually enhances their accuracy in predicting eto like the results of the radiation based machine learning models all humidity based deep learning and classical machine learning models achieved a significantly higher precision in estimating eto compared with humidity based empirical models it was proven that when the temperature characteristics and rh were given the tcn lstm dnn rf and svm also performed significantly better than conventional equations similarly ferreira et al 2019 also reported that humidity based ann and svm models outperformed empirical equations the results reinforce the superiority of dl and cml models for modeling eto compared with empirical equations corroborating the findings of kisi 2016 mehdizadeh 2018 and yamaç and todorovic 2020 among all applied humidity based deep learning models and classical machine learning models the humidity based tcn model had the lowest rmse and the highest r2 meaning that it performed the best this result might have been obtained because the ability of tcn to describe nonlinear relationships between weather and eto was stronger than in other models due to its reasonable inner structure in the second strategy the proposed models including humidity based tcn lstm dnn rf and svm also all outperformed the humidity based ordinary equations reinforcing that applied machine learning models can obtain a significantly higher precision when estimating eto using humidity characteristics beyond the area wherein they were trained similar to the first strategy the humidity based tcn model also achieved the highest r2 and the lowest rmse compared with other models above all the better performance of the proposed humidity based machine learning models in the second strategy demonstrated that the well trained humidity based machine learning models could be used in a new area with similar meteorological conditions which has barely been reported by previous studies 5 conclusions three typical deep learning models tcn dnn and lstm and two classical machine learning models rf and svm were proposed for estimating daily eto with incomplete meteorological data in the northeast plain china additionally two strategies were adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed models for predicting eto 1 proposed models were trained and tested in each weather station and 2 weather stations were split into several groups using the k means method with their mean climatic characteristics then in each group stations took turns testing the proposed models trained by the rest stations the conclusions showed that 1 in the first strategy temperature based tcn and rf significantly outperformed temperature based empirical methods and in the second strategy temperature based tcn lstm and rf models achieved a markedly higher accuracy in estimating eto than temperature based empirical methods 2 radiation based dl and cml models all performed markedly better than radiation based empirical models especially lstm and tcn in both strategies and 3 humidity based dl and cml models performed markedly better than humidity based empirical models especially tcn in both strategies above all when radiation or humidity datasets were available all proposed dl and cml models could estimate eto with a higher accuracy than calibrated empirical equations beyond the study areas in which they were trained however when temperature features were available only tcn and lstm model could predict eto with a higher accuracy than calibrated temperature based empirical equations beyond the study areas credit authorship contribution statement zhijun chen conceptualization methodology software writing

5046,to evaluate the performance of deep learning methods dl for reference evapotranspiration estimation and to assess the applicability of the developed dl models beyond the study areas where they were trained three popular dl models named deep neural network dnn temporal convolution neural network tcn and long short term memory neural network lstm were developed to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration eto using incomplete meteorological data in the northeast plain china the performances of the three dl models were compared to two classical machine learning models cml support vector machine svm and random forest rf and empirical equations including two temperature based hargreaves h and modified hargreaves mh three radiation based ritchie r priestley talor p and makkink m and two humidity based romanenko rom and schendel s empirical models in two strategies 1 all proposed models were trained tested and compared in each single weather station and 2 all weather stations were split into several groups using the k means method with their mean climatic characteristics then in each group stations took turns testing the proposed models which were trained by rest of the stations the results showed that 1 the coefficient of determination r2 values of the tcn and rf were 0 048 and 0 035 significantly higher than that of mh respectively and the relative root mean error rmse values of tcn and rf were substantially 0 096 and 0 074 mm d lower than that of mh indicating that tcn and rf performed better than empirical models in the first strategy and tcn and lstm exhibited an rmse that was significantly decreased by 0 069 and 0 079 mm d showing that tcn and lstm outperformed empirical models in the second strategy compared with the mh method 2 in both strategies compared with the ritchie r model tcn lstm dnn rf and svm increased r2 and decreased rmse significantly especially the tcn model 3 similarly tcn lstm dnn rf and svm models all augmented r2 and reduced rmse substantially in comparison to humidity based empirical models in both strategies especially the tcn model overall when temperature based features were available the tcn and lstm models performed markedly better than temperature based empirical models beyond the study areas and when radiation based or humidity based features were available all of the proposed dl and cml models outperformed radiation based or humidity based empirical equations beyond the study areas in which they were trained keywords reference evapotranspiration deep learning neural network temporal convolution neural network long short term memory neural network 1 introduction evapotranspiration et contains two processes evaporation from surfaces of soil and plants and transpiration from crops to the atmosphere it is essential for estimation of irrigation water requirements hydrological processes evaluation of agronomy systems etc shiri et al 2013 it is critical to predict et accurately to design irrigation plans and improve the water resource use efficiency ferreira et al 2019 the computing accuracy of et highly relies on reference evapotranspiration eto which is the evapotranspiration of a reference surface defined as a hypothetical grass with a uniform height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 allen et al 1998 improving the precision of the estimation of eto plays a vital role in computing et and therefore increasing the irrigation efficiency and agricultural water reuse feng et al 2016 shiri et al 2013 the fao 56 penman monteith pm based on the laws of energy balance and aerodynamics is the most commonly used method for computing eto and for the validation of the other eto approaches feng et al 2016 tabari et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 the pm method however requires many meteorological features such as the maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation which hinders its application especially in developing countries traore et al 2010 abdullah et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to explore a simpler model to estimate eto with a reasonable precision using fewer weather features to estimate reference crop evaporation with incomplete weather variables many researchers have embraced different empirical methods such as temperature based radiation based humidity based water budget based mass transfer based and pan based methods to compute eto among these models temperature based radiation based and humidity based models are frequently used to compute eto instead of the pm method when all meteorological features are not available priestley and taylor 1972 the temperature based hargreaves h and modified hargreaves mh method are commonly used to estimate eto because of their high precision and simplicity luo et al 2014 almorox et al 2015 evaluated the performance of 11 temperature based methods for estimating eto and found that the h method obtained the highest accuracy the radiation based models mainly include the priestley taylor pt markkink m and ritchie r equations feng et al 2016 assessed the performance of these three radiation based models for computing eto and showed that the accuracy of pt and r equations was higher than that of the m equation tabari et al 2012 also evaluated pt m r jensen haise and turc models for estimating eto and found that the performance of the r equation was the best among these models humidity based models like romanenko rom and schendel s equations are also models commonly used to calculate eto using humidity based weather features mehdizadeh et al 2017 djaman et al 2015 although some empirical models including h mh pt r rom and s equations exhibit an excellent performance for estimating eto their performance varied widely across regions djaman et al 2015 evaluated 16 empirical models for computing eto in which the complete weather data were not available and found that the empirical models were either overestimating or underestimating the eto therefore exploration and development improved models for estimating eto with a high precision using less meteorological data is needed in the last decades with the rapid development of computers computing ability and artificial intelligence theory computing eto using weather data has been considered a regression task that can be solved by some classical machine learning cml and deep learning dl models dou and yang 2018 kalteh 2016 abdullah et al 2015 assessed the extreme learning machine elm model for estimating eto and the results showed that the elm model had an excellent performance in modeling eto wen et al 2015 evaluated the support vector machine svm for predicting eto only by air temperature and radiation data and found that the performance of svm was better than that of the h and pt method many previous studies have demonstrated that machine learning like the artificial neural network ann svm elm and random forest rf can precisely predict eto and the performance of these classical machine learning models was better than that of empirical models szegedy et al 2013 kalteh 2016 karandish and šimůnek 2016 some previous studies have shown that svm and rf models could estimate eto with a higher accuracy than other cml models however svm and rf models have a relative shallow structure and do not capture temporal information fan et al 2018 saggi and jain 2019 feng et al 2017 in recent years deep learning models have been successfully applied in various domains and showed outstanding performances in both regression and classification problems bui et al 2020 lee et al 2020 kao et al 2020 typical deep learning models include the deep neural network dnn convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm wang et al 2020 compared the dnn models for subsurface flow forecasting and found that the performance of theory guided dnn better than that of traditional dnn model zhou et al 2017 proposed cnn models for tomato primary organ recognition and found that cnn models can precisely recognize the fruit flower and stem of the tomato in 2018 bai et al 2018 developed an improved convolutional network named temporal convolution network tcn compared with dnn and tcn models the lstm model has a chain like structure that can memory the past information and has an ability to deal with time series data zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 developed the lstm model to predict the dynamic of the water table depth in five sub areas of the hetao irrigation district in arid northwestern china the results showed that the lstm model achieved the best performance among the considered models above all dl models have achieved success in many domains however these models are rarely used in the domain of agriculture and hydrology let alone in predicting eto in addition almost all studies that adopted cml models to predict eto were testing the performance of these models for estimating eto in one test dataset alone which cannot show how good or bad machine learning models are therefore the performance of well trained machine learning models at a new meteorological station is not precise above all the specific aims of this study were 1 to develop three dl models dnn tnn and lstm and two classical machine learning models svm and rf for predicting eto in the northeast plain of china 2 to compare the performance of the three dl models with the two cml models and empirical equations in estimating eto with limited meteorological inputs and 3 to investigate their performance

2018 compared with the cnn model tcn model has two distinguishing characteristics namely causal convolutions and dilated convolutions enabling the tcn model to convincingly outperform some baseline recurrent neural networks in solving sequence problems in casual convolutions the output of time t was containing previous information eq 12 meaning that the tcn model can memory longer past information in dilated convolutions the receptive field is enlarged fig 2 making the tcn model capture broader range of inputs yu and koltun 2015 when the casual and dilated convolutions are considered the output of time t is expressed as eq 13 in this study two hidden layers were established and the kernel size was 2 besides the dilation factor for input layer first hidden layer and second hidden layer were 1 2 and 4 repectively fig 3 shows the data flow in tcn model with input of ra tmin tmax and tmean in additon the shape of input data of tcn model was samples 1 features the structres of the tcn models were built by the pytorch package in python 3 6 software 12 f t i 0 k 1 f i x t i 13 f t i 0 k 1 f i x t i d where f t is output of time t fi is filter xi is input of time i d is dilation factor k is the filter size deep neural network dnn model is a new type of a typical artificial neural network whose weights and bias were trained by error back propagation bp algorithm compared with conventional bp neural networks the dnn model has more hidden layers enabling it to obtain a powerful ability for dealing with regression and classification tasks in many industries however more hidden layers also brought a vital shortcoming gradient vanishing the relu eq 14 active function was adopted in this study to overcome this problem an example of the dnn model used in this study was illustrated in fig 4 the dnn model has two main processes feed forward process and error backpropagation process the feed forward process is expressed as eq 15 and the error backpropagation process update of weights and bias is calculated by eqs 16 and 17 in this study the shape of input of dnn model was samples features and the python 3 6 software and tensorflow 2 0 package were adopted to build the dnn model in which three hidden layers with 20 neurons were established and the learning rate was 0 005 14 relu s x x 0 0 x 0 15 e t op w 4 relu w 3 relu w 2 relu w 1

respectively e η and wij are error learning rate and weight of i layer and j neuron respectively long term and short term memory neural network lstm a new form of recurrent neural network rnn is illustrated in fig 5 a fig 5b explained how lstm calculated the eto through 365 time series data as has been done in this study this chain like structure enables the lstm model to remember the information of the past making the lstm model performs excellently when dealing with time series problems from fig 5a one can see that there are three gates including forgetting gate input gate and output gate inside the lstm model the forgetting gate is expressed as eq 18 in this gate the output ht 1 of step t 1 and input of step t xt is mapped between 0 and 1 by sigmoid active function deciding amount of information that is to be forgotten the input gate selects the useful information from the output ht 1 of step t 1 and input of step t xt to upgrade control parameters ct 1 of t 1 step the calculation process is expressed as eq 19 to eq 21 the output gate is mainly to calculate the output by eq 22 and eq 23 in this study the time step was 365 steps meaning that the output of t step was decided information of the previous 365 days and thus the dimension of input of lstm model was samples 365 features the lstm models were built by the tensorflow 2 0 package in python 3 6 software 18 f t sigmiod w f h t 1 u f x t b f 19 i t sigmiod w i h t 1 u i x t b i 20 c t tanh w c h t 1 u c x t b c 21 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 22 o t sigmoid w o h t 1 u o x t b o 23 h t o t tanh c t where sigmoid and tanh are activation functions ftct 1 and itc t are matrices that decide which information should be forgotten and which should be remembered respectively ct is a new control parameter for step t ot is the output without the forgetting matrix and ht is the final output of step t 2 2 4 classical machine learning models the random forest rf model is an ensemble learning model in which the base models are decision trees the decision tree is a non parametric learning method used for classification and regression the goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules if then else decision rules inferred from the data features the typical structure is illustrated in fig 6 a the key process of creating a decision tree is to determine feature 1 feature 2 and so on information gain shown in eq 24 to eq 25 is a common index employed to choose feature 1 to feature n details of the decision tree algorithm are given in zhou 2018 in this study the rf models were written by the scikit learn package in python 3 6 24 gain d a e n t d v 1 v d v d e n t d v 25 e n t d k 1 y p k log 2 p k where gain d a is the information gain of feature a ent d is the information entropy of subset d ent dv is the information entropy of subset dv dv and d are the number of subset dv and d respectively and pk is a probability of k classification in d subset support vector machine svm achieved an excellent performance in many classification and regression tasks tabari et al 2012 ferreira et al 2019 in fact the svm model is a linear classifier which is linear line to solve the nonlinear problems the kernel function was applied eq 26 26 y w φ x b where y is the output w is the weight matrix b is the bias and φ x is the kernel function which maps the input feature space into a high dimensional feature space in this study the radial basis function was used as a kernel function for the svm model the aim of svm is to maximize the distance from the support vectors to line wφ x b 0 eq 27 and to decrease the influence of data noise achieve a soft margin in eq 27 the maximization of the distance is equal to minimization of the wtw therefore the aim function of svm is written as eq 28 27 distance max w φ x b w t w 28 min 1 2 w 2 c ξ i y i w φ x b 0 29 l w b α ξ 1 2 w 2 c ξ i i 1 n α i y i w t φ x b 1 where distance is the distance from the support vectors to line wφ x b 0 w is the weight matrix c is a parameter obtained by training and ξi represents slacking variables the eq 28 can be solved by langrange multiplier method eq 29 details of the calculation for svm are given in suykens and vandewalle 1999 in this study the svm models were written by the scikit learn package in python 3 6 2 3 data management and the development of models in this study to evaluate the performance of the proposed empirical and machine learning models for estimating eto using limited meteorological data three scenarios were evaluated 1 temperature based models using the daily minimum tmin maximum tmax and average temperature tmean and extraterrestrial radiation ra four input weather features which were the same as the input features of temperature based empirical equations 2 humidity based models using tmin tmax tmean ra and relative humidity rh five input weather features which were the same as the input features of humidity based empirical equations and 3 radiation based models using tmin tmax tmean ra and solar radiation rs five input weather features which were the same as the input features of radiation based empirical equations additionally the performance of temperature based models was compared with that of temperature based empirical methods the performance of humidity based models was compared with that of humidity based empirical methods and the performance of radiation based models was compared with that of radiation based empirical methods to further evaluate the performance of machine learning models for predicting eto in some areas which were not used to train models two strategies were adopted 1 all machine models were trained and tested in each weather station and 2 all weather stations were split into groups using the k means method a conventional clustering algorithm with their mean climatic characteristics table 1 then in each group each station took turns testing the proposed models which trained by the rest of the stations in the first strategy considering that the performance of the proposed models in one test dataset could not evaluate which model was better the daily values of meteorological features were randomly split into five sub datasets then four subsets were used to train the model which was then tested on the fifth one after that the t test was adopted to evaluate whether the performances of the proposed models exhibited significant differences in the second strategy cluster one had 4 weather stations and cluster two included 12 weather stations table 1 in each cluster stations took turns testing the proposed models trained by the rest of the stations then the t test was adopted to evaluate whether the performances of the proposed models displayed significant differences the daily average values of tmax tmin rh ra rs and eto from 1951 to 2018 for each meteorological station were available in this study these features were used to group all weather stations by the k means algorithm which is a standard clustering method with the advantage of being fast and straightforward zhou and zhao 2013 the k means method aims to partition n objects into k distinct and non overlapping clusters with the result being that each object belongs to the closest group using the k means algorithm includes several main processes such as first specifying the number of clusters k and then assigning each object to precisely one of the k clusters using the euclidean distance considering that selecting k is far from simple the silhouette coefficient was adopted to evaluate which k was the best the relationship between k and the silhouette coefficient is illustrated in fig 6b it shows that two clusters with a silhouette coefficient of 0 52 was the best choice in this study the result of the k means algorithm is shown in table 1 which shows that baicheng tongliao chifeng and chaoyang belonged to cluster 1 and the others belonged to cluster 2 to reduce the impacts of the absolute scare of the data on precision of models in predicting eto the input variables tmin tmax tmean ra rs and rh in each station were compressed between 0 and 1 by following equation feng et al 2016 30 x input x 0 x min x max x min where x0 is the actual value xmin is the minimum value and xmax is the maximum value 2 4 model performance and assessment the accuracy of all models was judged by two widely used indexes including the relative root mean error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 which were calculated by the following equations 31 rmse i n p i o i 2 n 32 r 2 i 1 n o i o avg p i p avg i 1 n o i o avg i 1 n p i p avg where pi and pavg are the predicted and average predicted value of eto mm d respectively and oi and oavg are the observed and average observed value of eto mm d 3 results 3 1 results of temperature based models the performance of proposed models in the first strategy is illustrated in fig 7 as seen from fig 7 the mean r2 of mh was 0 013 higher than that of h and the rmse was 0 025 mm d lower these results indicate that the mh model outperformed the h model therefore in this study the performance of temperature based tcn lstm dnn rf and svm was only compared with mh fig 7 shows that there was no significant difference in the r2 or rmse among mh lstm dnn and svm models this result reflects that in this study the accuracy of lstm dnn and svm was statistically almost the same as that of temperature based empirical models fig 7 also illustrates that the mean r2 values of tcn and rf were 0 831 and 0 818 which were 0 048 and 0 035 higher than that of mh respectively fig 7a and the rmse of tcn and rf were 0 755 and 0 777 mm d respectively which were 0 096 and 0 074 mm d lower than that of the mh model respectively fig 7b these results confirm that temperature based tcn and rf achieved a higher accuracy when predicting eto than the empirical method furthermore compared with rf tcn increased the r2 by 0 013 and decreased the rmse by 0 022 mm d indicating that the temperature based tcn model slightly outperformed rf the r2 and rmse values of all temperature based models in the second strategy are illustrated in fig 8 fig 8a shows that the r2 values of the tcn lstm dnn and rf model were 0 033 0 039 0 022 and 0 027 respectively and were substantially higher than that of mh in the second strategy respectively and the r2 of svm was statistically same as that of mh fig 8b shows that compared with the mh equation tcn and lstm significantly decreased the rmse by 0 069 and 0 079 mm d in the second strategy respectively and dnn rf and svm did not reduce rmse substantially indicating that tcn and lstm were better than dnn rf svm and mh models in estimating eto using temperature features in the second strategy above all the performances of those models in the second strategy reflect that when temperature features are given well trained tcn and lstm models can predict eto with an substantially higher accuracy than empirical models in other areas which have a similar climate to the sites wherein the tcn lstm and rf models were trained 3 2 results of radiation based models it can be seen from fig 9 that there was no significant difference in the r2 or rmse among m p and r models however the r2 of the r model was 0 014 and 0 019 higher and the rmse of the r model was 0 033 and 0 041 mm d lower than those of the m and p models respectively this result reflects that among the three radiation based empirical models the r model performed the best in general therefore in this study the performance of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm was only compared with r when radiation features were available the r2 values of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm were 0 052 0 052 0 075 0 055 and 0 042 higher than the r model respectively and the rmse values were 0 156 0 229 0 078 0 148 and 0 110 mm d lower respectively fig 9 this result indicates that radiation based dl and cml models all performed markedly better than radiation based empirical models in addition the r2 of lstm was significantly higher than that of tcn dnn and svm and slightly higher than that of rf and the rmse of lstm was substantially lower than that of dnn and svm and slightly lower than that of the tcn and rf model fig 9 indicating that the performance of lstm was significantly better than the dnn and svm model and slightly better than the rf and tcn model furthermore the accuracy of estimating eto with radiation features between the tcn and rf model was not significantly different at the p 0 05 probability level but numerically the average rmse of the tcn model was 0 08 mm d lower than that of the rf model above all when radiation features were given the lstm performed best the tcn second and the rf third for predicting eto in the northeast plain china for the second strategy the r2 and rmse values of all radiation based models are illustrated in fig 10 fig 10 shows that the r2 of the r model was 0 845 which was significantly lower than that of the tcn lstm dnn rf and svm model and the rmse of the r model was 0 722 mm d which was substantially higher than that of the tcn lstm dnn rf and svm model indicating that the well trained radiation based machine learning models outperformed the empirical methods in terms of estimating eto beyond areas wherein they were trained in addition the tcn and lstm model achieved the highest r2 0 917 and 0 905 respectively and lowest rmse 0 502 and 0 545 mm d respectively confirming that radiation based tcn and lstm predicted eto with a higher accuracy than dnn rf and svm did in the second strategy to conclude all five proposed dl and cml models can achieve a higher precision than empirical methods beyond the area in which they were trained and in these five models radiation based tcn and lstm performed the best 3 3 results of humidity based models fig 11 shows that the r2 of the rom model was 0 099 greater and the rmse was 0 210 mm d lesser than that of r model making the rom model better than the s model for predicting eto using humidity datasets therefore in this study the performance of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm was only compared with rom when humidity features were given the r2 values of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm were 0 100 0 077 0 083 0 093 and 0 091 higher than the rom model respectively and the rmse values were 0 246 0 189 0 193 0 223 and 0 217 mm d significantly lower respectively fig 11 this result indicates that humidity based dl and cml models performed better than radiation based empirical models on average the r2 values of rf and svm were 0 016 and 0 010 and 0 014 and 0 008 higher than those of lstm and dnn respectively and the rmse values were 0 034 and 0 031 mm d and 0 028 and 0 024 mm d lower respectively fig 11 this result confirms that the performances of rf and svm models were better than lstm and dnn when humidity features were available fig 11b also shows that the tcn model decreased the rmse by 0 023 and 0 029 mm d compared to the rf and svm model confirming that the tcn model outperformed the rf and svm model in predicting eto when humidity features were given above all all proposed humidity based machine models significantly outperformed the humidity based empirical models and among the dl and cml models the tcn model performed the best for the second strategy the r2 and rmse values of all humidity based models in the second strategy are shown in fig 12 from fig 12a one can see that the r2 values of tcn lstm dnn rf and svm were 0 906 0 890 0 905 0 902 and 0 899 in the second strategy respectively and were substantially higher than that of rom reflecting that the proposed dl and cml models fitted the dynamic of real eto better than the empirical humidity models fig 12b shows that the rmse of rom was substantially higher than those of the dl and cml models making humidity based dl and cml models better than empirical models in predicting eto beyond the area wherein dl and cml models were trained besides the rmse of the tcn model was 0 56 which was 0 054 0 023 0 026 and 0 03 mm d lower than those of lstm dnn rf and svm respectively this result reflects that humidity based tcn performed best in estimating eto above all when humidity features were available tcn lstm dnn rf and svm models could predict eto with a higher accuracy than empirical models beyond the area in which the tcn lstm dnn rf and svm models were trained especially the tcn model 4 discussion 4 1 performance of temperature based models the hargreaves method h is one of the most straightforward empirical formulas for calculating reference evapotranspiration and is widely used across the world due to its higher accuracy and low requirements for meteorological data allen et al 1998 in 2011 hu et al 2011 modified the h formula using the global optimization algorithm sce ua shuffled complex evolution method developed at the university of arizona in china then the modified hargreaves method mh obtained a better performance than the h method for calculating eto in china in this study the performance of mh with higher r2 and lower rmse values was better than the h equation this result agreed with the result obtained by feng et al 2016 who found that in a hilly area of sichuan province southeast china the precision of the mh equation in predicting eto was significantly higher than that of the h method in most studies the machine learning models increased the precision of calculating eto using temperature data wen et al 2015 gocic et al 2016 torres et al 2011 however in this study we found that temperature based lstm dnn and svm models did not improve the accuracy for estimating eto because the r2 and rmse values of them were almost the same statistically on the contrary feng et al 2016 reported that the dnn model had a better performance than the mh method tabari et al 2012 found that the results obtained with the svm models for eto estimation were better than those for empirical climate models ferreira et al 2019 also insisted that the temperature based dnn and svm with higher r2 and lower rmse values exhibited better performance when compared to h equations there are two explanations for this contrary result firstly in a sense the lower values of rmse or higher values of r2 cannot reflect that the dnn model performed better unless the lower value or higher value was significantly lower or higher nevertheless in those studies the authors tried to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and empirical models using the numerical value of r2 and rmse to measure the performance of models in one test dataset only secondly the performance of machine learning models varied widely by region chen et al 2020 although lstm dnn and svm did not perform significantly better than mh the performances of temperature based tcn and rf were markedly better than those of mh and temperature based tcn and slightly better than that of temperature based rf in this study similarly this result was obtained by feng et al 2017 who reported that temperature based rf performed well when modeling daily eto tcn performed slightly better than rf probably due to its causal and dilated convolutions bai et al 2018 this meant that tcn performed the best among the proposed deep learning models in predicting eto many studies on using machine learning models in modeling eto have included training and testing models in the same area so we do not know how they perform beyond the study area to solve this problem reis et al 2019 and ferreira et al 2019 grouped meteorological data from all stations and then used this pooled dataset to train models and test each station separately however in a sense this grouped meteorological data from all stations becomes a big weather station in which the datasets for training and testing are still from the same station therefore we still do not know anything about the performance of models beyond the meteorological station wherein they were trained in this study we applied the k means method to cluster all weather stations into two groups in each group we used one station to test models trained by the rest of the stations in this way meteorological data from each station were only used to test or train thus the performance of models beyond the training weather sites was obtained it is worth to note that in second strategy the training stations of those two groups were different 3 stations for first group and 11 stations for second group however in this study that may not affect the performance of proposed models there are two possible reasons 1 although the datasets for 3 stations were fewer than those from 11 stations for training deep learning models and classical machine models these two datasets were both enough because the layers of deep learning models were not too deep 2 to some extent more datasets result in better performance however in this study performances of all models were compared under the same conditions in this strategy temperature based tcn lstm and rf models exhibited markedly better performances for modeling eto 4 2 performance of radiation based models some researchers have reported that about 80 of the variation in eto can be explained by temperature and radiation priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 therefore radiation based empirical equations might achieve excellent performances for estimating eto in this study three radiation based empirical methods such as makkink ritchie and priestley taylor that are used widely feng et al 2016 tabari et al 2012 were selected to conduct a comparison with deep learning and classical machine learning models the results showed that all proposed radiation based deep learning and classical machine learning models were significantly better than the three radiation based empirical models similarly feng et al 2016 also reported that artificial neural networks ann had a higher precision for modeling eto than makkink ritchie and priestley taylor in sichuan province china wang 2019 evaluated the performance of dnn rf svm and three empirical equations makkink ritchie and priestley taylor method for predicting eto in shenyang liaoning province china and found that dnn rf and svm obtained a higher accuracy than empirical models the use of classical machine learning models such as ann rf and svm for estimating eto with limited weather features has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years and it has been found that classical machine learning models can perform better than empirical equations dou and yang 2018 yin et al 2017 feng et al 2017 however the dl models have scarcely been applied for estimating eto in this study we employed three typical and widely used deep learning models the tcn dnn and lstm model which have been proved to have a better performance in sequence tasks to model daily eto using radiation data the result showed that when radiation features were given the mean rmse of lstm was lower than that of dnn and svm and slightly lower than that of the tcn and rf model and the mean rmse of tcn was slightly lower than that of rf in general the reason for the better performance of the lstm and tcn model is probably that the inner structure of the lstm model meant that it could remember passing information and tcn s causal and dilated convolution layers also made it possible to remember previous information da silva et al 2019 bai et al 2018 chen et al 2020 shen 2018 in the second strategy in which the deep learning and classical machine learning model were trained and tested in different meteorological stations the precision of radiation based tcn lstm dnn rf and svm was significantly higher than that of empirical models for estimating eto this result indicates that radiation based deep learning models and classical machine learning models could perform better than empirical models beyond the weather stations in which they were trained it is worth mentioning that deep learning models tcn and lstm were better than classical learning machine models rf and svm in the second strategy 4 3 performance of humidity based models in this study the rmse of the humidity based rom equation was 0 190 lower than that of the humidity based s equation indicating that the accuracy of rom was higher than that of the s model ferreira et al 2019 also found a better performance of rom compared with s model it is worth mentioning that although compared with the temperature based equation the humidity based s model has one more weather feature input rh the performance of rom was only slightly better than that of the h and mh equations the performance of the s equation was even poorer than the performance of the h and mh equations similar results were obtained by kiafar et al 2017 who also found that compared with the s equation the h equation obtained higher precision in predicting eto the reason for this result was probably that the humidity based empirical formulas do not use extraterrestrial radiation as the input compared to the temperature based equations however for deep learning models and classical machine learning models adding rh as the input markedly improved the precision of estimating eto compared with temperature based deep learning models and classical machine learning models this result was like that obtained by ferreira et al 2019 who found that the precision of ann and svm models for modeling eto was improved by adding the humidity characteristic to the base of temperature characteristics it is reasonable that feeding more features to the machine learning models usually enhances their accuracy in predicting eto like the results of the radiation based machine learning models all humidity based deep learning and classical machine learning models achieved a significantly higher precision in estimating eto compared with humidity based empirical models it was proven that when the temperature characteristics and rh were given the tcn lstm dnn rf and svm also performed significantly better than conventional equations similarly ferreira et al 2019 also reported that humidity based ann and svm models outperformed empirical equations the results reinforce the superiority of dl and cml models for modeling eto compared with empirical equations corroborating the findings of kisi 2016 mehdizadeh 2018 and yamaç and todorovic 2020 among all applied humidity based deep learning models and classical machine learning models the humidity based tcn model had the lowest rmse and the highest r2 meaning that it performed the best this result might have been obtained because the ability of tcn to describe nonlinear relationships between weather and eto was stronger than in other models due to its reasonable inner structure in the second strategy the proposed models including humidity based tcn lstm dnn rf and svm also all outperformed the humidity based ordinary equations reinforcing that applied machine learning models can obtain a significantly higher precision when estimating eto using humidity characteristics beyond the area wherein they were trained similar to the first strategy the humidity based tcn model also achieved the highest r2 and the lowest rmse compared with other models above all the better performance of the proposed humidity based machine learning models in the second strategy demonstrated that the well trained humidity based machine learning models could be used in a new area with similar meteorological conditions which has barely been reported by previous studies 5 conclusions three typical deep learning models tcn dnn and lstm and two classical machine learning models rf and svm were proposed for estimating daily eto with incomplete meteorological data in the northeast plain china additionally two strategies were adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed models for predicting eto 1 proposed models were trained and tested in each weather station and 2 weather stations were split into several groups using the k means method with their mean climatic characteristics then in each group stations took turns testing the proposed models trained by the rest stations the conclusions showed that 1 in the first strategy temperature based tcn and rf significantly outperformed temperature based empirical methods and in the second strategy temperature based tcn lstm and rf models achieved a markedly higher accuracy in estimating eto than temperature based empirical methods 2 radiation based dl and cml models all performed markedly better than radiation based empirical models especially lstm and tcn in both strategies and 3 humidity based dl and cml models performed markedly better than humidity based empirical models especially tcn in both strategies above all when radiation or humidity datasets were available all proposed dl and cml models could estimate eto with a higher accuracy than calibrated empirical equations beyond the study areas in which they were trained however when temperature features were available only tcn and lstm model could predict eto with a higher accuracy than calibrated temperature based empirical equations beyond the study areas credit authorship contribution statement zhijun chen conceptualization methodology software writing

5047,meteorological drought propagating to hydrological drought usually occurs with a noticeable time delay due to the catchment buffering effect knowledge gain in the delayed hydrological response is indispensable for developing timely drought monitoring systems in this study a two stage statistical framework is proposed for identifying the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts at a weekly resolution candidate response time is initially selected by exclusively evaluating linear or nonlinear correlations between precipitation and streamflow anomalies in the second stage the optimal response time is determined at which the greatest number of streamflow deficits can be monitored by concurrent precipitation deficits a case study is conducted for the wei river basin of the loess plateau china to investigate the spatio temporal variability in drought response time under a changing environment results indicate that hydrological droughts respond to meteorological droughts with time lags of 25 39 weeks exhibiting noticeable spatial variability the long time hydrological response is expected where there are sufficient vegetation and loess deposits drought response time identification for each calendar month reveals the long term and short term hydrological response in winter and summer respectively a time varying baseflow index is found to be positively related to the drought response time therefore having control on its marked seasonality in a changing environment summer hydrological droughts tend to respond to precipitation variability at longer time scales while decreasing response time is noticed in winter a preliminary attribution analysis highlights that changes in meteorological drought severity and catchment water storage in combination exert control on the temporal variability in drought response time over the past half century findings of the study may favor hydrological drought monitoring dependent on precipitation

natural hazards which are typically defined as sustained periods of the major decline in usable water resources including precipitation soil moisture streamflow groundwater and reservoir storage apurv et al 2017 redmond 2002 droughts likely to trigger crop losses leng and hall 2018 wildfire westerling et al 2006 ecosystem degradation assal et al 2016 and conflicts between diverse water users gleick 2014 von uexkull et al 2016 have widespread impacts on many aspects of natural and human systems typically drought events are grouped into four categories namely meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts based on compartments of the hydrological cycle and sectors of human activity affected mishra et al 2015 it has been observed the close linkage between various types of droughts wilhite 2000 meteorological droughts characterized by precipitation deficits often act as the onset of agricultural and hydrological droughts which are separately quantified as the below normal availability of soil moisture and streamflow huang et al 2017 peters et al 2006 when water supply from natural river courses or man made impounding facilities is insufficient to satisfy the demand of human society hydrological droughts develop into socio economic droughts subsequently mehran et al 2015 the transition from one type of droughts to another is referred to as drought propagation apurv et al 2017 which has become a hot topic in the hydrological community during recent two decades guo et al 2020 heudorfer and stahl 2017 huang et al 2015 van lanen 2006 van loon et al 2012 wu et al 2018 understanding drought propagation mechanisms with the current study particularly focusing on the propagation from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts is a significant foundation for the improved skills in drought monitoring and early warning further benefiting the reduced vulnerability of the human community to drought hazards wang et al 2016 previous efforts have revealed that drought propagation through a hydrological system has several features in common which are the pooling attenuation lagging and lengthening van loon et al 2012 yang et al 2017 the pooling phenomenon in the drought propagation is that consecutive meteorological droughts collectively merge into a single agricultural or hydrological drought minor meteorological droughts can be attenuated when high catchment storage is available at the very beginning of precipitation deficits there widely exist time lags between the occurrence of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts in addition droughts usually get increasingly longer duration when evolving from atmospheric precipitation to agricultural soil moisture to hydrological streamflow droughts important features aforementioned are a result of the role of various hydro meteorological processes such as the infiltration evapotranspiration and aquifer recharge and discharge in drought propagation herrera estrada et al 2017 consequently a combination of climatic the rainfall pattern and snowmelt and catchment the topography geology soil type and vegetation coverage properties as influential factors of relevant hydro meteorological processes can simultaneously impose control over drought propagation which has been investigated by an ensemble of studies barker et al 2016 haslinger et al 2014 lorenzolacruz et al 2013 peters et al 2003 van loon 2015 with the aid of modeling experiments apurv et al 2017 further identified three drought propagation mechanisms under diverse climates by controlling key climate factors precipitation seasonality climate aridity and the timing of precipitation with respect to potential evapotranspiration that impact drought propagation processes methods for drought propagation analysis are broadly classified into the model simulation and statistical approaches in the former approach the hydrological response to meteorological droughts is analyzed using physically based models assumed to provide a valid representation of associated hydrological processes yu et al 1999 however the modeling method involves the labor intensive calibration process and is typically applied to the site specific analysis van loon et al 2012 also reported that the use of models at larger regional or global spatial scales are challenged by the difficulty in properly representing the time lag effect in drought propagation in comparison the statistical approach with less assumption is easier to be used at diverse spatial extent provided the availability of long term and reliable observations of atmospheric and hydrological variables as an important feature of drought propagation the time lag effect has been receiving growing attention folland et al 2015 huang et al 2015 laizé and hannah 2010 the time lag between meteorological and hydrological droughts arises to a large extent from the soil buffering as well as the slow aquifer recharge discharge processes these hydrological processes can modulate climate variability signals propagating along a terrestrial hydrological system determining that the streamflow responds to precipitation anomalies with an observable time delay and changes at relatively lower frequencies barker et al 2016 laizé and hannah 2010 drought response time is a useful indicator for quantifying the time lag effect in the drought propagation drought response at long time scales is commonly interpreted as the strong catchment resistance to hydrological droughts in the case of the occurrence of meteorological droughts conversely the prompt response is typically related to the low catchment resistance knowledge about the drought response time has important implications for hydrological drought identification and early warning therefore the current study is directed to a more specific investigation into the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts aiming to improve our understanding of drought propagation mechanisms earlier efforts are accustomed to characterizing drought conditions by means of standardized drought indices e g the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized streamflow index ssi for meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 vicente serrano et al 2012 xu et al 2015 case studies in contrasting catchments of the uk austria spain china and the american continent barker et al 2016 haslinger et al 2014 lorenzolacruz et al 2013 ma et al 2019 oertel et al 2018 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 utilized the pearson correlation coefficient to measure the spi ssi dependence and determined the appropriate time scale of the spi which was best correlated with the 1 month ssi series as the response time of hydrological droughts to cumulated precipitation deficits in drought propagation analysis the spi and ssi are typically calculated at the monthly scale peña gallardo et al 2019 tijdeman et al 2018a this yields the drought response time also having the monthly resolution barker et al 2016 gevaert et al 2018 lorenzolacruz et al 2013 however a major concern arises that spatio temporal changes in hydrological response time are insufficient to be detectable at a relatively coarse i e the monthly temporal resolution to bridge the gap the standardized drought indices at multiple weekly scales are introduced into drought propagation analysis for the first time to improve the drought response time to a finer temporal resolution such efforts favor the accurate representation of the difference in drought response time over a large spatial and temporal scale both linear and nonlinear relationships are noticed in drought propagation processes van loon and laaha 2015 for instance meteorological droughts with the significant deficit volume tend to trigger severe hydrological droughts which represents a generally linear propagation pattern in terms of the drought deficit volume increasing studies are now noting the nonlinear reaction of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts heudorfer and stahl 2017 van loon and laaha 2015 wang et al 2016 cases of the nonlinear response are that a series of minor meteorological droughts can evolve into a severe hydrological drought while the attenuation of meteorological droughts may sometimes occur as a result of the high catchment storage available wong et al 2013 wu et al 2017 found in a catchment of southeast china that a logarithmic function instead of a linear form was more appropriate in modeling the close link between meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics i e the duration and magnitude wong et al 2013 further revealed in three european catchments that hydrological drought characteristics were not linearly dependent on preceding meteorological droughts and therefore the copula function was employed to describe their nonlinear dependence structure however previous studies on the drought response time identification were accustomed to exclusively examining the linear correlation but overlooking the nonlinear dependence of diverse droughts haslinger et al 2014 huang et al 2017 lorenzolacruz et al 2013 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 currently the mutual information based on the entropy theory becomes an increasingly popular metric of nonlinear correlations between two random variables fang et al 2018 fernando et al 2009 kinney and atwal 2014 may et al 2008 quilty et al 2016 therefore in order to derive the more accurate drought response time this study utilizes the pearson correlation and mutual information which enable linear and nonlinear relationships jointly taken into consideration in addition the global climate and land cover governing the drought propagation process are undergoing perceivable changes knowledge gap still exists regarding how and to what extent hydrological droughts respond to their causal meteorological droughts in a different way as a result of a changing environment it is a topic that remains understudied to this end the current study investigates dynamics of drought response time as well as their dominant drivers therefore new insights into the response of drought propagation behaviors to a changing environment can be acquired which is essential to the development of the updated drought monitoring systems this study is motivated to explore the drought propagation mechanism with the special focus on one of its significant features the time lag effect the drought response time is utilized as a quantitative indicator of the time lag effect detailed objectives are to 1 develop a two stage statistical framework for drought response time identification which jointly evaluates the linear and nonlinear relationships in drought propagation 2 improve the identified drought response time to a finer temporal resolution by using the standardized drought indices at multiple weekly scales and 3 detect the evolution of drought response time in a changing environment and conduct a preliminary attribution analysis results of the study may increase our knowledge of the drought propagation mechanism and further benefit the hydrological drought monitoring dependent on precipitation deficit information available at larger spatial extent 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the loess plateau lp fig 1 a with a highly fragmented landform covers an area of 640 000 square kilometers 33 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e of northwest china yang et al 2012 the plateau intensively influenced by the monsoon has semiarid and sub humid climates centuries of massive human activities including deforestation over grazing unsustainable agricultural practices and warfare have resulted in the degraded ecosystems and sparse vegetation coverage lü et al 2012 in the case of intense precipitation surface flow can take place rapidly as a direct consequence of less precipitation being intercepted by the sparse vegetation subsequently only a limited amount of atmospheric water infiltrates deeper to replenish the soil moisture content and recharge the groundwater given unfavorable conditions of catchment storage streamflow droughts tend to occur in response to antecedent precipitation deficits persisting for a sustained time period which is in agreement with historical records liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 as water resources available have been major constraints on economic growth and ecological restoration of the relatively arid lp it is of practical importance to explicate the drought propagation mechanism towards the timely drought preparedness the wei river basin wrb fig 1 b is a typical region located at the southern edge of the loess plateau as it consists of all three characteristic topography of the plateau the stony mountains hills and valley plains the wei river with a length of 818 km flows from the west to the east and drains an area of 134 800 square kilometers the annual precipitation in the wrb as shown in fig 1 c forms a spatial gradient from the southeast 900 mm to the northwest 300 mm most precipitation accounting for 63 2 of the annual total occurs between july and october in the form of thunderstorms given the high variability in climate and topography the wrb is subsequently divided into five sub regions for ease of analysis which are depicted in fig 1 b table 1 summarizes the climatic and catchment characteristics of five sub regions it is noted the dissimilar climates as well as the remarkable difference in topography land cover and vegetation status which jointly give rise to contrasting response patterns of hydrological systems to meteorological droughts across the wrb the upper reach of the wrb uwb is characterized by stony mountains and hills the jing river basin jrb and the beiluo river basin brb in the northern proportion of the wrb are characterized by loess hills the dominant landform of the loess plateau the middle and lower reaches of the wrb mwb and lwb are alluvial plains at the lower elevations loess is deposited up to 180 m in the western and northern parts i e the uwb the jrb and brb in comparison the mwb and lwb have shallow loess deposits mainly due to the river cutting through the loess profile even to the position of the bedrock a recent study by zhu et al 2018 provides a loess thickness map of the lp at a high spatial resolution of 100 m 100 m interested readers can refer to the high resolution map for the site specific information about soil layer depth across the wrb land cover of the wrb fig 1 d gradually varies from the broadleaf deciduous forest and cropland in the southern part to the steppe at the northernmost edge sun et al 2014 vegetation status fig 1 e monitored using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi indicates the highest coverage in the mwb ndvimean 0 577 which is followed by the lwb ndvimean 0 498 almost the equivalent values of the mean monthly ndvi is observed in the uwb and brb in comparison the lowest vegetation coverage is found in the jrb ndvimean 0 326 2 2 data description precipitation and streamflow records as well as relevant explanatory variables are used for the drought response time identification and attribution analysis daily precipitation observations at 22 gauging stations fig 1 c within or adjacent to the wrb are retrieved from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn data cdcindex cid 6d1b5efbdcbf9a58 html over the period from 1960 to 2010 daily precipitation observations are required to calculate the spi at multiple weekly scales ranging from 4 to 105 weeks which is indispensable for deriving the drought response time at a high temporal resolution additionally in situ streamflow observations at five gauges namely linjiacun xianyang huanxian zhuangjiashan and zhuangtou are acquired from the hydrology and water resource survey bureau of shaanxi province over the same analysis period additionally water fluxes mainly the evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater storage and a remotely sensed vegetation status indicator in close association of streamflow generation are utilized in an attempt to explain spatiotemporal variations of the drought response time from perspectives of climatic and catchment properties daily soil moisture at top 2 m of soil layer direct

standardized drought indices the use of standardized drought indices has been increasingly witnessed in the hydrological community for drought monitoring bazrafshan et al 2014 risk analysis dai et al 2020 and impact assessment madadgar et al 2017 primary due to the simplicity standardized nature and flexibility of use in time and space farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 in this study meteorological and hydrological droughts are of high interest and characterized by the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized streamflow index ssi respectively for the meteorological drought characterization the spi initially proposed by mckee et al 1993 is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo it measures the departure of the precipitation accumulation from the long term mean the procedure for the spi calculation is detailed as follows step 1 precipitation observations are aggregated at a user defined time scale step 2 a probability distribution function usually a gamma distribution shown in eq 1 is fitted to the aggregated precipitation series for each calendar month independently 1 g x 0 x g x d x 1 β α γ α 0 x x α 1 e x β d x γ α 0 y α 1 e y d y estimates of distribution parameters are derived using the maximum likelihood method and given by 2 α 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 β x α a ln x ln x n in which x is the mean of precipitation observations given that the gamma distribution is invalid for x 0 and there can be zero values in the aggregated precipitation series the cumulative probability of precipitation g x is modified to be h x 3 h x 1 q g x q step 3 an equiprobability transformation is performed which converts the skewed precipitation accumulation into a normally distributed variable with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one the spi formula is given by 4 spi t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 0 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 when 0 h x 0 5 t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 0 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 when 0 5 h x 1 5 t ln 1 h x 2 when 0 h x 0 5 ln 1 1 h x 2 when 0 5 h x 1 in which c 0 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 and d 3 are parameters equivalent to 2 515517 0 802853 0 010328 1 432788 0 189269 and 0 001308 respectively it is the last step that makes the spi comparable temporally and spatially in light of the popularity of the spi in drought studies the standardization principles are also applied to hydrological variables such as the soil moisture groundwater and streamflow resulting in a family of standardized indices for monitoring diverse droughts in the hydrological cycle aghakouchak 2014 barker et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2012 in this study the ssi based on streamflow observations is employed for the hydrological drought characterization note that the ssi differs from the spi in the type of probability distributions for fitting the accumulated data however no consensus can be easily achieved on a widely accepted distribution function suitable for the highly skewed streamflow herein the log normal distribution is adopted for the ssi calculation due to its favorable performance in similar catchments in northwest china gao and zhang 2016 xiong et al 2015 the probability density function of the log normal distribution is shown in eq 6 6 f x 1 2 π σ 2 1 x exp ln x μ 2 2 σ 2 major advantages of standardized drought indices include the ease of calculation the low data requirement and the multi scalar characteristic the multi scalar characteristic implies that drought indices can be flexibly calculated at multiple time scales to monitor precipitation variability over contrasting accumulation periods shi et al 2020 since the time taken for precipitation anomalies to propagate into diverse water resources differs considerably the time scale at which the precipitation deficits accumulate distinguishes types of droughts mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 therefore the monthly ssi is related to the spi at varying time scales to recognize the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts in this study inspired by the work by wang et al 2011 we utilize the spi at multiple weekly scales from 4 to 105 weeks in order to identify the drought response time at a high temporal also the weekly resolution for more complete spi and ssi description interested readers are referred to mckee et al 1993 and shukla and wood 2008 the spi and ssi series are calculated using the sci package in r project stagge et al 2015 3 2 mutual information the pearson correlation coefficient is a dependence metric extensively utilized in diverse hydrological studies abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 hatt et al 2009 prathumratana et al 2008 the corresponding formula is given as follows 7 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x and y are two random variables n represents the sample size and x i y i is the i th pair wise sample the use of the pearson correlation coefficient requires a fundamental assumption that random variables under investigation are linearly dependent however the assumption regarding the inherently linear dependence is often challenged in the hydrological system which is also the same case in the drought propagation processes since a number of time varying climatic precipitation temperature etc and catchment mainly the vegetation coverage and land use characteristics can control the drought propagation in both of isolated and interactive ways yang et al 2017 therefore the pearson correlation analysis may be not well suitable for dealing with some highly nonlinear relationships existing in hydrological system for the current study ignoring the nonlinear dependence of the ssi on the spi tends to derive the inaccurate drought response time the limitation of the linear correlation analysis has motivated the development of an alternative dependence metric the mutual information mi which is effective in detecting the nonlinear and chaotic dependence fraser and swinney 1986 the mutual information is rooted in the information and entropy theories and also referred to as the transinformation ebeling et al 1995 and the relative entropy vedral 2002 in earlier literature the formula is given below 8 i xy f xy x y log f xy x y f x x f y y d x d y where i xy denotes the mi between two random variables and f xy x y is the joint probability density function pdf with marginals f x x and f y y from a perspective of information theory the i xy is interpreted as the reduced uncertainty or information again regarding y due to the knowledge of x by definition in eq 8 the mutual information evaluates the kullback leibler distance of the joint distribution f xy x y from the distribution f x x f y y denoting a case when two variables are independent granger and lin 1994 maes et al 1997 if two random variables are not correlated the joint distribution f xy x y will theoretically equal the product of two marginals f x x f y y generating an mi score of zero in contrast the strong correlation will produce a high value of the mi score therefore it is reasonable to regard the mi as a reliable indicator of the presence of dependence in a practical context the mi is defined for discrete variables by replacing integrals with sums which is presented as follows fang et al 2018 9 i xy x y p xy x y log p xy x y p x x p y y where p x x p y y and p xy x y are the estimated marginal and joint pdfs commonly used techniques for the pdf estimation include the crude histogram and the non parametric kernel density estimator sharma 2000 the mi as shown in eq 9 is clearly based only on the probability distributions derived from the sample set no assumption about the dependence structure is involved which enables the mi to evaluate the more generalized including the nonlinear dependence of two random variables the other advantage over the linear correlation metric is the robustness of the mi since it is insensitive to the noise and data transformation in this study the mi between the spi and ssi series is calculated using the infotheo package for r more details can be found in battiti 1994 and may et al 2008 3 3 a two stage statistical framework for drought response time identification in line with earlier efforts barker et al 2016 haslinger et al 2014 huang et al 2015 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 the current study makes use of the multi scalar characteristic of the spi a spi time scale capable of yielding the highest spi ssi correlation is defined as the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts such definition in essence is based on the notion that the development i e the onset peak severity and termination of hydrological droughts is responsive to the persistence of meteorological drought conditions quantified using the precipitation deficit accumulation over a prolonged period of time instead of merely the response to the specific timing mainly the onset peak severity and termination of antecedent meteorological droughts thereby hydrological drought response time derived here highlights the cumulative effects of meteorological droughts the definition is widely adopted by an ensemble of previous studies on drought propagation dash et al 2019 gevaert et al 2018 ma et al 2019 oertel et al 2018 van loon et al 2011 following the definition aforementioned a simple two stage framework is proposed for identifying the drought response time which is capable of dealing with the linear and nonlinear dependence of streamflow droughts on meteorological droughts by means of the pearson correlation and mutual information analysis its main components are depicted in fig 2 the use of the framework follows a procedure described below step 1 drought characterization daily precipitation observations are aggregated over multiple accumulation periods and standardized to yield the spi series for the meteorological drought characterization time periods over which precipitation observations are accumulated distinguish the time scales of the spi in the current study the spi time scales varying from 4 to 105 weeks are of particular interest which are equivalent to 1 24 months on a monthly basis hereafter for example the spi series at a 4 week scale is abbreviated as the spi 4 additionally the 1 month ssi series for hydrological drought characterization is derived from the streamflow observations following the same standardization principle note that if 3 month 6 month and 12 month hydrological droughts are of concern by decision makers the 1 month ssi can be flexibly replaced with the ssi at 3 month 6 month and 12 month scales thereby providing an opportunity to analyze how meteorological droughts propagate into the increasingly long term hydrological droughts step 2 dependence measurement the 1 month ssi is cross correlated with the spi at multiple time scales changing from 4 to 105 weeks to assess the extent to which streamflow anomalies are dependent upon precipitation variations according to the definition provided by the world meteorological organization svoboda et al 2012 the time scale of a drought index refers to a moving time window over which precipitation or streamflow observations are accumulated to yield their composite values that are subsequently standardized for characterizing dryness and wetness changes fig 3 illustrates how to pair the spi and ssi at contrasting time scales in each calendar month which is a critical step deserving necessary clarifications for brevity the pairing process is only exemplified for june it is observed that no matter how the time scale of drought indices varies as the user designates the spi and ssi at the end of june have the same termination date i e june 30th the only difference consists in the length of the time window determining the number of days used for calculating composite values of precipitation or streamflow therefore as fig 3 depicts the ssi series at a 1 month scale in combination with the spi series at diverse weekly scales can be simultaneously derived for june afterwards the 1 month ssi is sequentially matched with the spi at contrasting time scales varying from 4 to 105 weeks and the degree of the pair wise spi ssi dependence is evaluated two types of dependence metrics are adopted which are the pearson correlation coefficient and the mi score the former one is good at modeling the linear relationship given that hydrological droughts may respond to meteorological droughts in a nonlinear manner the mi analysis is further performed to detect the possible nonlinear linkage between two types of droughts time scales over which the spi are the most correlated with the 1 month ssi are identified as the candidate drought response time they are separately the spi p and spi q in terms of the maximum pearson correlation and the mi score as shown in fig 2 this step differs from many previous studies in the further use of the spi at diverse weekly scales and the mutual information in an attempt to accurately identify the drought response time at an improved temporal resolution step 3 drought deficit monitoring the candidate drought response time is derived by assessing the spi ssi relationship they are the p week and q week scales of the spi acquired through the pearson correlation and mi analysis respectively this step proposes a useful metric further assisting in screening out the optimal one given that the spi ssi relationship indicates the generalized linkage between precipitation anomalies and streamflow anomalies it implies that water surplus in addition to water deficits is jointly considered however efforts to recognize the drought response time is motivated by the practical requirement for drought monitoring thereby highlighting that the specific focus ought to be laid on deficit aspect of usable water resources in such a context drought response time identified is considered appropriate only when as many as streamflow deficits can be synchronously monitored by the precipitation deficit accumulation hence it is reasonable to further determine the optimal response time by comparing the effectiveness of diverse candidates in monitoring the greatest number of streamflow deficits as shown detailly in fig 3 the 1 month ssi as well as the spi at p week and q week scales are calculated at the end of individual calendar month resulting in that the ssi and spi series have the equivalent length and can be paired month by month herein a metric developed for identifying the optimal response time is defined to be the total number of streamflow deficits quantified as ssi 0 that can be monitored by the concurrent shortage of precipitation accumulation quantified as spi 0 the metrics are denoted as sd s p i p and sd s p i q when the candidate response time namely the p week and q week scales of the spi derived from the pearson correlation and mutual information analysis is separately under investigation step 4 response time determination as shown in eq 10 finally determine the candidate response time which is associated with the maximum co occurrence of streamflow deficits and accumulated precipitation deficits to be the optimal drought response time in the study deficits of precipitation and streamflow can be identified when the spi and ssi values fall below zero the spi and ssi thresholds utilized to screen out water deficits coincide with those adopted by a number of earlier studies patel et al 2007 tan et al 2019 uddameri et al 2019 van oel et al 2018 10 arg max p q s d spi p s d spi q a simple two stage strategy is applied in the search for the drought response time initially the correlation analysis is conducted to ensure that the precipitation anomalies accumulated over the candidate response time can have a close association with streamflow anomalies in the second stage particular attention is paid to the dependence of streamflow deficits on precipitation deficits the co occurrence of precipitation and streamflow deficits is used as a supplementary criterion to further screen out the optimal response time which aims to more effectively monitor hydrological droughts depending on the precipitation deficit information 3 4 baseflow separation the baseflow component is separated from the streamflow hydrograph to attribute changes in drought response time herein a recursive digital filtering rdf method is utilized which is embedded in the hysep an automated baseflow separation tool developed by the united states geological survey usgs sloto and crouse 1996 the usgs hysep is widely used bosch et al 2017 and is employed in the study given its favorable performance reported in the hailiutu river which is adjacent to our study site in the loess plateau zhou et al 2013 the use of the hysep initially requires estimating the duration of surface runoff depending on an empirical formula 11 n a 0 2 the interval 2 n applied to the baseflow separation is an odd integer which is in the range of 3 11 and nearest to 2 n subsequently a local minimum method is utilized to identify the minimum flow during an interval the hysep also provides two rdf based alternative techniques including the fixed interval and sliding interval the local minimum method sequentially examines whether the daily streamflow value is the lowest in half the interval minus one day 0 5 2 n 1 before and after the day under investigation if so a local minimum is screened out and connected by a straight line with the nearest local minimum the baseflow in each day between two local minimums is determined using the linear interpolation algorithm furthermore the baseflow index bfi is calculated as the ratio of baseflow to the total streamflow usually on a monthly or annual basis 4 result analysis and discussion 4 1 drought propagation features in the wrb prior to proceeding to the drought response time identification it is essential to first take an overview of the drought propagation behavior in the study area and evaluate the usefulness of standardized drought indices for drought propagation analysis fig 4 indicates the 4 week spi and the 1 month ssi series of the whole wrb over the past five decades although the spi and ssi time scales are slightly different almost the equivalent number of daily observations of precipitation or streamflow are accumulated to derive the specific values of drought indicators a threshold of 1 is used to identify the drought occurrence presence and the termination from the time varying spi and ssi series livada and assimakopoulos 2007 modarres 2007 meteorological and hydrological droughts screened out are depicted in the central part of fig 4 some major droughts are observed to occur in 1978 1980 1995 1997 and 1999 which are in good agreement with the historical records archived at the drought hazard database of china http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode disa dro dis chn html over the period 1962 2010 a total of 80 meteorological droughts and 46 hydrological droughts were identified based on the spi and ssi series thereby highlighting the necessity of investigating the frequent drought hazards in the wrb the number of meteorological droughts was nearly twice as high as that of hydrological droughts the reason for the phenomenon is that streamflow response to precipitation anomalies results from the passage of infiltrated water across several subsurface filters that play a significant role in attenuating the precipitation variation modes shun and duffy 1999 streamflow as an output of the terrestrial hydrological system therefore fluctuates at a relatively lower rate relative to the input signal the precipitation finally giving rise to the diminished number of drought events when propagating from the atmosphere into the hydrological cycle markovic and koch 2015 the average duration was 1 2 and 2 1 months for meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively in terms of the average severity meteorological droughts 0 73 were less severe than hydrological ones 1 17 therefore drought statistics indicate that droughts evolving from the meteorological to hydrological segments in the wrb become less frequent but have longer duration and intensified severity according to a study by apurv et al 2017 the drought propagation in the wrb can be classified as the type 2 propagation mechanism which produces longer hydrological droughts relative to meteorological droughts it is reported that the type 2 propagation mechanism exclusively develops where there are relatively arid climates and precipitation in phase with the potential evapotranspiration it is just in line with the climatic characteristics of the study site the use of standardized drought indices helps to reveal drought propagation features in the wrb which include the pooling attenuation lagging and lengthening and are highlighted in fig 4 a striking phenomenon of the drought pooling was observed in 1997 in which a series of consecutive meteorological droughts penetrated into the terrestrial hydrological system and eventually came into being a hydrological drought having the most negative impacts over the period 1962 2010 it was the same case in 1999 by comparison a meteorological drought with the severity of nearly 4 in 1968 as shown in fig 4 was attenuated possibly as a result of the high storage in the aquifer the years of 2001 and 2002 exemplified that hydrological droughts had obviously prolonged duration relative to the antecedent meteorological droughts with respect to the time lag effect which is central to the current study it was noticed the perceivable time delay between hydrological and meteorological droughts more precisely expressed as the time interval between onsets of two types of droughts li et al 2018 sattar and kim 2019 in 1973 and 1974 major droughts in 1995 1997 and 1998 also presented clear evidence that the occurrence of hydrological droughts reacts to their causal meteorological droughts in a time lagged manner therefore the wrb has significant propagation features in common with many basins around the world the analysis above also reminds that the use of standardized drought indices has advantages in properly identifying the drought propagation mechanism as well as important propagation features in an intuitive and effective way denoting their usefulness for drought propagation analysis 4 2 drought response time identification at an annual scale it has been noted the marked time interval between the arrival of the precipitation shortage and the consequent deficits in usable water resources such as the soil moisture groundwater and streamflow of the terrestrial hydrological system therefore time scales over which precipitation deficits accumulate can advantageously distinguish different kinds of droughts mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 the multi scalar nature of the spi offers the ease of calculating precipitation anomalies at multiple time scales in this subsection the monthly ssi is cross correlated with the spi at changing time scales from 4 to 105 weeks in order to determine the appropriate response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts fig 5 illustrates the drought response time identification for five sub basins of the wrb which is conducted within the proposed two stage framework in the upper reach of the wrb fig 5 a it is unclear whether it is the linearity or the nonlinearity that dominates the spi ssi relationship both of the linear and nonlinear correlation between the spi and the ssi are jointly examined using the pearson correlation and mutual information analysis the consistent trends are observed in the linear and nonlinear relationship curves across the full range of the spi time scales the pearson correlation coefficient as a measure of the linear relationship reaches its peak 0 712 at the spi time scale of 30 weeks in comparison the highest mi score 0 391 occurs at the spi accumulation period of 38 weeks this yields the 30 and 38 weeks successively recognized as the candidate response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts dependent exclusively on evaluating the linear or nonlinear association between the spi and the ssi the spi ssi correlation quantified above represents the global dependence of streamflow anomalies both deficit and surplus scenarios are included upon precipitation anomalies further assessment of the performance of each candidate response time in monitoring the streamflow deficit reveals that out of 287 times of streamflow deficits over the period 1962 2010 218 and 223 which account for nearly 80 of the total can be synchronously identified by the negative spi values at 30 week and 38 week scales respectively therefore the spi 38 which is more effective in indicating the below normal streamflow availability is regarded as the optimal time scale at which hydrological droughts respond to meteorological droughts in the upper reach of the wrb likewise the drought response time can be screened out for the remaining sub basins which is 28 28 25 and 39 weeks in the middle reach the lower reach of the wrb the jrb and the brb also noted is that linear and nonlinear relationship curves vary in a very similar pattern hydrological droughts in different parts of the wrb can respond to meteorological droughts at the spi time scales varying from 25 to 39 weeks the brb and the upper reach of the wrb i e 38 and 39 weeks have the hydrological response at relatively longer time scales in comparison with the jrb 25 weeks and the middle 28 weeks and lower 28 weeks reaches of the wrb the spatial heterogeneity of the drought response time is closely associated with the difference in soil depth and vegetation coverage as shown in fig 1 b the upper reach of the wrb as well as the brb is at higher elevations of 900 2400 m relative to the middle and lower reaches of the wrb 320 800 m the former two parts of the wrb are covered by the loess deposits estimated to be 50 180 m jiang 1997 in contrast the middle and lower reaches in the wei river valley have a shallow soil depth of 0 50 m soil contents in the wrb are mainly composed of the quaternary loess which was deposited by the strong northwesterly winds and has soft porous and permeable characteristics therefore the upper reach and the brb have a higher storage capacity favoring the stronger resistance of catchments to precipitation deficits accumulated at shorter time scales and leading to the delayed hydrological response similarly a study by barker et al 2016 in the uk highlighted that catchments underlain by major aquifers tended to show the delayed propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts which also gives rise to the longer spi time scales most strongly related to the monthly ssi however the jrb is an exception in the wrb that a catchment with the deep soil cover still presents the rapid hydrological response the jrb has almost the same soil depth as the upper reach and the brb the noticeable difference is the vegetation coverage the remotely sensed ndvi is used as a good indicator of the vegetation dynamics for terrestrial ecosystems the jrb has a mean monthly ndvi of 0 326 which is 20 lower than that in the upper reach of the wrb 0 405 and the brb 0 395 for the jrb with the relatively sparse vegetation less precipitation can be intercepted and travel deeper to recharge the catchment owing to less water storage meteorological droughts persisting in the jrb for a period of time can develop into the hydrological droughts at a higher speed in comparison with the upper reach and the brb in the subsequent subsection 4 4 a more detailed discussion is presented regarding how the catchment water storage can influence the streamflow recession process in drought conditions and induce different drought response time as a result the jrb has the most rapid drought response time 25 weeks across the wrb which denotes its weak resistance to meteorological droughts catchment properties such as the soil layer depth and vegetation status are found in the wrb to be important controls on the spatial variability in the drought response time 4 3 seasonal variability in drought response time the previous subsection detects the drought response time at an annual scale which benefits the recognition of drought vulnerable regions where atmospheric drought signals can more rapidly penetrate into the hydrological system the seasonality in the drought response time is also a topic of high interest since knowledge about the seasonal difference is important for planning the operational drought mitigation in this subsection the ssi series of the individual month is related to the corresponding spi series with the varying time scales to determine the drought response time for each calendar month the spi ssi relationship is also quantified by the pearson correlation coefficients and the mi scores fig 6 depicts the monthly response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts across the wrb the noticeable seasonality is observed the wrb heavily influenced by the east asian monsoons is characterized by the abundant precipitation and high temperature in summer while it is dry and cold in winter as shown in the figure hydrological response to precipitation deficits occurs at a long spi time scale in winter december the next february it is due to the dominant replenishment of the winter streamflow by the groundwater discharge the assumption is supported by the high baseflow index in five sub basins which is in the range of 0 66 0 87 the aquifer recharge discharge process is quite slow and the most of aquifer recharge happens in summer when the wrb receives the majority of its annual precipitation enabling winter streamflow to respond to precipitation deficits even present in the antecedent summer in spring march may air temperature and precipitation start to escalate a combination of the growing precipitation and the snowmelt caused by the higher temperature induces an increased availability of surface water an important amount of which travels through the soil to become the soil moisture subsurface flow and groundwater flow the increase in subsurface flow diminishes the contribution of groundwater to streamflow in the river course which is backed by the baseflow index decreasing from 0 66 to 0 87 in winter to 0 36 0 69 in spring at five sub basins water transiting as the subsurface flow follows a shorter drainage path and thus has a relatively shorter residence time in comparison with the groundwater discharge to the stream as a result it is observed a noticeable decline in the drought response time in summer june august when the catchment is frequently subject to rainfall with high intensity the surface flow can increasingly take place because of the saturation and infiltration excess mechanisms the baseflow index continues decreasing to the lowest level 0 24 0 32 in the whole year the fast flow components surpassing the groundwater start to play a dominant role in the streamflow generation therefore the summer streamflow variability is primarily dependent on the precipitation anomalies at the short spi time scales and a hydrological drought is more likely to arise from the precipitation deficits in the most recent months with regard to the autumn september november the decreased temperature restrains the evaporative loss and the soil moisture maintains the high level in the catchment see fig 9 in spite of the reduction in the received precipitation hydrological droughts can respond to meteorological droughts following a shorter drainage path and at relatively short spi time scales during late autumn november water stored in the shallow soil layer may be exhausted producing the delayed hydrological response to meteorological droughts in some parts of the wrb the autumn shifts the downward trend in the baseflow index and witnesses a rise in the baseflow index 0 41 0 61 previous studies conducted by huang et al 2017 and wu et al 2018b in the wrb also indicated the similar seasonality in drought response time which is characterized by the delayed and rapid drought propagation in winter and summer respectively huang s and wu s works represent the use of the previously popular method in which only the linear correlation between meteorological and hydrological droughts is evaluated for identifying drought response time in the present study the drought response time of 2 8 1 4 2 8 and 7 4 months in spring summer autumn and winter is shorter as compared to the results 6 3 6 and 12 months in the corresponding seasons derived by huang et al 2017 the difference may notify the existence of nonlinear dependence of two types of droughts of concern as well as its role in determining drought response time analysis above also indicates that the time varying baseflow index is generally proportional to the hydrological drought response time throughout a year a high baseflow index means that the streamflow is mainly supplied by the deep groundwater which discharges to the stream following a long drainage path giving rise to the long time hydrological response in addition to the drought response time identified for each calendar month fig 7 presents in detail the spi ssi relationship in the form of the pearson correlation coefficients and the mi scores the strength of the spi ssi relationship provides an overall impression of the extent to which hydrological droughts are dependent upon meteorological droughts as depicted in fig 7 the highest dependence of the ssi on the spi is obtained in spring mainly in may and autumn september october with an exception at the upper reach of the wrb in winter the evapotranspiration is deduced to be partially responsible for the relatively lower spi ssi correlation in the remaining months in summer when the abundant precipitation occurs in phase with high temperature the intense evaporation is at the highest level of the year and the resultant water loss cannot be overlooked in the streamflow generation process therefore anomalies in the summer streamflow appear to be more related to the effective precipitation i e precipitation minus evapotranspiration rather than the precipitation alone with respect to the winter the streamflow is dominantly supplied by the steady groundwater discharge which is largely refilled by the infiltrated water in the preceding summer thus winter streamflow droughts can react to the precipitation deficits accumulated backward to the antecedent summer the fate of the infiltrated water is explained by retention in the root zone as soil moisture losses through evapotranspiration and recharge to groundwater apurv et al 2017 it suggests that the summer evapotranspiration can serve as a disturbance in the aquifer recharge process and thus exert influence on the winter streamflow variability to verify the assumption concerning summer intense evapotranspiration as a determinant of streamflow anomalies in summer and winter the spi ssi correlation is compared against the linkage between the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the ssi unlike the spi the spei proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 additionally takes into account the effect of evapotranspiration on drought development and normalizes the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration instead of the precipitation alone the ssi relationship with two types of meteorological drought indicators i e the spei and spi are jointly measured using the pearson correlation coefficient and mutual information metric difference in correlation calculated as cor r spei s s i c o r r spi s s i is presented in table 2 the consistently positive values of difference noted in summer and winter months remind that a higher degree of linkage between meteorological and hydrological droughts is available conditioned on the additional consideration of evapotranspiration influence similarly the role of evapotranspiration in the drought propagation is highlighted by barker et al 2016 who further recommended the use of the precipitation evapotranspiration index for the meteorological drought characterization in an attempt to give a clear picture of the climatic controls on the drought relationship although the spei having stronger association with the ssi seems to be more suitable for drought prorogation analysis the present study still utilizes the spi to characterize meteorological droughts with the purpose of keeping the effect of temperature separate for the following attribution analysis 4 4 variation of drought response time in a changing environment and a preliminary attribution analysis in a changing environment both climate and land surface are undergoing perceivable changes to provide insight into how the drought propagation process is affected by such changes variations of the drought response time are detected for the period 1962 2010 using the mann kendall mk trend test which is followed by a preliminary attribution analysis in contrast to the unique value of response time derived over the full analysis period 1962 2010 in subsections 4 2 and 4 3 a 25 year time window is utilized and moves from the beginning corresponding to the year 1962 to the end corresponding to the year 2010 of the spi and ssi series this yields 25 sets of windowed spi and ssi sub series using the proposed two stage statistical framework as depicted in fig 2 drought response time can be subsequently computed for each set of the pair wise spi ssi sub series in such a way drought response time can have 25 values on the time axis providing an opportunity to analyze its changes during the past half century the trend detection and attribution analysis are conducted with a particular focus on summer and winter which are associated with the shortest and longest drought response time in the whole year respectively as shown in table 3 drought response time in winter mostly becomes shorter over the period 1962 2010 but without significant downward trends being observed whereas there is an exception in the middle reach of the wrb the prompter reaction of hydrological droughts to meteorological ones in the majority of the study area is deduced to be associated with changes in catchment water storage and the severity of precipitation deficits propagating into the terrestrial part of the hydrological cycle firstly winter air temperature escalated at an annual rate of 0 0394 c 0 0357 c 0 0364 c 0 0419 c and 0 0433 c over the recent half century in the upper middle and lower reaches as well as two major tributaries namely the jrb and brb of the wrb three decades ago the chinese government initiated a large scale vegetation restoration program featuring the retirement of cultivated land on steep slopes and afforestation of degraded landscapes since the year 1982 the wrb in the domain of the implementation of the ambitious restoration project has experienced the growth of vegetation coverage the annual increments in the winter ndvi are estimated to be 4 71 10 3 year 5 38 10 3 year 4 92 10 3 year 1 78 10 3 year and 3 16 10 3 year in five sub basins a changing environment characterized by a warmer climate and the greener land surface jointly forces the intensified evapotranspiration rate as depicted in fig 8 across the wrb the intensification of evapotranspiration subsequently gives rise to the decline in moisture content at the top 2 m of soil layer fig 9 the drying trends in surface soil at multiple depths were also observed by a number of existing studies chen et al 2010 jia et al 2017 liang et al 2018 with focus on the present study area less water can travel deeper to recharge groundwater also resulting in the decreasing storage in the aquifer fig 8 in winter the baseflow indices as high as 0 66 0 87 indicate the dominant contribution of catchment storage to winter streamflow in the river course less water mainly in forms of soil moisture content and groundwater impounded in catchment is difficult to endure the relatively long term precipitation deficits thereby being partly responsible for the decreasing response time of hydrological droughts to their casual meteorological ones the other reason for the shorter response time in winter is closely linked to variations in meteorological drought severity mean values of winter precipitation deficits in each 25 year time window are successively calculated and found to ascend over the past half century fig 10 a it is reasonable to deduce that for the same catchment with the equivalent amount of water storage more intense precipitation shortage signals tend to more easily penetrate into the hydrological system and trigger the consequent streamflow deficits in a prompter way as for the exception noted in the middle reach of the wrb where drought response time however presents a marked upward trend river damming may play a central role in the 1970s the linjiacun reservoir with the storage capacity of 50 million m3 came into operation at the middle reach which is the only reservoir in the main course of the wei river reservoir operations are in favor of maintaining the minimum discharge essential for riverine ecosystem health in winter months therefore restraining the meteorological drought propagation along the hydrological cycle effects of reservoir operations on the drought propagation has been discussed in diverse catchments of spain lópez moreno et al 2013 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 and china wang et al 2019 through comparative analysis a major finding presents that river regulation via the damming diminishes the hydrological sensitivity to precipitation variations at shorter time scales and leads to the delayed response which coincides well with the exceptional case in the middle reach in summer hydrological droughts tend to react to meteorological droughts at increasingly longer spi time scales three out of five sub basins exhibit significant upward trends in drought response time as previous attribution analysis in winter has highlighted the role of catchment storage and meteorological drought severity in drought propagation these two influential factors are examined in an effort to explicate the changing pattern of drought response time in summer as well baseflow indices of five sub basins attain the lowest level 0 24 0 32 reminding that streamflow generation in summer months is dominantly dependent on the horizontal movement of water in the unsaturated zone and overland flow instead of the groundwater flow in the deep aquifer trend detection using the mk test fig 9 discloses the descending trends in summer soil moisture at the shallow depth 0 2 m across the study area less moisture content in the catchment can lower the catchment resistance to precipitation deficits and speed up meteorological drought propagation through the terrestrial system decreased catchment storage therefore represents an unfavorable condition for explaining why drought response time in summer becomes increasingly longer over the past five decades however supportive evidence is provided when properties of meteorological droughts are under investigation the past half century witnesses the gradual alleviation of drought severity as shown in fig 10 b the mk test statistics are estimated to be 1 89 2 51 2 18 5 21 and 1 10 for a series of mean values of summer precipitation deficits in five sub basins given that meteorological droughts become less severe the catchment is able to withstand precipitation deficits persisting for a longer period of time giving rise to the hydrological response in a more delayed manner more obviously three sub basins i e the jrb and the middle and lower reaches with significantly longer response time exactly match with where precipitation deficits are markedly alleviated identified by the mk test statistic less than 1 96 it is reasonable to deduce that although the decrease in catchment storage corresponds to decreased resistance to hydrological drought this decreased resistance is offset by the decrease in meteorological drought severity as a result meteorological droughts with lower severity have a more vital role in determining the changing pattern of summer drought response time at the study site attribution analysis above mainly reveals the changing catchment water storage and meteorological drought severity as drivers responsible for variations in hydrological drought response time over the past half century to more intuitively illustrate their effects on drought propagation recession processes of catchment outflow under meteorological drought conditions are schematically outlined in a comparative way in which catchment storage fig 11 a as well as precipitation deficit severity fig 11 b is brought under control in fig 11 a scenarios 1 and 2 representing the high catchment storage and low storage are analyzed owing to higher storage in favor of yielding a larger amount of catchment outflow the initial value q 1 of recession segment in scenario 1 can be observably greater than that q 2 in scenario 2 when the catchment is subject to the meteorological drought with the same severity it will take a longer period of time for a higher initial value namely q 1 to decline below a threshold that indicates the occurrence of hydrological droughts this gives rise to response time 1 being much longer than response time 2 in fig 11 a evidencing the delay hydrological response conditional on the higher level of antecedent catchment storage moreover fig 11 b illustrates the impact of meteorological drought severity on drought propagation scenarios 3 and 4 differ in precipitation deficit signals with different severity as fig 11 b keeps the catchment storage invariant recession processes of the catchment outflow have the same initial values in scenarios 3 q 3 and 4 q 4 however when precipitation deficits separately occur with different severity the affected catchment outflow in scenarios 3 and 4 can plunge at different rates and start to diverge gradually recession rate of catchment outflow in the high severity deficit scenario is noticed to be greater than that in the low severity deficit scenario it is because much less precipitation in the case of a more severe meteorological drought can infiltrate to replenish the catchment in which water content is largely proportional to the yield of its outflow catchment outflow in scenario 3 reaches the threshold for streamflow deficits earlier than the counterpart in scenario 4 triggering response time 3 being shorter than response time 4 in fig 11 b thereby the rapid drought response pattern is expected given the occurrence of precipitation deficits with high severity in addition to the aforementioned two controls over the drought response time the role of diverse human interventions should be underlined river damming is found to decelerate the drought propagation from the atmosphere into the hydrological system on the contrary hydrological drought response is accelerated by groundwater pumping which has been investigated by apurv et al 2017 and tijdeman et al 2018b ultimately for a catchment in the same season which maintains the constant threshold for streamflow deficits hydrological drought response time is supposed to be a function of characteristics of atmospheric forcings the catchment storage and diverse human interventions which is also explained at the bottom of fig 11 5 conclusions increased understanding of the drought propagation mechanism favors enhanced skills in drought monitoring and early warning given the time lag effect widely present in drought propagation from one type to another the study particularly investigates the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts firstly a two stage statistical framework is proposed for accurately identifying the drought response time at an improved temporal i e the weekly resolution the monthly ssi series is initially cross correlated with the spi series at multiple weekly scales to determine the candidate drought response time through exclusively evaluating the linear and nonlinear dependence of streamflow anomalies on precipitation anomalies respectively in the second stage the deficit aspect of usable water resources is of special concern the number of streamflow deficits which can be properly monitored by the concurrent precipitation deficits is compared among each candidate response time to screen out the optimal one then drought response time at both annual and monthly scales is identified within the proposed framework which is beneficial to the spatial and temporal comparison finally variations of drought response time in a changing climate are detected over the past half century which is followed by a preliminary attribution analysis a case study is conducted for a typical region namely the wrb in the loess plateau china results show that the propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts diminishes the number of droughts but intensifies the severity and duration hydrological droughts usually react to the occurrence of meteorological droughts in a time lagged manner subsequently drought response time identification at an annual scale reveals that hydrological droughts in the wrb respond to meteorological drought at 25 week to 39 week time scales the noticeable spatial variability is found to be governed by the loess deposit depth and vegetation coverage which largely represent the catchment storage and precipitation interception capacity relatively long response time can be expected where there are major soil and vegetation coverage apart from the spatial variability drought response time also presents marked seasonality with the short term and long term hydrological response being observed in summer and winter respectively the time varying baseflow index is noted to be in direct proportion to the drought response time and thus have control over the seasonal variability the underlying mechanism is that a higher baseflow index in winter denotes a major supply of streamflow by deep groundwater which discharges to the stream following a long path resulting in the long time hydrological response additionally in a changing environment hydrological droughts in summer tend to respond to meteorological droughts at increasingly longer time scales while decreasing response time is seen in winter such changes are preliminarily attributed to variations in catchment water storage and meteorological drought severity over the past half century therefore attribution analysis above highlights a combination of factors which include the vegetation status soil deposit depth catchment storage and the changing meteorological drought severity have significant control on the spatio temporal variability in drought response time in the wrb these findings may improve our knowledge about the drought propagation mechanism and are in support of developing operational drought monitoring systems in addition to influential factors mainly representing the catchment properties investigated above evapotranspiration serving as an important disturbance in the precipitation streamflow relationship can impact the hydrological response time to meteorological droughts evaporative losses in the streamflow generation cannot be disregarded when abundant atmospheric water and high temperature are available simultaneously and especially in the context of current global warming therefore the role of evapotranspiration in the drought propagation which has been partially noticed in subsection 4 3 deserves further investigation in an attempt to provide a clear picture of both climatic and catchment controls over drought response time credit authorship contribution statement wei fang methodology software formal analysis writing original draft

5047,meteorological drought propagating to hydrological drought usually occurs with a noticeable time delay due to the catchment buffering effect knowledge gain in the delayed hydrological response is indispensable for developing timely drought monitoring systems in this study a two stage statistical framework is proposed for identifying the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts at a weekly resolution candidate response time is initially selected by exclusively evaluating linear or nonlinear correlations between precipitation and streamflow anomalies in the second stage the optimal response time is determined at which the greatest number of streamflow deficits can be monitored by concurrent precipitation deficits a case study is conducted for the wei river basin of the loess plateau china to investigate the spatio temporal variability in drought response time under a changing environment results indicate that hydrological droughts respond to meteorological droughts with time lags of 25 39 weeks exhibiting noticeable spatial variability the long time hydrological response is expected where there are sufficient vegetation and loess deposits drought response time identification for each calendar month reveals the long term and short term hydrological response in winter and summer respectively a time varying baseflow index is found to be positively related to the drought response time therefore having control on its marked seasonality in a changing environment summer hydrological droughts tend to respond to precipitation variability at longer time scales while decreasing response time is noticed in winter a preliminary attribution analysis highlights that changes in meteorological drought severity and catchment water storage in combination exert control on the temporal variability in drought response time over the past half century findings of the study may favor hydrological drought monitoring dependent on precipitation

natural hazards which are typically defined as sustained periods of the major decline in usable water resources including precipitation soil moisture streamflow groundwater and reservoir storage apurv et al 2017 redmond 2002 droughts likely to trigger crop losses leng and hall 2018 wildfire westerling et al 2006 ecosystem degradation assal et al 2016 and conflicts between diverse water users gleick 2014 von uexkull et al 2016 have widespread impacts on many aspects of natural and human systems typically drought events are grouped into four categories namely meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts based on compartments of the hydrological cycle and sectors of human activity affected mishra et al 2015 it has been observed the close linkage between various types of droughts wilhite 2000 meteorological droughts characterized by precipitation deficits often act as the onset of agricultural and hydrological droughts which are separately quantified as the below normal availability of soil moisture and streamflow huang et al 2017 peters et al 2006 when water supply from natural river courses or man made impounding facilities is insufficient to satisfy the demand of human society hydrological droughts develop into socio economic droughts subsequently mehran et al 2015 the transition from one type of droughts to another is referred to as drought propagation apurv et al 2017 which has become a hot topic in the hydrological community during recent two decades guo et al 2020 heudorfer and stahl 2017 huang et al 2015 van lanen 2006 van loon et al 2012 wu et al 2018 understanding drought propagation mechanisms with the current study particularly focusing on the propagation from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts is a significant foundation for the improved skills in drought monitoring and early warning further benefiting the reduced vulnerability of the human community to drought hazards wang et al 2016 previous efforts have revealed that drought propagation through a hydrological system has several features in common which are the pooling attenuation lagging and lengthening van loon et al 2012 yang et al 2017 the pooling phenomenon in the drought propagation is that consecutive meteorological droughts collectively merge into a single agricultural or hydrological drought minor meteorological droughts can be attenuated when high catchment storage is available at the very beginning of precipitation deficits there widely exist time lags between the occurrence of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts in addition droughts usually get increasingly longer duration when evolving from atmospheric precipitation to agricultural soil moisture to hydrological streamflow droughts important features aforementioned are a result of the role of various hydro meteorological processes such as the infiltration evapotranspiration and aquifer recharge and discharge in drought propagation herrera estrada et al 2017 consequently a combination of climatic the rainfall pattern and snowmelt and catchment the topography geology soil type and vegetation coverage properties as influential factors of relevant hydro meteorological processes can simultaneously impose control over drought propagation which has been investigated by an ensemble of studies barker et al 2016 haslinger et al 2014 lorenzolacruz et al 2013 peters et al 2003 van loon 2015 with the aid of modeling experiments apurv et al 2017 further identified three drought propagation mechanisms under diverse climates by controlling key climate factors precipitation seasonality climate aridity and the timing of precipitation with respect to potential evapotranspiration that impact drought propagation processes methods for drought propagation analysis are broadly classified into the model simulation and statistical approaches in the former approach the hydrological response to meteorological droughts is analyzed using physically based models assumed to provide a valid representation of associated hydrological processes yu et al 1999 however the modeling method involves the labor intensive calibration process and is typically applied to the site specific analysis van loon et al 2012 also reported that the use of models at larger regional or global spatial scales are challenged by the difficulty in properly representing the time lag effect in drought propagation in comparison the statistical approach with less assumption is easier to be used at diverse spatial extent provided the availability of long term and reliable observations of atmospheric and hydrological variables as an important feature of drought propagation the time lag effect has been receiving growing attention folland et al 2015 huang et al 2015 laizé and hannah 2010 the time lag between meteorological and hydrological droughts arises to a large extent from the soil buffering as well as the slow aquifer recharge discharge processes these hydrological processes can modulate climate variability signals propagating along a terrestrial hydrological system determining that the streamflow responds to precipitation anomalies with an observable time delay and changes at relatively lower frequencies barker et al 2016 laizé and hannah 2010 drought response time is a useful indicator for quantifying the time lag effect in the drought propagation drought response at long time scales is commonly interpreted as the strong catchment resistance to hydrological droughts in the case of the occurrence of meteorological droughts conversely the prompt response is typically related to the low catchment resistance knowledge about the drought response time has important implications for hydrological drought identification and early warning therefore the current study is directed to a more specific investigation into the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts aiming to improve our understanding of drought propagation mechanisms earlier efforts are accustomed to characterizing drought conditions by means of standardized drought indices e g the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized streamflow index ssi for meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively kazemzadeh and malekian 2016 vicente serrano et al 2012 xu et al 2015 case studies in contrasting catchments of the uk austria spain china and the american continent barker et al 2016 haslinger et al 2014 lorenzolacruz et al 2013 ma et al 2019 oertel et al 2018 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 utilized the pearson correlation coefficient to measure the spi ssi dependence and determined the appropriate time scale of the spi which was best correlated with the 1 month ssi series as the response time of hydrological droughts to cumulated precipitation deficits in drought propagation analysis the spi and ssi are typically calculated at the monthly scale peña gallardo et al 2019 tijdeman et al 2018a this yields the drought response time also having the monthly resolution barker et al 2016 gevaert et al 2018 lorenzolacruz et al 2013 however a major concern arises that spatio temporal changes in hydrological response time are insufficient to be detectable at a relatively coarse i e the monthly temporal resolution to bridge the gap the standardized drought indices at multiple weekly scales are introduced into drought propagation analysis for the first time to improve the drought response time to a finer temporal resolution such efforts favor the accurate representation of the difference in drought response time over a large spatial and temporal scale both linear and nonlinear relationships are noticed in drought propagation processes van loon and laaha 2015 for instance meteorological droughts with the significant deficit volume tend to trigger severe hydrological droughts which represents a generally linear propagation pattern in terms of the drought deficit volume increasing studies are now noting the nonlinear reaction of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts heudorfer and stahl 2017 van loon and laaha 2015 wang et al 2016 cases of the nonlinear response are that a series of minor meteorological droughts can evolve into a severe hydrological drought while the attenuation of meteorological droughts may sometimes occur as a result of the high catchment storage available wong et al 2013 wu et al 2017 found in a catchment of southeast china that a logarithmic function instead of a linear form was more appropriate in modeling the close link between meteorological and hydrological drought characteristics i e the duration and magnitude wong et al 2013 further revealed in three european catchments that hydrological drought characteristics were not linearly dependent on preceding meteorological droughts and therefore the copula function was employed to describe their nonlinear dependence structure however previous studies on the drought response time identification were accustomed to exclusively examining the linear correlation but overlooking the nonlinear dependence of diverse droughts haslinger et al 2014 huang et al 2017 lorenzolacruz et al 2013 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 currently the mutual information based on the entropy theory becomes an increasingly popular metric of nonlinear correlations between two random variables fang et al 2018 fernando et al 2009 kinney and atwal 2014 may et al 2008 quilty et al 2016 therefore in order to derive the more accurate drought response time this study utilizes the pearson correlation and mutual information which enable linear and nonlinear relationships jointly taken into consideration in addition the global climate and land cover governing the drought propagation process are undergoing perceivable changes knowledge gap still exists regarding how and to what extent hydrological droughts respond to their causal meteorological droughts in a different way as a result of a changing environment it is a topic that remains understudied to this end the current study investigates dynamics of drought response time as well as their dominant drivers therefore new insights into the response of drought propagation behaviors to a changing environment can be acquired which is essential to the development of the updated drought monitoring systems this study is motivated to explore the drought propagation mechanism with the special focus on one of its significant features the time lag effect the drought response time is utilized as a quantitative indicator of the time lag effect detailed objectives are to 1 develop a two stage statistical framework for drought response time identification which jointly evaluates the linear and nonlinear relationships in drought propagation 2 improve the identified drought response time to a finer temporal resolution by using the standardized drought indices at multiple weekly scales and 3 detect the evolution of drought response time in a changing environment and conduct a preliminary attribution analysis results of the study may increase our knowledge of the drought propagation mechanism and further benefit the hydrological drought monitoring dependent on precipitation deficit information available at larger spatial extent 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the loess plateau lp fig 1 a with a highly fragmented landform covers an area of 640 000 square kilometers 33 43 41 16 n 100 54 114 33 e of northwest china yang et al 2012 the plateau intensively influenced by the monsoon has semiarid and sub humid climates centuries of massive human activities including deforestation over grazing unsustainable agricultural practices and warfare have resulted in the degraded ecosystems and sparse vegetation coverage lü et al 2012 in the case of intense precipitation surface flow can take place rapidly as a direct consequence of less precipitation being intercepted by the sparse vegetation subsequently only a limited amount of atmospheric water infiltrates deeper to replenish the soil moisture content and recharge the groundwater given unfavorable conditions of catchment storage streamflow droughts tend to occur in response to antecedent precipitation deficits persisting for a sustained time period which is in agreement with historical records liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 as water resources available have been major constraints on economic growth and ecological restoration of the relatively arid lp it is of practical importance to explicate the drought propagation mechanism towards the timely drought preparedness the wei river basin wrb fig 1 b is a typical region located at the southern edge of the loess plateau as it consists of all three characteristic topography of the plateau the stony mountains hills and valley plains the wei river with a length of 818 km flows from the west to the east and drains an area of 134 800 square kilometers the annual precipitation in the wrb as shown in fig 1 c forms a spatial gradient from the southeast 900 mm to the northwest 300 mm most precipitation accounting for 63 2 of the annual total occurs between july and october in the form of thunderstorms given the high variability in climate and topography the wrb is subsequently divided into five sub regions for ease of analysis which are depicted in fig 1 b table 1 summarizes the climatic and catchment characteristics of five sub regions it is noted the dissimilar climates as well as the remarkable difference in topography land cover and vegetation status which jointly give rise to contrasting response patterns of hydrological systems to meteorological droughts across the wrb the upper reach of the wrb uwb is characterized by stony mountains and hills the jing river basin jrb and the beiluo river basin brb in the northern proportion of the wrb are characterized by loess hills the dominant landform of the loess plateau the middle and lower reaches of the wrb mwb and lwb are alluvial plains at the lower elevations loess is deposited up to 180 m in the western and northern parts i e the uwb the jrb and brb in comparison the mwb and lwb have shallow loess deposits mainly due to the river cutting through the loess profile even to the position of the bedrock a recent study by zhu et al 2018 provides a loess thickness map of the lp at a high spatial resolution of 100 m 100 m interested readers can refer to the high resolution map for the site specific information about soil layer depth across the wrb land cover of the wrb fig 1 d

calculate the spi at multiple weekly scales ranging from 4 to 105 weeks which is indispensable for deriving the drought response time at a high temporal resolution additionally in situ streamflow observations at five gauges namely linjiacun xianyang huanxian zhuangjiashan and zhuangtou are acquired from the hydrology and water resource survey bureau of shaanxi province over the same analysis period additionally water fluxes mainly the evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater storage and a remotely sensed vegetation status indicator in close association of streamflow generation are utilized in an attempt to explain spatiotemporal variations of the drought response time from perspectives of climatic and catchment properties daily soil moisture at top 2 m of soil layer direct

standardized drought indices the use of standardized drought indices has been increasingly witnessed in the hydrological community for drought monitoring bazrafshan et al 2014 risk analysis dai et al 2020 and impact assessment madadgar et al 2017 primary due to the simplicity standardized nature and flexibility of use in time and space farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 in this study meteorological and hydrological droughts are of high interest and characterized by the standardized precipitation index spi and the standardized streamflow index ssi respectively for the meteorological drought characterization the spi initially proposed by mckee et al 1993 is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo it measures the departure of the precipitation accumulation from the long term mean the procedure for the spi calculation is detailed as follows step 1 precipitation observations are aggregated at a user defined time scale step 2 a probability distribution function usually a gamma distribution shown in eq 1 is fitted to the aggregated precipitation series for each calendar month independently 1 g x 0 x g x d x 1 β α γ α 0 x x α 1 e x β d x γ α 0 y α 1 e y d y estimates of distribution parameters are derived using the maximum likelihood method and given by 2 α 1 4 a 1 1 4 a 3 β x α a ln x ln x n in which x is the mean of precipitation observations given that the gamma distribution is invalid for x 0 and there can be zero values in the aggregated precipitation series the cumulative probability of precipitation g x is modified to be h x 3 h x 1 q g x q step 3 an equiprobability transformation is performed which converts the skewed precipitation accumulation into a normally distributed variable with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one the spi formula is given by 4 spi t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 0 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 when 0 h x 0 5 t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 0 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 when 0 5 h x 1 5 t ln 1 h x 2 when 0 h x 0 5 ln 1 1 h x 2 when 0 5 h x 1 in which c 0 c 1 c 2 d 1 d 2 and d 3 are parameters equivalent to 2 515517 0 802853 0 010328 1 432788 0 189269 and 0 001308 respectively it is the last step that makes the spi comparable temporally and spatially in light of the popularity of the spi in drought studies the standardization principles are also applied to hydrological variables such as the soil moisture groundwater and streamflow resulting in a family of standardized indices for monitoring diverse droughts in the hydrological cycle aghakouchak 2014 barker et al 2016 vicente serrano et al 2012 in this study the ssi based on streamflow observations is employed for the hydrological drought characterization note that the ssi differs from the spi in the type of probability distributions for fitting the accumulated data however no consensus can be easily achieved on a widely accepted distribution function suitable for the highly skewed streamflow herein the log normal distribution is adopted for the ssi calculation due to its favorable performance in similar catchments in northwest china gao and zhang 2016 xiong et al 2015 the probability density function of the log normal distribution is shown in eq 6 6 f x 1 2 π σ 2 1 x exp ln x μ 2 2 σ 2 major advantages of standardized drought indices include the ease of calculation the low data requirement and the multi scalar characteristic the multi scalar characteristic implies that drought indices can be flexibly calculated at multiple time scales to monitor precipitation variability over contrasting accumulation periods shi et al 2020 since the time taken for precipitation anomalies to propagate into diverse water resources differs considerably the time scale at which the precipitation deficits accumulate distinguishes types of droughts mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 therefore the monthly ssi is related to the spi at varying time scales to recognize the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts in this study inspired by the work by wang et al 2011 we utilize the spi at multiple weekly scales from 4 to 105 weeks in order to identify the drought response time at a high temporal also the weekly resolution for more complete spi and ssi description interested readers are referred to mckee et al 1993 and shukla and wood 2008 the spi and ssi series are calculated using the sci package in r project stagge et al 2015 3 2 mutual information the pearson correlation coefficient is a dependence metric extensively utilized in diverse hydrological studies abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 hatt et al 2009 prathumratana et al 2008 the corresponding formula is given as follows 7 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x and y are two random variables n represents the sample size and x i y i is the i th pair wise sample the use of the pearson correlation coefficient requires a fundamental assumption that random variables under investigation are linearly dependent however the assumption regarding the inherently linear dependence is often challenged in the hydrological system which is also the same case in the drought propagation processes since a number of time varying climatic precipitation temperature etc and catchment mainly the vegetation coverage and land use characteristics can control the drought propagation in both of isolated and interactive ways yang et al 2017 therefore the pearson correlation analysis may be not well suitable for dealing with some highly nonlinear relationships existing in hydrological system for the current study ignoring the nonlinear dependence of the ssi on the spi tends to derive the inaccurate drought response time the limitation of the linear correlation analysis has motivated the development of an alternative dependence metric the mutual information mi which is effective in detecting the nonlinear and chaotic dependence fraser and swinney 1986 the mutual information is rooted in the information and entropy theories and also referred to as the transinformation ebeling et al 1995 and the relative entropy vedral 2002 in earlier literature the formula is given below 8 i xy f xy x y log f xy x y f x x f y y d x d y where i xy denotes the mi between two random variables and f xy x y is the joint probability density function pdf with marginals f x x and f y y from a perspective of information theory the i xy is interpreted as the reduced uncertainty or information again regarding y due to the knowledge of x by definition in eq 8 the mutual information evaluates the kullback leibler distance of the joint distribution f xy x y from the distribution f x x f y y denoting a case when two variables are independent granger and lin 1994 maes et al 1997 if two random variables are not correlated the joint distribution f xy x y will theoretically equal the product of two marginals f x x f y y generating an mi score of zero in contrast the strong correlation will produce a high value of the mi score therefore it is reasonable to regard the mi as a reliable indicator of the presence of dependence in a practical context the mi is defined for discrete variables by replacing integrals with sums which is presented as follows fang et al 2018 9 i xy x y p xy x y log p xy x y p x x p y y where p x x p y y and p xy x y are the estimated marginal and joint pdfs commonly used techniques for the pdf estimation include the crude histogram and the non parametric kernel density estimator sharma 2000 the mi as shown in eq 9 is clearly based only on the probability distributions derived from the sample set no assumption about the dependence structure is involved which enables the mi to evaluate the more generalized including the nonlinear dependence of two random variables the other advantage over the linear correlation metric is the robustness of the mi since it is insensitive to the noise and data transformation in this study the mi between the spi and ssi series is calculated using the infotheo package for r more details can be found in battiti 1994 and may et al 2008 3 3 a two stage statistical framework for drought response time identification in line with earlier efforts barker et al 2016 haslinger et al 2014 huang et al 2015 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 the current study makes use of the multi scalar characteristic of the spi a spi time scale capable of yielding the highest spi ssi correlation is defined as the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts such definition in essence is based on the notion that the development i e the onset peak severity and termination of hydrological droughts is responsive to the persistence of meteorological drought conditions quantified using the precipitation deficit accumulation over a prolonged period of time instead of merely the response to the specific timing mainly the onset peak severity and termination of antecedent meteorological droughts thereby hydrological drought response time derived here highlights the cumulative effects of meteorological droughts the definition is widely adopted by an ensemble of previous studies on drought propagation dash et al 2019 gevaert et al 2018 ma et al 2019 oertel et al 2018 van loon et al 2011 following the definition aforementioned a simple two stage framework is proposed for identifying the drought response time which is capable of dealing with the linear and nonlinear dependence of streamflow droughts on meteorological droughts by means of the pearson correlation and mutual information analysis its main components are depicted in fig 2 the use of the framework follows a procedure described below step 1 drought characterization daily precipitation observations are aggregated over multiple accumulation periods and standardized to yield the spi series for the meteorological drought characterization time periods over which precipitation observations are accumulated distinguish the time scales of the spi in the current study the spi time scales varying from 4 to 105 weeks are of particular interest which are equivalent to 1 24 months on a monthly basis hereafter for example the spi series at a 4 week scale is abbreviated as the spi 4 additionally the 1 month ssi series for hydrological drought characterization is derived from the streamflow observations following the same standardization principle note that if 3 month 6 month and 12 month hydrological droughts are of concern by decision makers the 1 month ssi can be flexibly replaced with the ssi at 3 month 6 month and 12 month scales thereby providing an opportunity to analyze how meteorological droughts propagate into the increasingly long term hydrological droughts step 2 dependence measurement the 1 month ssi is cross correlated with the spi at multiple time scales changing from 4 to 105 weeks to assess the extent to which streamflow anomalies are dependent upon precipitation variations according to the definition provided by the world meteorological organization svoboda et al 2012 the time scale of a drought index refers to a moving time window over which precipitation or streamflow observations are accumulated to yield their composite values that are subsequently standardized for characterizing dryness and wetness changes fig 3 illustrates how to pair the spi and ssi at contrasting time scales in each calendar month which is a critical step deserving necessary clarifications for brevity the pairing process is only exemplified for june it is observed that no matter how the time scale of drought indices varies as the user designates the spi and ssi at the end of june have the same termination date i e june 30th the only difference consists in the length of the time window determining the number of days used for calculating composite values of precipitation or streamflow therefore as fig 3 depicts the ssi series at a 1 month scale in combination with the spi series at diverse weekly scales can be simultaneously derived for june afterwards the 1 month ssi is sequentially matched with the spi at contrasting time scales varying from 4 to 105 weeks and the degree of the pair wise spi ssi dependence is evaluated two types of dependence metrics are adopted which are the pearson correlation coefficient and the mi score the former one is good at modeling the linear relationship given that hydrological droughts may respond to meteorological droughts in a nonlinear manner the mi analysis is further performed to detect the possible nonlinear linkage between two types of droughts time scales over which the spi are the most correlated with the 1 month ssi are identified as the candidate drought response time they are separately the spi p and spi q in terms of the maximum pearson correlation and the mi score as shown in fig 2 this step differs from many previous studies in the further use of the spi at diverse weekly scales and the mutual information in an attempt to accurately identify the drought response time at an improved temporal resolution step 3 drought deficit monitoring the candidate drought response time is derived by assessing the spi ssi relationship they are the p week and q week scales of the spi acquired through the pearson correlation and mi analysis respectively this step proposes a useful metric further assisting in screening out the optimal one given that the spi ssi relationship indicates the generalized linkage between precipitation anomalies and streamflow anomalies it implies that water surplus in addition to water deficits is jointly considered however efforts to recognize the drought response time is motivated by the practical requirement for drought monitoring thereby highlighting that the specific focus ought to be laid on deficit aspect of usable water resources in such a context drought response time identified is considered appropriate only when as many as streamflow deficits can be synchronously monitored by the precipitation deficit accumulation hence it is reasonable to further determine the optimal response time by comparing the effectiveness of diverse candidates in monitoring the greatest number of streamflow deficits as shown detailly in fig 3 the 1 month ssi as well as the spi at p week and q week scales are calculated at the end of individual calendar month resulting in that the ssi and spi series have the equivalent length and can be paired month by month herein a metric developed for identifying the optimal response time is defined to be the total number of streamflow deficits quantified as ssi 0 that can be monitored by the concurrent shortage of precipitation accumulation quantified as spi 0 the metrics are denoted as sd s p i p and sd s p i q when the candidate response time namely the p week and q week scales of the spi derived from the pearson correlation and mutual information analysis is separately under investigation step 4 response time determination as shown in eq 10 finally determine the candidate response time which is associated with the maximum co occurrence of streamflow deficits and accumulated precipitation deficits to be the optimal drought response time in the study deficits of precipitation and streamflow can be identified when the spi and ssi values fall below zero the spi and ssi thresholds utilized to screen out water deficits coincide with those adopted by a number of earlier studies patel et al 2007 tan et al 2019 uddameri et al 2019 van oel et al 2018 10 arg max p q s d spi p s d spi q a simple two stage strategy is applied in the search for the drought response time initially the correlation analysis is conducted to ensure that the precipitation anomalies accumulated over the candidate response time can have a close association with streamflow anomalies in the second stage particular attention is paid to the dependence of streamflow deficits on precipitation deficits the co occurrence of precipitation and streamflow deficits is used as a supplementary criterion to further screen out the optimal response time which aims to more effectively monitor hydrological droughts depending on the precipitation deficit information 3 4 baseflow separation the baseflow component is separated from the streamflow hydrograph to attribute changes in drought response time herein a recursive digital filtering rdf method is utilized which is embedded in the hysep an automated baseflow separation tool developed by the united states geological survey usgs sloto and crouse 1996 the usgs hysep is widely used bosch et al 2017 and is employed in the study given its favorable performance reported in the hailiutu river which is adjacent to our study site in the loess plateau zhou et al 2013 the use of the hysep initially requires estimating the duration of surface runoff depending on an empirical formula 11 n a 0 2 the interval 2 n applied to the baseflow separation is an odd integer which is in the range of 3 11 and nearest to 2 n subsequently a local minimum method is utilized to identify the minimum flow during an interval the hysep also provides two rdf based alternative techniques including the fixed interval and sliding interval the local minimum method sequentially examines whether the daily streamflow value is the lowest in half the interval minus one day 0 5 2 n 1 before and after the day under investigation if so a local minimum is screened out and connected by a straight line with the nearest local minimum the baseflow in each day between two local minimums is determined using the linear interpolation algorithm furthermore the baseflow index bfi is calculated as the ratio of baseflow to the total streamflow usually on a monthly or annual basis 4 result analysis and discussion 4 1 drought propagation features in the wrb prior to proceeding to the drought response time identification it is essential to first take an overview of the drought propagation behavior in the study area and evaluate the usefulness of standardized drought indices for drought propagation analysis fig 4 indicates the 4 week spi and the 1 month ssi series of the whole wrb over the past five decades although the spi and ssi time scales are slightly different almost the equivalent number of daily observations of precipitation or streamflow are accumulated to derive the specific values of drought indicators a threshold of 1 is used to identify the drought occurrence presence and the termination from the time varying spi and ssi series livada and assimakopoulos 2007 modarres 2007 meteorological and hydrological droughts screened out are depicted in the central part of fig 4 some major droughts are observed to occur in 1978 1980 1995 1997 and 1999 which are in good agreement with the historical records archived at the drought hazard database of china http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode disa dro dis chn html over the period 1962 2010 a total of 80 meteorological droughts and 46 hydrological droughts were identified based on the spi and ssi series thereby highlighting the necessity of investigating the frequent drought hazards in the wrb the number of meteorological droughts was nearly twice as high as that of hydrological droughts the reason for the phenomenon is that streamflow response to precipitation anomalies results from the passage of infiltrated water across several subsurface filters that play a significant role in attenuating the precipitation variation modes shun and duffy 1999 streamflow as an output of the terrestrial hydrological system therefore fluctuates at a relatively lower rate relative to the input signal the precipitation finally giving rise to the diminished number of drought events when propagating from the atmosphere into the hydrological cycle markovic and koch 2015 the average duration was 1 2 and 2 1 months for meteorological and hydrological droughts respectively in terms of the average severity meteorological droughts 0 73 were less severe than hydrological ones 1 17 therefore drought statistics indicate that droughts evolving from the meteorological to hydrological segments in the wrb become less frequent but have longer duration and intensified severity according to a study by apurv et al 2017 the drought propagation in the wrb can be classified as the type 2 propagation mechanism which produces longer hydrological droughts relative to meteorological droughts it is reported that the type 2 propagation mechanism exclusively develops where there are relatively arid climates and precipitation in phase with the potential evapotranspiration it is just in line with the climatic characteristics of the study site the use of standardized drought indices helps to reveal drought propagation features in the wrb which include the pooling attenuation lagging and lengthening and are highlighted in fig 4 a striking phenomenon of the drought pooling was observed in 1997 in which a series of consecutive meteorological droughts penetrated into the terrestrial hydrological system and eventually came into being a hydrological drought having the most negative impacts over the period 1962 2010 it was the same case in 1999 by comparison a meteorological drought with the severity of nearly 4 in 1968 as shown in fig 4 was attenuated possibly as a result of the high storage in the aquifer the years of 2001 and 2002 exemplified that hydrological droughts had obviously prolonged duration relative to the antecedent meteorological droughts with respect to the time lag effect which is central to the current study it was noticed the perceivable time delay between hydrological and meteorological droughts more precisely expressed as the time interval between onsets of two types of droughts li et al 2018 sattar and kim 2019 in 1973 and 1974 major droughts in 1995 1997 and 1998 also presented clear evidence that the occurrence of hydrological droughts reacts to their causal meteorological droughts in a time lagged manner therefore the wrb has significant propagation features in common with many basins around the world the analysis above also reminds that the use of standardized drought indices has advantages in properly identifying the drought propagation mechanism as well as important propagation features in an intuitive and effective way denoting their usefulness for drought propagation analysis 4 2 drought response time identification at an annual scale it has been noted the marked time interval between the arrival of the precipitation shortage and the consequent deficits in usable water resources such as the soil moisture groundwater and streamflow of the terrestrial hydrological system therefore time scales over which precipitation deficits accumulate can advantageously distinguish different kinds of droughts mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 the multi scalar nature of the spi offers the ease of calculating precipitation anomalies at multiple time scales in this subsection the monthly ssi is cross correlated with the spi at changing time scales from 4 to 105 weeks in order to determine the appropriate response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts fig 5 illustrates the drought response time identification for five sub basins of the wrb which is conducted within the proposed two stage framework in the upper reach of the wrb fig 5 a it is unclear whether it is the linearity or the nonlinearity that dominates the spi ssi relationship both of the linear and nonlinear correlation between the spi and the ssi are jointly examined using the pearson correlation and mutual information analysis the consistent trends are observed in the linear and nonlinear relationship curves across the full range of the spi time scales the pearson correlation coefficient as a measure of the linear relationship reaches its peak 0 712 at the spi time scale of 30 weeks in comparison the highest mi score 0 391 occurs at the spi accumulation period of 38 weeks this yields the 30 and 38 weeks successively recognized as the candidate response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts dependent exclusively on evaluating the linear or nonlinear association between the spi and the ssi the spi ssi correlation quantified above represents the global dependence of streamflow anomalies both deficit and surplus scenarios are included upon precipitation anomalies further assessment of the performance of each candidate response time in monitoring the streamflow deficit reveals that out of 287 times of streamflow deficits over the period 1962 2010 218 and 223 which account for nearly 80 of the total can be synchronously identified by the negative spi values at 30 week and 38 week scales respectively therefore the spi 38 which is more effective in indicating the below normal streamflow availability is regarded as the optimal time scale at which hydrological droughts respond to meteorological droughts in the upper reach of the wrb likewise the drought response time can be screened out for the remaining sub basins which is 28 28 25 and 39 weeks in the middle reach the lower reach of the wrb the jrb and the brb also noted is that linear and nonlinear relationship curves vary in a very similar pattern hydrological droughts in different parts of the wrb can respond to meteorological droughts at the spi time scales varying from 25 to 39 weeks the brb and the upper reach of the wrb i e 38 and 39 weeks have the hydrological response at relatively longer time scales in comparison with the jrb 25 weeks and the middle 28 weeks and lower 28 weeks reaches of the wrb the spatial heterogeneity of the drought response time is closely associated with the difference in soil depth and vegetation coverage as shown in fig 1 b the upper reach of the wrb as well as the brb is at higher elevations of 900 2400 m relative to the middle and lower reaches of the wrb 320 800 m the former two parts of the wrb are covered by the loess deposits estimated to be 50 180 m jiang 1997 in contrast the middle and lower reaches in the wei river valley have a shallow soil depth of 0 50 m soil contents in the wrb are mainly composed of the quaternary loess which was deposited by the strong northwesterly winds and has soft porous and permeable characteristics therefore the upper reach and the brb have a higher storage capacity favoring the stronger resistance of catchments to precipitation deficits accumulated at shorter time scales and leading to the delayed hydrological response similarly a study by barker et al 2016 in the uk highlighted that catchments underlain by major aquifers tended to show the delayed propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts which also gives rise to the longer spi time scales most strongly related to the monthly ssi however the jrb is an exception in the wrb that a catchment with the deep soil cover still presents the rapid hydrological response the jrb has almost the same soil depth as the upper reach and the brb the noticeable difference is the vegetation coverage the remotely sensed ndvi is used as a good indicator of the vegetation dynamics for terrestrial ecosystems the jrb has a mean monthly ndvi of 0 326 which is 20 lower than that in the upper reach of the wrb 0 405 and the brb 0 395 for the jrb with the relatively sparse vegetation less precipitation can be intercepted and travel deeper to recharge the catchment owing to less water storage meteorological droughts persisting in the jrb for a period of time can develop into the hydrological droughts at a higher speed in comparison with the upper reach and the brb in the subsequent subsection 4 4 a more detailed discussion is presented regarding how the catchment water storage can influence the streamflow recession process in drought conditions and induce different drought response time as a result the jrb has the most rapid drought response time 25 weeks across the wrb which denotes its weak resistance to meteorological droughts catchment properties such as the soil layer depth and vegetation status are found in the wrb to be important controls on the spatial variability in the drought response time 4 3 seasonal variability in drought response time the previous subsection detects the drought response time at an annual scale which benefits the recognition of drought vulnerable regions where atmospheric drought signals can more rapidly penetrate into the hydrological system the seasonality in the drought response time is also a topic of high interest since knowledge about the seasonal difference is important for planning the operational drought mitigation in this subsection the ssi series of the individual month is related to the corresponding spi series with the varying time scales to determine the drought response time for each calendar month the spi ssi relationship is also quantified by the pearson correlation coefficients and the mi scores fig 6 depicts the monthly response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts across the wrb the noticeable seasonality is observed the wrb heavily influenced by the east asian monsoons is characterized by the abundant precipitation and high temperature in summer while it is dry and cold in winter as shown in the figure hydrological response to precipitation deficits occurs at a long spi time scale in winter december the next february it is due to the dominant replenishment of the winter streamflow by the groundwater discharge the assumption is supported by the high baseflow index in five sub basins which is in the range of 0 66 0 87 the aquifer recharge discharge process is quite slow and the most of aquifer recharge happens in summer when the wrb receives the majority of its annual precipitation enabling winter streamflow to respond to precipitation deficits even present in the antecedent summer in spring march may air temperature and precipitation start to escalate a combination of the growing precipitation and the snowmelt caused by the higher temperature induces an increased availability of surface water an important amount of which travels through the soil to become the soil moisture subsurface flow and groundwater flow the increase in subsurface flow diminishes the contribution of groundwater to streamflow in the river course which is backed by the baseflow index decreasing from 0 66 to 0 87 in winter to 0 36 0 69 in spring at five sub basins water transiting as the subsurface flow follows a shorter drainage path and thus has a relatively shorter residence time in comparison with the groundwater discharge to the stream as a result it is observed a noticeable decline in the drought response time in summer june august when the catchment is frequently subject to rainfall with high intensity the surface flow can increasingly take place because of the saturation and infiltration excess mechanisms the baseflow index continues decreasing to the lowest level 0 24 0 32 in the whole year the fast flow components surpassing the groundwater start to play a dominant role in the streamflow generation therefore the summer streamflow variability is primarily dependent on the precipitation anomalies at the short spi time scales and a hydrological drought is more likely to arise from the precipitation deficits in the most recent months with regard to the autumn september november the decreased temperature restrains the evaporative loss and the soil moisture maintains the high level in the catchment see fig 9 in spite of the reduction in the received precipitation hydrological droughts can respond to meteorological droughts following a shorter drainage path and at relatively short spi time scales during late autumn november water stored in the shallow soil layer may be exhausted producing the delayed hydrological response to meteorological droughts in some parts of the wrb the autumn shifts the downward trend in the baseflow index and witnesses a rise in the baseflow index 0 41 0 61 previous studies conducted by huang et al 2017 and wu et al 2018b in the wrb also indicated the similar seasonality in drought response time which is characterized by the delayed and rapid drought propagation in winter and summer respectively huang s and wu s works represent the use of the previously popular method in which only the linear correlation between meteorological and hydrological droughts is evaluated for identifying drought response time in the present study the drought response time of 2 8 1 4 2 8 and 7 4 months in spring summer autumn and winter is shorter as compared to the results 6 3 6 and 12 months in the corresponding seasons derived by huang et al 2017 the difference may notify the existence of nonlinear dependence of two types of droughts of concern as well as its role in determining drought response time analysis above also indicates that the time varying baseflow index is generally proportional to the hydrological drought response time throughout a year a high baseflow index means that the streamflow is mainly supplied by the deep groundwater which discharges to the stream following a long drainage path giving rise to the long time hydrological response in addition to the drought response time identified for each calendar month fig 7 presents in detail the spi ssi relationship in the form of the pearson correlation coefficients and the mi scores the strength of the spi ssi relationship provides an overall impression of the extent to which hydrological droughts are dependent upon meteorological droughts as depicted in fig 7 the highest dependence of the ssi on the spi is obtained in spring mainly in may and autumn september october with an exception at the upper reach of the wrb in winter the evapotranspiration is deduced to be partially responsible for the relatively lower spi ssi correlation in the remaining months in summer when the abundant precipitation occurs in phase with high temperature the intense evaporation is at the highest level of the year and the resultant water loss cannot be overlooked in the streamflow generation process therefore anomalies in the summer streamflow appear to be more related to the effective precipitation i e precipitation minus evapotranspiration rather than the precipitation alone with respect to the winter the streamflow is dominantly supplied by the steady groundwater discharge which is largely refilled by the infiltrated water in the preceding summer thus winter streamflow droughts can react to the precipitation deficits accumulated backward to the antecedent summer the fate of the infiltrated water is explained by retention in the root zone as soil moisture losses through evapotranspiration and recharge to groundwater apurv et al 2017 it suggests that the summer evapotranspiration can serve as a disturbance in the aquifer recharge process and thus exert influence on the winter streamflow variability to verify the assumption concerning summer intense evapotranspiration as a determinant of streamflow anomalies in summer and winter the spi ssi correlation is compared against the linkage between the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the ssi unlike the spi the spei proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 additionally takes into account the effect of evapotranspiration on drought development and normalizes the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration instead of the precipitation alone the ssi relationship with two types of meteorological drought indicators i e the spei and spi are jointly measured using the pearson correlation coefficient and mutual information metric difference in correlation calculated as cor r spei s s i c o r r spi s s i is presented in table 2 the consistently positive values of difference noted in summer and winter months remind that a higher degree of linkage between meteorological and hydrological droughts is available conditioned on the additional consideration of evapotranspiration influence similarly the role of evapotranspiration in the drought propagation is highlighted by barker et al 2016 who further recommended the use of the precipitation evapotranspiration index for the meteorological drought characterization in an attempt to give a clear picture of the climatic controls on the drought relationship although the spei having stronger association with the ssi seems to be more suitable for drought prorogation analysis the present study still utilizes the spi to characterize meteorological droughts with the purpose of keeping the effect of temperature separate for the following attribution analysis 4 4 variation of drought response time in a changing environment and a preliminary attribution analysis in a changing environment both climate and land surface are undergoing perceivable changes to provide insight into how the drought propagation process is affected by such changes variations of the drought response time are detected for the period 1962 2010 using the mann kendall mk trend test which is followed by a preliminary attribution analysis in contrast to the unique value of response time derived over the full analysis period 1962 2010 in subsections 4 2 and 4 3 a 25 year time window is utilized and moves from the beginning corresponding to the year 1962 to the end corresponding to the year 2010 of the spi and ssi series this yields 25 sets of windowed spi and ssi sub series using the proposed two stage statistical framework as depicted in fig 2 drought response time can be subsequently computed for each set of the pair wise spi ssi sub series in such a way drought response time can have 25 values on the time axis providing an opportunity to analyze its changes during the past half century the trend detection and attribution analysis are conducted with a particular focus on summer and winter which are associated with the shortest and longest drought response time in the whole year respectively as shown in table 3 drought response time in winter mostly becomes shorter over the period 1962 2010 but without significant downward trends being observed whereas there is an exception in the middle reach of the wrb the prompter reaction of hydrological droughts to meteorological ones in the majority of the study area is deduced to be associated with changes in catchment water storage and the severity of precipitation deficits propagating into the terrestrial part of the hydrological cycle firstly winter air temperature escalated at an annual rate of 0 0394 c 0 0357 c 0 0364 c 0 0419 c and 0 0433 c over the recent half century in the upper middle and lower reaches as well as two major tributaries namely the jrb and brb of the wrb three decades ago the chinese government initiated a large scale vegetation restoration program featuring the retirement of cultivated land on steep slopes and afforestation of degraded landscapes since the year 1982 the wrb in the domain of the implementation of the ambitious restoration project has experienced the growth of vegetation coverage the annual increments in the winter ndvi are estimated to be 4 71 10 3 year 5 38 10 3 year 4 92 10 3 year 1 78 10 3 year and 3 16 10 3 year in five sub basins a changing environment characterized by a warmer climate and the greener land surface jointly forces the intensified evapotranspiration rate as depicted in fig 8 across the wrb the intensification of evapotranspiration subsequently gives rise to the decline in moisture content at the top 2 m of soil layer fig 9 the drying trends in surface soil at multiple depths were also observed by a number of existing studies chen et al 2010 jia et al 2017 liang et al 2018 with focus on the present study area less water can travel deeper to recharge groundwater also resulting in the decreasing storage in the aquifer fig 8 in winter the baseflow indices as high as 0 66 0 87 indicate the dominant contribution of catchment storage to winter streamflow in the river course less water mainly in forms of soil moisture content and groundwater impounded in catchment is difficult to endure the relatively long term precipitation deficits thereby being partly responsible for the decreasing response time of hydrological droughts to their casual meteorological ones the other reason for the shorter response time in winter is closely linked to variations in meteorological drought severity mean values of winter precipitation deficits in each 25 year time window are successively calculated and found to ascend over the past half century fig 10 a it is reasonable to deduce that for the same catchment with the equivalent amount of water storage more intense precipitation shortage signals tend to more easily penetrate into the hydrological system and trigger the consequent streamflow deficits in a prompter way as for the exception noted in the middle reach of the wrb where drought response time however presents a marked upward trend river damming may play a central role in the 1970s the linjiacun reservoir with the storage capacity of 50 million m3 came into operation at the middle reach which is the only reservoir in the main course of the wei river reservoir operations are in favor of maintaining the minimum discharge essential for riverine ecosystem health in winter months therefore restraining the meteorological drought propagation along the hydrological cycle effects of reservoir operations on the drought propagation has been discussed in diverse catchments of spain lópez moreno et al 2013 vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 and china wang et al 2019 through comparative analysis a major finding presents that river regulation via the damming diminishes the hydrological sensitivity to precipitation variations at shorter time scales and leads to the delayed response which coincides well with the exceptional case in the middle reach in summer hydrological droughts tend to react to meteorological droughts at increasingly longer spi time scales three out of five sub basins exhibit significant upward trends in drought response time as previous attribution analysis in winter has highlighted the role of catchment storage and meteorological drought severity in drought propagation these two influential factors are examined in an effort to explicate the changing pattern of drought response time in summer as well baseflow indices of five sub basins attain the lowest level 0 24 0 32 reminding that streamflow generation in summer months is dominantly dependent on the horizontal movement of water in the unsaturated zone and overland flow instead of the groundwater flow in the deep aquifer trend detection using the mk test fig 9 discloses the descending trends in summer soil moisture at the shallow depth 0 2 m across the study area less moisture content in the catchment can lower the catchment resistance to precipitation deficits and speed up meteorological drought propagation through the terrestrial system decreased catchment storage therefore represents an unfavorable condition for explaining why drought response time in summer becomes increasingly longer over the past five decades however supportive evidence is provided when properties of meteorological droughts are under investigation the past half century witnesses the gradual alleviation of drought severity as shown in fig 10 b the mk test statistics are estimated to be 1 89 2 51 2 18 5 21 and 1 10 for a series of mean values of summer precipitation deficits in five sub basins given that meteorological droughts become less severe the catchment is able to withstand precipitation deficits persisting for a longer period of time giving rise to the hydrological response in a more delayed manner more obviously three sub basins i e the jrb and the middle and lower reaches with significantly longer response time exactly match with where precipitation deficits are markedly alleviated identified by the mk test statistic less than 1 96 it is reasonable to deduce that although the decrease in catchment storage corresponds to decreased resistance to hydrological drought this decreased resistance is offset by the decrease in meteorological drought severity as a result meteorological droughts with lower severity have a more vital role in determining the changing pattern of summer drought response time at the study site attribution analysis above mainly reveals the changing catchment water storage and meteorological drought severity as drivers responsible for variations in hydrological drought response time over the past half century to more intuitively illustrate their effects on drought propagation recession processes of catchment outflow under meteorological drought conditions are schematically outlined in a comparative way in which catchment storage fig 11 a as well as precipitation deficit severity fig 11 b is brought under control in fig 11 a scenarios 1 and 2 representing the high catchment storage and low storage are analyzed owing to higher storage in favor of yielding a larger amount of catchment outflow the initial value q 1 of recession segment in scenario 1 can be observably greater than that q 2 in scenario 2 when the catchment is subject to the meteorological drought with the same severity it will take a longer period of time for a higher initial value namely q 1 to decline below a threshold that indicates the occurrence of hydrological droughts this gives rise to response time 1 being much longer than response time 2 in fig 11 a evidencing the delay hydrological response conditional on the higher level of antecedent catchment storage moreover fig 11 b illustrates the impact of meteorological drought severity on drought propagation scenarios 3 and 4 differ in precipitation deficit signals with different severity as fig 11 b keeps the catchment storage invariant recession processes of the catchment outflow have the same initial values in scenarios 3 q 3 and 4 q 4 however when precipitation deficits separately occur with different severity the affected catchment outflow in scenarios 3 and 4 can plunge at different rates and start to diverge gradually recession rate of catchment outflow in the high severity deficit scenario is noticed to be greater than that in the low severity deficit scenario it is because much less precipitation in the case of a more severe meteorological drought can infiltrate to replenish the catchment in which water content is largely proportional to the yield of its outflow catchment outflow in scenario 3 reaches the threshold for streamflow deficits earlier than the counterpart in scenario 4 triggering response time 3 being shorter than response time 4 in fig 11 b thereby the rapid drought response pattern is expected given the occurrence of precipitation deficits with high severity in addition to the aforementioned two controls over the drought response time the role of diverse human interventions should be underlined river damming is found to decelerate the drought propagation from the atmosphere into the hydrological system on the contrary hydrological drought response is accelerated by groundwater pumping which has been investigated by apurv et al 2017 and tijdeman et al 2018b ultimately for a catchment in the same season which maintains the constant threshold for streamflow deficits hydrological drought response time is supposed to be a function of characteristics of atmospheric forcings the catchment storage and diverse human interventions which is also explained at the bottom of fig 11 5 conclusions increased understanding of the drought propagation mechanism favors enhanced skills in drought monitoring and early warning given the time lag effect widely present in drought propagation from one type to another the study particularly investigates the response time of hydrological droughts to meteorological droughts firstly a two stage statistical framework is proposed for accurately identifying the drought response time at an improved temporal i e the weekly resolution the monthly ssi series is initially cross correlated with the spi series at multiple weekly scales to determine the candidate drought response time through exclusively evaluating the linear and nonlinear dependence of streamflow anomalies on precipitation anomalies respectively in the second stage the deficit aspect of usable water resources is of special concern the number of streamflow deficits which can be properly monitored by the concurrent precipitation deficits is compared among each candidate response time to screen out the optimal one then drought response time at both annual and monthly scales is identified within the proposed framework which is beneficial to the spatial and temporal comparison finally variations of drought response time in a changing climate are detected over the past half century which is followed by a preliminary attribution analysis a case study is conducted for a typical region namely the wrb in the loess plateau china results show that the propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts diminishes the number of droughts but intensifies the severity and duration hydrological droughts usually react to the occurrence of meteorological droughts in a time lagged manner subsequently drought response time identification at an annual scale reveals that hydrological droughts in the wrb respond to meteorological drought at 25 week to 39 week time scales the noticeable spatial variability is found to be governed by the loess deposit depth and vegetation coverage which largely represent the catchment storage and precipitation interception capacity relatively long response time can be expected where there are major soil and vegetation coverage apart from the spatial variability drought response time also presents marked seasonality with the short term and long term hydrological response being observed in summer and winter respectively the time varying baseflow index is noted to be in direct proportion to the drought response time and thus have control over the seasonal variability the underlying mechanism is that a higher baseflow index in winter denotes a major supply of streamflow by deep groundwater which discharges to the stream following a long path resulting in the long time hydrological response additionally in a changing environment hydrological droughts in summer tend to respond to meteorological droughts at increasingly longer time scales while decreasing response time is seen in winter such changes are preliminarily attributed to variations in catchment water storage and meteorological drought severity over the past half century therefore attribution analysis above highlights a combination of factors which include the vegetation status soil deposit depth catchment storage and the changing meteorological drought severity have significant control on the spatio temporal variability in drought response time in the wrb these findings may improve our knowledge about the drought propagation mechanism and are in support of developing operational drought monitoring systems in addition to influential factors mainly representing the catchment properties investigated above evapotranspiration serving as an important disturbance in the precipitation streamflow relationship can impact the hydrological response time to meteorological droughts evaporative losses in the streamflow generation cannot be disregarded when abundant atmospheric water and high temperature are available simultaneously and especially in the context of current global warming therefore the role of evapotranspiration in the drought propagation which has been partially noticed in subsection 4 3 deserves further investigation in an attempt to provide a clear picture of both climatic and catchment controls over drought response time credit authorship contribution statement wei fang methodology software formal analysis writing original draft

5048,human activities have changed global nutrients cycling and appreciably altered marine ecosystems in riverine estuarine systems this is evident by the significant shifts in the supply of nitrogen and phosphorus however very little is known about the concentrations and fluxes and of these nutrients and their seasonal changes in hainan island china we examined hainan island which is the second largest island in china to assess the spatiotemporal concentrations and fluxes of nutrients using seasonal data on a whole of system scale covering river estuaries and adjacent coastal water 2017 the annual average total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp concentrations were 77 23 31 36 μmol l and 3 25 1 67 μmol l respectively the annual fluxes of pollutants from the discharge of coastal rivers on hainan island into coastal waters were 1 8 104 t for tdn and 1 1 103 t for tdp respectively the month with the largest contribution to the annual pollutants load was october which contributed 13 60 of tdn and 17 79 of tdp in addition the largest river fluxes were nandu river which contributed 7 5 103 t of tdn and 364 t of tdp the annual average concentrations of pollutants in the surface coastal water were 7 60 10 71 μmol l for dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and 0 24 0 31 μmol l for dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip the annual average n p ratios in coastal rivers and seawater were 30 and 65 which were significantly higher than the redfield ratio n p 16 the din and dip concentrations of most monitoring stations met the national first class seawater standards but the problem of nutrient pollution in some local coastal water areas was still outstanding the coastal water quality monitoring should consider the influence of tropical storms influence on hainan island the effective improvement of coastal water quality should be based on land ocean coordination monitoring of coastal water quality and the riverine nutrient flux of hainan island

part of the south china sea and separated by the qiongzhou strait from the leizhou peninsula of guangdong is the second largest island of china hainan island is characterized by a radial river system which mostly originates from the central mountainous area with high elevation zhao et al 2015 with rapid industrial and economic development on hainan island these rivers have been polluted to different degrees but have led to some local adjacent coastal water pollution department of ecological environmental protection in hainan province 2017 herbeck et al 2011 zhang et al 2019a b zhou 2013 in addition three red tides occurred in coastal waters adjacent to haikou and lingao city in 2016 department of hainan province ocean and fishery 2017 in recent years various studies on nutrients

that the characteristics of land based pollutants in hainan island and controlling land based pollution were elaborated to divide the coastal zone pollution control of hainan island however the marine coastal water quality was not linked to the characteristics of land based pollutants input and the composition and riverine discharge of nutrients into the coastal river estuaries greatly changed under intense rainstorms and human activity thereby resulting in a significant deterioration of the coastal environment and phytoplankton increases in coastal water chang 2006 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a zhou 2013 however few studies reported the whole island seasonal nutrient flux transport to the coastal waters in hainan island which is easily influenced by tropical typhoons land ocean

and pritchard 1986 su et al 2019 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 therefore the spatiotemporal river fluxes and response to adjacent coastal water quality in hainan island is important for understanding the coastal estuarine systems and improving the management of nutrient pollution of estuaries in order to address the aforementioned gaps in our understanding of the riverine and coastal systems the latest seasonal data which cover land based riverine inputs from january to december and coastal water quality three water seasons were also collected in 2017 we reported the concentration in estuaries of 19 major rivers and the coastal water quality response in hainan island in order to 1 assess the spatial nutrient contamination in the river estuaries 2 quantify the spatial distribution of the nutrient fluxes of 19 rivers into coastal waters 3 identify the spatiotemporal distribution of din and dip concentrations in coastal water adjacent to hainan island and 4 clarify the seasonal variation in n p in the coastal rivers inputs form hainan island and the seawater response this study provides a comprehensive data set on the river fluxes of major nutrients into the

of the national sea area the total coastline length of hainan province is 1928 km of which the coastline length of hainan island makes up 1618 km the average annual temperature t of the province in 2016 was 25 1 c the annual rainfall was 2176 7 mm department of ecological environmental protection in hainan province 2017 zhang et al 2019a hainan island has a tropical moist monsoonal climate and the topography is characterized by mountains in the central area and hills and alluvial plains in the coastal areas zhao et al 2015 in terms of the drainage area and mean discharge of the rivers in the island the largest is the nandu river a which drains the central and northern parts of the island and flows northward to the qiongzhou strait chang 2006 in addition there are many moderate sized and small sized rivers such as the lingshui ningyuan and zhubi rivers on the island details of the discharge of coastal rivers into the coastal water on hainan island are shown in the table1 2 2 data sources and analytical method the data of this study were derived from the hainan provincial department of ecological environmental protection of which march and may 2017 represented the dry season july and august represented the wet season and october and november represented the normal season the river estuary and coastal water quality monitoring are shown in fig 1 the din and dip seawater samples were first filtered with a 0 45 μm pore size acetate cellulose filter membrane and the water samples were stored in a refrigerator before analysis 20 c after the water samples were collected the dissolved nutrients in the water were measured in accordance with the method specified in the specification of oceanographic survey state bureau of quality technical supervision 2007 the din and dip concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry din is the sum of the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n and the dip is po4 3 p the chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended particles tsp dissolved oxygen do water t ph salinity s and other environmental parameters were determined in accordance with the method specified in the specification of oceanographic survey state bureau of quality technical supervision 2007 for the coastal river freshwater samples field sampling was performed according to the technical specifications requirements for monitoring of surface water and waste water by the ministry of environmental protection china mepc 2002b the water sampling sites were all downriver of the estuaries to avoid the negative impacts from coastal water tdn and tdp were decomposed to no3 and po4 3 with a boracic acid persulfate oxidation solution and then measured in accordance with the method of no3 and po4 3 grasshoff et al 1999 2 3 riverine flows and fluxes of tdn and tdp in this study the river fluxes of tdn and tdp were calculated as follows nutrient exports were estimated from hainan island which represented the nutrient loads from the most downstream main channel station with water discharge data according to the field monitoring data obtained by the hainan provincial department of ecological environmental protection the river freshwater discharges were not included in the total fluxes owing to the influence of high tide in the investigation period thus river estuary monitoring stations were used to quantify the fluxes of nutrients transported from the river estuaries to the coastal water the annual riverine fluxes of nutrients used here were classically estimated using the following equation f i c i j q i j where fi g is the annual flux of the nutrients in river i c i j g m3 is the average concentration of the species in the river i during month j and qi j m3 is the cumulative discharge of river i during month j 2 4 statistical analyses the correlation between variables was determined by spearman correlation between the environmental factors and coastal water quality using spss 22 0 a regression test was also used to identify the relationship between the control of environmental factors on nutrient characteristics where the nutrient concentration was set as the dependent variables and the s was set as the independent variables statistical analyses were conducted at a significance level of p 0 05 for each regression by origin lab 9 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of tdn and tdp concentrations in the coastal rivers of hainan island the spatial patterns of the tdn and tdp concentrations in the coastal rivers of hainan island are shown in fig 2 the results indicated that there was a wide variation in the spatial distribution the annual average concentration of tdn was 77 23 31 36 μmol l with a range of 14 99 μmol l to 368 31 μmol l the maximum and minimum concentrations were found in b in july and october respectively according to the environmental quality standards for surface water in china mepc 2002a the water quality of 7 river estuary monitoring stations was better than standard iii which accounted for 36 84 of the 19 river estuary stations and 31 58 river monitoring stationswas between standards iiiand iv in addition the 6 river estuary stations between standards ivand v were identified as a b f g k and n which had annual average concentrations of 118 55 125 21 109 80 120 51 121 28 and 124 55 μmol l respectively comparatively the annual average concentration of tdp was 3 25 1 67 μmol l with a range from 0 00 μmol l to 10 01 μmol l the maximum and minimum concentrations were found in k in july and b in february respectively the water quality of 10 river monitoring stations was better than the water quality standard ii which accounted for 52 63 of the total stations furthermore 42 11 of the monitoring stations were between standards iiiand iv only one river estuary of k had water quality that was inferior to the water quality standard iii with a mean concentration of 7 24 μmol l in addition high concentrations of both tdn and tdp were found in k in all seasons 3 2 spatiotemporal fluxes of tdn and tdp in the coastal rivers of hainan island the flux patterns of tdn and tdp in coastal rivers of hainan island had different spatiotemporal scales fig 3 the estimated annual fluxes of pollutants discharged from the main rivers of hainan island discharge into coastal waters were 1 8 104 t for tdn and 1 1 103 t for tdp for the tdn and tdp monthly flux patterns the tdn and tdp of the 19 rivers had similar trends the tdn and tdp load from the 19 coastal rivers into the coastal waters peaked in october in the normal season and accounted for 13 60 and 17 79 of the annual load discharge respectively the lowest tdn and tdp fluxes were in december and march in the dry season which only contributed 5 16 and 5 27 of the annual flux respectively in addition the spatial distributions of riverine tdn and tdp inputs were identified and showed a wide range pattern fig 3 in the 19 coastal rivers in hainan island the largest river flux was from a which contributed 7 5 103 t for tdn and 364 t for tdp this was because that the a is the largest river with the largest drainage area and mean freshwater discharge of the rivers on the island fig 1 most of tdn and tdp discharge into coastal water were contributed by a c n and s which accounted for 90 91 and 84 23 respectively the contributions of tdn and tdp in a c n and s were 41 68 15 48 13 98 and 19 77 for tdn and 32 02 16 96 18 33 and 16 93 for tdp respectively moreover the other rivers m d g i h and j contributed 1 6 103 t of tdn and 180 t of tdp in the annual load 3 3 spatiotemporal distribution of din and dip concentrations in the adjacent coastal water of hainan island the spatiotemporal distribution of the din and dip concentrations in the adjacent coastal water of hainan island was determined during the investigation period in 2017 fig 4 there were significant differences in the din and dip concentrations among the dry wet and normal seasons by one way anova p 0 05 the results showed that the annual average concentration of din was 7 60 10 71 μmol l with a range from 1 07 μmol l to 56 64 μmol l the average concentration of din in the dry season was 4 33 1 18 μmol l with a range from 1 07 μmol l to 6 57 μmol l the average concentration of din in the wet season was 8 14 5 14 μmol l ranging from 1 29 to 29 71 μmol l the average concentration of din in the normal season was 10 45 9 53 μmol l ranging from 1 86 to 56 64 μmol l fig 4 n nh4 n no2 and n no3 comprised 2 61 2 17 1 04 1 00 and 3 99 4 84 μmol l of the annual mean din respectively in addition n no3 and n nh4 accounted for 46 0 and 40 1 while n no2 accounted for 13 9 respectively n no3 and n nh4 were the main species of din comparatively the annual average concentration of dip was 0 24 0 31 μmol l with a range from 0 00 μmol l to 2 71 μmol l the average concentration of dip in dry season was 0 22 0 09 μmol l with a range from 0 03 μmol l to 0 35 μmol l the average concentration of dip in the wet season was 0 17 0 25 μmol l with a range from 0 00 μmol l to 1 35 μmol l in the normal season the average concentration of dip was 0 33 0 47 μmol l fluctuating from 0 00 μmol l to 2 71 μmol l fig 4 the high concentrations of din and dip in coastal water areas appeared in a estuary in the adjacent coastal water of haikou city some coastal water areas of qionghai city and xiaohai coastal water of wanning city 3 4 seasonal variation in the input of n p from coastal rivers of hainan island and seawater response the riverine exports of nutrients have a key influence on the nutrient composition in receiving adjacent coastal water redfield et al 1963 proposed a fixed element ratio n p 16 1 for sustained growth of aquatic organisms redfield et al 1963 the din dip ratio showed a relatively wide variation 7 702 with an average value 65 81 in surface water in annual average that was considerably higher than the redfield ratio 16 except for that in the dry season fig 5 the din dip ratio was much higher in the wet season 121 112 in surface water and normal season 51 46 in surface water than in the dry season 23 13 in surface water owing to the higher din concentration but lower dip concentration in the normal and wet seasons comparatively the seasonal tdn tdp ratio in riverine estuary water was not significantly different p 0 05 the annual tdn tdp ratios in river estuaries were lower than the din dip ratios of seawater except for in the dry season with a relatively wider range 3 190 with an average value of 30 36 in surface water in the annual average which was also significantly higher than the redfield ratio 16 in seawater the tdn tdp ratio was higher in the wet season 33 45 in surface water than those in the normal 29 40 in surface water and dry seasons 27 17 in surface water owing to the higher tdn concentration but relatively lower tdp concentration in the dry season in addition overall n was relatively excessive and p was relatively insufficient in the river estuary waters of hainan island this was one of the possible key reasons that the adjacent coastal water of hainan island was characterized by p limitation 4 discussion 4 1 status of nutrient concentrations and composition during the three periods the din and dip concentrations presented clear seasonal variations under the impacts of complex hydrological and biogeochemical conditions according to the seawater quality standard of china gb3097 1997 the din and dip concentrations at most monitoring stations met the national first class seawater standards aqsiq 1997 in comparison the concentrations of din and dip in this study were comparable to those found in most of the coastal waters listed in table 2 as for the din concentration the values were larger than those in the bohai sea south yellow sea and north yellow sea while the din values were lower than those east china sea coastal water li et al 2003 song et al 2016 yang et al 2020 ye et al 2017 on one hand the concentrations of oxidized nitrogen species of n no2 and n no3 were higher than those of the reduced nitrogen species among the din n no3 may have originated from strong land based nitrogen source inputs liu et al 2011 on the other hand the n nh4 concentration could have been attributed to the large scale conversion of mangrove forests into aquaculture ponds i e turning nutrient sinks into sources during the past decades also had consequences for the adjacent coastal waters herbeck et al 2020 the aquaculture ponds contain high concentrations of n nh4 and dissolved organic nitrogen liu et al 2011 for the dip concentrations the values were lower than those in the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea coastal waters in terms of nutrient composition the annual average din dip values were greater than those in other coastal waters in china such as the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea this might have been attributed to the monitoring stations located in adjacent coastal waters li et al 2003 song et al 2016 yang et al 2020 ye et al 2017 high din dip concentrations were mostly observed and distributed in adjacent coastal waters in china the growth of phytoplankton was potentially limited by p redfield et al 1963 which has an important impact on the growth reproduction and species composition of the phytoplankton in addition overall n is relatively excessive and p is relatively insufficient in the coastal waters of hainan island which is characterized by p limitation in this study sundareshwar et al 2003 zhang et al 2019a this may affect the primary productivity species distribution and ecosystem structure of phytoplankton in the offshore waters of hainan island the main reasons for the tdn and tdp high concentrations in river estuaries were influenced by large contribution of agricultural fertilizer application municipal sewage discharge and the poultry livestock culture in the watersheds zhang et al 2019a zhou 2013 in comparison to the tdn concentration the tdp concentration in river estuary stations were relatively low and could lead to the adjacent coastal water of hainan island being characterized by p limitation as for the hotspots of din and dip in coastal water human activities played an important role the north coast contains haikou which is the most populated city on hainan island and a which is the river with the largest freshwater discharge flows through farmland and livestock and poultry breeding area thereby bringing high levels of nutrients wastewater and agricultural run off from the central island into the estuary fig 1 therefore the riverine sources were the main cause of the high levels of nutrients in the north of hainan island in addition the hydrodynamics also have a significant influence on the status of nutrients in hainan island for example the xiaohai coastal waters are in a semi enclosed bay its coastal water exchange capacity is weak and several rivers discharge nutrients into the coastal water moreover coastal aquaculture industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater discharge into the small sea occupied which may be an important reason for the excess din and dip in the local coastal waters of hainan island herbeck et al 2013 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a 4 2 correlation analysis of influencing factors on adjacent coastal water quality in hainan island the correlation coefficients indicated that the influencing factors of the din and dip concentrations showed clear variation in different seasons in the adjacent coastal water of hainan island table 3 table 3 shows that there were significant negative correlations between s and din and dip in the wet and normal seasons p 0 001 but not in the dry season which proved that the nutrients in surface coastal water were mainly affected by the terrestrial input zhang et al 2019a in the wet and normal seasons the freshwater discharge was larger than that in the dry season which resulted in more nitrogen and phosphorus discharge into coastal waters in the dry season the fluxes of tdn and tdp decreased with the decrease in freshwater flow this suggested that din and dip are related to river freshwater discharge and seawater dilution in the adjacent coastal water of hainan the din and dip concentrations were positively correlated with each other table 3 thereby indicating their common origins and similar cycling processes such as the assimilation and reproduction by remineralization yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a din had significant positive relationships between n species p 0 01 except for n no3 in the dry season n no3 was the major form of din in the coastal water of hainan island although n nh4 and n no2 were also the important composition to din zhou 2013 in addition the results indicated significant positive correlations between the concentrations of cod din and dip in all seasons p 0 05 this indicated their common riverine source and that the organic nitrogen and phosphorous in coastal water can also transform into din and dip respectively yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b as for the spatial differences in the nutrient distribution patterns human activities could not be neglected first the a and n are located in haikou which is the most populous city in hainan province zhou 2013 the tdn and tdp fluxes can be affected by municipal and industrial sewage discharge poultry livestock culture and other aquaculture contributions zhang et al 2019a second the tdn and tdp fluxes were influenced by agricultural fertilizer application and aquaculture in the watershed furthermore submarine groundwater discharge with inputs of nutrients in certain regions may play a significant role in controlling the nutrients in the adjacent coastal water ji et al 2013 previous studies in the laoye lagoon of hainan island verified that the submarine groundwater discharge derived nutrient fluxes in mol d were din 1 7 105 and dip 5 2 102 according to radium isotope method ji et al 2013 nutrients in coastal water may also change with the seasonal variation in submarine groundwater discharge 4 3 seasonal change of din and dip behavior in hainan island coastal water s is regarded as a conservative tracer in the ocean because it was not produced or removed by chemical or biological processes without occurring any reaction except for the dilution of freshwater with seawater wu et al 2016 in conservative mixing the concentration of a nutrient can be expressed as a linear function of s along a continuum boyle et al 1974 wu et al 2016 2017 when the range in the s of the investigated stations in coastal water of hainan island was wide the relationship between the nutrients and s in the coastal water of hainan island showed that din and dip demonstrated conservative mixing behaviors in the wet and normal season due to the tidal mixing effect and the riverine inputs and their influenced on the distributions of din and dip fig 6 higher din and dip concentrations were found in estuaries with large river water input such as the adjacent coastal waters of the yangtze river yellow river and pearl river in china fan and huang 2008 li et al 2017 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the din concentration was significantly negatively correlated with the change in s in the wet and normal seasons r2 0 135 and 0 768 respectively p 0 01 however no significant linear correlation was observed in dry season on one hand the river discharge was relatively low in the dry season thereby leading to the decrease in the nutrient flux input to coastal water on the other hand there were other inner dominant processes of din induced by biological activities phytoplankton uptake and bacteria assimilation wu et al 2016 in addition the dip concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with the change in s in the wet and normal seasons but not in the dry season r2 0 313 and 0 712 respectively p 0 001 this was because the river discharge was relatively low in dry season thereby leading to the decrease in tdp flux input the dip concentrations also decreased rapidly in the dry season which was possibly due to the effects of suspended solids on adsorption and sedimentation li et al 2017 slomp 2011 wu et al 2017 this indicated that the seasonal change in the dip concentration was mainly affected by riverine inputs and the hydrological conditions in the coastal water of hainan island 4 4 impacts of freshwater discharge and tropical storms on riverine nutrient flux inputs to coastal water the results indicated that significant relationships between the water discharge and nutrients fluxes were observed fig 7 a the tdn and tdp fluxes were significantly positively correlated with the monthly freshwater discharge flow r2 0 934 and 0 803 respectively p 0 001 the seasonal river discharge was the predominant influencing factor on the monthly nutrient flux fig 7b therefore the high nutrient loads in the normal season could possibly be attributed to the large freshwater discharges induced by tropical storms the coastal river fluxes of nutrients were influenced by strong rainstorms in the tropical environment chen et al 2018 herbeck et al 2011 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 in 2017 there were 17 regional tropical storms in hainan which was approximately 7 times more than that in the same period thereby making it the year with the most frequently occurring storms in the history of regional rainstorms fig 7c the two local tropical storms in the normal season and one local tropical storm caused heavy rain and flood disasters in local cities and counties hainan meteorological service 2017 heavy tropical storms often significantly increase both river freshwater flows and their nutrient fluxes therefore the local climate including meteorological and hydrological conditions often determines the seasonal pattern of nutrient fluxes to coastal waters the results showed that river freshwater flow was clearly higher than that in other months when tropical severe typhoon khanun landed on hainan island in october hainan meteorological service 2017 however little was known about the effect of the storm event related heavy precipitation on the tropical island s estuarine dynamics because of the unpredictability of storm formation and tracks it is difficult to arrange for appropriate storm sampling herbeck et al 2011 the increase of riverine freshwater and nutrients fluxes induced by tropical typhoon in this study was consistent with those of former studies in the biscayne bay neuse river estuary and pamlico sound in the usa paerl et al 2018 wachnicka et al 2019 similarly the phenomenon was also observed in the xiamen bay jiaozhou bay and pearl river estuary which are semi enclosed coastal waters in china chen et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the tropical storms can not only lead to the increase in nutrient fluxes but also induce increases in n p supplied from the estuary to the coastal region thereby increasing the degree of p limitation chen et al 2018 the frequency of storm rainfall is expected to continue in the foreseeable future paerl et al 2018 therefore intensive monitoring of river water quality and quantity should be introduced for the reliable and accurate determination of fluxes during storm events in hainan island 4 5 land ocean integration management of coastal water quality and riverine nutrient flux inputs owing to the advantages of the hainan eco civilization in china and the implementation plan of national eco civilization test zone hainan in hainan province cccpc 2019 land ocean integration monitoring of coastal water quality and riverine nutrient flux inputs should be introduced in the plan based on the land ocean spatial monitoring stations the seawater quality monitoring stations currently mismatch the land based pollutants input seawater quality monitoring stations mismatch the land based river pollutants input in monitoring frequency and time month day and hour though we linked the river and coastal water data in the same month the coastal water monitoring station should record the land based pollutants input for example the estuaries and sewage outlets should have intensive monitoring stations covering the coastal mixed zone and the distance of the monitoring stations offshore should be appropriately reduced in the next filed monitoring scheme furthermore an optimized coastal monitoring network should use a water quality response for improved reliability and efficiency duan et al 2019 in addition the critical riverine nutrient source area of the watershed of a should be implemented in the tdn and tdp land based pollutant source control due to the largest contribution to the fluxes of tdn and tdp and response in coastal water quality on one hand for the control of land based pollutants in china n nh4 is the main indicator but tdn pollution control has not been conducted in implemented emission reduction plans lu et al 2016 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b on the other hand the coastal water quality of nitrogen and phosphorus were din and dip respectively consequently inconsistencies between river and coastal water quality exist in monitoring indicators the total land based pollution control and supervision of river nutrient discharge into the sea should be strengthened in pollution areas strokal et al 2017 and coastal water quality should be linked with total pollutant load control management for nitrogen and phosphorus in the future 5 conclusions in summary our study showed the spatiotemporal riverine nutrient fluxes in response to adjacent coastal water quality in hainan island the spatial patterns of tdn and tdp concentrations in coastal rivers of hainan island indicated that the concentrations varied at different times and within different rivers the annual average tdn and tdp concentrations were 77 23 31 36 μmol l and 3 25 1 67 μmol l respectively the river flux patterns of tdn and tdp were significantly different in spatiotemporal scale the annual fluxes of pollutants from the discharge of coastal water of hainan into coastal waters were 1 8 104 t for tdn and 1 1 103 t for tdp respectively the seasonal water discharge was the predominant influencing factor on the monthly nutrient flux in addition the adjacent coastal water quality in response to the river tdn and tdp inputs was significantly different in the dry wet and normal seasons most monitoring stations of din and dip concentrations met the national first class seawater standards but the problem of nutrient pollution in some local coastal water areas was still outstanding the nutrients in the surface coastal water were mainly affected by the terrestrial input in the wet and normal seasons overall n was relatively excessive and p was relatively insufficient in the coastal waters of hainan island which were characterized by p limitation land ocean integration management of coastal water quality and riverine nutrient flux inputs should be introduced to effectively and efficiently control river and coastal water quality in the future

5048,human activities have changed global nutrients cycling and appreciably altered marine ecosystems in riverine estuarine systems this is evident by the significant shifts in the supply of nitrogen and phosphorus however very little is known about the concentrations and fluxes and of these nutrients and their seasonal changes in hainan island china we examined hainan island which is the second largest island in china to assess the spatiotemporal concentrations and fluxes of nutrients using seasonal data on a whole of system scale covering river estuaries and adjacent coastal water 2017 the annual average total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorus tdp concentrations were 77 23 31 36 μmol l and 3 25 1 67 μmol l respectively the annual fluxes of pollutants from the discharge of coastal rivers on hainan island into coastal waters were 1 8 104 t for tdn and 1 1 103 t for tdp respectively the month with the largest contribution to the annual pollutants load was october which contributed 13 60 of tdn and 17 79 of tdp in addition the largest river fluxes were nandu river which contributed 7 5 103 t of tdn and 364 t of tdp the annual average concentrations of pollutants in the surface coastal water were 7 60 10 71 μmol l for dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and 0 24 0 31 μmol l for dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip the annual average n p ratios in coastal rivers and seawater were 30 and 65 which were significantly higher than the redfield ratio n p 16 the din and dip concentrations of most monitoring stations met the national first class seawater standards but the problem of nutrient pollution in some local coastal water areas was still outstanding the coastal water quality monitoring should consider the influence of tropical storms influence on hainan island the effective improvement of coastal water quality should be based on land ocean coordination monitoring of coastal water quality and the riverine nutrient flux of hainan island

cycling of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorous dip in coastal waters ding et al 2019 liu et al 2016 lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019b according to the surface water quality standard tdn and tdp are the land surface water quality indicators mepc 2002a b however the din and dip are the indicators of marine water quality in the sea water quality standard gb3097 1997 in china aqsiq 1997 the dip is frequently the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth in many marine environments sundareshwar et al 2003 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a the excess tdn and tdp derived from extensive leaching from agricultural fertilizer industrial and municipal sewage discharge have adverse effects on adjacent water quality hainan island which is located in the northern part of the south china sea and separated by the qiongzhou strait from the leizhou peninsula of guangdong is the second largest island of china hainan island is characterized by a radial river system which mostly originates from the central mountainous area with high elevation zhao et al 2015 with rapid industrial and economic development on hainan island these rivers have been polluted to different degrees but have led to some local adjacent coastal water pollution department of ecological environmental protection in hainan province 2017 herbeck et al 2011 zhang et al 2019a b zhou 2013 in addition three red tides occurred in coastal waters adjacent to haikou and lingao city in 2016 department of hainan province ocean and fishery 2017 in recent years various studies on nutrients contamination in rivers estuaries and adjacent coastal areas have been conducted chang 2006 huang 2012 li et al 2010 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a zhao et al 2015 zhou 2013 previous studies showed that the characteristics of land based pollutants in hainan island and controlling land based pollution were elaborated to divide the coastal zone pollution control of hainan island however the marine coastal water quality was not linked to the characteristics of land based pollutants input and the composition and riverine discharge of nutrients into the coastal river estuaries greatly changed under intense rainstorms and human activity thereby resulting in a significant deterioration of the coastal environment and phytoplankton increases in coastal water chang 2006 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a zhou 2013 however few studies reported the whole island seasonal nutrient flux transport to the coastal waters in hainan island which is easily influenced by tropical typhoons land ocean integration has been recognized as the key factor when dealing with sea use and marine pollution which needs to coordinate the river watershed regions and coastal management powley et al 2018 schubel and pritchard 1986 su et al 2019 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 therefore the spatiotemporal river fluxes and response to adjacent coastal water quality in hainan island is important for understanding the coastal estuarine systems and improving the management of nutrient pollution of estuaries in order to address the aforementioned gaps in our understanding of the riverine and coastal systems the latest seasonal data which cover land based riverine inputs from january to december and coastal water quality three water seasons were also collected in 2017 we reported the concentration in estuaries of 19 major rivers and the coastal water quality response in hainan island in order to 1 assess the spatial nutrient contamination in the river estuaries 2 quantify the spatial distribution of the nutrient fluxes of 19 rivers into coastal waters 3 identify the spatiotemporal distribution of din and dip concentrations in coastal water adjacent to hainan island and 4 clarify the seasonal variation in n p in the coastal rivers inputs form hainan island and the seawater response this study provides a comprehensive data set on the river fluxes of major nutrients into the coastal water and the water quality response which is beneficial for nutrient load reduction in hainan island within the chinese total pollutant load control system and will also provide fundamental information for marine environmental protection in hainan island 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hainan island is located at the southernmost end of china across from the qiongzhou strait to the north and faces the leizhou peninsula fig 1 hainan island is the second largest island in china after taiwan island with a coastal water area of approximately 2 million km2 which accounts for 42 3 of the national sea area the total coastline length of hainan province is 1928 km of which the coastline length of hainan island makes up 1618 km the average annual temperature t of the province in 2016 was 25 1 c the annual rainfall was 2176 7 mm department of ecological environmental protection in hainan province 2017 zhang et al 2019a hainan island has a tropical moist monsoonal climate and the topography is characterized by mountains in the central area and hills and alluvial plains in the coastal areas zhao et al 2015 in terms of the drainage area and mean discharge of the rivers in the island the largest is the nandu river a which drains the central and northern parts of the island and flows northward to the qiongzhou strait chang 2006 in addition there are many moderate sized and small sized rivers such as the lingshui ningyuan and zhubi rivers on the island details of the discharge of coastal rivers into the coastal water on hainan island are shown in the table1 2 2 data sources and analytical method the data of this study were derived from the hainan provincial department of ecological environmental protection of which march and may 2017 represented the dry season july and august represented the wet season and october and november represented the normal season the river estuary and coastal water quality monitoring are shown in fig 1 the din and dip seawater samples were first filtered with a 0 45 μm pore size acetate cellulose filter membrane and the water samples were stored in a refrigerator before analysis 20 c after the water samples were collected the dissolved nutrients in the water were measured in accordance with the method specified in the specification of oceanographic survey state bureau of quality technical supervision 2007 the din and dip concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry din is the sum of the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n and the dip is po4 3 p the chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended particles tsp dissolved oxygen do water t ph salinity s and other environmental parameters were determined in accordance with the method specified in the specification of oceanographic survey state bureau of quality technical supervision 2007 for the coastal river freshwater samples field sampling was performed according to the technical specifications requirements for monitoring of surface water and waste water by the ministry of environmental protection china mepc 2002b the water sampling sites were all downriver of the estuaries to avoid the negative impacts from coastal water tdn and tdp were decomposed to no3 and po4 3 with a boracic acid persulfate oxidation solution and then measured in accordance with the method of no3 and po4 3 grasshoff et al 1999 2 3 riverine flows and fluxes of tdn and tdp in this study the river fluxes of tdn and tdp were calculated as follows nutrient exports were estimated from hainan island which represented the nutrient loads from the most downstream main channel station with water discharge data according to the field monitoring data obtained by the hainan provincial department of ecological environmental protection the river freshwater discharges were not included in the total fluxes owing to the influence of high tide in the investigation period thus river estuary monitoring stations were used to quantify the fluxes of nutrients transported from the river estuaries to the coastal water the annual riverine fluxes of nutrients used here were classically estimated using the following equation f i c i j q i j where fi g is the annual flux of the nutrients in river i c i j g m3 is the average concentration of the species in the river i during month j and qi j m3 is the cumulative discharge of river i during month j 2 4 statistical analyses the correlation between variables was determined by spearman correlation between the environmental factors and coastal water quality using spss 22 0 a regression test was also used to identify the relationship between the control of environmental factors on nutrient characteristics where the nutrient concentration was set as the dependent variables and the s was set as the independent variables statistical analyses were conducted at a significance level of p 0 05 for each regression by origin lab 9 3 results 3 1 spatial patterns of tdn and tdp concentrations in the coastal rivers of hainan island the spatial patterns of the tdn and tdp concentrations in the coastal rivers of hainan island are shown in fig 2 the results indicated that there was a wide variation in the spatial distribution the annual average concentration of tdn was 77 23 31 36 μmol l with a range of 14 99 μmol l to 368 31 μmol l the maximum and minimum concentrations were found in b in july and october respectively according to the environmental quality standards for surface water in china mepc 2002a the water quality of 7 river estuary monitoring stations was better than standard iii which accounted for 36 84 of the 19 river estuary stations and 31 58 river monitoring stationswas between standards iiiand iv in addition the 6 river estuary stations between standards ivand v were identified as a b f g k and n which had annual average concentrations of 118 55 125 21 109 80 120 51 121 28 and 124 55 μmol l respectively comparatively the annual average concentration of tdp was 3 25 1 67 μmol l with a range from 0 00 μmol l to 10 01 μmol l the maximum and minimum concentrations were found in k in july and b in february respectively the water quality of 10 river monitoring stations was better than the water quality standard ii which accounted for 52 63 of the total stations furthermore 42 11 of the monitoring stations were between standards iiiand iv only one river estuary of k had water quality that was inferior to the water quality standard iii with a mean concentration of 7 24 μmol l in addition high concentrations of both tdn and tdp were found in k in all seasons 3 2 spatiotemporal fluxes of tdn and tdp in the coastal rivers of hainan island the flux patterns of tdn and tdp in coastal rivers of hainan island had different spatiotemporal scales fig 3 the estimated annual fluxes of pollutants discharged from the main rivers of hainan island discharge into coastal waters were 1 8 104 t for tdn and 1 1 103 t for tdp for the tdn and tdp monthly flux patterns the tdn and tdp of the 19 rivers had similar trends the tdn and tdp load from the 19 coastal rivers into the coastal waters peaked in october in the normal season and accounted for 13 60 and 17 79 of the annual load discharge respectively the lowest tdn and tdp fluxes were in december and march in the dry season which only contributed 5 16 and 5 27 of the annual flux respectively in addition the spatial distributions of riverine tdn and tdp inputs were identified and showed a wide range pattern fig 3 in the 19 coastal rivers in hainan island the largest river flux was from a which contributed 7 5 103 t for tdn and 364 t for tdp this was because that the a is the largest river with the largest drainage area and mean freshwater discharge of the rivers on the island fig 1 most of tdn and tdp discharge into coastal water were contributed by a c n and s which accounted for 90 91 and 84 23 respectively the contributions of tdn and tdp in a c n and s were 41 68 15 48 13 98 and 19 77 for tdn and 32 02 16 96 18 33 and 16 93 for tdp respectively moreover the other rivers m d g i h and j contributed 1 6 103 t of tdn and 180 t of tdp in the annual load 3 3 spatiotemporal distribution of din and dip concentrations in the adjacent coastal water of hainan island the spatiotemporal distribution of the din and dip concentrations in the adjacent coastal water of hainan island was determined during the investigation period in 2017 fig 4 there were significant differences in the din and dip concentrations among the dry wet and normal seasons by one way anova p 0 05 the results showed that the annual average concentration of din was 7 60 10 71 μmol l with a range from 1 07 μmol l to 56 64 μmol l the average concentration of din in the dry season was 4 33 1 18 μmol l with a range from 1 07 μmol l to 6 57 μmol l the average concentration of din in the wet season was 8 14 5 14 μmol l ranging from 1 29 to 29 71 μmol l the average concentration of din in the normal season was 10 45 9 53 μmol l ranging from 1 86 to 56 64 μmol l fig 4 n nh4 n no2 and n no3 comprised 2 61 2 17 1 04 1 00 and 3 99 4 84 μmol l of the annual mean din respectively in addition n no3 and n nh4 accounted for 46 0 and 40 1 while n no2 accounted for 13 9 respectively n no3 and n nh4 were the main species of din comparatively the annual average concentration of dip was 0 24 0 31 μmol l with a range from 0 00 μmol l to 2 71 μmol l the average concentration of dip in dry season was 0 22 0 09 μmol l with a range from 0 03 μmol l to 0 35 μmol l the average concentration of dip in the wet season was 0 17 0 25 μmol l with a range from 0 00 μmol l to 1 35 μmol l in the normal season the average concentration of dip was 0 33 0 47 μmol l fluctuating from 0 00 μmol l to 2 71 μmol l fig 4 the high concentrations of din and dip in coastal water areas appeared in a estuary in the adjacent coastal water of haikou city some coastal water areas of qionghai city and xiaohai coastal water of wanning city 3 4 seasonal variation in the input of n p from coastal rivers of hainan island and seawater response the riverine exports of nutrients have a key influence on the nutrient composition in receiving adjacent coastal water redfield et al 1963 proposed a fixed element ratio n p 16 1 for sustained growth of aquatic organisms redfield et al 1963 the din dip ratio showed a relatively wide variation 7 702 with an average value 65 81 in surface water in annual average that was considerably higher than the redfield ratio 16 except for that in the dry season fig 5 the din dip ratio was much higher in the wet season 121 112 in surface water and normal season 51 46 in surface water than in the dry season 23 13 in surface water owing to the higher din concentration but lower dip concentration in the normal and wet seasons comparatively the seasonal tdn tdp ratio in riverine estuary water was not significantly different p 0 05 the annual tdn tdp ratios in river estuaries were lower than the din dip ratios of seawater except for in the dry season with a relatively wider range 3 190 with an average value of 30 36 in surface water in the annual average which was also significantly higher than the redfield ratio 16 in seawater the tdn tdp ratio was higher in the wet season 33 45 in surface water than those in the normal 29 40 in surface water and dry seasons 27 17 in surface water owing to the higher tdn concentration but relatively lower tdp concentration in the dry season in addition overall n was relatively excessive and p was relatively insufficient in the river estuary waters of hainan island this was one of the possible key reasons that the adjacent coastal water of hainan island was characterized by p limitation 4 discussion 4 1 status of nutrient concentrations and composition during the three periods the din and dip concentrations presented clear seasonal variations under the impacts of complex hydrological and biogeochemical conditions according to the seawater quality standard of china gb3097 1997 the din and dip concentrations at most monitoring stations met the national first class seawater standards aqsiq 1997 in comparison the concentrations of din and dip in this study were comparable to those found in most of the coastal waters listed in table 2 as for the din concentration the values were larger than those in the bohai sea south yellow sea and north yellow sea while the din values were lower than those east china sea coastal water li et al 2003 song et al 2016 yang et al 2020 ye et al 2017 on one hand the concentrations of oxidized nitrogen species of n no2 and n no3 were higher than those of the reduced nitrogen species among the din n no3 may have originated from strong land based nitrogen source inputs liu et al 2011 on the other hand the n nh4 concentration could have been attributed to the large scale conversion of mangrove forests into aquaculture ponds i e turning nutrient sinks into sources during the past decades also had consequences for the adjacent coastal waters herbeck et al 2020 the aquaculture ponds contain high concentrations of n nh4 and dissolved organic nitrogen liu et al 2011 for the dip concentrations the values were lower than those in the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea coastal waters in terms of nutrient composition the annual average din dip values were greater than those in other coastal waters in china such as the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea this might have been attributed to the monitoring stations located in adjacent coastal waters li et al 2003 song et al 2016 yang et al 2020 ye et al 2017 high din dip concentrations were mostly observed and distributed in adjacent coastal waters in china the growth of phytoplankton was potentially limited by p redfield et al 1963 which has an important impact on the growth reproduction and species composition of the phytoplankton in addition overall n is relatively excessive and p is relatively insufficient in the coastal waters of hainan island which is characterized by p limitation in this study sundareshwar et al 2003 zhang et al 2019a this may affect the primary productivity species distribution and ecosystem structure of phytoplankton in the offshore waters of hainan island the main reasons for the tdn and tdp high concentrations in river estuaries were influenced by large contribution of agricultural fertilizer application municipal sewage discharge and the poultry livestock culture in the watersheds zhang et al 2019a zhou 2013 in comparison to the tdn concentration the tdp concentration in river estuary stations were relatively low and could lead to the adjacent coastal water of hainan island being characterized by p limitation as for the hotspots of din and dip in coastal water human activities played an important role the north coast contains haikou which is the most populated city on hainan island and a which is the river with the largest freshwater discharge flows through farmland and livestock and poultry breeding area thereby bringing high levels of nutrients wastewater and agricultural run off from the central island into the estuary fig 1 therefore the riverine sources were the main cause of the high levels of nutrients in the north of hainan island in addition the hydrodynamics also have a significant influence on the status of nutrients in hainan island for example the xiaohai coastal waters are in a semi enclosed bay its coastal water exchange capacity is weak and several rivers discharge nutrients into the coastal water moreover coastal aquaculture industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater discharge into the small sea occupied which may be an important reason for the excess din and dip in the local coastal waters of hainan island herbeck et al 2013 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a 4 2 correlation analysis of influencing factors on adjacent coastal water quality in hainan island the correlation coefficients indicated that the influencing factors of the din and dip concentrations showed clear variation in different seasons in the adjacent coastal water of hainan island table 3 table 3 shows that there were significant negative correlations between s and din and dip in the wet and normal seasons p 0 001 but not in the dry season which proved that the nutrients in surface coastal water were mainly affected by the terrestrial input zhang et al 2019a in the wet and normal seasons the freshwater discharge was larger than that in the dry season which resulted in more nitrogen and phosphorus discharge into coastal waters in the dry season the fluxes of tdn and tdp decreased with the decrease in freshwater flow this suggested that din and dip are related to river freshwater discharge and seawater dilution in the adjacent coastal water of hainan the din and dip concentrations were positively correlated with each other table 3 thereby indicating their common origins and similar cycling processes such as the assimilation and reproduction by remineralization yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a din had significant positive relationships between n species p 0 01 except for n no3 in the dry season n no3 was the major form of din in the coastal water of hainan island although n nh4 and n no2 were also the important composition to din zhou 2013 in addition the results indicated significant positive correlations between the concentrations of cod din and dip in all seasons p 0 05 this indicated their common riverine source and that the organic nitrogen and phosphorous in coastal water can also transform into din and dip respectively yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b as for the spatial differences in the nutrient distribution patterns human activities could not be neglected first the a and n are located in haikou which is the most populous city in hainan province zhou 2013 the tdn and tdp fluxes can be affected by municipal and industrial sewage discharge poultry livestock culture and other aquaculture contributions zhang et al 2019a second the tdn and tdp fluxes were influenced by agricultural fertilizer application and aquaculture in the watershed furthermore submarine groundwater discharge with inputs of nutrients in certain regions may play a significant role in controlling the nutrients in the adjacent coastal water ji et al 2013 previous studies in the laoye lagoon of hainan island verified that the submarine groundwater discharge derived nutrient fluxes in mol d were din 1 7 105 and dip 5 2 102 according to radium isotope method ji et al 2013 nutrients in coastal water may also change with the seasonal variation in submarine groundwater discharge 4 3 seasonal change of din and dip behavior in hainan island coastal water s is regarded as a conservative tracer in the ocean because it was not produced or removed by chemical or biological processes without occurring any reaction except for the dilution of freshwater with seawater wu et al 2016 in conservative mixing the concentration of a nutrient can be expressed as a linear function of s along a continuum boyle et al 1974 wu et al 2016 2017 when the range in the s of the investigated stations in coastal water of hainan island was wide the relationship between the nutrients and s in the coastal water of hainan island showed that din and dip demonstrated conservative mixing behaviors in the wet and normal season due to the tidal mixing effect and the riverine inputs and their influenced on the distributions of din and dip fig 6 higher din and dip concentrations were found in estuaries with large river water input such as the adjacent coastal waters of the yangtze river yellow river and pearl river in china fan and huang 2008 li et al 2017 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2017 the din concentration was significantly negatively correlated with the change in s in the wet and normal seasons r2 0 135 and 0 768 respectively p 0 01 however no significant linear correlation was observed in dry season on one hand the river discharge was relatively low in the dry season thereby leading to the decrease in the nutrient flux input to coastal water on the other hand there were other inner dominant processes of din induced by biological activities phytoplankton uptake and bacteria assimilation wu et al 2016 in addition the dip concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with the change in s in the wet and normal seasons but not in the dry season r2 0 313 and 0 712 respectively p 0 001 this was because the river discharge was relatively low in dry season thereby leading to the decrease in tdp flux input the dip concentrations also decreased rapidly in the dry season which was possibly due to the effects of suspended solids on adsorption and sedimentation li et al 2017 slomp 2011 wu et al 2017 this indicated that the seasonal change in the dip concentration was mainly affected by riverine inputs and the hydrological conditions in the coastal water of hainan island 4 4 impacts of freshwater discharge and tropical storms on riverine nutrient flux inputs to coastal water the results indicated that significant relationships between the water discharge and nutrients fluxes were observed fig 7 a the tdn and tdp fluxes were significantly positively correlated with the monthly freshwater discharge flow r2 0 934 and 0 803 respectively p 0 001 the seasonal river discharge was the predominant influencing factor on the monthly nutrient flux fig 7b therefore the high nutrient loads in the normal season could possibly be attributed to the large freshwater discharges induced by tropical storms the coastal river fluxes of nutrients were influenced by strong rainstorms in the tropical environment chen et al 2018 herbeck et al 2011 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 in 2017 there were 17 regional tropical storms in hainan which was approximately 7 times more than that in the same period thereby making it the year with the most frequently occurring storms in the history of regional rainstorms fig 7c the two local tropical storms in the normal season and one local tropical storm caused heavy rain and flood disasters in local cities and counties hainan meteorological service 2017 heavy tropical storms often significantly increase both river freshwater flows and their nutrient fluxes therefore the local climate including meteorological and hydrological conditions often determines the seasonal pattern of nutrient fluxes to coastal waters the results showed that river freshwater flow was clearly higher than that in other months when tropical severe typhoon khanun landed on hainan island in october hainan meteorological service 2017 however little was known about the effect of the storm event related heavy precipitation on the tropical island s estuarine dynamics because of the unpredictability of storm formation and tracks it is difficult to arrange for appropriate storm sampling herbeck et al 2011 the increase of riverine freshwater and nutrients fluxes induced by tropical typhoon in this study was consistent with those of former studies in the biscayne bay neuse river estuary and pamlico sound in the usa paerl et al 2018 wachnicka et al 2019 similarly the phenomenon was also observed in the xiamen bay jiaozhou bay and pearl river estuary which are semi enclosed coastal waters in china chen et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 the tropical storms can not only lead to the increase in nutrient fluxes but also induce increases in n p supplied from the estuary to the coastal region thereby increasing the degree of p limitation chen et al 2018 the frequency of storm rainfall is expected to continue in the foreseeable future paerl et al 2018 therefore intensive monitoring of river water quality and quantity should be introduced for the reliable and accurate determination of fluxes during storm events in hainan island 4 5 land ocean integration management of coastal water quality and riverine nutrient flux inputs owing to the advantages of the hainan eco civilization in china and the implementation plan of national eco civilization test zone hainan in hainan province cccpc 2019 land ocean integration monitoring of coastal water quality and riverine nutrient flux inputs should be introduced in the plan based on the land ocean spatial monitoring stations the seawater quality monitoring stations currently mismatch the land based pollutants input seawater quality monitoring stations mismatch the land based river pollutants input in monitoring frequency and time month day and hour though we linked the river and coastal water data in the same month the coastal water monitoring station should record the land based pollutants input for example the estuaries and sewage outlets should have intensive monitoring stations covering the coastal mixed zone and the distance of the monitoring stations offshore should be appropriately reduced in the next filed monitoring scheme furthermore an optimized coastal monitoring network should use a water quality response for improved reliability and efficiency duan et al 2019 in addition the critical riverine nutrient source area of the watershed of a should be implemented in the tdn and tdp land based pollutant source control due to the largest contribution to the fluxes of tdn and tdp and response in coastal water quality on one hand for the control of land based pollutants in china n nh4 is the main indicator but tdn pollution control has not been conducted in implemented emission reduction plans lu et al 2016 su et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b on the other hand the coastal water quality of nitrogen and phosphorus were din and dip respectively consequently inconsistencies between river and coastal water quality exist in monitoring indicators the total land based pollution control and supervision of river nutrient discharge into the sea should be strengthened in pollution areas strokal et al 2017 and coastal water quality should be linked with total pollutant load control management for nitrogen and phosphorus in the future 5 conclusions in summary our study showed the spatiotemporal riverine nutrient fluxes in response to adjacent coastal water quality in hainan island the spatial patterns of tdn and tdp concentrations in coastal rivers of hainan island indicated that the concentrations varied at different times and within different rivers the annual average tdn and tdp concentrations were 77 23 31 36 μmol l and 3 25 1 67 μmol l respectively the river flux patterns of tdn and tdp were significantly different in spatiotemporal scale the annual fluxes of pollutants from the discharge of coastal water of hainan into coastal waters were 1 8 104 t for tdn and 1 1 103 t for tdp respectively the seasonal water discharge was the predominant influencing factor on the monthly nutrient flux in addition the adjacent coastal water quality in response to the river tdn and tdp inputs was significantly different in the dry wet and normal seasons most monitoring stations of din and dip concentrations met the national first class seawater standards but the problem of nutrient pollution in some local coastal water areas was still outstanding the nutrients in the surface coastal water were mainly affected by the terrestrial input in the wet and normal seasons overall n was relatively excessive and p was relatively insufficient in the coastal waters of hainan island which were characterized by p limitation land ocean integration management of coastal water quality and riverine nutrient flux inputs should be introduced to effectively and efficiently control river and coastal water quality in the future

5049,understanding the transport time scales for sediment in an estuary is important to study the retention of pollutants such as heavy metals that adsorb to sediment in this study a three dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was developed to investigate the transport time scales of sediment in the modaomen waterway mw china the results show that approximately 100 and 240 days are required for fine grained settling velocity ωs 0 2 mm s and coarse grained sediment ωs 0 5 mm s to transport from the headwater to the estuary mouth respectively unlike dissolved materials sediment undergoes intermittent settling and resuspension which are key processes that determine the sediment age the sediment stays longer at the seabed than suspended in the water column the sediment has more potential to be eroded from the seabed in the freshwater region because of the strong bottom shear stress these eroded sediments can be rapidly diffused to the upper water column and advected seaward in contrast sediment tends to deposit within the turbidity maximum zone due to low bottom shear stress and weak turbulent mixing downstream of the turbidity maximum turbulent mixing is further suppressed by density stratification and the eroded sediment is rarely diffused to the upper water column as a result sediment travels more rapidly in the freshwater region than in the brackish zone the sediment in the upper water column is mostly advected from upstream and the difference in the sediment ages near the surface and at the bottom can reach 40 days for the coarse grained sediment the sediment age has an effect on water quality because a long sediment retention time facilitates the accumulation of pollutants in the mw keywords sediment age sediment deposition turbulent diffusion stratification 1 introduction the movement of sediment plays a key role in morphological evolution brand et al 2010 and ecological processes clark et al 2017 in coastal areas an understanding of sediment transport thus has both economic and environmental benefits the transport of fine sediments is the main cause of navigation channel siltation expensive dredging is carried out in many estuaries to maintain the maritime access routes liu et al 2011 nayar et al 2003 in estuarine and coastal regions fine sediments are polluted to various degrees because heavy metals nutrients and organic matters are often bound to sediments baeyens et al 1997 a previous study also demonstrated that fecal indicator bacteria are highly abundant in seabed sediments especially in areas with high settling rates de brauwere et al 2014 when sediments are stirred up adsorbed nutrients and heavy metals are released into the water column and can significantly impact the water quality and ecological system liu et al 2002 the amount of sediment in suspension influences the turbidity controls the penetration of light and further influences the primary production mcsweeney et al 2017 rivers play an important role in delivering sediment from the continents to the coastal oceans it is estimated that the riverine sediment input constitutes 95 of the land ocean sediment transfer walling and fang 2003 large amounts of sediment delivered by rivers tend to be trapped inside estuaries due to their unique dynamic conditions for example the annual sediment load transported to the estuary of the changjiang river is estimated to be 450 106 t yr and approximately 50 of that sediment is deposited inside the estuary milliman et al 1985 liu et al 2010 the mekong river carries approximately 110 106 t of sediment to the south china sea annually and more than one third is accumulated in the tidal river and estuary nowacki et al 2015 in addition 90 of the flux of elements such as mn cr pb and fe is carried into coastal areas by rivers and most of which is transported in an adsorbed state attached to sediments martin and meybeck 1979 the quantity and transport time of these heavy metals are of vital importance to water quality near the coast by considering the settling and resuspension processes of sediment mercier and delhez 2007 applied the constituent oriented age and residence time theory cart www climate be cart to diagnose the sediment transport time scales on the belgian coast the theory was further applied to investigate the river borne sediment transport time in the tidal york river and the results showed that the sediment transport time was largely dependent on sediment characteristics such as settling velocity and critical shear stress for erosion gong and shen 2010 the spatial distribution of sediment transport time indicates that sediment tends to remain longer in the estuary than in the tidal river ralston and geyer 2017 these studies have successfully quantified the sediment transport time in coastal waters however the correlation between estuarine hydrodynamics and transport time of river borne sediment has not been fully examined the modaomen waterway mw china is one of the main outlets for the pearl river estuary and provides a typical example to investigate the riverine sediment transport time fig 1 the mw receives an annual freshwater runoff of 236 109 m3 from the xijiang and beijiang rivers fig 1a the tremendous amount of river discharge carries an annual sediment flux of 24 3 106 t yr approximately 20 50 of which is trapped in the river networks and the estuary the deposited sediments act as the main source for shoreline propagation he et al 2018 large amounts of heavy metals adhere to the sediment which poses a serious threat to water quality gui et al 2015 an examination of the sediment transport time scales is therefore necessary to better understand the morphological and ecological processes to address this issue we employed a numerical model to investigate sediment transport processes and time scales in the mw the aims of this study are 1 to investigate the spatial distribution of riverine sediment age in the mw 2 to examine the correlation between estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment age and 3 to reveal the sediment transport mechanism in the mw in this study we examined the variation in sediment age both spatially and temporally to further investigate the dominant factors that control the sediment age we examined the effects of resuspension and net sediment transport pattern on sediment age the goal of this study was to improve understanding of sediment transport processes and time scales in estuaries with massive riverine sediment input 2 study site the mw fig 1a is located downstream of the xijiang river one of the three main rivers xijiang beijiang and dongjiang that enter the pearl river delta area the mw is approximately 63 km long from beiqingtou to the river mouth with a mean water depth of approximately 5 m under the long term averaged river discharge the landward limit of salt intrusion is located at guadingjiao fig 1b which is 15 km from the river mouth a turbidity maximum is formed within the brackish zone under the combined influence of convergent estuarine circulation and stratification liang 2004 the mw is generally less than 3 km in width and features a weakly convergent geometry inside the estuary several sand bars are situated along the main stream which results in large lateral variation of bathymetry the estuary bifurcates into three branches in the downstream area with the mw to the south the hongwan waterway to the east and the hezhou waterway to the west a large ebb shoal submerged ebb tidal delta is located along the estuary mouth among the eight outlets of the prd the mw receives the most freshwater runoff and accounts for 31 85 of the freshwater input from the xijiang and beijiang rivers the mw experiences a micro tidal regime with a mean tidal range of 1 11 m at the river mouth sanzao station fig 1b the tidal range decreases toward upstream as a result of bottom friction and river discharge cai et al 2018 the tide inside the mw is asymmetric semidiurnal it is estimated that the annual runoff is 5 77 times greater than the tidal prism jia et al 2006 the tidal currents are ebb dominant with a longer ebb duration than flood duration the vertically averaged ebb velocity is 0 70 m s and decreases to 0 42 m s during the flood tide measured in december 2003 gong and shen 2011 the mw exhibits strong density stratification given the large freshwater input and weak tidal forcing except during spring tides in the dry season analysis of water samples has shown that the suspended sediment is mainly composed of silt and clay and 92 7 of the sediment has a grain size of less than 0 063 mm he et al 2018 the annual bed load is approximately 350 103 t which is only 1 27 of the suspended load we therefore only considered the transport time for the suspended load in this study the settling velocity ranges from 0 04 mm s or less for clay to 1 4 mm s for coarse silt lin et al 2017 under the influence of large riverine sediment input the suspended sediment concentration ssc decreases as it progresses downstream from the headwater the ssc then exhibits an increase in the turbidity maximum because of sediment trapping the ssc is typically lower in the offshore area than inside the estuary however the trend can be reversed during storm events when waves are strong chen et al 2009 on intra tidal time scales the distribution of the ssc depends largely on the resuspension processes during a flood tide eroded sediment from the seabed can be suspended into the upper layer of the water column which results in a higher ssc low turbidity water is observed during ebb tides when vertical mixing is reduced due to the enhancement of stratification wen et al 2014 after the sediment is transported outside the estuary mouth it is transported further westward by the along shore current li and li 2018 3 methodology 3 1 numerical modeling the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc was used to simulate the sediment transport time in this study the model has been successfully applied to estuaries park et al 2005 shen and lin 2006 zhu et al 2018 lakes arifin et al 2016 gong et al 2016 reservoirs chen et al 2016 and rivers alarcon et al 2014 the efdc model s hydrodynamics are formulated in curvilinear orthogonal horizontal coordinates and sigma coordinate in the vertical direction the model solves the three dimensional continuity and free surface equations of motion with hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations the mellor and yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure mellor and yamada 1982 modified by galperin et al 1988 is implemented in the model to obtain the vertical viscosity and diffusivity it simulates density and topographically induced circulation as well as tidal and wind driven flow for the sake of computational efficiency the model used in this study only covered the four western outlets of the pearl river delta the riverine boundary extended to gaoyao in the xijiang river and to shijiao in the beijiang river where daily discharges were measured the open sea boundary extended to the 40 m isobath outside the estuary to remove any errors induced by the influence of open boundaries there were 10 190 cells in the horizontal plane with cell lengths from approximately 150 m in the mw to 1 200 m at the western open ocean boundary ten layers of water column of the same relative thickness using sigma coordinate were specified vertically open sea boundaries were forced by nine harmonic constituents namely q1 o1 p1 k1 n2 m2 s2 k2 and sa the tidal harmonic constituents and salinity on the open sea boundary were extracted from a previously used large domain model which has been well calibrated and verified gong and shen 2011 this study focused on the near coast region where salinity dominates the density stratification and the influence of temperature on stratification is minimal temperature was therefore assumed to be constant during the model simulation a time step of 30 s was used the hydrodynamic roughness z0 varying from 0 002 m to 0 006 m was used based on the model calibration to improve the simulation of cohesive sediment processes in the mw the sediment transport module used by lin and kuo 2003 was implemented in this study two classes of sediments were included in this study for each class the governing equation is 1 c i t c i u x c i υ y c i z ω ω s i x k h c i x y k h c i y z k z c i z where t is the time the subscript i denotes the i th class sediment ci is the ssc in the water column g m3 x and y are the horizontal coordinate and z is the vertical coordinate u v and ω are the velocity components in the x y and z directions respectively ωi s is the sediment settling velocity kh and kz are the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients respectively at the water surface no sediment flux is allowed and the boundary condition is 2 ω s i c i z k z c i 0 at the seabed the boundary condition for sediment flux is 3 ω s i c i k z c i z d i e i where ei is the mass of sediment eroded from the seabed per unit area per unit time known as the resuspension rate di is the sediment mass deposited on the seabed per area per unit time the erosion of cohesive sediment is based on the critical shear stress for erosion 4 e i m τ b τ cre i 1 0 for τ b τ c r e i τ b τ cre i where τb is the bed shear stress τi cre is the critical shear stress for erosion and m is an empirical constant with the same unit as erosion the deposition rate is calculated as 5 d i c b i ω s i 1 τ b τ crd i 0 for τ b τ crd i τ b τ crd i where ci b is the sediment concentration at the bottom layer of the water column and τi crd is the critical shear stress for deposition the sediment concentration at the seabed is calculated as 6 c s i t d i e i where ci s is the sediment concentration at the seabed g m2 if a unit depth at the seabed is assumed ci s then has the same unit as the suspended sediment each class of sediment is assumed to be well mixed on the seabed this simplifying assumption may neglect the interactions between each class of sediment such as armoring effects and cohesive force which are important factors that limit erodibility sanford 2008 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 moreover sediment erodibility varies with consolidation growth as a result of deposition duration and sedimentary thickness huang et al 2020 the critical shear stress is therefore set to a constant high value of 0 25 pa for both sediment classes based on suspended sediment simulations 3 2 sediment age to diagnose the time scales of sediment transport the concept of age was utilized following cart it was based on the advection diffusion equation in eulerian framework and it was also capable of dealing with reactive processes the concept was first introduced by delhez et al 1999 and deleersnijder et al 2001 to evaluate the time elapsed since particles left the region where their age is set or reset to zero this approach introduces an age concentration tracer into the model associated with each constituent being evaluated transport of the age concentration tracer is treated exactly as the corresponding tracer the theory was further applied to diagnose cohesive sediment transport in the belgian coast by considering the settling and resuspension of the age concentration tracer mercier and delhez 2007 they made a distinction between two complementary aspects of resuspension and horizontal transport of the sediment namely resuspension age and transport age the resuspension age is defined as the time elapsed since a particle is eroded from the bed and is used to diagnose the resuspension deposition events the transport age is introduced to measure the mean age of suspended sediment particles that have traveled from a source region where the age is prescribed to zero to a concerned region we used the transport age in this study and defined the sediments to have an age of zero when they entered the mw from the headwater owing to the ebb dominated dynamics in the mw the incoming sediment from offshore is negligible he et al 2018 the sediment and age concentrations at the open sea boundaries were set to zero sediments were allowed to be advected out of the model domain through all its boundaries the sediment age was computed based on sediment and age concentration the age concentration in the water column can be computed by the following equation 7 α i t u α i x υ α i y α i z ω ω s i c i x k h α i x y k h α i y z k z α i z where αi represents the sediment age concentration g m3 s the age concentration at the seabed is 8 α s i t c s i d α i e α i where 9 d α i α b i c b i d i 10 e α i α s i c s i e i where αi s and αi b are the age concentration on the seabed and in the bottom layer of the water column respectively the age concentration on the seabed αi s uses units of g m2 s the boundary condition at the interface of the bottom layer and seabed is 11 ω s i α i k z α i z d α i e α i at the seabed the increase in age concentration for each sediment class can be obtained by adding the age concentration of the newly deposited sediment during deposition events when resuspension occurs the i th class sediment is eroded with its mean age at the seabed because transport of the age concentration tracer is treated exactly as the corresponding sediment the neglect of sediment interactions on the seabed such as consolidation can lead to an underestimation of sediment age mercier and delhez 2007 applied a consolidated layer which accounts for local source of sediments to avoid any underestimation of sediment age because only the sediment age from riverine input was considered in this study the assumption of perfect mixing on the seabed is acceptable for age calculations when neglecting the local source of sediment the selection of a high critical shear stress for erosion can also reduce the associated errors induced by this assumption the sediment age is 12 a i α i c i for suspended sediment and 13 a s i α s i c s i for seabed sediment the unit of sediment age was initially in seconds and then converted into days herein 3 3 model setup the aim of this study was to evaluate sediment age under normal dynamic conditions a multi year average river discharge was thus prescribed at the riverine boundaries with 6900 m3 s for xijiang river and 1330 m3 s for beijiang river the mean sscs are 220 g m3 and 130 g m3 for the xijiang and beijiang rivers respectively the suspended sediment from the riverine sources is mainly composed of silt 70 and clay 30 hu et al 2018 in many studies the sediment grain size is essentially the main factor used to differentiate sediment classes and the settling velocity is usually calculated directly from stokes s law holt and james 1999 luan et al 2017 however the sediments in the mw are mostly suspended in the form of flocs which have a higher settling velocity than single particles moreover the settling velocity can be impacted by various factors such as sediment concentration turbulence and the organic and mineralogical composition of the sediment particle deng et al 2015 it is therefore difficult to find an appropriate mathematical formula to describe how the settling velocity responds to these important factors considering the flocculation the settling velocities were set to 0 2 mm s and 0 5 mm s for fine grained clay and coarse grained silt sediment respectively lin et al 2017 the critical shear stresses for deposition were set to 0 12 and 0 18 pa respectively based on the model calibration the parameters of the two classes of sediment are summarized in table 1 because this study focused on riverine sediment transport time we assumed that there was initially no sediment in the water column and at the seabed for computational purposes the age concentration was set to zero at the upstream boundaries the clock started as soon as the sediment was discharged into the mw to better illustrate the impacts of deposition and resuspension processes on sediment age the age of water was calculated by assigning a passive tracer at the riverine boundary both the water and sediment ages are referred to beiqingtou fig 1a the headwater of the mw the model was run for 10 years to obtain dynamic equilibrium for sediment and age concentration and only the results for the last 29 days were used the mean sediment age of each vertical layer was calculated based on eq 12 the results at each layer were averaged to obtain the vertically averaged sediment mean age an average of the vertically averaged mean sediment age during the last 29 days was conducted to remove the tidal signal boon 2004 the average sediment age was calculated for each class of sediment 3 4 model calibration to assess the model s capability for tidal simulations the tidal elevation produced by the model was compared with the observed data from december 2009 the results showed consistency between the model results and the observations particularly during spring tides fig 2 the discrepancies occurred mostly during small flood ebb tides for the dominant m2 tidal constituent in the mw the mean error for amplitude was less than 8 and the mean phase difference was less than 11 to calibrate the tidal current salinity and ssc the in situ measurements of the mw during january 2016 were used during the spring tide current salinity and ssc were continuously measured for at least 27 h and contained two flood ebb cycles in general the modeled velocity agreed with the observed current fig 3 the model can accurately compute the current speed and current direction the salinity in the estuary showed distinct fluctuations that corresponded to the river discharge and tides fig 4 the discrepancies between the model and the observations occurred mostly during peak flows during this time it was difficult to accurately simulate the sediment concentration the variations between the modeled and observed ssc had the same trend however the model was unable to reproduce the peak ssc values the discrepancies were probably caused by setting the critical shear stress uniformly in space and time and only two classes of sediments were considered fig 5 the model performance is further evaluated quantitatively using the correlation coefficient cc oke et al 2002 14 cc 1 n i 1 n m m o o s m s 0 and the skill score ss murphy 1988 allen et al 2007 15 ss 1 i 1 n m o 2 i 1 n o o 2 where m and o are the modeled and observed time series values which have mean values of m and o and standard deviations sm and so performance levels were categorized as follows 0 65 as excellent 0 65 0 5 as very good 0 5 0 2 as good and 0 2 as poor maréchal 2004 the cc of tidal current ranged from 0 51 to 0 93 with a mean value of 0 81 the ss ranged from 0 49 to 0 82 and showed a better performance near the bottom ss 0 72 than near the surface ss 0 67 the cc of salinity varied from 0 57 to 0 94 with a mean value of 0 83 the ss of the salinity simulation showed better performance near the surface ss 0 84 than near the bottom ss 0 71 for the ssc simulations the cc ranged between 0 54 and 0 79 and the ss varied from 0 42 to 0 67 overall the model results were reliable and could be used to diagnose the sediment transport time scales in the mw 4 results 4 1 mean sediment age the distribution of sediment age is shown as contours for both sediments in the water column fig 6 a and b and on the seabed fig 6c and d the sediment age shows distinct spatial variation in the mw it takes approximately 100 days for fine grained sediment ω s 0 2 mm s to transport from the headwater to the river mouth under long term averaged river discharge because of the high settling velocity ω s 0 5 mm s the transport time for coarse grained sediment is 260 days at the river mouth the transport time for the sediment is far greater than that for the water parcel which takes only 7 days fig 7 this indicates that the age of every water parcel is determined mainly by the advection diffusion process delhez et al 1999 shen and haas 2004 whereas the intermittent settling and deposition process of sediment can be a considerable factor contributing to the sediment age spatially the difference in sediment transport time is distinct for different regions of the mw in the freshwater region it takes 40 days for the fine grained sediment and 120 days for the coarse grained sediment to travel a distance of 48 km from beiqingtou to guadingjiao locations shown in fig 1b however the sediment transport time increases significantly in the brackish zone from guadingjiao to the estuary mouth it takes 60 days for the fine grained sediment and 140 days for the coarse grained sediment to travel a distance of 15 km the difference in sediment age between the freshwater region and the brackish zone is in accordance with that reported in hudson river ralston and geyer 2017 which indicates that the sediment age depends largely on local hydrodynamic conditions it is notable that there is a distinct difference between the transverse distribution of water age and sediment age for the dissolved material without settling and resuspension processes the water age is lower near the western side the transverse variation in water age is mainly determined by the exchange flow with inflow in the deep channel on the eastern side and outflow residing on the shallow shoal valle levinson and lwiza 1995 the coriolis force plays a minor role in determining the transverse structure of the exchange flow in the narrow mw given a kelvin number k e b f g h s where b represents the estuary width g is the reduced gravity hs is the mean depth of the buoyant layer and f is the coriolis force of 0 13 valle levinson 2008 the transverse distribution of sediment age is consistent with the lateral variation in bathymetry fig 1b and 6 in general the sediment age is lower in the deep channel and higher on the shallow shoals the sediment on the seabed shows a similar pattern of aging with suspended sediment interestingly the age of the seabed sediment is close to that of the suspended sediment in the main channels whereas it is several times older than suspended sediment on the shallow shoal fig 6c and d this suggests that sediment tends to deposit on the shoals where tidal current is weak 4 2 vertical distribution of sediment age the interaction between the buoyancy input of river flow and salty water in an estuary creates a density gradient force and consequently determines the transport characteristics of materials pritchard 1952 banas et al 2010 to further investigate the association between sediment age and estuarine dynamics we plotted the distribution of 29 day averaged salinity velocity ssc and sediment age fig 8 along the selected longitudinal section fig 1b sediment tends to accumulate in the lower mw where the salt front resides approximately 5 15 km from the river mouth fig 8a c this area also exhibits strong stratification with maximum surface bottom salinity difference reaching up to 18 psu therefore the peak sscs for both fine and coarse grained sediment are developed in this area which facilitates the formation of the turbidity maximum the formation of the turbidity maximum in the mw has been attributed to turbulence suppression estuarine circulation and seabed sediment resuspension liang 2004 the vertical profiles for fine and coarse grained sediment are somewhat different in the well mixed freshwater region the difference between the surface and bottom sscs for fine grained sediment is approximately 10 g m3 fig 8b inside the turbidity maximum the ssc decreases by 30 g m3 toward the upper water column because turbulent mixing is greatly suppressed by density stratification geyer 1993 the coarse grained sediment has more potential to settle on the seabed due to a high settling velocity thus the vertical gradient of ssc for coarse grained sediment is lower in the turbidity maximum than in the freshwater region fig 8c the distribution of sediment age is consistent with the estuarine hydrodynamics fig 8d and e the ages of both the fine and coarse grained sediment experience significant increases near the null point of the landward estuarine circulation which provides strong evidence for the effects of the turbidity maximum on trapping sediment friedrichs 2009 ralston et al 2012 with the absence of density gradient force sediment travels more rapidly in the freshwater region and the sediment age is homogeneous in the vertical direction while in the brackish zone the maximum surface bottom age difference can reach 40 days for the coarse sediment for both the fine and coarse grained sediment an age maximum is observed approximately 5 km from the river mouth where the sediment age is greater than those both upstream and downstream it is notable that an open sea boundary condition with diffusive flux may induce inaccurate age simulations for a significant fraction of the model domain deleersnijder et al 2020 in this work the diffusive process near the open sea boundary has a minor impact on the age simulation inside the mw given a peclet number pe u l k where u is the averaged velocity k is the averaged horizontal eddy viscosity over the domain and l is the distance between the headwater and the open sea boundary of approximately 255 the formation of the age maximum is therefore likely caused by the convergent estuarine circulation rather than errors induced by the boundary condition 4 3 suspended age and deposition age another model scenario was conducted to further investigate the time that the sediment has been suspended in the water column which is referred to as suspended age in this study because it is assumed there is no sediment on the seabed the riverine sediment can be persistently suspended in the water column by setting the critical shear stress for deposition to zero the results for suspended age are shown in fig 9 a and 9b the fine sediment is suspended for nearly 18 days when transports from the headwater to the river mouth fig 9a due to the high settling velocity the suspended age for coarse sediment that travels the same distance is approximately 60 fig 9b the suspended age is generally several times greater than the age of water parcel which suggests that sediments tend to be accumulated in the near bottom region and transported by the relatively weak bottom flow in the freshwater region the suspended age for fine sediment is similar to the water age the suspended age for coarse sediment is approximately 2 3 times greater than that of the fine sediment which is proportional to the settling velocity in the brackish zone the interaction between freshwater and salty water generates a strong vertical density gradient and the upward diffusion of sediment is largely suppressed winterwerp 2001 in addition the seaward advection of sediment is reduced by the landward baroclinic force associated with the longitudinal density gradient a large portion of sediment is transported upstream by the landward bottom current and the suspended age increases significantly the difference between sediment age and suspended age is the time that sediment has stayed on the seabed which is termed as deposition age the results for the deposition age of fine and coarse grained sediment are show in fig 9c and d in general the deposition age is 3 40 times greater than the suspended age the spatial distribution of the deposition age is similar to the sediment age and accounts for approximately 70 to 98 of the sediment age this indicates that the intermittent erosion and deposition processes are the most important factors that control the sediment transport time a rapid increase in deposition age is observed near the landward limit of salt intrusion where sediments are most efficiently trapped geyer 1993 5 discussion 5 1 role of river discharge many previous studies have examined the response of water age to variations in river discharge because the advective transport induced by freshwater discharge is responsible for most of the seaward material transport lerczak et al 2006 dissolved materials in an estuary are efficiently transported downstream under high discharge conditions thus less time is required for them to be flushed out of the estuary wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 a recent study in the chesapeake bay further demonstrated that high river discharge during a tropical storm tended to carry a large amount of sediments to the lower bay cheng et al 2013 thus it is necessary to examine the correlation between sediment age and river discharge to further investigate the effects of river discharge on the sediment age two model scenarios were conducted by specifying the long term average river discharge during the dry season 2860 m3 s for the xijiang river and 551 m3 s for the beijiang river and wet season 11600 m3 s for the xijiang river and 2150 m3 s for the beijiang river at the riverine boundaries the results show that sediment age is inversely proportional to the river discharge fig 10 under the mean flow condition during the dry season the sediment age increases considerably it takes 350 days and 750 days for the fine sediment and coarse sediment discharged from the headwaters to transport to the estuary mouth respectively in contrast it takes only 30 days for fine grained sediment and 80 days for coarse grained sediment to transport from the headwater to the river mouth for the wet season simulation the sediment age results under different flow conditions suggest that river discharge plays a major role in sediment transport in the mw most sediments are carried downstream by the freshwater discharge yuan et al 2012 owing to the ebb dominated hydrodynamics a change in river discharge would alter the net seaward sediment flux and ultimately determine the sediment transport time scales on the other hand the distance of salt intrusion varies by approximately 30 km between dry and wet seasons gong and shen 2011 gong et al 2018 the turbidity maximum resides at the location of the landward limit of salt intrusion geyer 1993 sediments are therefore more efficiently trapped during the dry season because the landward movement of the turbidity maximum and sediment age is typically 10 15 times greater than that during the wet season 5 2 sediment settling and resuspension gong and shen 2010 demonstrated that the intermittent settling and resuspension processes strongly affect the sediment age however the underlying mechanisms have not been examined the model results in this study also demonstrate that the sediment age is highly relevant to the resuspension and deposition processes given the longer transport time for sediment than that for the water parcel figs 6 and 7 in an estuary sediment deposition is determined by the bottom shear stress and the strength of turbulent mixing is responsible for keeping sediment in suspension kostaschuk et al 1989 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 to examine the resuspension frequency we statistically analyzed the time that bottom shear stress exceeds the critical erosion stress and investigated the capacity for sediment remaining in suspension using the turbulent diffusion coefficient the time that bottom shear stress exceeds the critical erosion stress accounts for approximately 85 of the total computation time in the upper reach of the mw because of the large freshwater input fig 11 a the interaction between the strong current and seabed generates strong turbulent mixing in the main channel of the freshwater region with the maximum depth averaged turbulent diffusivity reaching 0 01 m2 s fig 11b the turbulent diffusivity also features distinctive transverse variation which coincides with the bathymetric change therefore the age difference between the suspended sediment and seabed sediment in the main channel of the freshwater region is minor because of the low potential for sediment resuspension riverine sediments favor deposition on the shallow shoals fig 12 and a higher sediment age is expected in the brackish zone the time that bottom shear stress exceeds the critical erosion stress decreases incrementally to 25 the interaction between freshwater and salt water generates vertical stratification which suppresses turbulent mixing the depth averaged turbulent diffusivity is less than 0 003 m2 s in the turbidity maximum and further decreases to less than 0 001 m2 s near the estuary mouth consequently the turbidity maximum becomes the major trapping area for sediment as seen in other estuaries ralston et al 2012 yellen et al 2017 the deposited sediments settle with their ages and the ages continue increasing while they stay on the seabed the sediment transport time scales therefore experience rapid increases inside the turbidity maximum 5 3 suspended sediment transport the major physical processes that control the net longitudinal material transport in an estuary are estuarine circulation and turbulent diffusion feng 1987 for sediment movement the settling velocity should be taken into account because it determines the vertical suspended sediment profile and ultimately alters sediment transport efficiency pejrup and edelvang 2014 the tidal averaged sediment transport can be written as 16 c i t u l c i x z k z c i z ω s i c i z where the overbars denote tidal average the lagrangian residual velocity u l is used to advect mass rather than eulerian residuals the terms on the left side are the change rate of the ssc and the terms on the right denote tidally averaged advection which is associated with the residual current turbulent diffusion and the sediment settling process the sediment transport mechanism analysis for both fine and coarse grained sediment was conducted and the results are shown in fig 13 in the freshwater region turbulent diffusion is the dominant factor in sediment transport thus the eroded sediment from the seabed can be rapidly diffused upward fig 13c and d given the low potential for sediment deposition in the freshwater region the suspended sediment is efficiently advected downstream fig 13a and b the distribution of the sediment age therefore shows a pattern similar to that of the water parcel and the increase of the sediment transport time is minor in the brackish zone the upward diffusion of sediment is constrained below the pycnocline because of the presence of stratification flores et al 2017 in the upper water column the sediment is mainly advected from upstream which has a lower age while near the bottom sediments with higher ages outside the estuary mouth can be transported back by the baroclinically driven residual current under the combined impacts of turbulence suppression and settling velocity fig 13e and f these older sediments tend to accumulate continually near the estuary mouth with a distance between 5 and 10 km consequently the sediment age in this zone is higher than either upstream or downstream and a distinct surface bottom age difference can be observed 5 4 implications for the estuarine ecosystem the dissolved material in an estuary is usually retained for several to dozens of days depending on the estuary length and dynamic conditions de brye et al 2012 nadell et al 2016 due to the settling and resuspension processes the transport time scales for sediment range from several months to years gong and shen 2010 ralston and geyer 2017 with the long term retention of sediments on the seabed organic rich sediments have been found to be the largest dissolved oxygen sink in estuaries lee et al 2009 pollutants heavy metals and organic carbons that adhere to the sediment are likely to accumulate in areas where sediments deposit observations have shown that the concentrations of heavy metals such as pb and cd are 2 3 times greater in the brackish zone of the mw than in the freshwater region shi et al 2015 these heavy metals have a high possibility of being released into the water column during resuspension events chen et al 2013 which poses a severe threat to the water quality of the estuary 6 conclusions the riverine sediment transport time scales in the mw were quantitatively investigated using the concept of age as defined in cart a three dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics and sediment movement in the mw and thoroughly verified by field observations the well calibrated model was used to simulate the sediment transport and estimate sediment age the model results demonstrate that a substantial time is required for the sediment to transport from the headwater downstream to the estuary mouth it takes approximately 100 days and 240 days for fine grained settling velocity ωs 0 2 mm s and coarse grained sediment ωs 0 5 mm s respectively to travel from the headwaters to the estuary mouth the episodic deposition and resuspension processes play key roles in determining the sediment transport time scales therefore sediment remains longer on the seabed than suspended in the water column spatially riverine sediment travels more rapidly in the freshwater region than in the brackish zone a rapid increase in sediment transport time is expected when these sediments are trapped in the salt front due to turbulence suppression estuarine circulation and resuspension because the turbulence is suppressed by stratification the upward diffusion is constrained to the area below the pycnocline and sediment is trapped inside the frontal zone the sediment in the upper water column is mainly advected from upstream thus the maximum surface bottom age difference can reach up to 40 days the sediment age during the dry season is 10 15 times greater than that during the wet season because of seasonal changes in freshwater runoff unlike passive material the transport time scales for sediment range from several months to years heavy metals attached to sediment accumulate inside the estuary and pose a major threat to the estuarine ecosystem credit authorship contribution

5049,understanding the transport time scales for sediment in an estuary is important to study the retention of pollutants such as heavy metals that adsorb to sediment in this study a three dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was developed to investigate the transport time scales of sediment in the modaomen waterway mw china the results show that approximately 100 and 240 days are required for fine grained settling velocity ωs 0 2 mm s and coarse grained sediment ωs 0 5 mm s to transport from the headwater to the estuary mouth respectively unlike dissolved materials sediment undergoes intermittent settling and resuspension which are key processes that determine the sediment age the sediment stays longer at the seabed than suspended in the water column the sediment has more potential to be eroded from the seabed in the freshwater region because of the strong bottom shear stress these eroded sediments can be rapidly diffused to the upper water column and advected seaward in contrast sediment tends to deposit within the turbidity maximum zone due to low bottom shear stress and weak turbulent mixing downstream of the turbidity maximum turbulent mixing is further suppressed by density stratification and the eroded sediment is rarely diffused to the upper water column as a result sediment travels more rapidly in the freshwater region than in the brackish zone the sediment in the upper water column is mostly advected from upstream and the difference in the sediment ages near the surface and at the bottom can reach 40 days for the coarse grained sediment the sediment age has an effect on water quality because a long sediment retention time facilitates the accumulation of pollutants in the mw keywords sediment age sediment deposition turbulent diffusion stratification 1 introduction the movement of sediment plays a key role in morphological evolution brand et al 2010 and ecological processes clark et al 2017 in coastal areas an understanding of sediment transport thus has both economic and environmental benefits the transport of fine sediments is the main cause of navigation channel siltation expensive dredging is carried out in many estuaries to maintain the maritime access routes liu et al 2011 nayar et al 2003 in estuarine and coastal regions fine sediments are polluted to various degrees because heavy metals nutrients and organic matters are often bound to sediments baeyens et al 1997 a previous study also demonstrated that fecal indicator bacteria are highly abundant in seabed sediments especially in areas with high settling rates de brauwere et al 2014 when sediments are stirred up adsorbed nutrients and heavy metals are released into the water column and can significantly impact the water quality and ecological system liu et al 2002 the amount of sediment in suspension influences the turbidity controls the penetration of light and further influences the primary production mcsweeney et al 2017 rivers play an important role in delivering sediment from the continents to the coastal oceans it is estimated that the riverine sediment input constitutes 95 of the land ocean sediment transfer walling and fang 2003 large amounts of sediment delivered by rivers tend to be trapped inside estuaries due to their unique dynamic conditions for example the annual sediment load transported to the estuary of the changjiang river is estimated to be 450 106 t yr and approximately 50 of that sediment is deposited inside the estuary milliman et al 1985 liu et al 2010 the mekong river carries approximately 110 106 t of sediment to the south china sea annually and more than one third is accumulated in the tidal river and estuary nowacki et al 2015 in addition 90 of the flux of elements such as mn cr pb and fe is carried into coastal areas by rivers and most of which is transported in an adsorbed state attached to sediments martin and meybeck 1979 the quantity and transport time of these heavy metals are of vital importance to water quality near the coast by considering the settling and resuspension processes of sediment mercier and delhez 2007 applied the constituent oriented age and residence time theory cart www climate be cart to diagnose the sediment transport time scales on the belgian coast the theory was further applied to investigate the river borne sediment transport time in the tidal york river and the results showed that the sediment transport time was largely dependent on sediment characteristics such as settling velocity and critical shear stress for erosion gong and shen 2010 the spatial distribution of sediment transport time indicates that sediment tends to remain longer in the estuary than in the tidal river ralston and geyer 2017 these studies have successfully quantified the sediment transport time in coastal waters however the correlation between estuarine hydrodynamics and transport time of river borne sediment has not been fully examined the modaomen waterway mw china is one of the main outlets for the pearl river estuary and provides a typical example to investigate the riverine sediment transport time fig 1 the mw receives an annual freshwater runoff of 236 109 m3 from the xijiang and beijiang rivers fig 1a the tremendous amount of river discharge carries an annual sediment flux of 24 3 106 t yr approximately 20 50 of which is trapped in the river networks and the estuary the deposited sediments act as the main source for shoreline propagation he et al 2018 large amounts of heavy metals adhere to the sediment which poses a serious threat to water quality gui et al 2015 an examination of the sediment transport time scales is therefore necessary to better understand the morphological and ecological processes to address this issue we employed a numerical model to investigate sediment transport processes and time scales in the mw the aims of this study are 1 to investigate the spatial distribution of riverine sediment age in the mw 2 to examine the correlation between estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment age and 3 to reveal the sediment transport mechanism in the mw in this study we examined the variation in sediment age both spatially and temporally to further investigate the dominant factors that control the sediment age we examined the effects of resuspension and net sediment transport pattern on sediment age the goal of this study was to improve understanding of sediment transport processes and time scales in estuaries with massive riverine sediment input 2 study site the mw fig 1a is located downstream of the xijiang river one of the three main rivers xijiang beijiang and dongjiang that enter the pearl river delta area the mw is approximately 63 km long from beiqingtou to the river mouth with a mean water depth of approximately 5 m under the long term averaged river discharge the landward limit of salt intrusion is located at guadingjiao fig 1b which is 15 km from the river mouth a turbidity maximum is formed within the brackish zone under the combined influence of convergent estuarine circulation and stratification liang 2004 the mw is generally less than 3 km in width and features a weakly convergent geometry inside the estuary several sand bars are situated along the main stream which results in large lateral variation of bathymetry the estuary bifurcates into three branches in the downstream area with the mw to the south the hongwan waterway to the east and the hezhou waterway to the west a large ebb shoal submerged ebb tidal delta is located along the estuary mouth among the eight outlets of the prd the mw receives the most freshwater runoff and accounts for 31 85 of the freshwater input from the xijiang and beijiang rivers the mw experiences a micro tidal regime with a mean tidal range of 1 11 m at the river mouth sanzao station fig 1b the tidal range decreases toward upstream as a result of bottom friction and river discharge cai et al 2018 the tide inside the mw is asymmetric semidiurnal it is estimated that the annual runoff is 5 77 times greater than the tidal prism jia et al 2006 the tidal currents are ebb dominant with a longer ebb duration than flood duration the vertically averaged ebb velocity is 0 70 m s and decreases to 0 42 m s during the flood tide measured in december 2003 gong and shen 2011 the mw exhibits strong density stratification given the large freshwater input and weak tidal forcing except during spring tides in the dry season analysis of water samples has shown that the suspended sediment is mainly composed of silt and clay and 92 7 of the sediment has a grain size of less than 0 063 mm he et al 2018 the annual bed load is approximately 350 103 t which is only 1 27 of the suspended load we therefore only considered the transport time for the suspended load in this study the settling velocity ranges from 0 04 mm s or less for clay to 1 4 mm s for coarse silt lin et al 2017 under the influence of large riverine sediment input the suspended sediment concentration ssc decreases as it progresses downstream from the headwater the ssc then exhibits an increase in the turbidity maximum because of sediment trapping the ssc is typically lower in the offshore area than inside the estuary however the trend can be reversed during storm events when waves are strong chen et al 2009 on intra tidal time scales the distribution of the ssc depends largely on the resuspension processes during a flood tide eroded sediment from the seabed can be suspended into the upper layer of the water column which results in a higher ssc low turbidity water is observed during ebb tides when vertical mixing is reduced due to the enhancement of stratification wen et al 2014 after the sediment is transported outside the estuary mouth it is transported further westward by the along shore current li and li 2018 3 methodology 3 1 numerical modeling the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc was used to simulate the sediment transport time in this study the model has been successfully applied to estuaries park et al 2005 shen and lin 2006 zhu et al 2018 lakes arifin et al 2016 gong et al 2016 reservoirs chen et al 2016 and rivers alarcon et al 2014 the efdc model s hydrodynamics are formulated in curvilinear orthogonal horizontal coordinates and sigma coordinate in the vertical direction the model solves the three dimensional continuity and free surface equations of motion with hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations the mellor and yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure mellor and yamada 1982 modified by galperin et al 1988 is implemented in the model to obtain the vertical viscosity and diffusivity it simulates density and topographically induced circulation as well as tidal and wind driven flow for the sake of computational efficiency the model used in this study only covered the four western outlets of the pearl river delta the riverine boundary extended to gaoyao in the xijiang river and to shijiao in the beijiang river where daily discharges were measured the open sea boundary extended to the 40 m isobath outside the estuary to remove any errors induced by the influence of open boundaries there were 10 190 cells in the horizontal plane with cell lengths from approximately 150 m in the mw to 1 200 m at the western open ocean boundary ten layers of water column of the same relative thickness using sigma coordinate were specified vertically open sea boundaries were forced by nine harmonic constituents namely q1 o1 p1 k1 n2 m2 s2 k2 and sa the tidal harmonic constituents and salinity on the open sea boundary were extracted from a previously used large domain model which has been well calibrated and verified gong and shen 2011 this study focused on the near coast region where salinity dominates the density stratification and the influence of temperature on stratification is minimal temperature was therefore assumed to be constant during the model simulation a time step of 30 s was used the hydrodynamic roughness z0 varying from 0 002 m to 0 006 m was used based on the model calibration to improve the simulation of cohesive sediment processes in the mw the sediment transport module used by lin and kuo 2003 was implemented in this study two classes of sediments were included in this study for each class the governing equation is 1 c i t c i u x c i υ y c i z ω ω s i x k h c i x y k h c i y z k z c i z where t is the time the subscript i denotes the i th class sediment ci is the ssc in the water column g m3 x and y are the horizontal coordinate and z is the vertical coordinate u v and ω are the velocity components in the x y and z directions respectively ωi s is the sediment settling velocity kh and kz are the horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients respectively at the water surface no sediment flux is allowed and the boundary condition is 2 ω s i c i z k z c i 0 at the seabed the boundary condition for sediment flux is 3 ω s i c i k z c i z d i e i where ei is the mass of sediment eroded from the seabed per unit area per unit time known as the resuspension rate di is the sediment mass deposited on the seabed per area per unit time the erosion of cohesive sediment is based on the critical shear stress for erosion 4 e i m τ b τ cre i 1 0 for τ b τ c r e i τ b τ cre i where τb is the bed shear stress τi cre is the critical shear stress for erosion and m is an empirical constant with the same unit as erosion the deposition rate is calculated as 5 d i c b i ω s i 1 τ b τ crd i 0 for τ b τ crd i τ b τ crd i where ci b is the sediment concentration at the bottom layer of the water column and τi crd is the critical shear stress for deposition the sediment concentration at the seabed is calculated as 6 c s i t d i e i where ci s is the sediment concentration at the seabed g m2 if a unit depth at the seabed is assumed ci s then has the same unit as the suspended sediment each class of sediment is assumed to be well mixed on the seabed this simplifying assumption may neglect the interactions between each class of sediment such as armoring effects and cohesive force which are important factors that limit erodibility sanford 2008 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 moreover sediment erodibility varies with consolidation growth as a result of deposition duration and sedimentary thickness huang et al 2020 the critical shear stress is therefore set to a constant high value of 0 25 pa for both sediment classes based on suspended sediment simulations 3 2 sediment age to diagnose the time scales of sediment transport the concept of age was utilized following cart it was based on the advection diffusion equation in eulerian framework and it was also capable of dealing with reactive processes the concept was first introduced by delhez et al 1999 and deleersnijder et al 2001 to evaluate the time elapsed since particles left the region where their age is set or reset to zero this approach introduces an age concentration tracer into the model associated with each constituent being evaluated transport of the age concentration tracer is treated exactly as the corresponding tracer the theory was further applied to diagnose cohesive sediment transport in the belgian coast by considering the settling and resuspension of the age concentration tracer mercier and delhez 2007 they made a distinction between two complementary aspects of resuspension and horizontal transport of the sediment namely resuspension age and transport age the resuspension age is defined as the time elapsed since a particle is eroded from the bed and is used to diagnose the resuspension deposition events the transport age is introduced to measure the mean age of suspended sediment particles that have traveled from a source region where the age is prescribed to zero to a concerned region we used the transport age in this study and defined the sediments to have an age of zero when they entered the mw from the headwater owing to the ebb dominated dynamics in the mw the incoming sediment from offshore is negligible he et al 2018 the sediment and age concentrations at the open sea boundaries were set to zero sediments were allowed to be advected out of the model domain through all its boundaries the sediment age was computed based on sediment and age concentration the age concentration in the water column can be computed by the following equation 7 α i t u α i x υ α i y α i z ω ω s i c i x k h α i x y k h α i y z k z α i z where αi represents the sediment age concentration g m3 s the age concentration at the seabed is 8 α s i t c s i d α i e α i where 9 d α i α b i c b i d i 10 e α i α s i c s i e i where αi s and αi b are the age concentration on the seabed and in the bottom layer of the water column respectively the age concentration on the seabed αi s uses units of g m2 s the boundary condition at the interface of the bottom layer and seabed is 11 ω s i α i k z α i z d α i e α i at the seabed the increase in age concentration for each sediment class can be obtained by adding the age concentration of the newly deposited sediment during deposition events when resuspension occurs the i th class sediment is eroded with its mean age at the seabed because transport of the age concentration tracer is treated exactly as the corresponding sediment the neglect of sediment interactions on the seabed such as consolidation can lead to an underestimation of sediment age mercier and delhez 2007 applied a consolidated layer which accounts for local source of sediments to avoid any underestimation of sediment age because only the sediment age from riverine input was considered in this study the assumption of perfect mixing on the seabed is acceptable for age calculations when neglecting the local source of sediment the selection of a high critical shear stress for erosion can also reduce the associated errors induced by this assumption the sediment age is 12 a i α i c i for suspended sediment and 13 a s i α s i c s i for seabed sediment the unit of sediment age was initially in seconds and then converted into days herein 3 3 model setup the aim of this study was to evaluate sediment age under normal dynamic conditions a multi year average river discharge was thus prescribed at the riverine boundaries with 6900 m3 s for xijiang river and 1330 m3 s for beijiang river the mean sscs are 220 g m3 and 130 g m3 for the xijiang and beijiang rivers respectively the suspended sediment from the riverine sources is mainly composed of silt 70 and clay 30 hu et al 2018 in many studies the sediment grain size is essentially the main factor used to differentiate sediment classes and the settling velocity is usually calculated directly from stokes s law holt and james 1999 luan et al 2017 however the sediments in the mw are mostly suspended in the form of flocs which have a higher settling velocity than single particles moreover the settling velocity can be impacted by various factors such as sediment concentration turbulence and the organic and mineralogical composition of the sediment particle deng et al 2015 it is therefore difficult to find an appropriate mathematical formula to describe how the settling velocity responds to these important factors considering the flocculation the settling velocities were set to 0 2 mm s and 0 5 mm s for fine grained clay and coarse grained silt sediment respectively lin et al 2017 the critical shear stresses for deposition were set to 0 12 and 0 18 pa respectively based on the model calibration the parameters of the two classes of sediment are summarized in table 1 because this study focused on riverine sediment transport time we assumed that there was initially no sediment in the water column and at the seabed for computational purposes the age concentration was set to zero at the upstream boundaries the clock started as soon as the sediment was discharged into the mw to better illustrate the impacts of deposition and resuspension processes on sediment age the age of water was calculated by assigning a passive tracer at the riverine boundary both the water and sediment ages are referred to beiqingtou fig 1a the headwater of the mw the model was run for 10 years to obtain dynamic equilibrium for sediment and age concentration and only the results for the last 29 days were used the mean sediment age of each vertical layer was calculated based on eq 12 the results at each layer were averaged to obtain the vertically averaged sediment mean age an average of the vertically averaged mean sediment age during the last 29 days was conducted to remove the tidal signal boon 2004 the average sediment age was calculated for each class of sediment 3 4 model calibration to assess the model s capability for tidal simulations the tidal elevation produced by the model was compared with the observed data from december 2009 the results showed consistency between the model results and the observations particularly during spring tides fig 2 the discrepancies occurred mostly during small flood ebb tides for the dominant m2 tidal constituent in the mw the mean error for amplitude was less than 8 and the mean phase difference was less than 11 to calibrate the tidal current salinity and ssc the in situ measurements of the mw during january 2016 were used during the spring tide current salinity and ssc were continuously measured for at least 27 h and contained two flood ebb cycles in general the modeled velocity agreed with the observed current fig 3 the model can accurately compute the current speed and current direction the salinity in the estuary showed distinct fluctuations that corresponded to the river discharge and tides fig 4 the discrepancies between the model and the observations occurred mostly during peak flows during this time it was difficult to accurately simulate the sediment concentration the variations between the modeled and observed ssc had the same trend however the model was unable to reproduce the peak ssc values the discrepancies were probably caused by setting the critical shear stress uniformly in space and time and only two classes of sediments were considered fig 5 the model performance is further evaluated quantitatively using the correlation coefficient cc oke et al 2002 14 cc 1 n i 1 n m m o o s m s 0 and the skill score ss murphy 1988 allen et al 2007 15 ss 1 i 1 n m o 2 i 1 n o o 2 where m and o are the modeled and observed time series values which have mean values of m and o and standard deviations sm and so performance levels were categorized as follows 0 65 as excellent 0 65 0 5 as very good 0 5 0 2 as good and 0 2 as poor maréchal 2004 the cc of tidal current ranged from 0 51 to 0 93 with a mean value of 0 81 the ss ranged from 0 49 to 0 82 and showed a better performance near the bottom ss 0 72 than near the surface ss 0 67 the cc of salinity varied from 0 57 to 0 94 with a mean value of 0 83 the ss of the salinity simulation showed better performance near the surface ss 0 84 than near the bottom ss 0 71 for the ssc simulations the cc ranged between 0 54 and 0 79 and the ss varied from 0 42 to 0 67 overall the model results were reliable and could be used to diagnose the sediment transport time scales in the mw 4 results 4 1 mean sediment age the distribution of sediment age is shown as contours for both sediments in the water column fig 6 a and b and on the seabed fig 6c and d the sediment age shows distinct spatial variation in the mw it takes approximately 100 days for fine grained sediment ω s 0 2 mm s to transport from the headwater to the river mouth under long term averaged river discharge because of the high settling velocity ω s 0 5 mm s the transport time for coarse grained sediment is 260 days at the river mouth the transport time for the sediment is far greater than that for the water parcel which takes only 7 days fig 7 this indicates that the age of every water parcel is determined mainly by the advection diffusion process delhez et al 1999 shen and haas 2004 whereas the intermittent settling and deposition process of sediment can be a considerable factor contributing to the sediment age spatially the difference in sediment transport time is distinct for different regions of the mw in the freshwater region it takes 40 days for the fine grained sediment and 120 days for the coarse grained sediment to travel a distance of 48 km from beiqingtou to guadingjiao locations shown in fig 1b however the sediment transport time increases significantly in the brackish zone from guadingjiao to the estuary mouth it takes 60 days for the fine grained sediment and 140 days for the coarse grained sediment to travel a distance of 15 km the difference in sediment age between the freshwater region and the brackish zone is in accordance with that reported in hudson river ralston and geyer 2017 which indicates that the sediment age depends largely on local hydrodynamic conditions it is notable that there is a distinct difference between the transverse distribution of water age and sediment age for the dissolved material without settling and resuspension processes the water age is lower near the western side the transverse variation in water age is mainly determined by the exchange flow with inflow in the deep channel on the eastern side and outflow residing on the shallow shoal valle levinson and lwiza 1995 the coriolis force plays a minor role in determining the transverse structure of the exchange flow in the narrow mw given a kelvin number k e b f g h s where b represents the estuary width g is the reduced gravity hs is the mean depth of the buoyant layer and f is the coriolis force of 0 13 valle levinson 2008 the transverse distribution of sediment age is consistent with the lateral variation in bathymetry fig 1b and 6 in general the sediment age is lower in the deep channel and higher on the shallow shoals the sediment on the seabed shows a similar pattern of aging with suspended sediment interestingly the age of the seabed sediment is close to that of the suspended sediment in the main channels whereas it is several times older than suspended sediment on the shallow shoal fig 6c and d this suggests that sediment tends to deposit on the shoals where tidal current is weak 4 2 vertical distribution of sediment age the interaction between the buoyancy input of river flow and salty water in an estuary creates a density gradient force and consequently determines the transport characteristics of materials pritchard 1952 banas et al 2010 to further investigate the association between sediment age and estuarine dynamics we plotted the distribution of 29 day averaged salinity velocity ssc and sediment age fig 8 along the selected longitudinal section fig 1b sediment tends to accumulate in the lower mw where the salt front resides approximately 5 15 km from the river mouth fig 8a c this area also exhibits strong stratification with maximum surface bottom salinity difference reaching up to 18 psu therefore the peak sscs for both fine and coarse grained sediment are developed in this area which facilitates the formation of the turbidity maximum the formation of the turbidity maximum in the mw has been attributed to turbulence suppression estuarine circulation and seabed sediment resuspension liang 2004 the vertical profiles for fine and coarse grained sediment are somewhat different in the well mixed freshwater region the difference between the surface and bottom sscs for fine grained sediment is approximately 10 g m3 fig 8b inside the turbidity maximum the ssc decreases by 30 g m3 toward the upper water column because turbulent mixing is greatly suppressed by density stratification geyer 1993 the coarse grained sediment has more potential to settle on the seabed due to a high settling velocity thus the vertical gradient of ssc for coarse grained sediment is lower in the turbidity maximum than in the freshwater region fig 8c the distribution of sediment age is consistent with the estuarine hydrodynamics fig 8d and e the ages of both the fine and coarse grained sediment experience significant increases near the null point of the landward estuarine circulation which provides strong evidence for the effects of the turbidity maximum on trapping sediment friedrichs 2009 ralston et al 2012 with the absence of density gradient force sediment travels more rapidly in the freshwater region and the sediment age is homogeneous in the vertical direction while in the brackish zone the maximum surface bottom age difference can reach 40 days for the coarse sediment for both the fine and coarse grained sediment an age maximum is observed approximately 5 km from the river mouth where the sediment age is greater than those both upstream and downstream it is notable that an open sea boundary condition with diffusive flux may induce inaccurate age simulations for a significant fraction of the model domain deleersnijder et al 2020 in this work the diffusive process near the open sea boundary has a minor impact on the age simulation inside the mw given a peclet number pe u l k where u is the averaged velocity k is the averaged horizontal eddy viscosity over the domain and l is the distance between the headwater and the open sea boundary of approximately 255 the formation of the age maximum is therefore likely caused by the convergent estuarine circulation rather than errors induced by the boundary condition 4 3 suspended age and deposition age another model scenario was conducted to further investigate the time that the sediment has been suspended in the water column which is referred to as suspended age in this study because it is assumed there is no sediment on the seabed the riverine sediment can be persistently suspended in the water column by setting the critical shear stress for deposition to zero the results for suspended age are shown in fig 9 a and 9b the fine sediment is suspended for nearly 18 days when transports from the headwater to the river mouth fig 9a due to the high settling velocity the suspended age for coarse sediment that travels the same distance is approximately 60 fig 9b the suspended age is generally several times greater than the age of water parcel which suggests that sediments tend to be accumulated in the near bottom region and transported by the relatively weak bottom flow in the freshwater region the suspended age for fine sediment is similar to the water age the suspended age for coarse sediment is approximately 2 3 times greater than that of the fine sediment which is proportional to the settling velocity in the brackish zone the interaction between freshwater and salty water generates a strong vertical density gradient and the upward diffusion of sediment is largely suppressed winterwerp 2001 in addition the seaward advection of sediment is reduced by the landward baroclinic force associated with the longitudinal density gradient a large portion of sediment is transported upstream by the landward bottom current and the suspended age increases significantly the difference between sediment age and suspended age is the time that sediment has stayed on the seabed which is termed as deposition age the results for the deposition age of fine and coarse grained sediment are show in fig 9c and d in general the deposition age is 3 40 times greater than the suspended age the spatial distribution of the deposition age is similar to the sediment age and accounts for approximately 70 to 98 of the sediment age this indicates that the intermittent erosion and deposition processes are the most important factors that control the sediment transport time a rapid increase in deposition age is observed near the landward limit of salt intrusion where sediments are most efficiently trapped geyer 1993 5 discussion 5 1 role of river discharge many previous studies have examined the response of water age to variations in river discharge because the advective transport induced by freshwater discharge is responsible for most of the seaward material transport lerczak et al 2006 dissolved materials in an estuary are efficiently transported downstream under high discharge conditions thus less time is required for them to be flushed out of the estuary wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 a recent study in the chesapeake bay further demonstrated that high river discharge during a tropical storm tended to carry a large amount of sediments to the lower bay cheng et al 2013 thus it is necessary to examine the correlation between sediment age and river discharge to further investigate the effects of river discharge on the sediment age two model scenarios were conducted by specifying the long term average river discharge during the dry season 2860 m3 s for the xijiang river and 551 m3 s for the beijiang river and wet season 11600 m3 s for the xijiang river and 2150 m3 s for the beijiang river at the riverine boundaries the results show that sediment age is inversely proportional to the river discharge fig 10 under the mean flow condition during the dry season the sediment age increases considerably it takes 350 days and 750 days for the fine sediment and coarse sediment discharged from the headwaters to transport to the estuary mouth respectively in contrast it takes only 30 days for fine grained sediment and 80 days for coarse grained sediment to transport from the headwater to the river mouth for the wet season simulation the sediment age results under different flow conditions suggest that river discharge plays a major role in sediment transport in the mw most sediments are carried downstream by the freshwater discharge yuan et al 2012 owing to the ebb dominated hydrodynamics a change in river discharge would alter the net seaward sediment flux and ultimately determine the sediment transport time scales on the other hand the distance of salt intrusion varies by approximately 30 km between dry and wet seasons gong and shen 2011 gong et al 2018 the turbidity maximum resides at the location of the landward limit of salt intrusion geyer 1993 sediments are therefore more efficiently trapped during the dry season because the landward movement of the turbidity maximum and sediment age is typically 10 15 times greater than that during the wet season 5 2 sediment settling and resuspension gong and shen 2010 demonstrated that the intermittent settling and resuspension processes strongly affect the sediment age however the underlying mechanisms have not been examined the model results in this study also demonstrate that the sediment age is highly relevant to the resuspension and deposition processes given the longer transport time for sediment than that for the water parcel figs 6 and 7 in an estuary sediment deposition is determined by the bottom shear stress and the strength of turbulent mixing is responsible for keeping sediment in suspension kostaschuk et al 1989 winterwerp and van kesteren 2004 to examine the resuspension frequency we statistically analyzed the time that bottom shear stress exceeds the critical erosion stress and investigated the capacity for sediment remaining in suspension using the turbulent diffusion coefficient the time that bottom shear stress exceeds the critical erosion stress accounts for approximately 85 of the total computation time in the upper reach of the mw because of the large freshwater input fig 11 a the interaction between the strong current and seabed generates strong turbulent mixing in the main channel of the freshwater region with the maximum depth averaged turbulent diffusivity reaching 0 01 m2 s fig 11b the turbulent diffusivity also features distinctive transverse variation which coincides with the bathymetric change therefore the age difference between the suspended sediment and seabed sediment in the main channel of the freshwater region is minor because of the low potential for sediment resuspension riverine sediments favor deposition on the shallow shoals fig 12 and a higher sediment age is expected in the brackish zone the time that bottom shear stress exceeds the critical erosion stress decreases incrementally to 25 the interaction between freshwater and salt water generates vertical stratification which suppresses turbulent mixing the depth averaged turbulent diffusivity is less than 0 003 m2 s in the turbidity maximum and further decreases to less than 0 001 m2 s near the estuary mouth consequently the turbidity maximum becomes the major trapping area for sediment as seen in other estuaries ralston et al 2012 yellen et al 2017 the deposited sediments settle with their ages and the ages continue increasing while they stay on the seabed the sediment transport time scales therefore experience rapid increases inside the turbidity maximum 5 3 suspended sediment transport the major physical processes that control the net longitudinal material transport in an estuary are estuarine circulation and turbulent diffusion feng 1987 for sediment movement the settling velocity should be taken into account because it determines the vertical suspended sediment profile and ultimately alters sediment transport efficiency pejrup and edelvang 2014 the tidal averaged sediment transport can be written as 16 c i t u l c i x z k z c i z ω s i c i z where the overbars denote tidal average the lagrangian residual velocity u l is used to advect mass rather than eulerian residuals the terms on the left side are the change rate of the ssc and the terms on the right denote tidally averaged advection which is associated with the residual current turbulent diffusion and the sediment settling process the sediment transport mechanism analysis for both fine and coarse grained sediment was conducted and the results are shown in fig 13 in the freshwater region turbulent diffusion is the dominant factor in sediment transport thus the eroded sediment from the seabed can be rapidly diffused upward fig 13c and d given the low potential for sediment deposition in the freshwater region the suspended sediment is efficiently advected downstream fig 13a and b the distribution of the sediment age therefore shows a pattern similar to that of the water parcel and the increase of the sediment transport time is minor in the brackish zone the upward diffusion of sediment is constrained below the pycnocline because of the presence of stratification flores et al 2017 in the upper water column the sediment is mainly advected from upstream which has a lower age while near the bottom sediments with higher ages outside the estuary mouth can be transported back by the baroclinically driven residual current under the combined impacts of turbulence suppression and settling velocity fig 13e and f these older sediments tend to accumulate continually near the estuary mouth with a distance between 5 and 10 km consequently the sediment age in this zone is higher than either upstream or downstream and a distinct surface bottom age difference can be observed 5 4 implications for the estuarine ecosystem the dissolved material in an estuary is usually retained for several to dozens of days depending on the estuary length and dynamic conditions de brye et al 2012 nadell et al 2016 due to the settling and resuspension processes the transport time scales for sediment range from several months to years gong and shen 2010 ralston and geyer 2017 with the long term retention of sediments on the seabed organic rich sediments have been found to be the largest dissolved oxygen sink in estuaries lee et al 2009 pollutants heavy metals and organic carbons that adhere to the sediment are likely to accumulate in areas where sediments deposit observations have shown that the concentrations of heavy metals such as pb and cd are 2 3 times greater in the brackish zone of the mw than in the freshwater region shi et al 2015 these heavy metals have a high possibility of being released into the water column during resuspension events chen et al 2013 which poses a severe threat to the water quality of the estuary 6 conclusions the riverine sediment transport time scales in the mw were quantitatively investigated using the concept of age as defined in cart a three dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics and sediment movement in the mw and thoroughly verified by field observations the well calibrated model was used to simulate the sediment transport and estimate sediment age the model results demonstrate that a substantial time is required for the sediment to transport from the headwater downstream to the estuary mouth it takes approximately 100 days and 240 days for fine grained settling velocity ωs 0 2 mm s and coarse grained sediment ωs 0 5 mm s respectively to travel from the headwaters to the estuary mouth the episodic deposition and resuspension processes play key roles in determining the sediment transport time scales therefore sediment remains longer on the seabed than suspended in the water column spatially riverine sediment travels more rapidly in the freshwater region than in the brackish zone a rapid increase in sediment transport time is expected when these sediments are trapped in the salt front due to turbulence suppression estuarine circulation and resuspension because the turbulence is suppressed by stratification the upward diffusion is constrained to the area below the pycnocline and sediment is trapped inside the frontal zone the sediment in the upper water column is mainly advected from upstream thus the maximum surface bottom age difference can reach up to 40 days the sediment age during the dry season is 10 15 times greater than that during the wet season because of seasonal changes in freshwater runoff unlike passive material the transport time scales for sediment range from several months to years heavy metals attached to sediment accumulate inside the estuary and pose a major threat to the estuarine ecosystem credit authorship contribution
