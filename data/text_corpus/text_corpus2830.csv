agitation speed from 100 to 200 rpm contact time from 1 to 24 h and temperature from 15 to 40 c to consider the performance appraisal of dspb and dscc adsorbents characterizations were executed through sem ft ir edx point of zero charge and surface area measurement to inspect the surface morphology and surface chemistry of dspb and dscc sorption study exposed non linear method was more desirable than linear methods in fitting the investigation results with more accuracy langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model were exposed as best fitted isotherm and kinetic model

and dscc validates the sorption process efficient therefore the activated form of date seed derived biochar offered potential contention as a sorbent for ibuprofen remotion from aqueous media keywords ibuprofen non linear isotherm kinetics desorption 1 introduction over the periods increasing the production of pharmaceutical compounds are exploiting pharmaceutical pollutants due to the continuous expulsion of wastewater into aquatic bodies from pharmaceutical industries nsaids non steroidal anti inflammatory drug are being used widely to prevent different types of diseases by humans as well as other animals 1 the amplified usage of the nsaids has raised the concentration to a detectable range in wastewater which is alarming for the aquatic environment 2 due to having strong stability their concentration level remains at danger limit and that makes it so much significant in the point of view of pollution the negative impact of such drugs like the conquest of developing cell growth in the human body prostration of liver and gills in fish is a point of anxiety for the researcher 3 ibuprofen 2 4 isobutylphenyl propanoic acid is one of the utmost consumed nsaid used as the main painkiller in headache arthritis dental pain muscle pain etc an extensive amount of ibuprofen has been identified in wastewater and aquatic bodies which is worrying condition to the aquatic environment due to its harmful effect in the ecosystem 4 6 consequently the elimination of such drugs from water is indispensable for human and animal health conventional water treatment processes have not been established as an efficient technology for the remotion of ibp from wastewater considering its less water solubility and higher polarity 7 therefore various processes like coagulation flocculation 8 advanced oxidation processes aop 9 photocatalytic degradation 10 have been used for removal of nsaids from water whereas the adsorption process has been initiated to be the most efficient technology for the exclusion of contaminants from aqueous bodies due to several deficiencies of stated techniques 11 elimination of various contaminants from liquid and gaseous effluent by the adsorption process has been recognized as a proficient and approachable technology for several years activated carbon extensively used to remove numerous organic contaminants from aqueous solution offers convenient result after activation with impressive porosity and surface area due to enlargement of pores and enhancement of surface area 4 12 physically and chemically activated biochar derived from various natural precursors have been effectively used as adsorbent towards the exclusion of organic pollutants numerous natural ingredients like potato peel modified biochar 13 wood apple 14 pine chip 15 and raspberry 16 have been used as a sorbent for the remotion of ibp from contaminated water the date fruit phoenix dactylifera is one of the foremost fruits grown in many tropical regions of the world the date fruit seed generally consists of cellulose lignin hemicelluloses and lignin cellulose where chief functional groups are cellulose and hemicellulose which comprise oxygen carbonyl ether and hydroxyl the date stone derivative adsorbent has been employed for exclusion of different organic and inorganic pollutants like uranium vi 17 methylene blue 18 chromium cr vi 19 levofloxacin 20 from aqueous solution however fewer studies have been reported on the adsorption of organic pollutants using date stone biochar as sorbent thus date stone derived activated biochar can be a novel substitute as adsorbent for ibuprofen remotion from aqueous bodies the current research explores the sorption competence of date stone derived activated biochar towards ibp exclusion from contaminated water batch investigations with inconstant experimental parameters like ph sorbent dosage agitation speed initial ibp concentration contact time and temperature were executed to examine the efficacy of bi directional form of date stone derived biochar for uptake of ibp in order to justify the better sorption performance of dspb and dscc a non linear isotherm and kinetics model approach was included which can be an imperative inclusion in the ibp remotion study the thermodynamic study explores the process of energy requirement the reusability performance of dspb and dscc was examined in the regeneration study cost assessment of the sorbents was presented for the prospects of dspb and dscc on a larger scale of ibp removal study 2 materials and methods 2 1 assortment and preparation of date seed biochar date stone seeds were acquired from the local market without any cost initially it was washed properly by deionized water afterward it was kept in sunlight for 2 to 3 days followed by drying in a hot air oven at temperature 60 c overnight to remove all the moisture later moisture free seeds were crushed and made ready for carbonization in further operation date seeds were placed in a cylindrical shaped muffle furnace for carbonization at temperature 700 c for 1 h afterward biochar was taken out from the furnace and cooled at room temperature then it was ground with pestle and mortar and sieved to a size 150 Î¼m and finally produced biochar was kept in an airtight container for further activation process 2 1 1 production of steam activated or physically activated date seed biochar carbonized biochar was activated in a cylindrical muffle furnace with superheated steam at a pressure of 1 5 kg cm2 and at a temperature 800 c for 1 h with a flow rate of 1 1 5 kg h finally date seeds physically activated biochar dspb was cooled and placed in a desiccator 2 1 2 preparation of chemically activated date seed biochar carbonized biochar was chemically impregnated with ortho phosphoric acid at a 3 2 wt ratio for overnight at 30 c in a magnetic stirrer after chemical treatment of date seed biochar with h3po4 deionized water was used for washing the treated biochar until it reached ph 7 and then it was dried in a hot air oven at a temperature of 60 65 c for overnight finally moisture free chemically activated date seed biochar dscc was stored 2 2 solution preparation 100 mg l of stock solution was prepared by adding 100 mg of ibuprofen sigma aldrich st louis mo in 90 of deionized water and 10 of methanol chromasolv for hplc 99 9 sigma aldrich in standard volumetric flask methanol was added to dissolve ibuprofen in solution as it was less soluble in water several working solutions of different concentrations were prepared by successive dilution from the prepared solution 2 3 determination of point of zero charge the point of zero charge of dspb and dscc was determined by 0 01 m nacl solutions with different ph values ranging from 2 to 10 both sorbents of 0 2 g were added separately in 20 ml solution and the mixtures were stirring for 48 h solution ph was maintained using 0 1 n naoh and 0 1 n hcl solutions the zero point charge was found by plotting initial solution ph and supernatant ph 2 4 adsorption investigations adsorption experiments of ibp by steam activated dspb and chemically activated dscc date seed biochar were performed in batch mode with several parametric conditions of ph 1 7 sorbent dose 333 10000 mg l agitation speed 100 200 rpm initial ibp concentrations 5 50 mg l temperature 15 c 40 c interaction time 1 24 h to explore the optimal condition for adsorption study the individual experiments were executed with different ibp concentration and collected samples were analyzed through uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan to measure the ibp concentration at 220 nm the ibp uptake of sorbents can be measured by qe mg g calculated from eq 1 as follows 1 q e c i c e v m where ci signifies ibp concentrations before adsorption ce indicates equilibrium ibp concentrations after sorption in mg l v represents solution volume in l m designates the adsorbent mass in g the general equation for ibp exclusion percentage is given in eq 2 2 re m o v a l c i c f c i 100 cf is ibp concentration after sorption in mg l 2 5 isotherm models sorption isotherms such as langmuir isotherm 21 freundlich isotherm 22 has been used in the present study langmuir isotherm substantiates the overall performance of the isotherm system and the sorption uptake capability of sorbent materials freundlich isotherm model is applied at low to intermediate concentration range of adsorbate molecules and is essentially associated with heterogeneous surface of sorbents however several isotherm models were reported in various adsorption studies by the researchers the toth isotherm 23 is an analytical alteration of the langmuir equation which is applied for reducing error between predicted and experimental value 24 this model is of utmost significance for its use in modeling of numerous multilayer and heterogeneous sorption methods 25 s b k model is another type of model used in the adsorption process evaluation of experimental and modeled sorption uptakes for silica gel as an adsorbent by the s b k model was reported by oh and saha 2013 2 2 6 a non linear methods determination of kinetic and isotherm model parameters of non linear study coefficient of determination r2 and chi squared Ï2 values are significant to inspect the better fitting of experimental data towards model validation chi squared Ï2 and co efficient of determination r2 values are calculated using eq 3 and eq 4 correspondingly as follows 3 Ï 2 q e e x p q e c a l 2 q e c a l 4 r 2 1 q e e x p q e c a l 2 q e e x p q e m e a n 2 where the amount of ibp uptake at equilibrium can be signified by qe exp mg g and qe cal mg g implies the quantity of ibp uptake both qe exp mg g and qe cal mg g can be determined using solver add in in microsoft excel chi squared Ï2 adjacent to zero signifies that experimental data and theoretical data attained from the model are supposed to similar therefore chi squared assessment is indispensable to ratify the finest fitted model for sorption investigation 26 2 7 desorption and reusability study physically activated date seed biochar dspb and chemically activated date seed biochar dscc both of 1000 mg l was equilibrated for 18 h with 20 mg l ibp solution in a shaker incubator at a constant agitation speed of 150 rpm ph 2 and temperature 20 c ibp desorption study was performed using methanol as a desorbing agent both spent sorbents were washed with 0 6 n methanol solution and the filtrate was analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometry to measure the ibp concentration after desorption in the filtrate the recyclability of the dspb and dscc was determined through the recurrence of the sorption regeneration procedure and it was repeated with regenerated sorbents in each recycle 3 results and discussions 3 1 adsorbents characterization 3 1 1 morphological study textural properties surface area and pore volume of the sorbents were explored through bet brunauer emmet teller surface area analyzer gemini vii india to examined pore volume and surface area of adsorbents the surface area of dspb and dscc was 513 m2 g and 342 m2 g correspondingly and the total pore volume of dspb and dscc were 0 205 cm3 g and 0 132 cm3 g respectively morphological analysis of dspb than dscc presented better surface area and microporous nature of sorbents may be due to the development of pores on sorbent exteriors scanning electron microscopic analysis sem jeol jsm 6510 japan was performed to inspect the surface morphology of dspb and dscc before and after sorption sem pictures as portrayed in fig 1 a d shows the textural transformation between dspb and dscc unequal and various pores were witnessed for dspb in fig 1a and in fig 1b it can be seen that pores were clogged as the existence of a greyish layer was observed and that may be due to ibp sorption onto the surface of dspb several irregular pores and extended surfaces were observed in fig 1c d blocking of pores and greyish layers were evinced for ibp devotion detected in fig 1d this study favors steam activation presenting more pores onto dspb surface that resulted in better ibp attachment on the surface of dscc the interface between the ibp ions and adsorbents may responsible for ibp sorption on the surface of the sorbents 27 surface charge phpzc of dspb and dscc was determined to investigate the preliminary consequence of solution ph onto sorbents phpzc for dspb and dscc was found to be 5 8 and 5 1 respectively 3 1 2 ft ir analysis of adsorbents the existence of the functional groups on the dspb and dscc can be inspected through ft ir techniques perkin elmer c109292 india accountable functional groups existence for sorption of ibp by dspb and dscc was explored through the ft ir study ft ir study in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 was executed to examine the surface chemistry of dspb and dscc as showed in fig 3a aromatic c h bend at 805 cm 1 ether c o bend at 1257 cm 1 amide co stretch at 1650 cm 1 and alcohol oh stretch at 3407 cm 1 were observed before sorption for dspb and after ibp adhesion of the bands were fairly shifted to 812 cm 1 aromatic group c h bend 1216 cm 1 ether c o bend 1643 cm 1 amide co stretch and 3402 cm 1 alcohol oh stretch remained the same group after sorption however the inclusion of carboxylic co bend at 1747 cm 1 was noticed in dspb after ibp adhesion may due to the presence of the carboxylic group in ibuprofen confirmed ibp sorption in dspb now for dscc existence of various functional groups like aromatic c h bend at 805 cm 1 ether c o at 1203 cm 1 amide co stretch at 1637 cm 1 and alcohol oh stretch at 3456 cm 1 were observed as depicted in fig 3b peaks were lifted to ether c o bend at 1205 cm 1 amide co stretch at 1642 cm 1 and alcohol oh bend at 3407 cm 1 in dscc after sorption of ibp again the addition of the carboxylic co bond at 1718 cm 1 was observed in dscc after ibp adhesion confirmed the attachment of ibuprofen moieties into dscc it can be seen in fig 3 aromatic bend amide bend and alcohol stretch were the accountable group for adhesion of ibp onto dspb and dscc 3 1 3 edx study of dspb and dscc elemental composition analysis of raw and spent dspb and dscc respectively was listed in table 1 and observed in fig 2 elemental analysis of both the sorbents revealed the presence of a considerable amount of carbon c and oxygen o in dspb and dscc the increase of carbon percentage after ibp sorption was noticed in table 1 confirmed the attachment of ibp in dspb and dscc as carbon c and oxygen o are the main constituent of ibuprofen c13h18o2 hence alterations of weight percentage of carbon and oxygen after sorption inferred ibp adhesion onto sorbents 14 3 2 various parametric effects 3 2 1 effect of ph the solution ph shows a decisive role in ibp adsorption onto dspb and dscc solution ph was considered whereas sorbent dose 3330 mg l initial ibuprofen concentration 20 mg l agitation speed 150 rpm temperature 20 c and interaction time 18 h remained constant the maximum ibp removal was 70 18 for dscc and 71 90 for dspb at ph 3 has been witnessed in fig 4 a favorable ibp exclusion was observed in an acidic state and an increase in ph sorption was reduced which may be due to the influence of pka value of ibp and point of zero charge ph pzc maximum elimination has been achieved at ph 3 as the ibp pka value was 4 91 as a protonated form of ibp was dominant in the solution a steady concordance between the protonated form of ibp and sorbent surfaces was observed the stable interface among non ionized ibp moieties and positively charged sorbent surface might have occurred when ibp pka value was more than ph of the solution it may be owing to the fact of an increase of positive charge on the sorbent surface once solution ph was less than the point of zero charge of the sorbent ph pzc the point of zero charges ph pzc of dspb and dscc was 6 1 and 6 4 correspondingly therefore ibp sorption rate was reduced due to electrostatic repulsion between less positively charged sorbent surfaces and anionic ibp as it became more anionic with an increase in ph 28 29 comparable drift was stated in our earlier exertion 27 3 2 2 impact of sorbent dose the consequence of sorbent dosage on ibp adsorption is imperative towards the ibp removal study by dspb and dscc sorption of ibp using various doses 333 10000 mg l at constant speed 150 rpm ph 3 temperature 20 c and time 18 h has been examined maximum exclusion of 79 81 and 76 87 at dose 6660 mg l were observed for dspb and dscc respectively as noticed in fig 4b removal of ibp was increased with dose since most of the unoccupied active site accessible initially and fast diffusion of ibp to unrestricted active site of the sorbents exterior ensued for both the sorbent though marginally drop of adsorption was observed with further increase of adsorbent dose owing to mass accretion on an active site of adsorbents at higher dose produced a decrease of active surface area for sorption 30 31 3 2 2 1 sorption mechanism of ibp on to dspb and dscc the sorption mechanism of ibp onto dspb and dscc can be categorized through the following influential factor i ibp sorption was involved in hydrogen bond exchanges between the carboxyl groups of ibuprofen and responsible functional group present in dspb and dscc which may confirm in ftir study ii functional groups like carboxylic co stretch ether c o bend alcohol oh stretch were responsible for ibp attachment for both the adsorbents dspb and dscc can be inveterate in ftir this might be accredited to the fact of ion interaction between the existing group in sorbents and ibp moieties which consist of the carboxylic group cooh resulted shifting of the peak in fig 3 after ibp adhesion onto dspb and dscc iii maximum adsorption of ibp was perceived in acidic medium for both the sorbent since at ph more than the pka value of the ibp its carboxylate anions r coo progressively existing however as ph increases ph is greater than pzc the adsorbents develop negative charged producing increased electrostatic repulsion of carboxylate anions of ibp and dspb and dscc resulted in reducing in sorption the intraparticle diffusion mechanism in the solid liquid phase was also decisive for the sorption mechanism 32 3 2 3 impact of initial ibp concentration and agitation speed initial ibp concentration shows a significant role in the adsorption study the effect of initial concentration on ibp sorption by dspb and dscc was presented in fig 4c ibp removal percentage increases with a rise in concentration up to 30 mg l for dspb and 1 25 mg l for dscc then removal of ibp was decreased for both the adsorbents maximum ibp remotion of dspb and dscc was obtained 92 35 at 30 mg l and 85 73 at 25 mg l respectively though due to the availability of free sorbents active sites initially fast diffusion of ibp molecules occurred onto dspb and dscc caused better sorption further rise in ibp concentration caused a slower sorption rate of ibp this may be accredited to the fact that the increase in initial ibp concentration available active sites of the adsorbents were enervated by ibp moieties which produced insufficient sorbents surface for sorption similar implications were noticed in reported studies 33 34 agitation speed is one of the active constraints in batch study ibp sorption was increased with a rise in agitation speed up to 160 rpm for both dspb and dscc then the rate of sorption was decreased as noticed in fig 4d whereas sorbent dose ph initial ibp concentration temperature and interaction time were kept constant this may be because the rate of sorption was increased as enhancement of the turbulence which develops boundary layer diffusion between sorbent inner surface and ibp molecules ibp may unable to interrelate with active sites of dspb and dscc when active sites were fenced by the upper adsorbents layer resulted in slow adsorption 34 therefore initially the ibp remotion rate was more with an increase in agitation speed comparable type of results was noticed in reported studies tables 2 and 3 3 2 3 1 isotherm models the current study explored the non linear and linear isotherm models for ibp sorption by dspb and dscc fig 5 implies the linearized plot of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models and the calculated parameters are given in table 4 the linear plot of langmuir isotherm for dscc and dspb showed a high r2 value of 0 990 and 0 973 correspondingly it has been found in fig 5a from the linearized plot that langmuir constant kl and maximum ibp uptake qm were attained 0 237 l mg and 10 51 mg g respectively for dspb and qm and kl of 13 87 mg g and 0 115 l mg respectively were obtained for dscc monolayer sorption recommended in langmuir isotherm linearized plot for both the sorbents freundlich isotherm linear plot for ibp removal by dspb and dscc was exhibited in fig 5b as r2 values of dscc and dspb were 0 994 and 0 923 respectively found in the freundlich isotherm plot which showed the goodness of fit to the model the kf value was found to be 0 132 for dspb and 0 477 for dscc whereas 1 n was 3 75 and 1 77 for dspb and dscc respectively from freundlich isotherm linear plot in the non linear model chi squared Ï2 and correlation coefficient r2 is indispensable for model fitting in a given sorption process 39 correlation coefficient r2 and chi squared Ï2 values for langmuir and freundlich non linear parameters were listed in table 4 it can be witnessed that in the case of non linear langmuir isotherm the co efficient of determination r2 for dspb was 0 959 and for dscc was 0 948 which exhibited non linear models as well fit in comparison to the linear model the value of chi squared Ï2 value for dspb and dscc was found 0 003 and 0 002 respectively seems to be very low which corroborates the implication of the non linear model in the case of dspb qm was found to be 13 17 mg g and kl was obtained 0 018 l mg again for dscc qm and kl were 11 23 mg g and 0 013 l mg respectively found from langmuir s isotherm non linear plot which was quite nearly as obtained in the linear model again the value of co efficient of determination r2 for the non linear form of freundlich isotherm for dspb and dscc was obtained 0 887 and 0 929 respectively chi squared Ï2 value of 0 233 for dspb and 0 002 for dscc as listed in table 4 recommended more precision than linear plot in fitting experimental data though langmuir isotherm was endorsed as a better fitted model for both dspb and dscc proposed monolayer sorption 3 2 4 influence of contact time ibp sorption effect on interaction time has been presented in fig 4e where ph sorbent dose initial ibp concentration agitation speed and temperature of 2 3330 mg l 20 mg l 150 rpm and 20 c respectively were constant fig 4e signifies that ibp removal percentage increases with a rise in time then it is saturated this may due to the initial presence of adequately free active sites on the adsorbent exteriors then it is slowly decreased with an increase of ibp attachment onto sorbent surfaces a maximum ibp removal percentage of 96 24 for dspb at 18 h and 87 01 for dscc at 21 h was obtained similarly chakraborty et al 2018 and 40 reported comparable drift for adsorption study 3 2 4 1 kinetic studies pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetic models were examined both non linear and linear schemes for better accuracy of fitting experimental results towards the ibp sorption process fig 6 and table 5 presented the linearized plot of pfo and pso models and kinetic parameter data respectively the correlation co efficient r2 values were 0 943 for dspb and 0 960 for dscc in the case of linearized forms of pfo kinetic model and r2 values of 0 995 and 0 997 for dspb and dscc respectively were determined in pso kinetic model pso kinetic model in linear form was the more amicable model of fitting experimental data than pfo kinetic model kinetic study endorses pso kinetic model which may be the rate limiting step of the ibp adsorption process whereas the intra particle diffusion model confirmed the impact of resistance of mass transfer on ibp sorption by dspb and dscc the diffusion constant kd was obtained 0 186 and 0 279 for dscc and dspb respectively from the qt vs t0 5 plot slop as designates in fig 6c the qt vs t0 5 plot exhibited ibp sorption using dspb and dscc complied multi linearity of data obtained from the kinetic study non linear regression was proposed to evade different constraints of the linear kinetic model towards justification of model relevancy to the sorption technique 41 kinetic parameters in the non linear form of pfo and pso models were listed in table 5 chi squared Ï2 values of 0 054 and 0 251 for dspb and dscc respectively were obtained in pfo and Ï2 values of 0 0085 for dspb and 0 0086 for dscc were found in pso the kinetic parameters data presented in table 5 favored to pso kinetic model therefore a non linear form of kinetic models was offered greater precision of fitting investigational data for both dspb and dscc 3 2 5 consequence of temperature on ibp adsorption the impact of temperature on ibp sorption by dspb and dscc has been explored at the temperature range 15 40 c ibp sorption decreased with a rise in temperature and at 20 c maximum ibp removal was achieved as shown in fig 4f ibp removal of 95 16 and 86 10 for dspb and dscc respectively were found ibp sorption rate was reduced at high temperature because of weak van der wall forces between ibp and sorbents which resulted in disruption of adsorptive forces with a rise in temperature primarily rise in the diffusion rate of ibp onto sorbents displayed better sorption and diffusion rate was decreased with further escalation in temperature this outcome can be vindicated by further associated studies 14 table 6 3 2 5 1 thermodynamic model calculated values of thermodynamic model parameters of dspb and dscc were tabulated in table 7 Î´s and Î´h values were determined from the slope and intercept respectively of Î´g versus t plot as portrays in fig 7 negative values of Î´h for dspb and dscc as tabulated in table 7 substantiated that the sorption process was exothermic and negative values of Î´s recommended ineffectiveness to ibp sorption with increasing temperature rise of Î´ g 0 values with the rise in temperature considered satisfactory sorption at low temperatures parametric values of thermodynamic study exposed sorption processes were feasible and spontaneous 3 3 desorption study efficacy of the sorbent can be justified by its recycle capability towards use on a larger scale in the current study methanol has been used for the desorption of ibp it can be witnessed in fig 8 dspb and dscc have been employed for the uptake of ibp up to 4 5 cycles which presented a substantial result for investigation of the reusability potential of both the adsorbents ibp remotion percentage was reduced from 92 43 to 69 54 for dspb and 85 26 to 61 89 for dscc fig 8 after 5 series of adsorption desorption the selection of methanol for desorption of ibp exhibited favorable outcomes as methanol also used for reusability study in our previous investigations for ibp sorption by coconut shell 43 and sugarcane bagasse 27 the reusability exploitation of dspb and dscc offered fruitful consequences that appear to be both the sorbents as competent for ibp sorption however sorbent properties generally changed after ibp sorption due to chemical interactions between sorbent and ibp molecules the surface area of dspb and dscc might be decreased by the blockage of micro pores of the surface of the adsorbent by contaminants aging could be considered as loading of ibp molecules onto the sorbent the sorption capacity of the adsorbent may be reduced by the aging effect it can be seen in fig 8 that after each cycle ibp sorption capability was decreased might be attributed to the fact of aging effect of sorbent zhang et al 44 offered that the surface area of biochar decreases as aging disturbs the potential sorption capacity of biochar undesirably 3 4 cost analysis of precursor production the cost valuation of dspb and dscc production was calculated in indian rupee inr sorbents cost analysis has been presented in table 8 a detailed study of the production cost of dspb and dscc clearly shows that production costs can be curbed by indigenous preparation the production cost of dscc was slightly higher than dspb as the chemical used in the activation process of dscc the overall price for the manufacture of dspb and dscc was 137 36 inr kg and 154 61 inr kg with a difference of approximately 17 inr the production price of various sorbents from different precursors such as aegle marmelos 14 colocasia esculenta 30 31 and parthenium hysterophorus 33 were 245 3 inr kg 100 573 inr kg and 188 903 inr kg respectively that has been reported in the previous works therefore the cost of dspb and dscc was considerable as compared to prices of other sorbents and can be used as effective adsorbent for ibp exclusion from the aqueous body 4 safe disposal study safe discarding of ibp laden sorbents is exceedingly recommended since disposing of ibp ions into soil resulted in secondary pollutants which leading to environmental pollution several procedures like incineration at medium temperature chemical decomposition waste immobilization by encapsulation burning in open containers etc can be adopted for secure disposal of ibp loaded dspb and dscc 5 conclusion the present investigation inspected the enactment of date stone derived activated biochar dspb and dscc by varying ph sorbent dose agitation speed initial ibp concentration interaction time and temperature ibp removal from aqueous solution was achieved 87 01 for dscc at 21 h and 96 24 at 18 h for dspb maximum uptake capacity qm of dspb and dscc was found 10 51 mg g and 13 87 mg g respectively langmuir isotherms of both linear and non linear model were recommended monolayer sorption as well fitted to experimental data of the sorption process by dspb and dscc the results from kinetic studies executed pseudo second order kinetic model as the best fitted model for both the sorbents it can be determined that non linear models were produced moderate elucidation of data correctness for ibp sorption than linear models from isotherm and kinetic studies thermodynamic studies of the sorption process exposed exothermic feasibility and favorable sorption occurred at lower temperatures regeneration capability of both the sorbents up to 5 cycles showed the potential ability of both the adsorbents the preparation cost of dspb and dscc has also favored the process to become cost efficient as compared to other sorbents reported so far therefore the ability of activated forms of date stone biochar can be employed as a prospective sorbent for ibp adsorption from

14150,current investigation explores the adsorption competences of steam activated date seed biochar dspb and chemically activated date seed biochar dscc towards ibuprofen ibp remotion from an aqueous

agitation speed from 100 to 200 rpm contact time from 1 to 24 h and temperature from 15 to 40 c to consider the performance appraisal of dspb and dscc adsorbents characterizations were executed through sem ft ir edx point of zero charge and surface area measurement to inspect the surface morphology and surface chemistry of dspb and dscc sorption study exposed non linear method was more desirable than linear methods in fitting the investigation results with more accuracy langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model were exposed as best fitted isotherm and kinetic model respectively for adsorption study of ibp maximum ibp remotion of 96 by dspb at 18 h and 87 by dscc at 21 h was achieved the spontaneous exothermic and feasible nature was exposed in the thermodynamic study of the ibp sorption technique by dspb and dscc regeneration of sorbents exhibited 69 54 and 61 89 of ibp removal for dspb and dscc respectively after 5 cycles of use the production cost of dspb and dscc validates the sorption process efficient therefore the activated form of date seed derived biochar offered potential contention as a sorbent for ibuprofen remotion from aqueous media keywords

expulsion of wastewater into aquatic bodies from pharmaceutical industries nsaids non steroidal anti inflammatory drug are being used widely to prevent different types of diseases by humans as well as

its harmful effect in the ecosystem 4 6 consequently the elimination of such drugs from water is indispensable for human and animal health conventional water treatment processes have not been established as an efficient technology for the remotion of ibp from wastewater considering its less water solubility and higher polarity 7 therefore various processes like coagulation flocculation 8 advanced oxidation processes aop 9 photocatalytic degradation 10 have been used for removal of nsaids from water whereas the adsorption process has been initiated to be the most efficient technology for the exclusion of contaminants from aqueous bodies due to several deficiencies of stated techniques 11 elimination of various contaminants from liquid and gaseous effluent by the adsorption process has been recognized as a proficient and approachable technology for several years activated carbon extensively used to remove numerous organic contaminants from aqueous solution offers convenient result after activation with impressive porosity and surface area due to enlargement of pores and enhancement of surface area 4 12 physically and chemically activated biochar derived from various natural precursors have been effectively used as adsorbent towards the exclusion of organic pollutants numerous natural ingredients like potato peel modified biochar 13 wood apple 14 pine chip 15 and raspberry 16 have been used as a sorbent for the remotion of ibp from contaminated water the date fruit phoenix dactylifera is one of the foremost fruits grown in many tropical regions of the world the date fruit seed generally consists of cellulose lignin hemicelluloses and lignin cellulose where chief functional groups are cellulose and hemicellulose which comprise oxygen carbonyl ether and hydroxyl the date stone derivative adsorbent has been employed for exclusion of different organic and inorganic pollutants like uranium vi 17 methylene blue 18 chromium cr vi 19 levofloxacin 20 from aqueous solution however fewer studies have been reported on the adsorption of organic pollutants using date stone biochar as sorbent thus date stone derived activated biochar can be a novel substitute as adsorbent for ibuprofen remotion from aqueous bodies the current research explores the sorption competence of date stone derived activated biochar towards ibp exclusion from contaminated water batch investigations with inconstant experimental parameters like ph sorbent dosage agitation speed initial ibp concentration contact time and temperature were executed to examine the efficacy of bi directional form of date stone derived biochar for uptake of ibp in order to justify the better sorption performance of dspb and dscc a non linear isotherm and kinetics model approach was included which can be an imperative inclusion in the ibp remotion study the thermodynamic study explores the process of energy requirement the reusability performance of dspb and dscc was examined in the regeneration study cost assessment of the sorbents was presented for the prospects of dspb and dscc on a larger scale of ibp removal study 2 materials and methods 2 1 assortment and preparation of date seed biochar date stone seeds were acquired from the local market without any cost initially it was washed properly by deionized water afterward it was kept in sunlight for 2 to 3 days followed by drying in a hot air oven at temperature 60 c overnight to remove all the moisture later moisture free seeds were crushed and made ready for carbonization in further operation date seeds were placed in a cylindrical shaped muffle furnace for carbonization at temperature 700 c for 1 h afterward biochar was taken out from the furnace and cooled at room temperature then it was ground with pestle and mortar and sieved to a size 150 Î¼m and finally produced biochar was kept in an airtight container for further activation process 2 1 1 production of steam activated or physically activated date seed biochar carbonized biochar was activated in a cylindrical muffle furnace with superheated steam at a pressure of 1 5 kg cm2 and at a temperature 800 c for 1 h with a flow rate of 1 1 5 kg h finally date seeds physically activated biochar dspb was cooled and placed in a desiccator 2 1 2 preparation of chemically activated date seed biochar carbonized biochar was chemically impregnated with ortho phosphoric acid at a 3 2 wt ratio for overnight at 30 c in a magnetic stirrer after chemical treatment of date seed biochar with h3po4 deionized water was used for washing the treated biochar until it reached ph 7 and then it was dried in a hot air oven at a temperature of 60 65 c for overnight finally moisture free chemically activated date seed biochar dscc was stored 2 2 solution preparation 100 mg l of stock solution was prepared by adding 100 mg of ibuprofen sigma aldrich st louis mo in 90 of deionized water and 10 of methanol chromasolv for hplc 99 9 sigma aldrich in standard volumetric flask methanol was added to dissolve ibuprofen in solution as it was less soluble in water several working solutions of different concentrations were prepared by successive dilution from the prepared solution 2 3 determination of point of zero charge the point of zero charge of dspb and dscc was determined by 0 01 m nacl solutions with different ph values ranging from 2 to 10 both sorbents of 0 2 g were added separately in 20 ml solution and the mixtures were stirring for 48 h solution ph was maintained using 0 1 n naoh and 0 1 n hcl solutions the zero point charge was found by plotting initial solution ph and supernatant ph 2 4 adsorption investigations adsorption experiments of ibp by steam activated dspb and chemically activated dscc date seed biochar were performed in batch mode with several parametric conditions of ph 1 7 sorbent dose 333 10000 mg l agitation speed 100 200 rpm initial ibp concentrations 5 50 mg l temperature 15 c 40 c interaction time 1 24 h to explore the optimal condition for adsorption study the individual experiments were executed with different ibp concentration and collected samples were analyzed through uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan to measure the ibp concentration at 220 nm the ibp uptake of sorbents can be measured by qe mg g calculated from eq 1 as follows 1 q e c i c e v m where ci signifies ibp concentrations before adsorption ce indicates equilibrium ibp concentrations after sorption in mg l v represents solution volume in l m designates the adsorbent mass in g the general equation for ibp exclusion percentage is given in eq 2 2 re m o v a l c i c f c i 100 cf is ibp concentration after sorption in mg l 2 5 isotherm models sorption isotherms such as langmuir isotherm 21 freundlich isotherm 22 has been used in the present study langmuir isotherm substantiates the overall performance of the isotherm system and the sorption uptake capability of sorbent materials freundlich isotherm model is applied at low to intermediate concentration range of adsorbate molecules and is essentially associated with heterogeneous surface of sorbents however several isotherm models were reported in various adsorption studies by the researchers the toth isotherm 23 is an analytical alteration of the langmuir equation which is applied for reducing error between predicted and experimental value 24 this model is of utmost significance for its use in modeling of numerous multilayer and heterogeneous sorption methods 25 s b k model is another type of model used in the adsorption process evaluation of experimental and modeled sorption uptakes for silica gel as an adsorbent by the s b k model was reported by oh and saha 2013 2 2 6 a non linear methods determination of kinetic and isotherm model parameters of non linear study coefficient of determination r2 and chi squared Ï2 values are significant to inspect the better fitting of experimental data towards model validation chi squared Ï2 and co efficient of determination r2 values are calculated using eq 3 and eq 4 correspondingly as follows 3 Ï 2 q e e x p q e c a l 2 q e c a l 4 r 2 1 q e e x p q e c a l 2 q e e x p q e m e a n 2 where the amount of ibp uptake at equilibrium can be signified by qe exp mg g and qe cal mg g implies the quantity of ibp uptake both qe exp mg g and qe cal mg g can be determined using solver add in in microsoft excel chi squared Ï2 adjacent to zero signifies that experimental data and theoretical data attained from the model are supposed to similar therefore chi squared assessment is indispensable to ratify the finest fitted model for sorption investigation 26 2 7 desorption and reusability study physically activated date seed biochar dspb and chemically activated date seed biochar dscc both of 1000 mg l was equilibrated for 18 h with 20 mg l ibp solution in a shaker incubator at a constant agitation speed of 150 rpm ph 2 and temperature 20 c ibp desorption study was performed using methanol as a desorbing agent both spent sorbents were washed with 0 6 n methanol solution and the filtrate was analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometry to measure the ibp concentration after desorption in the filtrate the recyclability of the dspb and dscc was determined through the recurrence of the sorption regeneration procedure and it was repeated with regenerated sorbents in each recycle 3 results and discussions 3 1 adsorbents characterization 3 1 1 morphological study textural properties surface area and pore volume of the sorbents were explored through bet brunauer emmet teller surface area analyzer gemini vii india to examined pore volume and surface area of adsorbents the surface area of dspb and dscc was 513 m2 g and 342 m2 g correspondingly and the total pore volume of dspb and dscc were 0 205 cm3 g and 0 132 cm3 g respectively morphological analysis of dspb than dscc presented better surface area and microporous nature of sorbents may be due to the development of pores on sorbent exteriors scanning electron microscopic analysis sem jeol jsm 6510 japan was performed to inspect the surface morphology of dspb and dscc before and after sorption sem pictures as portrayed in fig 1 a d shows the textural transformation between dspb and dscc unequal and various pores were witnessed for dspb in fig 1a and in fig 1b it can be seen that pores were clogged as the existence of a greyish layer was observed and that may be due to ibp sorption onto the surface of dspb several irregular pores and extended surfaces were observed in fig 1c d blocking of pores and greyish layers were evinced for ibp devotion detected in fig 1d this study favors steam activation presenting more pores onto dspb surface that resulted in better ibp attachment on the surface of dscc the interface between the ibp ions and adsorbents may responsible for ibp sorption on the surface of the sorbents 27 surface charge phpzc of dspb and dscc was determined to investigate the preliminary consequence of solution ph onto sorbents phpzc for dspb and dscc was found to be 5 8 and 5 1 respectively 3 1 2 ft ir analysis of adsorbents the existence of the functional groups on the dspb and dscc can be inspected through ft ir techniques perkin elmer c109292 india accountable functional groups existence for sorption of ibp by dspb and dscc was explored through the ft ir study ft ir study in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 was executed to examine the surface chemistry of dspb and dscc as showed in fig 3a aromatic c h bend at 805 cm 1 ether c o bend at 1257 cm 1 amide co stretch at 1650 cm 1 and alcohol oh stretch at 3407 cm 1 were observed before sorption for dspb and after ibp adhesion of the bands were fairly shifted to 812 cm 1 aromatic group c h bend 1216 cm 1 ether c o bend 1643 cm 1 amide co stretch and 3402 cm 1 alcohol oh stretch remained the same group after sorption however the inclusion of carboxylic co bend at 1747 cm 1 was noticed in dspb after ibp adhesion may due to the presence of the carboxylic group in ibuprofen confirmed ibp sorption in dspb now for dscc existence of various functional groups like aromatic c h bend at 805 cm 1 ether c o at 1203 cm 1 amide co stretch at 1637 cm 1 and alcohol oh stretch at 3456 cm 1 were observed as depicted in fig 3b peaks were lifted to ether c o bend at 1205 cm 1 amide co stretch at 1642 cm 1 and alcohol oh bend at 3407 cm 1 in dscc after sorption of ibp again the addition of the carboxylic co bond at 1718 cm 1 was observed in dscc after ibp adhesion confirmed the attachment of ibuprofen moieties into dscc it can be seen in fig 3 aromatic bend amide bend and alcohol stretch were the accountable group for adhesion of ibp onto dspb and dscc 3 1 3 edx study of dspb and dscc elemental composition analysis of raw and spent dspb and dscc respectively was listed in table 1 and observed in fig 2 elemental analysis of both the sorbents revealed the presence of a considerable amount of carbon c and oxygen o in dspb and dscc the increase of carbon percentage after ibp sorption was noticed in table 1 confirmed the attachment of ibp in dspb and dscc as carbon c and oxygen o are the main constituent of ibuprofen c13h18o2 hence alterations of weight percentage of carbon and oxygen after sorption inferred ibp adhesion onto sorbents 14 3 2 various parametric effects 3 2 1 effect of ph the solution ph shows a decisive role in ibp adsorption onto dspb and dscc solution ph was considered whereas sorbent dose 3330 mg l initial ibuprofen concentration 20 mg l agitation speed 150 rpm temperature 20 c and interaction time 18 h remained constant the maximum ibp removal was 70 18 for dscc and 71 90 for dspb at ph 3 has been witnessed in fig 4 a favorable ibp exclusion was observed in an acidic state and an increase in ph sorption was reduced which may be due to the influence of pka value of ibp and point of zero charge ph pzc maximum elimination has been achieved at ph 3 as the ibp pka value was 4 91 as a protonated form of ibp was dominant in the solution a steady concordance between the protonated form of ibp and sorbent surfaces was observed the stable interface among non ionized ibp moieties and positively charged sorbent surface might have occurred when ibp pka value was more than ph of the solution it may be owing to the fact of an increase of positive charge on the sorbent surface once solution ph was less than the point of zero charge of the sorbent ph pzc the point of zero charges ph pzc of dspb and dscc was 6 1 and 6 4 correspondingly therefore ibp sorption rate was reduced due to electrostatic repulsion between less positively charged sorbent surfaces and anionic ibp as it became more anionic with an increase in ph 28 29 comparable drift was stated in our earlier exertion 27 3 2 2 impact of sorbent dose the consequence of sorbent dosage on ibp adsorption is imperative towards the ibp removal study by dspb and dscc sorption of ibp using various doses 333 10000 mg l at constant speed 150 rpm ph 3 temperature 20 c and time 18 h has been examined maximum exclusion of 79 81 and 76 87 at dose 6660 mg l were observed for dspb and dscc respectively as noticed in fig 4b removal of ibp was increased with dose since most of the unoccupied active site accessible initially and fast diffusion of ibp to unrestricted active site of the sorbents exterior ensued for both the sorbent though marginally drop of adsorption was observed with further increase of adsorbent dose owing to mass accretion on an active site of adsorbents at higher dose produced a decrease of active surface area for sorption 30 31 3 2 2 1 sorption mechanism of ibp on to dspb and dscc the sorption mechanism of ibp onto dspb and dscc can be categorized through the following influential factor i ibp sorption was involved in hydrogen bond exchanges between the carboxyl groups of ibuprofen and responsible functional group present in dspb and dscc which may confirm in ftir study ii functional groups like carboxylic co stretch ether c o bend alcohol oh stretch were responsible for ibp attachment for both the adsorbents dspb and dscc can be inveterate in ftir this might be accredited to the fact of ion interaction between the existing group in sorbents and ibp moieties which consist of the carboxylic group cooh resulted shifting of the peak in fig 3 after ibp adhesion onto dspb and dscc iii maximum adsorption of ibp was perceived in acidic medium for both the sorbent since at ph more than the pka value of the ibp its carboxylate anions r coo progressively existing however as ph increases ph is greater than pzc the adsorbents develop negative charged producing increased electrostatic repulsion of carboxylate anions of ibp and dspb and dscc resulted in reducing in sorption the intraparticle diffusion mechanism in the solid liquid phase was also decisive for the sorption mechanism 32 3 2 3 impact of initial ibp concentration and agitation speed initial ibp concentration shows a significant role in the adsorption study the effect of initial concentration on ibp sorption by dspb and dscc was presented in fig 4c ibp removal percentage increases with a rise in concentration up to 30 mg l for dspb and 1 25 mg l for dscc then removal of ibp was decreased for both the adsorbents maximum ibp remotion of dspb and dscc was obtained 92 35 at 30 mg l and 85 73 at 25 mg l respectively though due to the availability of free sorbents active sites initially fast diffusion of ibp molecules occurred onto dspb and dscc caused better sorption further rise in ibp concentration caused a slower sorption rate of ibp this may be accredited to the fact that the increase in initial ibp concentration available active sites of the adsorbents were enervated by ibp moieties which produced insufficient sorbents surface for sorption similar implications were noticed in reported studies 33 34 agitation speed is one of the active constraints in batch study ibp sorption was increased with a rise in agitation speed up to 160 rpm for both dspb and dscc then the rate of sorption was decreased as noticed in fig 4d whereas sorbent dose ph initial ibp concentration temperature and interaction time were kept constant this may be because the rate of sorption was increased as enhancement of the turbulence which develops boundary layer diffusion between sorbent inner surface and ibp molecules ibp may unable to interrelate with active sites of dspb and dscc when active sites were fenced by the upper adsorbents layer resulted in slow adsorption 34 therefore initially the ibp remotion rate was more with an increase in agitation speed comparable type of results was noticed in reported studies tables 2 and 3 3 2 3 1 isotherm models the current study explored the non linear and linear isotherm models for ibp sorption by dspb and dscc fig 5 implies the linearized plot of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models and the calculated parameters are given in table 4 the linear plot of langmuir isotherm for dscc and dspb showed a high r2 value of 0 990 and 0 973 correspondingly it has been found in fig 5a from the linearized plot that langmuir constant kl and maximum ibp uptake qm were attained 0 237 l mg and 10 51 mg g respectively for dspb and qm and kl of 13 87 mg g and 0 115 l mg respectively were obtained for dscc monolayer sorption recommended in langmuir isotherm linearized plot for both the sorbents freundlich isotherm linear plot for ibp removal by dspb and dscc was exhibited in fig 5b as r2 values of dscc and dspb were 0 994 and 0 923 respectively found in the freundlich isotherm plot which showed the goodness of fit to the model the kf value was found to be 0 132 for dspb and 0 477 for dscc whereas 1 n was 3 75 and 1 77 for dspb and dscc respectively from freundlich isotherm linear plot in the non linear model chi squared Ï2 and correlation coefficient r2 is indispensable for model fitting in a given sorption process 39 correlation coefficient r2 and chi squared Ï2 values for langmuir and freundlich non linear parameters were listed in table 4 it can be witnessed that in the case of non linear langmuir isotherm the co efficient of determination r2 for dspb was 0 959 and for dscc was 0 948 which exhibited non linear models as well fit in comparison to the linear model the value of chi squared Ï2 value for dspb and dscc was found 0 003 and 0 002 respectively seems to be very low which corroborates the implication of the non linear model in the case of dspb qm was found to be 13 17 mg g and kl was obtained 0 018 l mg again for dscc qm and kl were 11 23 mg g and 0 013 l mg respectively found from langmuir s isotherm non linear plot which was quite nearly as obtained in the linear model again the value of co efficient of determination r2 for the non linear form of freundlich isotherm for dspb and dscc was obtained 0 887 and 0 929 respectively chi squared Ï2 value of 0 233 for dspb and 0 002 for dscc as listed in table 4 recommended more precision than linear plot in fitting experimental data though langmuir isotherm was endorsed as a better fitted model for both dspb and dscc proposed monolayer sorption 3 2 4 influence of contact time ibp sorption effect on interaction time has been presented in fig 4e where ph sorbent dose initial ibp concentration agitation speed and temperature of 2 3330 mg l 20 mg l 150 rpm and 20 c respectively were constant fig 4e signifies that ibp removal percentage increases with a rise in time then it is saturated this may due to the initial presence of adequately free active sites on the adsorbent exteriors then it is slowly decreased with an increase of ibp attachment onto sorbent surfaces a maximum ibp removal percentage of 96 24 for dspb at 18 h and 87 01 for dscc at 21 h was obtained similarly chakraborty et al 2018 and 40 reported comparable drift for adsorption study 3 2 4 1 kinetic studies pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetic models were examined both non linear and linear schemes for better accuracy of fitting experimental results towards the ibp sorption process fig 6 and table 5 presented the linearized plot of pfo and pso models and kinetic parameter data respectively the correlation co efficient r2 values were 0 943 for dspb and 0 960 for dscc in the case of linearized forms of pfo kinetic model and r2 values of 0 995 and 0 997 for dspb and dscc respectively were determined in pso kinetic model pso kinetic model in linear form was the more amicable model of fitting experimental data than pfo kinetic model kinetic study endorses pso kinetic model which may be the rate limiting step of the ibp adsorption process whereas the intra particle diffusion model confirmed the impact of resistance of mass transfer on ibp sorption by dspb and dscc the diffusion constant kd was obtained 0 186 and 0 279 for dscc and dspb respectively from the qt vs t0 5 plot slop as designates in fig 6c the qt vs t0 5 plot exhibited ibp sorption using dspb and dscc complied multi linearity of data obtained from the kinetic study non linear regression was proposed to evade different constraints of the linear kinetic model towards justification of model relevancy to the sorption technique 41 kinetic parameters in the non linear form of pfo and pso models were listed in table 5 chi squared Ï2 values of 0 054 and 0 251 for dspb and dscc respectively were obtained in pfo and Ï2 values of 0 0085 for dspb and 0 0086 for dscc were found in pso the kinetic parameters data presented in table 5 favored to pso kinetic model therefore a non linear form of kinetic models was offered greater precision of fitting investigational data for both dspb and dscc 3 2 5 consequence of temperature on ibp adsorption the impact of temperature on ibp sorption by dspb and dscc has been explored at the temperature range 15 40 c ibp sorption decreased with a rise in temperature and at 20 c maximum ibp removal was achieved as shown in fig 4f ibp removal of 95 16 and 86 10 for dspb and dscc respectively were found ibp sorption rate was reduced at high temperature because of weak van der wall forces between ibp and sorbents which resulted in disruption of adsorptive forces with a rise in temperature primarily rise in the diffusion rate of ibp onto sorbents displayed better sorption and diffusion rate was decreased with further escalation in temperature this outcome can be vindicated by further associated studies 14 table 6 3 2 5 1 thermodynamic model calculated values of thermodynamic model parameters of dspb and dscc were tabulated in table 7 Î´s and Î´h values were determined from the slope and intercept respectively of Î´g versus t plot as portrays in fig 7 negative values of Î´h for dspb and dscc as tabulated in table 7 substantiated that the sorption process was exothermic and negative values of Î´s recommended ineffectiveness to ibp sorption with increasing temperature rise of Î´ g 0 values with the rise in temperature considered satisfactory sorption at low temperatures parametric values of thermodynamic study exposed sorption processes were feasible and spontaneous 3 3 desorption study efficacy of the sorbent can be justified by its recycle capability towards use on a larger scale in the current study methanol has been used for the desorption of ibp it can be witnessed in fig 8 dspb and dscc have been employed for the uptake of ibp up to 4 5 cycles which presented a substantial result for investigation of the reusability potential of both the adsorbents ibp remotion percentage was reduced from 92 43 to 69 54 for dspb and 85 26 to 61 89 for dscc fig 8 after 5 series of adsorption desorption the selection of methanol for desorption of ibp exhibited favorable outcomes as methanol also used for reusability study in our previous investigations for ibp sorption by coconut shell 43 and sugarcane bagasse 27 the reusability exploitation of dspb and dscc offered fruitful consequences that appear to be both the sorbents as competent for ibp sorption however sorbent properties generally changed after ibp sorption due to chemical interactions between sorbent and ibp molecules the surface area of dspb and dscc might be decreased by the blockage of micro pores of the surface of the adsorbent by contaminants aging could be considered as loading of ibp molecules onto the sorbent the sorption capacity of the adsorbent may be reduced by the aging effect it can be seen in fig 8 that after each cycle ibp sorption capability was decreased might be attributed to the fact of aging effect of sorbent zhang et al 44 offered that the surface area of biochar decreases as aging disturbs the potential sorption capacity of biochar undesirably 3 4 cost analysis of precursor production the cost valuation of dspb and dscc production was calculated in indian rupee inr sorbents cost analysis has been presented in table 8 a detailed study of the production cost of dspb and dscc clearly shows that production costs can be curbed by indigenous preparation the production cost of dscc was slightly higher than dspb as the chemical used in the activation process of dscc the overall price for the manufacture of dspb and dscc was 137 36 inr kg and 154 61 inr kg with a difference of approximately 17 inr the production price of various sorbents from different precursors such as aegle marmelos 14 colocasia esculenta 30 31 and parthenium hysterophorus 33 were 245 3 inr kg 100 573 inr kg and 188 903 inr kg respectively that has been reported in the previous works therefore the cost of dspb and dscc was considerable as compared to prices of other sorbents and can be used as effective adsorbent for ibp exclusion from the aqueous body 4 safe disposal study safe discarding of ibp laden sorbents is exceedingly recommended since disposing of ibp ions into soil resulted in secondary pollutants which leading to environmental pollution several procedures like incineration at medium temperature chemical decomposition waste immobilization by encapsulation burning in open containers etc can be adopted for secure disposal of ibp loaded dspb and dscc 5 conclusion the present investigation inspected the enactment of date stone derived activated biochar dspb and dscc by varying ph sorbent dose agitation speed initial ibp concentration interaction time and temperature ibp removal from aqueous solution was achieved 87 01 for dscc at 21 h and 96 24 at 18 h for dspb maximum uptake capacity qm of dspb and dscc was found 10 51 mg g and 13 87 mg g respectively langmuir isotherms of both linear and non linear model were recommended monolayer sorption as well fitted to experimental data of the sorption process by dspb and dscc the results from kinetic studies executed pseudo second order kinetic model as the best fitted model for both the sorbents it can be determined that non linear models were produced moderate elucidation of data correctness for ibp sorption than linear models from isotherm and kinetic studies thermodynamic studies of the sorption process exposed exothermic feasibility and favorable sorption occurred at lower temperatures regeneration capability of both the sorbents up to 5 cycles showed the potential ability of both the adsorbents the preparation cost of dspb and dscc has also favored the process to become cost efficient as compared to other sorbents reported so far therefore the ability of activated forms of date stone biochar can be employed as a prospective sorbent for ibp adsorption from

mainly associated with the discharge of effluents from large scale industries like petrochemicals and refineries to the rivers seas marines and underground water resources 1 many attempts have been made to minimize the environmental effects associated with the industrial effluents upgrading separation processes according to environmental friendly green technologies wastewater treatment using advanced separation techniques recycle of spent process water and removal of heavy metal ions and other charged species from water using capacitive deionization cdi technology are obvious examples of such attempts 2 3 water recycling is one of the most important concerns of the petrochemical and refinery plants beside minimization of the volume of wastewater discharge to the environment regeneration and reuse of low contaminated spent process water is of great importance from economical point of view 4 petrochemical wastewater is a general term for describing wastewaters associated with oil related industries the sources of the petrochemical wastewaters are diverse and can be originated from different processes such as oilfield production crude oil refinery olefin process refrigeration energy unities lubrication and chemical cleaning operations fig 1 illustrates a typical scheme of water balance in a refinery or petrochemical plant petrochemical wastewaters commonly contain various organic and inorganic components that need to be well treated before discharge 5 6 aldehyde is one of the most important pollutants that can be found in a lot of petrochemical units such as vinyl acetate 7 acetaldehyde 8 acetic acid 9 ethylene oxide 10 and ethylene glycol 11 these petrochemical units produce effluents and side water streams contaminated with aldehydes aldehydes are a group of the most dangerous water pollutants and their treatment is rather difficult 12 aldehyde is an organic compound containing a cho functional group consisting of a carbonyl center a carbon double bonded to oxygen with the carbon atom also bonded to hydrogen and to a hydrocarbon chain 13 exposure to aldehydes can cause severe damage to the mouth throat and stomach accumulation of fluid in the lungs chronic respiratory disease kidney and liver throat irritation dizziness reddening swelling of the skin dna and abnormal muscle development 14 15 the most significant step in the prevention of aldehyde pollution is the treatment of wastewater before discharge into the environment 16 there are many technologies applied for the removal of aldehyde from effluents such as reverse osmosis 17 membrane distillation 18 vacuum distillation 19 pervaporation 20 activated carbon adsorption 21 and ion exchange 22 most of the applied methods involve high energy consumption and hardly affordable investment especially working costs which can limit their application in practice besides that some of the aforementioned methods can result in the secondary contamination of the water resource 23 among all the methods applied for aldehyde separation fixed bed column adsorption and ion exchange resins emerge as potential solutions for the problem of aldehyde contamination 24 fixed bed column studies reveal important information for the scale up of the dynamic adsorption process such as the breaking time bed saturation point and also the effects of feed flowrate initial

fig 4 shows the sem images of the as received resin at different magnifications in the next stage of the resin preparation resin particles react with caustic soda solution to be provided with o h ions sem photographs of the sodium hydroxide modified resin at different magnifications are presented in fig 5 a c by comparing the figs 4 and 5 some changes are obvious cristal like fibers can be observed on the surface of the resin after modification with n a o h which may be related to the hydroxylation reaction products 38 at the next step of preparation re sin o h reacts with a 5 w w aqueous solution of sodium bisulfite to ensure bisulfite ion replacement figs 6 a c shows the sem images of the resin after bisulfite modification bisulfite precipitate covers the resin surface as a thin shell fig 6b spongy like morphology of r h s o 3 precipitate is also obvious in fig 6c this morphology provides a large surface area favorable for the adsorption of ac finally in ac removal process r

ac is adsorbed by the bisulfite treated resin according eq 2 by comparing figs 6 and 7 accumulation of some particulates on the surface of the resin is obvious after adsorption these brilliant particles may be r hoch2so3 precipitates adsorbed on the surface of the resin in the regeneration process the resin bed saturated with ac is regenerated by washing with sodium bisulfite solution fig 8 shows the sem images of the resin after bisulfite treatment particulates attached to the surface of the resin are noticeably reduced after regeneration as it is obvious in fig 8 compare to fig 7 3 2 ftir analysis results in ftir spectra changes in the characteristic patterns of the absorption bands clearly indicate changes in the chemical composition of the material or the presence of contamination the main functional groups of the resin that may change during the ac adsorption process are aldehyde related functional groups ch co alcohols oh and sulfite so table 2 shows the wavenumbers of the functional groups in the ir spectral results 39 the ftir spectrum of the resin before ac adsorption is shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the ftir spectrum of the resin after ac adsorption fig 11 a shows the ftir spectrum of the bisulfite treated resin before adsorption and fig 11b showes the spectrum of the resin after adsorption of ac to compare the changes in the functional groups of the resin before and after adsorption both of the ir spectrums are shown in a single plot fig 11 as obvious from fig 11 the transmittance intensity of the aldehyde related peaks at the wavenumber ranges of 2600 to 2800 cm 1 and 1500 1700 cm 1 decreased after adsorption this shows that the amount of ac increases in the resin after adsorption in addition the transmittance intensity of the sulfite peaks at the wavenumber range of 1100 to 1200 cm 1 increased after adsorption that is due to the replacement of sulfite with ac during the adsorption according to the reaction mechanism presented by eq 2 fig 12 a shows the ftir spectrum of the resin after adsorption of ac and fig 12b shows the ftir spectrum of the resin after regeneration process to compare the changes in the functional groups of the resin before and after regeneration both of the spectrums are shown in a single plot fig 12 the transmittance intensity of the sulfite functional groups at the wavenumber range of 1100 to 1200 cm 1 decreased after the regeneration process in contrast the transmittance intensity of the aldehyde related functionalities ch co at the wavenumber ranges of 2600 to 2800 cm 1 and 1500 1700 cm 1 increased this result shows that the amount of ac decreases in the resin after regeneration that is due to the replacement of ac with sulfite groups during the regeneration treatment according to the reaction mechanism expressed by eq 3 3 3 breakthrough curve analysis results of the experimental breakthrough curve analysis together with the tomas model fitting parameters are presented in table 3 acceptable values of the regression coefficients r 2 as well as appropriate agreement of the experimental bed adsorption capacity values q e with the model predicted ones q t indicates that the thomas model could well describe the breakthrough data bed adsorption capacity thomas model parameters and removal percentages are significant parameters in dynamic adsorption study analysis of these parameters that were presented in table 3 may lead to better understanding about the behavior of the dynamic adsorption system it can be inferred from the results that the average values of the bed adsorption capacity at break point q b at exhaustion point q e and calculated from the tomas model q t was obtained as 3 31 mg g 10 59 mg g and 9 42 mg g respectively fig 13 shows the amounts of the ac removal percentage at different operating conditions it can be concluded from the results that the average ac removal percentage x is 65 62 this shows amberlite ira 402 oh resin has a good potential for ac adsorption the maximum ac removal percentage 85 44 was obtained for the test no 6 at q 1 5 l min l 30 cm and c 0 50 mg l where the q and l are at their medium levels and c 0 has the lowest value this is the optimal condition for the feed intake to the adsorption bed effects of operating parameters on the breakthrough curve results will be thoroughly investigated in the next sections 3 3 1 effect of flowrate fig 14 shows the breakthrough curves at different flowrates 1 to 3 l min constant bed length of 30 cm and constant ac initial concentration of 100 mg l obtained by plotting the c c 0 values against time increase of the feed flowrate results in more turbulence in the flow crossing through the bed turbulence flow facilitates the mass transfer toward the surface and inside the pores of the resin particles therefore the operation time decreases by increasing the feed flowrate on the other hand the mass transfer zone mtz decreases by increasing the feed flowrate as it is obvious from fig 14 this confirms that mass transfer resistances decrease as flowrate increases 40 it is worth mentioning that higher practical capacity of the bed may be used in the case of the reduced mtz 41 the values of removal percentage x at q 3 l min q 1 5 l min and q 1 l min are 54 63 60 72 and 66 61 respectively it is concluded that the removal percentage decreases by increasing the feed flowrate this may be due to the decreased residence time of the adsorbate inside the column at higher flowrates 3 3 2 effect of bed length fig 15 illustrates the effect of the bed length on breakthrough behavior adsorption column experiments were conducted by variation of the active bed length in the range of 15 45 cm while the feed flowrate and ac initial concentration remained constant at 1 5 l min and 100 mg l respectively the breakthrough curves become wider at increased bed lengths in other word the mtz in the breakthrough curves increases with increasing the bed length this is due to the fact that more surface area and active sites are provided for adsorption of ac molecules by increasing the bed length moreover the contact time between ac molecules and adsorbent surface increases so the bed adsorption capacity increases in addition the exhaustion time is closer to the break time in the beds with longer active length this means that larger portion of the adsorption capacity is practically accessible in the beds with shorter length similar results have been obtained by other researchers 42 the values of removal percentage x at l 15 cm l 30 cm and l 45 cm are 57 35 60 72 and 78 93 respectively it is inferred from the results that the removal percentage increases by increasing the bed active length this may be related to the increased contact time between the ac molecules and the resin surface in addition bed with longer active length provides larger surface area for adsorption of ac 3 3 3 effect of initial concentration fig 16 shows the breakthrough curves obtained at different initial concentrations 50 150 mg l constant flowrate of 1 5 l min and constant adsorption bed length of 30 cm the mtz becomes narrower with increasing the ac initial concentration this may be attributed to the enhanced mass transfer and increased driving forces due to the enhanced concentration gradient developed between the bulk solution and the adsorbent surface 43 similar trends have been observed by other researchers 44 the exhaustion time becomes closer to the break time at higher feed concentrations this means better utilization of the bed adsorption capacity until the breaking time the values of removal percentage x at c0 150 mg l c0 100 mg l and c0 50 mg l are 55 67 60 72 and 85 44 respectively as it is obvious the removal percentage decreases by increasing the ac initial concentration this may be due to the entrance of higher amount of ac into the bed when influents with higher concentrations are fed although mass transfer is improved at higher ac uptakes removal percentage of the process decreases due to the limited number of the active sites in the bed 3 4 regeneration one of the most important characteristics of an adsorption process is the capacity for regeneration and reuse in this study the resin bed was saturated with ac at operating conditions of q 1 5 l min l 30 cm and c0 100 mg l and then regenerated by sodium bisulfite solution according to eq 3 adsorption regeneration experiment was performed for six consequences to measure the bed capability for reuse fig 17 shows the breakthrough curves for the successive adsorption regeneration cycles the bed adsorption capacity values indicate a negligible deviation from each other this means appropriate reusability and durability of the resin for the adsorption process little capacity loss observed in fig 17 may be due to the irreversible adsorption of ac on some active sites and or deterioration of some active sites along with the adsorption regeneration treatments in other word a few number of the active sites bonded with the adsorbate molecules cannot return to their original state after regeneration this is the so called hysteresis effect commonly observed in adsorption systems 45 table 4 shows the removal percentage alteration of the resin bed after each regeneration step negligible removal capacity loss less than 4 was observed after six consecutive adsorption regeneration series this indicates appropriate and sustainable performance of the resin in adsorption of acetaldehyde from water 4 conclusions in this work strong anionic resin of amberlite ira402 oh pretreated with sodium bisulfite solution has been used to adsorb acetaldehyde from water using a fixed bed column after saturation of the resin with ac the resin was regenerated using sodium bisulfite solution as an inexpensive chemical reagent the effects of three operating parameters including bed active length initial ac concentration and feed flowrate were investigated on the column performance by analyzing the breakthrough curves bed adsorption capacity ac removal percentage and thomas model parameters were calculated and compared at different operating conditions sem and ftir analyses results confirmed that the adsorption of ac on the resin surface was based on the ion exchange complexation reaction negligible bed capacity loss for ac adsorption was observed after six consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles based on the objective achieved in the current study it can be concluded that the modified resin can be economic and highly efficient for ac removal from petrochemical spent process water declaration of competing interest all the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding this submission 
14151,dynamic adsorption of acetaldehyde from water on strong anionic resin of amberlite ira 402 oh modified with bisulfite treatment was investigated effects of three fundamental parameters including

resin surface as a result of the aldehyde adsorption some differences in the characteristic patterns of ch bonds as a result of aldehyde adsorption were also approved by the ftir analysis aldehyde removal and bed adsorption capacity were calculated at different operating conditions the experimental breakthrough data was satisfactorily correlated with the thomas model the maximum bed adsorption capacity was obtained as 11 14 mg g in good agreement with the experimentally measured bed capacity 12 61 mg g regeneration experiments demonstrated negligible capacity loss less than 4 of the resin bed after six successive adsorption regeneration cycles results indicated that amberlite ira 402 oh with the maximum acetaldehyde removal of 86 is a potential adsorbent for the recovery of low

mainly associated with the discharge of effluents from large scale industries like petrochemicals and refineries to the rivers seas marines and underground water resources 1 many attempts have been made to minimize the environmental effects associated with the industrial effluents upgrading separation processes according to environmental friendly green technologies wastewater treatment using advanced separation techniques recycle of spent process water and removal of heavy metal ions and other charged species from water using capacitive deionization cdi technology are obvious examples of such attempts 2 3 water recycling is one of the most important concerns of the petrochemical and refinery plants beside minimization of the volume of wastewater discharge to the environment regeneration and reuse of low contaminated spent process water is of great importance from economical point of view 4 petrochemical wastewater is a general term for describing wastewaters associated with oil related industries the sources of the petrochemical wastewaters are diverse and can be originated from different processes such as oilfield production crude oil refinery olefin process refrigeration energy unities lubrication and chemical cleaning operations fig 1 illustrates a typical scheme of water balance in a refinery or petrochemical plant petrochemical wastewaters commonly contain various organic and inorganic components that need to be well treated before discharge 5 6 aldehyde is one of the most important pollutants that can be found in a lot of petrochemical units such as vinyl acetate 7 acetaldehyde 8 acetic acid 9 ethylene oxide 10 and ethylene glycol 11 these petrochemical units produce effluents and side water streams contaminated with aldehydes aldehydes are a group of the most dangerous water pollutants and their treatment is rather difficult 12 aldehyde is an organic compound containing a cho functional group consisting of a carbonyl center a carbon double bonded to oxygen with the carbon atom also bonded to hydrogen and to a hydrocarbon chain 13 exposure to aldehydes can cause severe damage to the mouth throat and stomach accumulation of fluid in the lungs chronic respiratory disease kidney and liver throat irritation dizziness reddening swelling of the skin dna and abnormal muscle development 14 15 the most significant step in the prevention of aldehyde pollution is the treatment of wastewater before discharge into the environment 16 there are many technologies applied for the removal of aldehyde from effluents such as reverse osmosis 17 membrane distillation 18 vacuum distillation 19 pervaporation 20 activated carbon adsorption 21 and ion exchange 22 most of the applied methods involve high energy consumption and hardly affordable investment especially working costs which can limit their application in practice besides that some of the aforementioned methods can result in the secondary contamination of the water resource 23 among all the methods applied for aldehyde separation fixed bed column adsorption and ion exchange resins emerge as potential solutions for the problem of aldehyde contamination 24 fixed bed column studies reveal important information for the scale up of the dynamic adsorption process such as the breaking time bed saturation point and also the effects of feed flowrate initial concentration and bed length on the separation process performance 25 adsorptive removal of aldehyde using fixed bed columns has been addressed in few works 26 29 aldehyde impurities are effectively

ranges of 2600 to 2800 cm 1 and 1500 1700 cm 1 decreased after adsorption this shows that the amount of ac increases in the resin after adsorption in addition the transmittance intensity of the sulfite peaks at the wavenumber range of 1100 to 1200 cm 1 increased after adsorption that is due to the replacement of sulfite with ac during the adsorption according to the reaction mechanism presented by eq 2 fig 12 a shows the ftir spectrum of the resin after adsorption of ac and fig 12b shows the ftir spectrum of the resin after regeneration process to compare the changes in the functional groups of the resin before and after regeneration both of the spectrums are shown in a single plot fig 12 the transmittance intensity of the sulfite functional groups at the wavenumber range of 1100 to 1200 cm 1 decreased after the regeneration process in contrast the transmittance intensity of the aldehyde related functionalities ch co at the wavenumber ranges of 2600 to 2800 cm 1 and 1500 1700 cm 1 increased this result shows that the amount of ac decreases in the resin after regeneration that is due to the replacement of ac with sulfite groups during the regeneration treatment according to the reaction mechanism expressed by eq 3 3 3 breakthrough curve analysis results of the experimental breakthrough curve analysis together with the tomas model fitting parameters are presented in table 3 acceptable values of the regression coefficients r 2 as well as appropriate agreement of the experimental bed adsorption capacity values q e with the model predicted ones q t indicates that the thomas model could well describe the breakthrough data bed adsorption capacity thomas model parameters and removal percentages are significant parameters in dynamic adsorption study analysis of these parameters that were presented in table 3 may lead to better understanding about the behavior of the dynamic adsorption system it can be inferred from the results that the average values of the bed adsorption capacity at break point q b at exhaustion point q e and calculated from the tomas model q t was obtained as 3 31 mg g 10 59 mg g and 9 42 mg g respectively fig 13 shows the amounts of the ac removal percentage at different operating conditions it can be concluded from the results that the average ac removal percentage x is 65 62 this shows amberlite ira 402 oh resin has a good potential for ac adsorption the maximum ac removal percentage 85 44 was obtained for the test no 6 at q 1 5 l min l 30 cm and c 0 50 mg l where the q and l are at their medium levels and c 0 has the lowest value this is the optimal condition for the feed intake to the adsorption bed effects of operating parameters on the breakthrough curve results will be thoroughly investigated in the next sections 3 3 1 effect of flowrate fig 14 shows the breakthrough curves at different flowrates 1 to 3 l min constant bed length of 30 cm and constant ac initial concentration of 100 mg l obtained by plotting the c c 0 values against time increase of the feed flowrate results in more turbulence in the flow crossing through the bed turbulence flow facilitates the mass transfer toward the surface and inside the pores of the resin particles therefore the operation time decreases by increasing the feed flowrate on the other hand the mass transfer zone mtz decreases by increasing the feed flowrate as it is obvious from fig 14 this confirms that mass transfer resistances decrease as flowrate increases 40 it is worth mentioning that higher practical capacity of the bed may be used in the case of the reduced mtz 41 the values of removal percentage x at q 3 l min q 1 5 l min and q 1 l min are 54 63 60 72 and 66 61 respectively it is concluded that the removal percentage decreases by increasing the feed flowrate this may be due to the decreased residence time of the adsorbate inside the column at higher flowrates 3 3 2 effect of bed length fig 15 illustrates the effect of the bed length on breakthrough behavior adsorption column experiments were conducted by variation of the active bed length in the range of 15 45 cm while the feed flowrate and ac initial concentration remained constant at 1 5 l min and 100 mg l respectively the breakthrough curves become wider at increased bed lengths in other word the mtz in the breakthrough curves increases with increasing the bed length this is due to the fact that more surface area and active sites are provided for adsorption of ac molecules by increasing the bed length moreover the contact time between ac molecules and adsorbent surface increases so the bed adsorption capacity increases in addition the exhaustion time is closer to the break time in the beds with longer active length this means that larger portion of the adsorption capacity is practically accessible in the beds with shorter length similar results have been obtained by other researchers 42 the values of removal percentage x at l 15 cm l 30 cm and l 45 cm are 57 35 60 72 and 78 93 respectively it is inferred from the results that the removal percentage increases by increasing the bed active length this may be related to the increased contact time between the ac molecules and the resin surface in addition bed with longer active length provides larger surface area for adsorption of ac 3 3 3 effect of initial concentration fig 16 shows the breakthrough curves obtained at different initial concentrations 50 150 mg l constant flowrate of 1 5 l min and constant adsorption bed length of 30 cm the mtz becomes narrower with increasing the ac initial concentration this may be attributed to the enhanced mass transfer and increased driving forces due to the enhanced concentration gradient developed between the bulk solution and the adsorbent surface 43 similar trends have been observed by other researchers 44 the exhaustion time becomes closer to the break time at higher feed concentrations this means better utilization of the bed adsorption capacity until the breaking time the values of removal percentage x at c0 150 mg l c0 100 mg l and c0 50 mg l are 55 67 60 72 and 85 44 respectively as it is obvious the removal percentage decreases by increasing the ac initial concentration this may be due to the entrance of higher amount of ac into the bed when influents with higher concentrations are fed although mass transfer is improved at higher ac uptakes removal percentage of the process decreases due to the limited number of the active sites in the bed 3 4 regeneration one of the most important characteristics of an adsorption process is the capacity for regeneration and reuse in this study the resin bed was saturated with ac at operating conditions of q 1 5 l min l 30 cm and c0 100 mg l and then regenerated by sodium bisulfite solution according to eq 3 adsorption regeneration experiment was performed for six consequences to measure the bed capability for reuse fig 17 shows the breakthrough curves for the successive adsorption regeneration cycles the bed adsorption capacity values indicate a negligible deviation from each other this means appropriate reusability and durability of the resin for the adsorption process little capacity loss observed in fig 17 may be due to the irreversible adsorption of ac on some active sites and or deterioration of some active sites along with the adsorption regeneration treatments in other word a few number of the active sites bonded with the adsorbate molecules cannot return to their original state after regeneration this is the so called hysteresis effect commonly observed in adsorption systems 45 table 4 shows the removal percentage alteration of the resin bed after each regeneration step negligible removal capacity loss less than 4 was observed after six consecutive adsorption regeneration series this indicates appropriate and sustainable performance of the resin in adsorption of acetaldehyde from water 4 conclusions in this work strong anionic resin of amberlite ira402 oh pretreated with sodium bisulfite solution has been used to adsorb acetaldehyde from water using a fixed bed column after saturation of the resin with ac the resin was regenerated using sodium bisulfite solution as an inexpensive chemical reagent the effects of three operating parameters including bed active length initial ac concentration and feed flowrate were investigated on the column performance by analyzing the breakthrough curves bed adsorption capacity ac removal percentage and thomas model parameters were calculated and compared at different operating conditions sem and ftir analyses results confirmed that the adsorption of ac on the resin surface was based on the ion exchange complexation reaction negligible bed capacity loss for ac adsorption was observed after six consecutive adsorption regeneration cycles based on the objective achieved in the current study it can be concluded that the modified resin can be economic and highly efficient for ac removal from petrochemical spent process water declaration of competing interest all the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding this submission 
14152,the study aims at evaluating the microbiome within different treatment steps and the efficiency of ultra filtration uf and chlorination processes on bacteria removal for safe water reuse next generation sequencing ngs techniques to characterize bacteria persistence in relation to the treatment facilities were applied results introduced comprehensive taxonomy of bacteria at family class and phylum levels wastewater treatment processes are effective in reducing the bacterial community of family and species the alpha diversity and taxonomical summaries of the samples suggested that the uf is essential in reducing bacteria species diversity however chlorination disinfection the final step of treatment needs further optimization because the uf process before chlorination showed better possible removal of bacterial communities when compared to the quality after chlorination proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidetes persisted through the stages of treatment proteobacteria remained contently present whereas bacteria of the other three phyla showed decrease between 2 fold to 100 fold following either ultrafiltration or chlorination more studies are required to distinguish between viable and non viable microorganisms keywords wastewater treatment molecular biology optimization of treatment processes 1 introduction water security is one of the national grand challenges in qatar 1 treated wastewater is an important component of water resources in the country currently qatar produces more than 800 000 m3 day of highly treated water using advanced treatment technologies these technologies include membrane filtration micro and ultra filtration followed by ultraviolet uv and chlorination disinfection 2 treated water is used in applications such as district cooling irrigation of green areas national parks and a few limited projects of groundwater aquifer recharge assessing the safe reuse of the treated water is very important to minimize the health risks that are associated with pathogens in reclaimed water 3 managing and protecting water sources has long been a major issue in gcc states particulalrly in qatar currently all wastewater treatment plants wwtps in qatar are not limited to tertiary treatment but advanced processes are added such as membrane ultrafiltration uf systems uv chlorination disinfection to allow 100 of treated wastewater to be recycled microbiological investigations of wastewater among different treatment facilities are also very valuable in optimizing treatment processes the key element of treatment is biological where bacteria and other microorganisms e g protozoa parasites fungus algae are responsible for organic matter degradation especially within the secondary treatment facilities additionally nutrient removal phosphorus and nitrogen in wwtps of qatar are taking place in the tertiary treatment by bacteria 4 the new wwtps in qatar are planning to add reverse osmosis ro system for improving the final effluent characterization of potential biofouling agents is a must for the best pretreatment technologies to avoid any damage membrane clogging or lack of performance effluent of poor quality and productivity to the ro membranes other benefits of using a molecular bacteriology approach for characterization and optimization include optimizing the conditions and dynamics of nitrifiers denitrifiers within secondary treatment processes selecting best bacterial species for phosphorus removal and maintaining optimizing their performance understanding ch4 producing archaea for energy applications identification of sulphur reducing bacteria for further research on h2s production collection and toxicology isolation of specific powerful bacteria for heavy metal and metalloids removal under harsh arid conditions and identification of pathogenic bacteria to human and animals and removing these contaminants for safe reuse options one of the limiting factors for water reuse is the microbiological contamination and potential risks to humans animals and environment investing money in developing disinfection technologies should be linked to awarness campaigns and public perception as well as scientific standards and regulations 5 rapid and accurate identification of bacteria species in wastewater treatment samples is an important valuable tool to assess efficacy of wastewater treatment techniques traditional culture based and phenotypic methods are time consuming and fail to identify unculturable or unusual species 6 the use of next generation sequencing tools enable such species to be identified 7 through the use of molecular techniques alpha beta and gamma proteobacteria are found to dominate chlorinated drinking water 8 10 in this study primer pools that amplify multiple hypervariable regions v2 3 4 6 7 8 and 9 were used to construct libraries from wastewater that were sampled from different stages of the waste water treatment ion 16s metagenomics kit thermo scientific waltham ma bacterial 16s rrna genes consist of nine hypervariable regions v1 v9 and these regions are unique to each type of bacteria and can act as their fingerprints 11 these hypervariable regions are flanked by stretches of highly conserved regions which serve as primer binding sites 12 therefore using 16s ribosomal rna in bacterial classification enable identification of samples of bacteria with unusual phenotypic profiles 11 rare bacteria 13 14 slow growing bacteria 15 and uncultivable bacteria 16 sequencing specific hypervariable regions on the 16s rdna allows for taxonomic analysis of the microbiome within the water samples 17 also the simultaneous survey of 7 out of the 9 hypervariable regions on the 16s rrna gene increases sensitivity and species level discrimination however the dna extraction method has been shown to influence microbial community composition 18 19 it is therefore important to compare samples analyzed with similar methods in this study using primers specific to the species of known pathogenic bacteria acrobacter spp and its presence in the waste water samples was detected using pcr this allowed the correlation with sequencing data from 16s bacterial classification and presence of the bacteria in the sample furthermore water being a microbial habitat could serve as an avenue through which antibiotic and metal resistance genes could potentially facilitate interchange between pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria 20 these genes are located on the same mobile genetic elements 21 22 bacterial resistance to antibiotics metals and disinfectants in water samples can greatly influence human health and result in serious economic consequences 23 24 we used molecular techniques to investigate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes specifically tetracycline resistance genes during the different stages of the wastewater treatment quantification of tetracycline resistant genes in wastewater could serve as a measure of water treatment efficacy as this antibiotic is one of the cheapest and most common clinically used antibiotics 25 and is relatively common in wastewater and manure impacted soils considering to the 10 key elements behind treated wastewater tww reuse in the middle east 26 this specific study summarized the key challenges at the treatment processes and reuse sides they include impacts of climate change on wastewater treatment impacts of industralization urbanization on wastewater treatment water reuse and public health concerns seasonal variation of treatment processes impact of wastewater reuse on environment impact of treated wastewater on plant physiology impact of wastewater on plant production yield wastewater reuse and contaminant bioavailability impacts of wastewater on plant genotoxicity wastewater and endocrine disrupting compounds the study adds scientifc value to the previous studies and available literature on merging physical treatment processes of ultrafiltration uf and chemical disinfection chlorination on microbial removal aimed at achieving tww of the highest quality additionally the study uses a molecular biology approach for the first time in the region to investigate the occurrence of microbiome in the levels of phyla classes and species using bacterial dna isolation and sequencing in wastewater samples of different treatment stages finally and if pathogens are still present in the final effluent the study highlights options of treatment optimization for better removal of bacteria from ww the specific objectives of the

module in the ion reporter software was used to classify individual reads via a two step alignment to the manually curated microseq and public content greengenes databases in the first step reads are aligned to the microseq id library with any unaligned reads subject to a second alignment to the greengenes database 27 28 taxonomical assignments in this data set are reported as a consensus of the results from all of the primers by default alignment at various taxonomic levels follows the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi guidelines requiring the family level to have 97 identity

diversity using the ion reporter software which leverages qiime s open source bioinformatics pipeline to produce diversity analyses and visualizations alpha diversity was measured using observed species metric which evaluates within sample diversity beta diversity was evaluated using the bray curtis dissimilarity method and bacterial diversity between different samples was plotted on a principal coordinate axis pcoa graph this aids in exploration of potential factors that group similar communities pcoa was visualized using the emperor software distances between samples of the pcoa

visualised under uv light in g box syngene md and analysed using the program gene tools syngene md 3 results and discussion wastewater samples were assessed by characterizing the bacterial community structure in each sample to understand the diversity of bacterial communities in the water samples next generation sequencing ngs and associated bioinformatics approaches were used this approach uses two primer sets that selectively amplify the corresponding hypervariable regions of the 16s region in bacteria primer set v2 4 8 and primer set v3 6 7 9 fig 2 these primers were designed to target more the sequences found in the greengenes database and the combination of the two primer pools allows for sequence based identification of a broad range of bacteria within a mixed population the amplified fragments were sequenced on the ion s5 system and the results analysed with the ion reporter software ion 16s metagenomics kit analyses module where sequence reads generated were analyzed by utilizing an optimal two step alignment that utilizes both the microseq id and greengenes databases in addition qualitative polymerase chain reaction pcr was also performed to detect the presence of specific pathogenic bacteria arcobacter spp to correlate with sequencing results and the presence of tetracycline resistant gene tetq to understand the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes during the wastewater treatment process 3 1 community analysis alpha and beta diversity plots the alpha diversity plot describes species richness which is represented by chao1 index and evenness of taxa in a single sample 30 fig 3 a and b show the alpha diversity plots for the species diversity and family diversity respectively sample 1 which is the raw wastewater influent exhibited the greatest species bacterial diversity including greater richness as observed by the highest number of observed species of 170 operational taxonomic unit otu in the species diversity plot fig 3a sample 9 which is the one after ultrafiltration system displayed the lowest species diversity and approximately 50 observed species sample 10 which is collected after the last stage of treatment i e chlorination has a lower species diversity than sample 1 but higher diversity than sample 9 while the number of observed otus in the species plot is about 110 fig 3a a similar pattern is observed in fig 3b which displays the number of observed species at family level sample 9 displayed the lowest number of observed species of about 50 in the family level sample 1 exhibited a higher family diversity and the number of species is about 110 the family diversity of this sample was higher than sample 9 but lower than sample 10 where the number of observed species is about 80 fig 3b the chao1 index which qualitatively measures alpha diversity which besides species richness also gives more weight to rare species this index also allows for the abundance of the species to be taken into account together the results suggest that ultrafiltration treatment prior to the collection of sample 9 is the most efficient at reducing the diversity and abundance of species and family in contrast the process of chlorination followed by ultrafiltration appears to result in an increased diversity of species and family this implies that the ultrafiltration process suffices and that the chlorination process should be optimized to prevent the increase in species and family diversity following the ultrafiltration process beta diversity represents the explicit comparison of bacterial communities based on their composition beta diversity metrics thus assess the differences between bacterial communities fig 4 shows the beta diversity plots for both family a and species b the principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used for plotting beta diversity this analysis illustrates the relationship between samples based on a distance matrix fig 4a shows that water samples from 1 to 8 are very similar with respect to family and are clustered together whereas sample 9 and sample 10 are different from each other and from other samples as indicated by the large distance between them this suggests that the bacterial population residing the water samples of 9 and 10 are different than the bacterial populations in the other water samples 1 to 8 indicating that the ultrafiltration and chlorination treatments have changed the species bacterial composition of the water samples fig 4b shows that there are three main clusters within species water samples from 1 to 5 and from 7 to 8 are grouped together as they all share similarities with regard to the species bacterial population sample 6 and 10 are further away as they share less similarities with the other samples the bacterial composition of sample 9 is very different than the other samples as is indicated by the larger distance between sample 9 and the other samples taken together the results reveal a sharp distinction between the bacterial population of samples 9 and the other samples this suggests the possibility that ultrafiltration treatment has changed the bacterial composition of sample 9 by decreasing the bacterial diversity of the sample it indicates that the microbiome in the water samples can persist under extreme conditions of chronic stress therefore in the wastewater treatment process to remove the microbes multiple hygienic barriers are employed such as uv disinfection and chlorination from our results the chlorination process affected bacterial abundance but not composition in the short term but uv disinfection caused the greatest decrease in both abundance and diversity 3 2 taxonomical assignments bacterial taxonomy is assigned based on the greengenes taxonomy and a greengenes reference database using the qiime pipeline 30 to understand the bacterial species diversity observed in alpha fig 3 and beta fig 4 diversity plots the bacterial composition of water samples was examined by plotting the relative abundance of the operational taxonomical units of different phyla of the wastewater samples fig 5 an operational taxonomic unit otu is normally defined as a cluster of reads with 97 similarity motivated by the expectation that these correspond approximately to species the otus were analyzed in the following ways 1 mapping the otu distribution of phylum level identification of microbes in each water sample and 2 ranking the otu according to species level classification with a cutoff at 100 otus for each water sample the vast majority of the sequences was assigned to four dominant phyla proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidates the dominant phylum across all the water samples is proteobacteria with the bacteria making up 96 and 88 of otus in sample 9 and 10 respectively fig 5 proteobacteria belong to the phylogenetic lineage of gram negative bacteria and is the most diverse phylum within the domain bacteria they are typically found in soil and water 31 within this diverse phylum there are five classes of proteobacteria listed as follows alpha proteobacteria beta proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria delta proteobacteria and epsilon proteobacteria 32 bacterial diversity and abundance of proteobacteria was analysed more specifically at the classes level fig 6 the major class of proteobacteria in water samples 1 to 3 and 8 to 10 is gamma proteobacteria whereas the major class in samples 4 to 7 is beta proteobacteria the gamma class is the largest proteobacterial group which contains a great number of familiar heterotrophic bacteria such as enterobacteriaceae and vibrionaceae 31 habi and daba 33 reported enterobacteriaceae isolates from the algerian river exhibited high resistance to pb and low resistance to cd in stream water that was polluted with heavy metals further family level classification revealed campylobacteraceae dominated otus in sample 1 32240 data not shown which was undetectable at the later stages of the water treatment process the family campylobacteraceae presently contains three genera campylobacter arcobacter and sulfurospirillum arcobacter is a genus of gram negative spiral shaped bacteria in the epsilon proteobacteria class and some of the arcobacter species are pathogenic causing enteritis and bacteraemia in humans 34 37 the possible transmission of arcobacter through contaminated water has been reported 38 qualitative pcr targeting the pathogenic bacteria arcobacter spp was performed to assess the correlation between ngs data and the bacterial dna in the water samples fig 7 which represents the relative abundance of otus derived from sequencing shows that arcobacter spp is present in all water samples except sample 9 and 10 with highest abundance in sample 1 14484 otus or 25 fig 7 fig 8 a shows that the pcr product of arcobacter spp 106 bp is only observed in samples 2 6 7 and 8 samples 4 and 5 show bands of 600 bp which is a result of unspecific binding the pcr reaction fig 8a did not correlate with the results from sequencing fig 7 but it showed that the lowest acceptable reads per sample to the detection of bacterial dna is 142 reads which was detected in water sample 8 since the results from sequencing and pcr shows that arcobacter spp was not detected in samples 9 and 10 therefore this suggests that ultrafiltration and chlorination treatments successfully reduced the pathogenic arcobacter spp bacteroidetes are phenotypically diverse phylum of gram stain negative bacteria that are morphologically present as rods the phylum contains four classes bacteroidia cytophagia flavobacteriia and sphingobacteria 39 the metagenomics analysis of the effect of the water treatment on this phylum showed that the relative abundance of bacteroidates reduced from 13 9 in sample 1 to only 1 2 in sample 10 similarly the relative abundance of actinobacteria has reduced to only 0 56 and 1 1 in sample 9 and 10 respectively fig 5 fig 5 also shows that the diversity of the groups of bacteria decreased from 9 cell lineages in stage 1 to only 5 lineages in stage 9 and 10 indicating that the richness of the biodiversity is lower for water samples 9 and 10 this reduction in the diversity confirms the results from beta diversity plot for the family level fig 4b fig 6 also shows that the diversity of the classes of proteobacteria decreased from 5 classes in samples 1 to 8 to only 3 and 4 classes in samples 9 and 10 respectively the biodiversity divergence in the wastewater samples may result from the different treatment processes of the water samples according to figs 3 and 4 a great shift in the bacterial community structure was observed after the ultrafiltration treatment this is consistent with the results from the alpha diversity plot of the water samples fig 3 and it confirms that the filtration membrane used in ultrafiltration system is able to reduce the bacterial species diversity of the water samples 3 3 molecular analysis of tetq tetracycline was one of the first broad spectrum antibiotics discovered it is known to either inhibit protein synthesis or interact with the bacterial membrane 40 a study on the effects of ultraviolet disinfection on antibiotic resistant escherichia coli from wastewater showed that uv disinfection could not effectively eliminate antibiotic resistance genes namely genes associated with tetracycline resistance 41 in this study pcr based detection of the bacillus fragilis teta q 2 gene was carried out on the water samples the tetracycline resistance gene tetq was detected through targeted amplification and it was detected in all the samples except 9 and 10 fig 8b therefore the ultrafiltration and chlorination treatments have decreased the prevalence of the tetracycline resistance gene hence likely reducing the possibility of exchange of antibiotic resistance genes within the environment 4 conclusions data derived from sequencing techniques prove that wastewater treatment processes are effective in reducing the diversity of bacteria species the alpha diversity and taxonomical summaries of the water samples suggested that the ultrafiltration is essential in reducing the bacterial diversity of the water samples although chlorination technology is used for final water disinfection water after ultrafiltration showed possible alteration of bacterial community compared to the quality after chlorination which may need further optimization to achieve better effluent quality chlorination did not modify greatly the bacterial community in terms of diversity to enhance these findings it would be better to use rna as an accurate indicator of viable bacteria inhabiting the community to understand what viability means we defined the term viable microbe as the ability of invasive bacteria to cause detrimental effects the ability of bacteria to replicate maintain metabolic activity and homeostasis classifies it as viable it is therefore important to clearly distinguish the presence and identity of viable bacteria in an attempt to understand the threat it poses when using dna as a source of information dead cells that can persist for a long time despite inactivation would also be detected and it would be hard to differentiate between viable and dead cells sampling of wastewater at different times of the year is also necessary to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the bacterial community structure variance with environmental conditions and the link to chemical parameters to be established more studies are necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the bacterial community structure in the final treated effluent and to confirm whether the treated water is well treated or not significant scientific

is essential in reducing bacteria species diversity however chlorination disinfection the final step of treatment needs further optimization because the uf process before chlorination showed better possible removal of bacterial communities when compared to the quality after chlorination proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidetes persisted through the stages of treatment proteobacteria remained contently present whereas bacteria of the other three phyla showed decrease between 2 fold to 100 fold following either ultrafiltration or chlorination more studies are required to distinguish between viable and non viable microorganisms keywords wastewater treatment molecular biology optimization of treatment processes 1 introduction water security is one of the national grand challenges in qatar 1 treated wastewater is an important component of water resources in the country currently qatar produces more than 800 000 m3 day of highly treated water using advanced treatment technologies these technologies include membrane filtration micro and ultra filtration followed by ultraviolet uv and chlorination disinfection 2 treated water is used in applications such as district cooling irrigation of green areas national parks and a few limited projects of groundwater aquifer recharge assessing the safe reuse of the treated water is very important to minimize the health risks that are associated with pathogens in reclaimed water 3 managing and protecting water sources has long been a major issue in gcc states particulalrly in qatar currently all wastewater treatment plants wwtps in qatar are not limited to tertiary treatment but advanced processes are added such as membrane ultrafiltration uf systems uv chlorination disinfection to allow 100 of treated wastewater to be recycled microbiological investigations of wastewater among different treatment facilities are also very valuable in optimizing treatment processes the key element of treatment is biological where bacteria and other microorganisms e g protozoa parasites fungus algae are responsible for organic matter degradation especially within the secondary treatment facilities additionally nutrient removal phosphorus and nitrogen in wwtps of qatar are taking place in the tertiary treatment by bacteria 4 the new wwtps in qatar are planning to add reverse osmosis ro system for improving the final effluent characterization of potential biofouling agents is a must for the best pretreatment technologies to avoid any damage membrane clogging or lack of performance effluent of poor quality and productivity to the ro membranes other benefits of using a molecular bacteriology approach for characterization and optimization include optimizing the conditions and dynamics of nitrifiers denitrifiers within secondary treatment processes selecting best bacterial species for phosphorus removal and maintaining optimizing their performance understanding ch4 producing archaea for energy applications identification of sulphur reducing bacteria for further research on h2s production collection and toxicology isolation of specific powerful bacteria for heavy metal and metalloids removal under harsh arid conditions and identification of pathogenic bacteria to human and animals and removing these contaminants for safe reuse options one of the limiting factors for water reuse is the microbiological contamination and potential risks to humans animals and environment investing money in developing disinfection technologies should be linked to awarness campaigns and public perception as well as scientific standards and regulations 5 rapid and accurate identification of bacteria species in wastewater treatment samples is an important valuable tool to assess efficacy of wastewater treatment techniques traditional culture based and phenotypic methods are time consuming and fail to identify unculturable or unusual species 6 the use of next generation sequencing tools enable such species to be identified 7 through the use of molecular techniques alpha beta and gamma proteobacteria are found to dominate chlorinated drinking water 8 10 in this study primer pools that amplify multiple hypervariable regions v2 3 4 6 7 8 and 9 were used to construct libraries from wastewater that were sampled from different stages of the waste water treatment ion 16s metagenomics kit thermo scientific waltham ma bacterial 16s rrna genes consist of nine hypervariable regions v1 v9 and these regions are unique to each type of bacteria and can act as their fingerprints 11 these hypervariable regions are flanked by stretches of highly conserved regions which serve as primer binding sites 12 therefore using 16s ribosomal rna in bacterial classification enable identification of samples of bacteria with unusual phenotypic profiles 11 rare bacteria 13 14 slow growing bacteria 15 and uncultivable bacteria 16 sequencing specific hypervariable regions on the 16s rdna allows for taxonomic analysis of the microbiome within the water samples 17 also the simultaneous survey of 7 out of the 9 hypervariable regions on the 16s rrna gene increases sensitivity and species level discrimination however the dna extraction method has been shown to influence microbial community composition 18 19 it is therefore important to compare samples analyzed with similar methods in this study using primers specific to the species of known pathogenic bacteria acrobacter spp and its presence in the waste water samples was detected using pcr this allowed the correlation with sequencing data from 16s bacterial classification and presence of the bacteria in the sample furthermore water being a microbial habitat could serve as an avenue through which antibiotic and metal resistance genes could potentially facilitate interchange between pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria 20 these genes are located on the same mobile genetic elements 21 22 bacterial resistance to antibiotics metals and disinfectants in water samples can greatly influence human health and result in serious economic consequences 23 24 we used molecular techniques to investigate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes specifically tetracycline resistance genes during the different stages of the wastewater treatment quantification of tetracycline resistant genes in wastewater could serve as a measure of water treatment efficacy as this antibiotic is one of the cheapest and most common clinically used antibiotics 25 and is relatively common in wastewater and manure impacted soils considering to the 10 key elements behind treated wastewater tww reuse in the middle east 26 this specific study summarized the key challenges at the treatment processes and reuse sides they include impacts of climate change on wastewater treatment impacts of industralization urbanization on wastewater treatment water reuse and public health concerns seasonal variation of treatment processes impact of wastewater reuse on environment impact of treated wastewater on plant physiology impact of wastewater on plant production yield wastewater reuse and contaminant bioavailability impacts of wastewater on plant genotoxicity wastewater and endocrine disrupting compounds the study adds scientifc value to the previous studies and available literature on merging physical treatment processes of ultrafiltration uf and chemical disinfection chlorination on microbial removal aimed at achieving tww of the highest quality additionally the study uses a molecular biology approach for the first time in the region to investigate the occurrence of microbiome in the levels of phyla classes and species using bacterial dna isolation and sequencing in wastewater samples of different treatment stages finally and if pathogens are still present in the final effluent the study highlights options of treatment optimization for better removal of bacteria from ww the specific objectives of the

diversity using the ion reporter software which leverages qiime s open source bioinformatics pipeline to produce diversity analyses and visualizations alpha diversity was measured using observed species metric which evaluates within sample diversity beta diversity was evaluated using the bray curtis dissimilarity method and bacterial diversity between different samples was plotted on a principal coordinate axis pcoa graph this aids in exploration of potential factors that group similar communities pcoa was visualized using the emperor software distances between samples of the pcoa

visualised under uv light in g box syngene md and analysed using the program gene tools syngene md 3 results and discussion wastewater samples were assessed by characterizing the bacterial community structure in each sample to understand the diversity of bacterial communities in the water samples next generation sequencing ngs and associated bioinformatics approaches were used this approach uses two primer sets that selectively amplify the corresponding hypervariable regions of the 16s region in bacteria primer set v2 4 8 and primer set v3 6 7 9 fig 2 these primers were designed to target more the sequences found in the greengenes database and the combination of the two primer pools allows for sequence based identification of a broad range of bacteria within a mixed population the amplified fragments were sequenced on the ion s5 system and the results analysed with the ion reporter software ion 16s metagenomics kit analyses module where sequence reads generated were analyzed by utilizing an optimal two step alignment that utilizes both the microseq id and greengenes databases in addition qualitative polymerase chain reaction pcr was also performed to detect the presence of specific pathogenic bacteria arcobacter spp to correlate with sequencing results and the presence of tetracycline resistant gene tetq to understand the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes during the wastewater treatment process 3 1 community analysis alpha and beta diversity plots the alpha diversity plot describes species richness which is represented by chao1 index and evenness of taxa in a single sample 30 fig 3 a and b show the alpha diversity plots for the species diversity and family diversity respectively sample 1 which is the raw wastewater influent exhibited the greatest species bacterial diversity including greater richness as observed by the highest number of observed species of 170 operational taxonomic unit otu in the species diversity plot fig 3a sample 9 which is the one after ultrafiltration system displayed the lowest species diversity and approximately 50 observed species sample 10 which is collected after the last stage of treatment i e chlorination has a lower species diversity than sample 1 but higher diversity than sample 9 while the number of observed otus in the species plot is about 110 fig 3a a similar pattern is observed in fig 3b which displays the number of observed species at family level sample 9 displayed the lowest number of observed species of about 50 in the family level sample 1 exhibited a higher family diversity and the number of species is about 110 the family diversity of this sample was higher than sample 9 but lower than sample 10 where the number of observed species is about 80 fig 3b the chao1 index which qualitatively measures alpha diversity which besides species richness also gives more weight to rare species this index also allows for the abundance of the species to be taken into account together the results suggest that ultrafiltration treatment prior to the collection of sample 9 is the most efficient at reducing the diversity and abundance of species and family in contrast the process of chlorination followed by ultrafiltration appears to result in an increased diversity of species and family this implies that the ultrafiltration process suffices and that the chlorination process should be optimized to prevent the increase in species and family diversity following the ultrafiltration process beta diversity represents the explicit comparison of bacterial communities based on their composition beta diversity metrics thus assess the differences between bacterial communities fig 4 shows the beta diversity plots for both family a and species b the principal coordinate analysis pcoa was used for plotting beta diversity this analysis illustrates the relationship between samples based on a distance matrix fig 4a shows that water samples from 1 to 8 are very similar with respect to family and are clustered together whereas sample 9 and sample 10 are different from each other and from other samples as indicated by the large distance between them this suggests that the bacterial population residing the water samples of 9 and 10 are different than the bacterial populations in the other water samples 1 to 8 indicating that the ultrafiltration and chlorination treatments have changed the species bacterial composition of the water samples fig 4b shows that there are three main clusters within species water samples from 1 to 5 and from 7 to 8 are grouped together as they all share similarities with regard to the species bacterial population sample 6 and 10 are further away as they share less similarities with the other samples the bacterial composition of sample 9 is very different than the other samples as is indicated by the larger distance between sample 9 and the other samples taken together the results reveal a sharp distinction between the bacterial population of samples 9 and the other samples this suggests the possibility that ultrafiltration treatment has changed the bacterial composition of sample 9 by decreasing the bacterial diversity of the sample it indicates that the microbiome in the water samples can persist under extreme conditions of chronic stress therefore in the wastewater treatment process to remove the microbes multiple hygienic barriers are employed such as uv disinfection and chlorination from our results the chlorination process affected bacterial abundance but not composition in the short term but uv disinfection caused the greatest decrease in both abundance and diversity 3 2 taxonomical assignments bacterial taxonomy is assigned based on the greengenes taxonomy and a greengenes reference database using the qiime pipeline 30 to understand the bacterial species diversity observed in alpha fig 3 and beta fig 4 diversity plots the bacterial composition of water samples was examined by plotting the relative abundance of the operational taxonomical units of different phyla of the wastewater samples fig 5 an operational taxonomic unit otu is normally defined as a cluster of reads with 97 similarity motivated by the expectation that these correspond approximately to species the otus were analyzed in the following ways 1 mapping the otu distribution of phylum level identification of microbes in each water sample and 2 ranking the otu according to species level classification with a cutoff at 100 otus for each water sample the vast majority of the sequences was assigned to four dominant phyla proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidates the dominant phylum across all the water samples is proteobacteria with the bacteria making up 96 and 88 of otus in sample 9 and 10 respectively fig 5 proteobacteria belong to the phylogenetic lineage of gram negative bacteria and is the most diverse phylum within the domain bacteria they are typically found in soil and water 31 within this diverse phylum there are five classes of proteobacteria listed as follows alpha proteobacteria beta proteobacteria gamma proteobacteria delta proteobacteria and epsilon proteobacteria 32 bacterial diversity and abundance of proteobacteria was analysed more specifically at the classes level fig 6 the major class of proteobacteria in water samples 1 to 3 and 8 to 10 is gamma proteobacteria whereas the major class in samples 4 to 7 is beta proteobacteria the gamma class is the largest proteobacterial group which contains a great number of familiar heterotrophic bacteria such as enterobacteriaceae and vibrionaceae 31 habi and daba 33 reported enterobacteriaceae isolates from the algerian river exhibited high resistance to pb and low resistance to cd in stream water that was polluted with heavy metals further family level classification revealed campylobacteraceae dominated otus in sample 1 32240 data not shown which was undetectable at the later stages of the water treatment process the family campylobacteraceae presently contains three genera campylobacter arcobacter and sulfurospirillum arcobacter is a genus of gram negative spiral shaped bacteria in the epsilon proteobacteria class and some of the arcobacter species are pathogenic causing enteritis and bacteraemia in humans 34 37 the possible transmission of arcobacter through contaminated water has been reported 38 qualitative pcr targeting the pathogenic bacteria arcobacter spp was performed to assess the correlation between ngs data and the bacterial dna in the water samples fig 7 which represents the relative abundance of otus derived from sequencing shows that arcobacter spp is present in all water samples except sample 9 and 10 with highest abundance in sample 1 14484 otus or 25 fig 7 fig 8 a shows that the pcr product of arcobacter spp 106 bp is only observed in samples 2 6 7 and 8 samples 4 and 5 show bands of 600 bp which is a result of unspecific binding the pcr reaction fig 8a did not correlate with the results from sequencing fig 7 but it showed that the lowest acceptable reads per sample to the detection of bacterial dna is 142 reads which was detected in water sample 8 since the results from sequencing and pcr shows that arcobacter spp was not detected in samples 9 and 10 therefore this suggests that ultrafiltration and chlorination treatments successfully reduced the pathogenic arcobacter spp bacteroidetes are phenotypically diverse phylum of gram stain negative bacteria that are morphologically present as rods the phylum contains four classes bacteroidia cytophagia flavobacteriia and sphingobacteria 39 the metagenomics analysis of the effect of the water treatment on this phylum showed that the relative abundance of bacteroidates reduced from 13 9 in sample 1 to only 1 2 in sample 10 similarly the relative abundance of actinobacteria has reduced to only 0 56 and 1 1 in sample 9 and 10 respectively fig 5 fig 5 also shows that the diversity of the groups of bacteria decreased from 9 cell lineages in stage 1 to only 5 lineages in stage 9 and 10 indicating that the richness of the biodiversity is lower for water samples 9 and 10 this reduction in the diversity confirms the results from beta diversity plot for the family level fig 4b fig 6 also shows that the diversity of the classes of proteobacteria decreased from 5 classes in samples 1 to 8 to only 3 and 4 classes in samples 9 and 10 respectively the biodiversity divergence in the wastewater samples may result from the different treatment processes of the water samples according to figs 3 and 4 a great shift in the bacterial community structure was observed after the ultrafiltration treatment this is consistent with the results from the alpha diversity plot of the water samples fig 3 and it confirms that the filtration membrane used in ultrafiltration system is able to reduce the bacterial species diversity of the water samples 3 3 molecular analysis of tetq tetracycline was one of the first broad spectrum antibiotics discovered it is known to either inhibit protein synthesis or interact with the bacterial membrane 40 a study on the effects of ultraviolet disinfection on antibiotic resistant escherichia coli from wastewater showed that uv disinfection could not effectively eliminate antibiotic resistance genes namely genes associated with tetracycline resistance 41 in this study pcr based detection of the bacillus fragilis teta q 2 gene was carried out on the water samples the tetracycline resistance gene tetq was detected through targeted amplification and it was detected in all the samples except 9 and 10 fig 8b therefore the ultrafiltration and chlorination treatments have decreased the prevalence of the tetracycline resistance gene hence likely reducing the possibility of exchange of antibiotic resistance genes within the environment 4 conclusions data derived from sequencing techniques prove that wastewater treatment processes are effective in reducing the diversity of bacteria species the alpha diversity and taxonomical summaries of the water samples suggested that the ultrafiltration is essential in reducing the bacterial diversity of the water samples although chlorination technology is used for final water disinfection water after ultrafiltration showed possible alteration of bacterial community compared to the quality after chlorination which may need further optimization to achieve better effluent quality chlorination did not modify greatly the bacterial community in terms of diversity to enhance these findings it would be better to use rna as an accurate indicator of viable bacteria inhabiting the community to understand what viability means we defined the term viable microbe as the ability of invasive bacteria to cause detrimental effects the ability of bacteria to replicate maintain metabolic activity and homeostasis classifies it as viable it is therefore important to clearly distinguish the presence and identity of viable bacteria in an attempt to understand the threat it poses when using dna as a source of information dead cells that can persist for a long time despite inactivation would also be detected and it would be hard to differentiate between viable and dead cells sampling of wastewater at different times of the year is also necessary to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the bacterial community structure variance with environmental conditions and the link to chemical parameters to be established more studies are necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the bacterial community structure in the final treated effluent and to confirm whether the treated water is well treated or not significant scientific

14153,the generation of large volume of produced water necessitates a chemically stable membrane with high water permeability for the removal of oil emulsion in this work a zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif 8 based thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane with improved pure water permeability and chemical stability was developed it was found that poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss coating could stabilize the zif 8 particles against dissolution in water this subsequently allowed the proper formation of tfn membrane with comparable separation properties as the thin film composite tfc membrane with the further use of triethylamine tea as an acid acceptor in interfacial polymerization the pure water permeability of tfn membrane improved significantly over both tfc and tfn membranes synthesized without tea with minimal loss in nacl rejection the enhanced water transport of tfn membrane was further manifested by the higher flux of tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane in forward osmosis fo filtration of both synthetic high salinity oil emulsion and real produced water in addition due to the chemically stable zif 8 particles the tfn membrane was demonstrated to have a better swelling resistance against produced water than the tfc membrane keywords produced water thin film nanocomposite membrane zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate triethylamine 1 introduction the increase of oil and gas exploration in the past century has witnessed the generation of large volume of high salinity oil emulsion wastewater known as produced water 1 4 the environmental concern on the discharge of produced water has gradually led to global attention on produced water treatment in this context membrane technology such as forward osmosis fo is a promising alternative in treating produced water 1 5 fo offers unrivalled benefits over other membrane processes such as lower energy demand 3 and lower fouling propensity 6 9 thin film composite tfc membrane is a typical membrane used in fo process due to the need for a dense rejection layer to minimize the loss of draw solute from draw solution to feed solution in view of the huge volume of global produced water generated daily substantial research effort has been focused on improving the water flux of tfc membrane one of the methods in enhancing membrane water transport is the development of thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane pioneered by hoek et al 10 this technique involves the incorporation of nanomaterial such as zeolite 11 13 and carbon nanotubes 14 16 into the polyamide rejection layer the nanomaterial can be introduced either via aqueous or organic reactive phase during interfacial polymerization generally it is reported that the nanomaterial improves the tfn membrane water flux without sacrificing the salt rejection 11 15 16 however it has been found that nanomaterial agglomeration occurs easily at high loading due to its poor interaction with polyamide matrix thus creating membrane defects 11 13 15 in view of this metal organic framework mof has been suggested as an alternative nanofiller to promote its better interaction with polyamide zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif 8 a type of mof has been increasingly used in preparing the tfn membrane 17 19 this is due to its aperture size of 3 4 Ã¥ which is between the size of typical hydrated salt ions 6 6 8 6 Ã¥ 20 and the size of water molecules 2 7 Ã¥ 11 making it an ideal molecular sieve for water separation zif 8 also demonstrates excellent chemical stability against hydrocarbon which can be found in produced water 21 however it has been reported recently that zif 8 demonstrates poor stability in water 22 23 liu et al discovered that the zif 8 crystalline framework was lost after its hydrothermal treatment with water 22 similar finding was also reported by zhang et al where the zif 8 was hydrolyzed by water to cause its dissolution in water 23 this indicated that the zif 8 had lost its aperture size and could no longer serve as a molecular sieve the poor zif 8 stability in water thus challenges the development of zif 8 based tfn membrane via aqueous phase dosing several works have been carried out to improve the zif 8 stability in water by substituting the 2 methylimidazole ligands at the zif 8 outer surface with a more hydrophobic imidazole ligand such as 5 6 dimethylbenzimidazole 22 24 in both studies the zif 8 framework and crystallinity were successfully retained in water after the surface ligand exchange process thus preserving the zif 8 stability in water 22 24 apart from tfn membrane development the use of acid acceptor such as triethylamine tea in interfacial polymerization has also been studied for enhancement of membrane water transport in essence hydrogen chloride is formed as a byproduct in interfacial polymerization it is widely accepted that tea helps to remove the hydrogen chloride to drive further reaction 25 26 hence tea can promote polyamide film crosslinking to induce diffusion controlled polyamide film growth this then reduces the polyamide film thickness to improve membrane water transport the increase of membrane water flux with the use of tea has been reported in other study 26 tea also brings other benefit besides water transport improvement van goethem et al produced a zif 8 based tfn membrane and found that zif 8 was degraded by the hydrogen chloride generated during interfacial polymerization 27 however this was successfully overcome with the use of tea which removed the hydrogen chloride from system thus preventing the zif 8 degradation and preserving its molecular sieving ability 27 the objective of this study is to develop a zif 8 based tfn membrane with high water permeability for fo treatment of high salinity oil emulsion wastewater in view of the zif 8 instability in water this work introduces the coating of poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss an anionic polymer onto the zif 8 particle surface as an electrosteric stabilizer moreover the use of tea in interfacial polymerization is proposed in developing the tfn membrane this work aims to provide a clearer understanding on the actual role of tea during interfacial polymerization of tfn membrane besides acting as an acid acceptor the tfc and tfn membranes synthesized under the influence of pss coating and tea were then evaluated for their changes in morphology and separation properties lastly the membranes were tested for the treatment of synthetic high salinity oil emulsion wastewater and real produced water using fo process to evaluate their potential in treating oily wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of zif 8 particles zif 8 particles were prepared by reacting 2 methylimidazole sigma aldrich and zinc nitrate hexahydrate sigma aldrich reactants both reactants were first dissolved individually in methanol merck to obtain clear reactant solutions having a concentration of 0 4 m and 3 2 m respectively the temperature of reactant solutions was then reduced to 5 c by immersing them in an ice bath after reaching 5 c the zinc nitrate hexahydrate solution was added to the 2 methylimidazole solution at 10 ml each to initiate the reaction under a stirring speed of 250 rpm ice was added to control the ice bath temperature at 5 c after 10 min the reaction mixture was diluted using methanol to 100 ml volume to quench the reaction the reaction mixture was then subjected to 8000 rpm of centrifugation process for 20 min to recover the zif 8 particles next the zif 8 particles were purified via washing with methanol followed by centrifugation the washing and centrifugation process was repeated for two times lastly the zif 8 particles were dispersed in either pure or mixture of methanol and water to obtain zif 8 suspensions for further characterization surface modification by pss or tfn membrane synthesis 2 2 surface modification of zif 8 particles via pss coating the zif 8 particles synthesized in section 2 1 underwent surface modification by pss molecules to improve the zif 8 particle stability in water thus enabling the tfn membrane synthesis via aqueous phase zif 8 dosing during interfacial polymerization a series of pss solutions were first prepared by dissolving 0 4604 g of pss sigma aldrich in different solvents with the composition as listed in table 1 meanwhile the zif 8 particles synthesized in section 2 1 were also dispersed in different solvents with the composition as listed in table 1 via 10 min of sonication upon the final cycle of centrifugation the zif 8 particle suspension was added to the pss solution prepared previously to obtain 50 ml of coating solution the pss coating solution was then stirred for 24 h under a stirring speed of 250 rpm to promote the adsorption of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface after 24 h the pss coated zif 8 particles were recovered via 8000 rpm of centrifugation process for 20 min finally the zif 8 particles were dispersed in deionized water via 10 min of sonication to form a stable suspension for characterization and tfn membrane synthesis 2 3 preparation of polysulfone psf support membrane the polysulfone psf support membrane was prepared via phase inversion process firstly the psf casting dope was prepared by dissolving 16 wt of psf udel p 1700 solvay advanced polymer l l c and 17 wt of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 10 sigma aldrich in n methylpyrrolidone nmp merck the casting dope was stirred for 24 h for homogenization the casting dope was degassed then poured evenly on top of a woven polyester fabric style 0715 dacron fabric texlon corporation on a glass plate at a thickness of 150 Î¼m the glass plate was transferred immediately into a distilled water bath to initiate the phase inversion the membrane casting was performed at room temperature after 24 h the psf support membrane was harvested and stored in deionized water until further use 2 4 synthesis of tfc and tfn membranes a series of tfc and tfn membranes were synthesized in this work in order to evaluate the separation properties and specifically the improvement of membrane water transport under the influence of pss coating of zif 8 particles and the use of tea in interfacial polymerization the synthesis conditions of all membranes are summarized in table 2 the tfc membranes were synthesized by reacting trimesoyl chloride tmc sigma aldrich and m phenylenediamine mpd merck via interfacial polymerization firstly the aqueous phase monomer solution was prepared by dissolving mpd with without tea merck in deionized water milli q meanwhile the organic phase monomer solution was prepared by dissolving tmc in n hexane merck in the meantime the psf support membrane was fixed onto a flat teflon chamber plate the psf support membrane was immersed with mpd solution for 10 min excess mpd solution was then removed from the psf support membrane surface using a rubber roller next the psf support membrane surface was contacted with tmc solution for 60 s the tfc membrane then underwent heat curing treatment in an oven at 60 c for 15 min the tfc membrane was finally dried in air for one day prior to its further use the tfn membranes were synthesized by loading the zif 8 particles into membrane via aqueous phase dosing the tfn membrane synthesis followed the similar protocol as the synthesis of tfc membrane with a slightly different method in preparing the aqueous phase monomer solution firstly mpd was dissolved with without tea in deionized water to form a portion of monomer solution meanwhile the zif 8 particles were prepared separately in the form of an aqueous suspension for uncoated zif 8 particles the particles were dispersed in deionized water via 10 min of sonication after the final cycle of centrifugation at the end of zif 8 particle synthesis section 2 1 for pss coated zif 8 particles the particles were dispersed in deionized water via 10 min of sonication after their recovery from coating solution via centrifugation section 2 2 finally the zif 8 suspension was mixed with the mpd monomer solution with without tea to obtain the aqueous phase monomer solution for interfacial polymerization 2 5 evaluation of membrane reverse osmosis ro separation properties reverse osmosis ro filtration test was performed to assess the separation properties of tfc and tfn membranes pure water permeability and nacl rejection before filtration test the membrane was pretreated to enhance its ro water flux firstly the membrane was immersed in deionized water for 10 min this was followed by its immersion in an ethanol merck water solution at 30 vol ethanol for 24 h finally the membrane was transferred into deionized water for 10 min followed by the immediate filtration experiment the filtration test was carried out at room temperature by using a dead end stirred cell sterlitech hp4750 having an effective membrane area of 14 6 cm2 the membrane was first pressurized for 1 h at 16 5 bar using nitrogen gas after that ro filtration test was conducted under a stirring speed of 350 rpm with two test feeds 18 2 mÏ deionized water milli q and aqueous nacl merck solution at 10 mm concentration for every test feed the process was equilibrated for 30 min before data collection began pure water filtration was conducted at a transmembrane pressure of 7 15 bar with an increment of 2 bar the flux was determined with eq 1 the slope for the linear plot of flux transmembrane pressure was determined as the pure water permeability based on eq

transmembrane pressure bar the filtration of nacl solution was performed at a transmembrane pressure of 15 bar eq 3 was used to determine the nacl rejection both feed and permeate nacl concentrations were determined with a conductivity meter starter 300c ohaus the initial and final feed concentrations were averaged to obtain the bulk feed concentration meanwhile two permeate concentration readings were averaged to obtain the permeate concentration nacl permeability was then determined by eq 4 based on solution diffusion theory the solution osmotic pressure term in eq 4 was estimated by using the van t hoff s equation eq 5 nacl permeability was subsequently used for calculation of fo water flux and structural parameter of psf support membrane which will be described in section 2 6 3 r s 1

performance for the treatment of high salinity oil emulsion the performance of tfc and tfn membranes for the treatment of high salinity oil emulsion was evaluated via fo filtration test the membrane was pretreated using the same protocol as outlined in section 2 5 prior to the fo filtration test to improve the membrane flux fo filtration test was then carried out at room temperature using a crossflow membrane cell assembly sterlitech cf042 having an effective membrane area of 42 cm2 the feed and draw solutions were circulated at a volumetric flow rate of 0 76 l min 12 gph and 0 51 l min 8 gph respectively the feed solution was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer while the mass of draw solution was measured with an electronic balance the fo filtration test was carried out in a countercurrent scheme for 90 min in each run a number of test feeds were run including pure water synthetic seawater 500 ppm synthetic high salinity oil emulsion and real produced water the content of each feed solution is summarized in table 3 for both synthetic oil emulsion and real produced water the feed was sonicated for 5 min followed by instant fo filtration test meanwhile the draw solution used was 1 m of aqueous nacl solution freshly prepared for every change of test feed both feed and draw solutions were prepared at a volume of 1 l for every fo filtration run between two runs of different test feeds both feed and draw solution flow systems were subjected to flushing to remove any trapped solutes in the systems by circulating deionized water through the systems for 15 min the fo flux was determined gravimetrically based on the change of mass of the draw solution as measured by the electronic balance at an interval of 5 s mathematically fo flux is described by eq 6 28 6 j v Î´ v d a m Î´ t Î´ m d Ï f a m Î´ t where jv is fo flux l m2 h Î´vd is change of volume of draw solution l am is effective membrane area m2 Î´t is time h Î´md is change of mass of draw solution g and Ïf is feed solution density g l jv was determined every 5 min based on the slope of the linear plot of Î´vd am against Î´t hence the temporal evolution of fo flux could be evaluated the capability of membrane in retaining oil particles was evaluated by measuring the oil concentration in feed and draw solutions for both synthetic high salinity oil emulsion and real produced water for synthetic oil emulsion the oil concentration was determined with an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer the sample absorbance was measured and converted to the oil concentration via a calibration curve meanwhile for real produced water the oil concentration was determined with a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph the oil rejection was subsequently calculated as similar to eq 3 with only the permeate concentration term replaced by the draw solution concentration instead the reverse salt flux was also calculated reverse salt flux is an indicator of the degree of loss of draw solute from the draw solution to feed solution generally a lower reverse salt flux is desirable to minimize the loss of draw solute and preserve the fo driving force the reverse salt flux was calculated based on the mass balance of draw solute in the draw solution eq 7 using pure water filtration data 7 j s c d i v d i c d f v d f a m Î´ t where js is reverse salt flux mol m2 h cd i is initial concentration of draw solute in draw solution m vd i is initial volume of draw solution l cd f is final concentration of draw solute in draw solution m and vd f is final volume of draw

icp of fo process in this study the structural parameter was calculated using eq 8 which is derived based on the mass balance of draw solute at the interface between polyamide film and support membrane surface 28 29 pure water filtration data were used for the calculation the structural parameter calculated was compared to that of the literature to check the suitability of psf support

membranes and oil emulsion 2 7 1 dynamic light scattering dls and zeta potential measurement dynamic light scattering dls analysis was carried out with malvern zetasizer nano zs to determine the zif 8 particle size and the size of oil particles for synthetic high salinity oil emulsion and real produced water each sample was diluted by 1000 times to avoid errors due to multiple light scattering during measurement the sample was sonicated for 10 min and immediately analyzed the analysis was carried out at 25 c in backscattering detection mode with the detector laser beam angle set at 173 the average particle size was determined from a minimum of three dls runs in addition the average zeta potential of sample was evaluated from at least three dls runs using the same instrument 2 7 2 transmission electron microscopy tem the morphology of zif 8 particles was viewed by transmission electron microscopy tem with philips cm12 transmission electron microscope a few drops of zif 8 suspension were first dropped onto the copper grids and left for evaporation the sample was then viewed at an accelerating voltage of 120 kv 2 7 3 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy the zif 8 particles were analyzed via attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy before and after pss coating by using thermo scientific nicolet is10 ftir spectrometer to check the presence of pss coating on zif 8 particle surface the scanning was conducted at a resolution of 4 cm 1 for 32 times from wavenumber of 1600 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 comparison was made between the ftir spectrum of zif 8 particles before and after pss coating to identify the presence of additional peaks associated with pss which would then confirm the successful coating of pss molecules onto zif 8 particle surface 2 7 4 field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem the surface morphology of tfc and tfn membranes was viewed via field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem using fei quanta feg 450 field emission scanning electron microscope before fesem imaging the membrane sample was coated with a layer of gold using quorum technologies ltd sc7620 sputter coater the sample was then viewed at an accelerating voltage of 5 kv 2 7 5 high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem the cross sectional morphology of tfc and tfn membranes was observed via high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem with fei tecnai g2 20 s twin high resolution transmission electron microscope before hrtem imaging the membrane sample was embedded into a uv cured resin block the resin block was subjected to ultramicrotomy thin sectioning at a thickness of 80 nm with leica microsystems em uc7 ultramicrotome the thin sections were finally collected on the copper grids and viewed at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv 2 7 6 water contact angle measurement the surface wettability of tfc and tfn membranes was evaluated via water contact angle measurement by using ramÃ© hart instrument co model 300 contact angle goniometer firstly the membrane sample was taped flatly on a glass slide 10 Î¼l of deionized water was dropped onto the sample surface the image of sessile drop was analyzed using dropimage software to measure the water contact angle for each sample the average water contact angle was evaluated based on the readings from at least five different spots on the sample surface 2 7 7 atomic force microscopy afm atomic force microscopy afm analysis was carried out using park systems xe 100 atomic force microscope to assess the surface roughness of tfc and tfn membranes firstly the membrane sample was cut into a small coupon and taped firmly onto the sample holder afm scanning was then carried out in non contact mode the surface roughness of sample was determined by analyzing the afm image with xei software for each sample a minimum of two different spots were scanned to obtain the average membrane surface roughness 2 7 8 thermogravimetric analysis tga thermogravimetric analysis tga was used to assess the swelling behavior of tfc and tfn membranes under fo filtration test using perkinelmer sta 6000 thermogravimetric analyzer the analysis was performed from 30 c to 400 c by heating at a rate of 5 c min under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen at a flowrate of 10 ml min tga was performed on both tfc and tfn membranes before and after fo filtration test the percent weight loss of sample was then evaluated to verify the presence of water and oil in the sample which indicated the occurrence of swelling phenomenon for that particular membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability study of zif 8 particles in water via pss coating this work intends to introduce zif 8 particles into the tfn membrane via aqueous phase dosing during interfacial polymerization in this context zif 8 particle stability in water is an important factor in ensuring the proper synthesis of tfn membrane hence the zif 8 particles synthesized in section 2 1 were dispersed in water and compared to those that were dispersed in methanol which was the zif 8 synthesis solvent dls analysis was conducted to evaluate the size and zeta potential of zif 8 particles dispersed in both solvents table 4 shows the results obtained from dls analysis the zif 8 particles achieved a stable size of 131 87 nm with low polydispersity index of 0 105 when dispersed in methanol however the zif 8 particle size increased significantly to 2417 90 nm when dispersed in water the sudden and extreme increase in zif 8 particle size strongly suggested the instability of zif 8 particles in water attributed to the agglomeration of some zif 8 particles in water in addition the polydispersity index of zif 8 particles increased substantially from 0 105 to 0 889 when the dispersion solvent was changed from methanol to water again this hinted that zif 8 particle agglomeration occurred in water environment as part of the zif 8 particles agglomerated while some remained dispersed individually a wide range of zif 8 particle size was obtained hence the zif 8 particles became very polydisperse with a high polydispersity index of 0 889 which was close to the maximum value of one in order to understand the nature of zif 8 particle instability in water the zeta potential of zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol and water was compared generally a zeta potential with absolute value of greater than 30 mv indicates a stable dispersion while limited stability is observed for a suspension with absolute zeta potential of below 20 mv 30 31 moreover agglomeration is evident when the absolute zeta potential of a dispersion is lower than 5 mv 30 table 4 shows that the zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol exhibited a zeta potential of 34 60 mv this indicated that the zif 8 particles were sufficiently stable in methanol the positive value of the zeta potential measured was accrued from the zinc ions that were present at the surface of zif 8 particles in contrast the zeta potential of zif 8 particles reduced significantly from 34 60 mv to 6 01 mv when the dispersion solvent was changed from methanol to water the closeness of this value to the empirical threshold of instability absolute value of lower than 5 mv 30 indicated that agglomeration was likely to occur for the zif 8 particles dispersed in water in fact it was unusual for the zif 8 particles to lose their stability to the extent such that the zeta potential changed sign under the change of dispersion solvent hence it was suspected that the zif 8 particles suffered from dissolution in water for instance some zif 8 particles might decay in water starting from the loss of zinc ions at the outer surface of zif 8 particles this would then expose the imidazolate anions in the inner zif 8 framework to possibly lead to a negative value of zeta potential the zif 8 particle agglomeration was then likely to occur due to the possibility of attraction between the zif 8 particles having positively charged zinc ions and negatively charged imidazolate anions at the outer surface respectively in order to verify the occurrence of zif 8 particle degradation in water tem imaging was conducted on the zif 8 particles dispersed in both methanol and water fig 1 displays the tem images of zif 8 particles dispersed in different solvents fig 1 a depicts that the zif 8 particles preserved their roughly spherical shape in methanol with a well defined boundary between individual zif 8 particles however after changing the dispersion solvent to water the zif 8 particles began to experience dissolution as highlighted by the red circles in fig 1 b some zif 8 particles were no longer spherical in shape and had a highly irregular surface morphology this indicated that the zif 8 particles already lost their framework structure and crystallinity hence they were no longer suitable for tfn membrane synthesis the dissolution of zif 8 particles in water was due to the hydrolysis of zif 8 particle framework by water molecules the hydrolysis of zif 8 particles is illustrated by the chemical equation below where n is the number of zif 8 units that form a zif 8 particle while m is the number of zif 8 units that dissolve in water 23 by le chatelier s principle the hydrolysis of zif 8 particles is inhibited by the zif 8 precursors zinc ions and 2 methylimidazole in water however since the zif 8 particles were dispersed in pure water without any precursors the zif 8 particles were highly susceptible to hydrolysis by water molecules the dissolution of zif 8 particles in aqueous solution had also been observed in the work of zhang et al 23 meanwhile the zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol did not suffer from any degradation as the hydrolysis was prevented by the non dissociable nature of methanol this was unlike water molecule which dissociates readily into h and oh ions during hydrolysis step zn 2 mim 2 n 2m h2o zn 2 mim 2 n m 2m oh m zn2 2m h2 mim both dls analysis and tem imaging unequivocally confirmed that the zif 8 particles degraded and thus were unstable in water therefore prior to using the zif 8 particles for tfn membrane synthesis it is necessary to stabilize the zif 8 particles against dissolution in water in this work pss coating was introduced to modify the surface of zif 8 particles in order to stabilize them in water it is believed that pss which is an anionic polymer can impart water stability to the zif 8 particles via electrosteric stabilization the pss coating was carried out using a number of coating solvents with varying composition of methanol and water similarly dls analysis and tem imaging were performed to assess the stability of zif 8 particles after pss coating the results of dls analysis are shown in table 5 it was important to first confirm the successful coating of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface since methanol had been proven to produce a stable zif 8 suspension the zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol were first analyzed it was noted during the preparation of pss coating solvent that pss had poor solubility in pure methanol some solid pss still remained in the coating solution during the coating process hence methanol was not a suitable coating solvent for performing the pss coating of zif 8 particles in contrast pss dissolved excellently in pure water hence water was an ideal solvent for the pss coating of zif 8 particles in fact pss molecules were successfully adsorbed onto the surface of zif 8 particles as suggested by the negative zeta potential in table 5 the change of zeta potential from 34 60 mv table 4 to 14 56 mv table 5 indicated that the zinc ions at the surface of zif 8 particles had been coated with the negatively charged pss molecules unfortunately the zif 8 particle size and its polydispersity index increased tremendously after the pss coating this suggested that zif 8 particle agglomeration still occurred it was deduced that the zif 8 particle aggregation was not due to the instability of zif 8 particles in methanol as methanol was generally a good solvent to disperse zif 8 particles and their zeta potential still suggested moderate stability instead zif 8 particle agglomeration occurred during the coating process as discussed earlier the zif 8 particles were unstable in water hence during pss coating it was impossible to totally avoid the contact between zif 8 particles and water as a result some zif 8 particles degraded and agglomerated during the coating process up to this point it is clear that a balance must be attained between methanol and water in order to achieve successful pss coating of zif 8 particles in particular the coating solvent should contain some methanol to maintain the stability of zif 8 particles during pss coating at the same time the coating solvent should also contain sufficient water to aid the dissolution of pss which was necessary to conduct successful coating procedure hence the pss coating of zif 8 particles was further carried out using methanol water mixture with 75 vol and 50 vol of methanol as the coating solvent from table 5 by gradually increasing the methanol content in coating solvent from pure water the zif 8 particles showed an increasingly negative zeta potential this proved that a better adsorption of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface occurred which resulted in the improved zif 8 particle stability in methanol hence a more effective coating process was achieved by using methanol water as the coating solvent instead of pure solvent besides the zif 8 particle size and its polydispersity index decreased significantly to almost similar order of magnitude as those of the zif 8 particles before pss coating table 4 hence the zif 8 particle dissolution and agglomeration were successfully minimized after the coating process nevertheless it was not surprising that the zif 8 particles became larger after pss coating due to the pss polymer brush surrounding the original zif 8 particles the dls results for methanol dispersion of zif 8 particles had proven the successful coating of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface as well as promising zif 8 particle stability after pss coating it was then crucial to evaluate the zif 8 particle stability in water as shown in table 5 by using pure water as the coating solvent large zif 8 particle size and high polydispersity index were observed this suggested severe zif 8 particle agglomeration as postulated previously besides the near zero zeta potential indicated extremely poor zif 8 particle stability in water due to the zif 8 particle degradation and agglomeration in water during pss coating most of the zif 8 particles already lost their stability despite the apparent successful pss coating shown by the dls results for methanol dispersion of zif 8 particles however upon introducing methanol into the coating solvent table 5 shows a similar trend for both methanol and aqueous dispersion of zif 8 particles with a gradually decreasing zif 8 particle size and polydispersity index as well as an increasingly negative zeta potential again these results confirmed the improved pss adsorption onto the zif 8 particle surface and thus enhanced zif 8 particle stability in water in fact the size and zeta potential of zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol and water almost converged after pss coating with the coating solvent of 75 vol methanol water this indicated that the pss coating process had stabilized the zif 8 particles sufficiently in both methanol and water from table 5 75 vol methanol water coating solvent resulted in the best pss coating condition since the pss coated zif 8 particles exhibited the best stability and minimal particle agglomeration however dls analysis could only prove the successful pss coating implicitly hence the zif 8 particles were analyzed via tem and atr ftir to confirm the adsorption of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface by comparing the tem images in fig 2 a and b black dots were found to be scattered randomly across the surface of zif 8 particles after pss coating indeed the black dots were the coated pss molecules in their coil up form hence the zif 8 particles were successfully coated with pss molecules the pss coating could be further verified by comparing the ftir spectrum of zif 8 particles before and after pss coating as shown in fig 3 an additional absorption peak was found to appear at 1038 cm 1 after pss coating indeed this absorption peak is associated to the soh and in plane vibration of the aromatic ring of sulfonate group in pss structure 32 34 therefore ftir analysis again confirmed that pss had been coated successfully onto the zif 8 particle surface this in turn imparted water stability to the zif 8 particles the pss coated zif 8 particles could then be utilized for tfn membrane development via aqueous phase dosing 3 2 tfn membrane synthesis with pss coated zif 8 particles the influence of pss coated zif 8 particles on the tfn membrane morphology and separation properties was investigated in this section two tfn membranes were synthesized by incorporating pss coated and uncoated zif 8 particles into the membrane by aqueous phase dosing during interfacial polymerization a tfc membrane was also synthesized as the control membrane for comparison the surface and cross sectional morphology of all membranes are depicted in fig 4 fig 4 a left shows that the tfc membrane had a typical ridge and valley surface morphology similar ridge and valley surface structure was also observed for the tfn membrane containing pss coated zif 8 particles tfn zif pss as shown in fig 4 b left however with the introduction of uncoated zif 8 particles the surface morphology of tfn membrane changed from ridge and valley structure to elongated leaf like feature that was sparsely distributed across the membrane surface fig 4 c left this meant that the tfn membrane containing uncoated zif 8 particles tfn zif had a significantly looser surface than both tfc and tfn zif pss membranes in addition the cross sectional morphology of all three membranes was also different fig 4 a right illustrates a smooth and thin polyamide film with thickness of about 250 nm for tfc membrane the thin polyamide film was resulted from the high mpd concentration employed in tfc membrane synthesis as reported in the previous work 35 however the integration of pss coated zif 8 particles increased the polyamide film thickness significantly to roughly 1050 nm as depicted in fig 4 b right meanwhile tfn zif membrane possessed a polyamide film with thickness of roughly 280 nm fig 4 c right which was similar to that of tfc membrane apart from film thickness difference the tfn membrane generally had a rougher surface than the tfc membrane regardless of the type of zif 8 particles added as shown in the right images of fig 4 this was proven by afm analysis which showed surface roughness of 0 273 Î¼m and 0 227 Î¼m for tfn zif and tfn zif pss membranes but 0 146 Î¼m for tfc membrane the substantial difference in the surface and cross sectional structure of tfc tfn zif and tfn zif pss membranes indicated that the interfacial polymerization of tfn membrane was influenced strongly by the pss coating of zif 8 particles in the typical interfacial polymerization of tfc membrane only a narrow miscibility zone existed due to the very low solubility of tmc in aqueous phase 36 as such mpd had to diffuse across the growing polyamide film to the organic phase for reaction with tmc to sustain the polyamide film growth however the miscibility zone widened substantially with the use of pss coated zif 8 particles in preparing the tfn zif pss membrane in essence pss molecule is of amphiphilic nature due to the presence of both long hydrophobic organic polystyrene moiety and hydrophilic inorganic sulfonate group in its structure hence the pss coated zif 8 particles could act like a surfactant to improve the miscibility between aqueous and organic phase during interfacial polymerization 37 the wider miscibility zone allowed tmc to diffuse freely into it to react with mpd for polyamide film growth 38 as a result a significantly thicker polyamide film was formed for tfn zif pss membrane fig 4 b right compared to tfc membrane fig 4 a right the substantial increase of polyamide film thickness gave rise to the significant increase of cocl crosslinking sites in the reaction zone however there was insufficient mpd to react with the large quantity of cocl crosslinking sites hence the crosslinking degree or the density of tfn zif pss membrane was lower than that of tfc membrane the wider miscibility zone was further confirmed as the pss coated zif 8 particles were found to reside not only inside the polyamide matrix but also near to the surface of tfn zif pss membrane as highlighted in fig 4 b right meanwhile the dissolution of uncoated zif 8 particles in water released plenty of zif 8 residues as the zif 8 residues were partitioned into the organic phase together with mpd they became obstacles inside the narrow miscibility zone this prevented mpd and tmc from contacting with each other effectively for polyamide film growth hence tfn zif membrane fig 4 c right had a significantly thinner polyamide film than tfn zif pss membrane fig 4 b right the zif 8 residues also obstructed mpd from contacting effectively with the cocl crosslinking sites in the polyamide film this led to a significantly lower crosslinking degree for tfn zif membrane compared to both tfc and tfn zif pss membranes hence it was not surprising that tfn zif membrane fig 4 c left possessed a much looser surface than both tfc membrane fig 4 a left and tfn zif pss membrane fig 4 b left the influence of pss coated zif 8 particles on tfn membrane formation is further manifested in the substantially contrasting membrane separation properties for water and nacl as illustrated in fig 5 from the perspective of water transport tfn zif pss membrane had a pure water permeability comparable to that of tfc membrane although its polyamide film was substantially thicker than that of tfc membrane theoretically a thicker polyamide film is not favorable for water transport due to higher transport resistance besides due to the thicker polyamide film the zif 8 particles remained embedded in the polyamide film as shown in fig 4 b right this negated the effectiveness of zif 8 particles in improving the water transport via hydrophilicity originating from their charged nature this indicated that other factors were responsible for the significantly lower water transport resistance within the polyamide film embedded with pss coated zif 8 particles firstly the zif 8 particles provided a preferential less tortuous pathway for water transport via their crystalline pore network compared to the denser polyamide film besides tfn zif pss membrane was looser than tfc membrane due to its lower crosslinking degree moreover nanogaps were unavoidable at the interface between polyamide and zif 8 particles as a result of the electrostatic repulsion between them this interaction arose because both polyamide film and zif 8 particles were negatively charged as proven in the previous work 35 and table 5 respectively principally nanogaps are interfacial voids that provide additional pathways for water transport 39 hence all these factors worked together to overcome the polyamide film thickness increment in governing the water transport this explained the similar pure water permeability between tfc and tfn zif pss membranes meanwhile nanogaps are non selective by nature and thus also allowed nacl to pass through them easily 40 this coupled with the looser polyamide film to negate the molecular sieving effect brought by the crystalline framework of zif 8 particles as a result nacl rejection decreased slightly for tfn zif pss membrane compared to tfc membrane on the other hand tfn zif membrane showed 21 1 higher pure water permeability and 32 8 reduction in nacl rejection compared to tfc membrane here polyamide film thickness did not play a major role in controlling the water transport since tfn zif and tfc membranes had a similar polyamide film thickness however tfn zif membrane had a much lower crosslinking degree than tfc membrane the significantly looser polyamide film thus improved the water transport of tfn zif membrane over tfc membrane meanwhile the uncoated zif 8 particles could no longer perform molecular sieving attributed to the loss of crystalline framework and aperture size under degradation by water this combined with the much looser polyamide film aforementioned to result in a severe drop in nacl rejection for tfn zif membrane compared to tfc membrane 3 3 tfn membrane synthesis under the aid of tea during interfacial polymerization section 3 2 demonstrates that it was essential to incorporate pss coated zif 8 particles in order to obtain a tfn membrane with better separation properties however tfn zif pss membrane still had a similar water permeability as tfc membrane fig 5 as discussed in section 3 2 this was due to the thicker polyamide film fig 4 b right which culminated in a very high water transport resistance and masked the possible water transport improvement induced by zif 8 hydrophilicity hence this section aims to reduce the polyamide film thickness by introducing tea as an acid acceptor during interfacial polymerization theoretically tea helps to remove the hydrogen chloride formed during interfacial polymerization which then promotes further reaction 25 26 it is postulated that tea can help to promote polyamide film crosslinking to induce diffusion controlled polyamide film growth thus reducing the polyamide film thickness a tfc membrane was also synthesized with the use of tea during interfacial polymerization to assess the lone effect of tea on polyamide film formation fig 6 depicts the surface and cross sectional morphology of tfc and tfn membranes synthesized with and without the use of tea during interfacial polymerization all membranes exhibited a ridge and valley surface morphology however the ridge and valley structure was loosened up slightly by using tea during interfacial polymerization for both tfc and tfn membranes meanwhile tea brought different changes to the cross sectional morphology of tfc and tfn membranes for tfc membrane a thicker polyamide film 350 nm with much rougher surface was formed by introducing tea during interfacial polymerization in contrast for tfn membrane the polyamide film thickness reduced from 1050 nm to 450 nm by using tea during polyamide film formation the contrasting trend of tfc and tfn membranes as well as the discrepancy between the experimental observation and postulation merited further investigation on the role of tea in governing the polyamide film formation in this study mpd was used as the amine monomer for polyamide film formation it is known that among the many amine monomers used for interfacial polymerization mpd has a relatively much higher partitioning ability into the organic phase 41 however by introducing tea in aqueous phase monomer solution for tfc membrane synthesis the partitioning ability of mpd decreased due to the competition and inhibition by tea 26 41 42 this lowered the amount of mpd that partitioned into the organic phase thus although tea could promote a faster reaction the lower amount of mpd indicated that less cocl crosslinking sites in the polyamide film were reacted by mpd hence the crosslinking degree of polyamide film for tfc tea membrane was slightly lower than that of tfc membrane mpd could then diffuse across the looser polyamide film more easily to participate in further polyamide film growth however owing to the inhibiting effect of tea on mpd the quantity of mpd available for polyamide film growth was limited as a result a slightly thicker polyamide film was formed for tfc tea membrane fig 6 b right compared to tfc membrane fig 6 a right since tea also promoted tmc hydrolysis 25 26 as the reaction progressed only little unhydrolyzed tmc remained for reaction at random locations on the membrane surface this explained the much rougher surface for tfc tea membrane fig 6 b right compared to tfc membrane fig 6 a right the non uniformity of membrane synthesized with the use of tea had also been reported in the literature 26 42 the tmc hydrolysis also reduced the crosslinking degree at the polyamide film surface 25 26 consequently tfc tea membrane fig 6 b left had a looser polyamide film surface than tfc membrane fig 6 a left meanwhile for tfn membrane synthesis it was discussed earlier that pss coated zif 8 particles widened the miscibility zone by virtue of the amphiphilic nature of pss in spite of this mpd was unable to occupy fully the wide miscibility zone to take part in reaction firstly tea restricted the amount of mpd that partitioned into the miscibility zone in addition the mpd that entered the miscibility zone was quickly reacted off due to the faster reaction promoted by tea hence most of the mpd was consumed for crosslinking reaction near the bottom of polyamide film instead of polyamide film growth which required tmc to diffuse across the wide miscibility zone in order to contact with mpd for reaction consequently the crosslinking degree of the bottom part of polyamide film increased rapidly this subsequently restricted mpd diffusion across the polyamide film for further reaction hence a significantly thinner polyamide film was formed for tfn tea zif pss membrane fig 6 d right than tfn zif pss membrane fig 6 c right the thinner polyamide film also allowed the zif 8 particles to protrude from the surface of tfn tea zif pss membrane as highlighted in fig 6 d right this was in contrast to tfn zif pss membrane fig 6 c right where the zif 8 particles remained embedded within the thicker polyamide film despite being able to diffuse deep into the miscibility zone moreover the inhibited mpd diffusion and tmc hydrolysis induced by tea lowered the crosslinking degree at the polyamide film surface hence tfn tea zif pss membrane fig 6 d left had a looser surface than tfn zif pss membrane fig 6 c left the use of tea in interfacial polymerization imparted substantial changes to the tfc and tfn membrane morphology and thus altered their separation properties as shown in fig 7 for tfc membrane the pure water permeability increased by 90 1 with the use of tea in membrane synthesis although the polyamide film of tfc tea membrane fig 6 b right was slightly thicker than that of tfc membrane fig 6 a right the polyamide film also had a lower crosslinking degree relative to that of tfc membrane besides tfc tea membrane fig 6 b right had a much rougher polyamide film surface than tfc membrane fig 6 a right as analyzed by afm the surface roughness of tfc tea membrane 0 382 Î¼m was 161 2 higher than the surface roughness of tfc membrane 0 146 Î¼m this improved the membrane surface wettability significantly as proven by its much lower water contact angle 34 8 2 6 compared to tfc membrane 65 5 2 4 this coupled with the looser polyamide film to overcome the polyamide film thickness increment in improving the water transport hence the pure water permeability of tfc tea membrane was significantly higher than that of tfc membrane meanwhile the nacl rejection of tfc tea membrane reduced by 2 5 compared to tfc membrane this was due to the formation of polyamide film with lower crosslinking degree which diminished its molecular sieving ability the improvement of pure water permeability with the use of tea was even higher for tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane as shown in fig 7 as illustrated in fig 6 c and d right a significantly thinner polyamide film was formed for tfn tea zif pss membrane compared to tfn zif pss membrane besides the zif 8 particles provided a less tortuous pathway for water transport as discussed earlier more importantly plenty of zif 8 particles were found to protrude from the membrane surface in fig 6 d right this meant that zif 8 hydrophilicity could now play its role effectively in impacting the water transport a rougher tfn membrane surface was also resulted by the protruding zif 8 as proven by the increase in surface roughness from 0 227 Î¼m tfn zif pss membrane to 0 253 Î¼m tfn tea zif pss membrane with the use of tea this coupled with zif 8 hydrophilicity to improve the membrane hydrophilicity as proven by the lower water contact angle of tfn tea zif pss membrane 56 4 2 7 compared to tfn zif pss membrane 64 7 3 0 the thinner and more hydrophilic polyamide film as well as the lower tortuosity of zif 8 particles ensured that the water transport was significantly improved as shown by the much higher pure water permeability for tfn tea zif pss membrane than tfn zif pss membrane meanwhile the nacl rejection remained similar regardless of whether tea was used in tfn membrane synthesis although the presence of nanogaps at the interface between polyamide and zif 8 particles was expected this was offset by the higher crosslinking degree of polyamide film for tfn tea zif pss membrane compared to tfn zif pss membrane hence the overall molecular sieving effect of tfn tea zif pss and tfn zif pss membranes was similar this explained the similar nacl rejection between both tfn membranes synthesized in short the use of tea in interfacial polymerization helped in improving the water transport of both tfc and tfn membranes specifically for tfn membrane synthesis the use of tea allowed the pss coated zif 8 particles to protrude from the membrane surface hence the water transport improvement induced by zif 8 hydrophilicity and polyamide film roughness could be effectively realized this allowed the tfn membrane to eventually outperform the tfc membrane in achieving higher pure water permeability while attaining only minimal loss in nacl rejection at the same time in view of the better performance of tfn membrane synthesized using tea in interfacial polymerization this membrane was selected for the fo treatment of high salinity oil emulsion in the subsequent section 3 4 fo treatment of high salinity oil emulsion using tfn membrane in this section the tfn membrane synthesized with the use of tea during interfacial polymerization was tested for the fo treatment of synthetic high salinity oil emulsion as well as real produced water the tfc membrane synthesized with the use of tea during interfacial polymerization was also tested as the control membrane for comparison apart from synthetic and real oil emulsion pure water and synthetic seawater were also run to assess the influence of the increasingly complex feed content on the fo performance of tfn membrane the fo flux of different feed solutions is shown in fig 8 for both tfc and tfn membranes the trend in fig 8 could be explained by the varying content of feed solutions as well as the interaction between the feed contents and membrane the highest fo flux was achieved by pure water for both tfc and tfn membranes principally the driving force of fo flux is the osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution and feed solution with a higher osmotic pressure difference giving higher fo flux 28 since the draw solution was freshly prepared and fixed at 1 l of aqueous nacl solution at a concentration of 1 m for every fo run the osmotic pressure of draw solution was similar for every fo run hence the fo flux was governed by the osmotic pressure of feed solution by using pure water as the feed zero osmotic pressure was contributed by the feed solution this maximized the osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution and feed solution hence pure water demonstrated the highest fo flux among the three feed solutions regardless of the type of membrane tested nevertheless the fo flux of pure water was still different between the tfc and tfn membranes as shown in fig 8 the tfn membrane consistently had a higher fo flux than the tfc membrane throughout the whole fo filtration run indeed this result matched with the finding in fig 7 whereby the tfn membrane had a higher pure water permeability than the tfc membrane as discussed earlier the enhancement of water transport for tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane was mainly attributed to the increased hydrophilicity and surface roughness induced by the zif 8 particles protruding from the membrane surface in addition fig 8 depicts that stable fo pure water flux could only be achieved by tfn membrane but not tfc membrane which showed an increasing fo pure water flux with time this was theorized to be due to the swelling of membrane by water during fo filtration and would be discussed in detail later meanwhile after changing the feed from pure water to synthetic seawater the fo flux decreased significantly by an average of 75 2 for both tfc and tfn membranes by using synthetic seawater as the feed the seasalts dissolved in water created osmotic pressure in the feed solution this reduced the osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution and feed solution significantly by taking the specification of seasalts used as the basis for calculation the synthetic seawater feed resulted in 57 5 loss of osmotic pressure difference compared to pure water feed with such substantial loss of fo driving force it was thus not surprising that the fo flux decreased severely after switching the feed solution from pure water to synthetic seawater regardless of the type of membrane tested however it is noted that the degree of loss of fo driving force 57 5 was still lower than the degree of fo flux reduction 75 2 by average this difference was due to the two unavoidable phenomena in a typical fo process using an asymmetric membrane reverse salt flux and icp in essence both reverse salt flux and icp further reduce the driving force and thus fo flux such scenarios were not accounted for the loss of fo driving force which was calculated based on the bulk concentration of feed and draw solutions prepared hence the actual loss of fo driving force was underestimated resulting in the disparity between the predicted and actual degree of fo flux reduction moving onto synthetic high salinity oil emulsion feed fig 8 displays a dissimilar fo flux between tfc and tfn membranes for tfc membrane the fo flux of oil emulsion was initially lower than that of synthetic seawater however it gradually increased and converged at almost similar value as the fo flux of synthetic seawater at the end of fo filtration run the increasing fo flux of tfc membrane with time was also observed previously for pure water feed this was due to the swelling of tfc membrane by water and oil emulsion hexadecane as water diffused into the polyamide film during fo filtration of pure water the free volume of membrane increased to accommodate water inside its matrix 43 45 hence more water pathways appeared in the polyamide film over time which gradually increased the fo flux of pure water meanwhile the rate of flux increment was found to be even higher for synthetic oil emulsion feed 0 020 l m2 h min than pure water feed 0 014 l m2 h min by comparing the slope for the linear best fit line of fo flux of both feeds this meant that membrane swelling was more significant with the presence of hexadecane in this work the hexadecane had been emulsified by triton x 100 surfactant this helped in improving the miscibility between the polyamide film and hexadecane resulting in the dissolution of hexadecane into the polyamide network hence the emulsified hexadecane exacerbated the swelling of tfc membrane that already occurred while running pure water feed as a result the tfc membrane experienced an even higher degree of swelling for oil emulsion feed compared to pure water feed swelling of polyamide membrane by oil emulsion had also been reported by past studies 46 49 in contrast the tfn membrane did not show any swelling as indicated by its stable fo flux for both pure water and synthetic oil emulsion feed in fig 8 this was attributed to the rigidification of polyamide matrix by zif 8 particles via their solid and crystalline framework which restricted the significant movement of polyamide chains the stiffening of membrane under the presence of zif 8 particles had also been reported by others 50 52 besides the charged zif 8 particles at the membrane surface further prevented the membrane solvation by hexadecane consequently the tfn membrane had a better resistance against swelling by both water and oil emulsion compared to the tfc membrane in order to verify the occurrence of membrane swelling tga was carried out on both tfc and tfn membranes before and after fo filtration run the tga profiles of all membranes are depicted in fig 9 from fig 9 a by increasing the temperature of tga to 350 c a weight difference was found between the tfc membrane before and after fo filtration run this was caused by both evaporation of water and oil emulsion that swelled the membrane during fo filtration in contrast the tga profile in fig 9 b shows no difference for the tfn membrane before and after fo filtration run this proved that the tfn membrane did not experience any swelling during fo filtration therefore tga successfully confirmed the improved swelling resistance of tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane meanwhile the substantial weight loss from 350 c onwards in both fig 9 a and b was due to the thermal degradation of tfc and tfn membrane respectively up to now it has been proven that the tfn membrane had a better resistance against swelling by water and oil emulsion compared to tfc membrane both membranes were then tested for the fo filtration of real produced water to reflect their capability in treating the oil emulsion fig 10 shows the fo flux of both tfc and tfn membranes by using real produced water as the feed similar to fig 8 the tfc membrane depicted an increasing fo flux with time while the tfn membrane demonstrated a stable fo flux in running real produced water feed again this proved the role of oil emulsion in inducing membrane swelling as well as the better swelling resistance of tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane nevertheless it was unfair to directly compare the fo flux between synthetic oil emulsion and real produced water owing to the much different feed properties including salinity and oil concentration therefore the fo performance of both oil emulsion feeds is summarized in table 6 together with their feed conditions to better illustrate the capability of both tfc and tfn membranes in treating such feeds using fo process it should be noted that the real produced water had a lower salinity than the synthetic oil emulsion this meant that using real produced water as the feed led to a lower loss of fo driving force hence it was not surprising that the fo flux of real produced water was higher than that of synthetic oil emulsion the real produced water also had a lower oil concentration than the synthetic oil emulsion this suggested that the tfc membrane should suffer from less severe swelling when it was brought into contact with the real produced water compared to the synthetic oil emulsion indeed this was proven by the rate of flux increment of tfc membrane for both oil emulsion feeds from table 6 changing the feed from synthetic oil emulsion to real produced water decreased the rate of flux increment by 21 6 from 0 020 l m2 h min to 0 016 l m2 h min the degree of reduction was indeed comparable to the degree of reduction of feed oil concentration 24 4 with the change of feed from synthetic oil emulsion to real produced water meanwhile the oil rejection was found to be higher than 99 regardless of the feeds and membranes tested this was because the oil particle size for both synthetic oil emulsion and real produced water table 6 was in nanometer range which was significantly larger than either the typical free volume size of polyamide film 1 nm 53 or the aperture size of zif 8 particles 0 34 nm 54 hence it was virtually impossible for the oil particles to penetrate through the membrane and high oil rejection was achieved by both membranes as discussed earlier icp and reverse salt flux are two phenomena in fo process that are detrimental to the fo flux these two parameters were also evaluated to better characterize the overall fo process performance principally icp reduces the effective fo driving force due to development of draw solute concentration profile inside the porous membrane support as a result of draw solute transport resistance across it by theory the degree of icp is indicated by the structural parameter of support membrane with a higher structural parameter indicating more severe icp the structural parameter of psf support membrane in this work was 2 565 mm this value was compared to that of other literature in table 7 the structural parameter in this work was found to be higher than that of most literature indicating serious icp during fo process this meant that the psf support membrane used in this work still gave relatively high resistance to nacl diffusion across it hence its structure should be further optimized in future work to lower down the level of icp for increased fo flux meanwhile reverse salt flux refers to the diffusion of draw solute from draw solution to feed solution this also reduces the effective driving force and thus deteriorates the fo flux by theory higher reverse salt flux is undesirable as it limits the attainable fo flux the reverse salt flux of tfc and tfn membranes was calculated to be 0 259 mol m2 h and 0 494 mol m2 h respectively the higher reverse salt flux of tfn membrane was attributed to its poorer ability in retaining nacl compared to tfc membrane as a result of the presence of nanogaps in tfn membrane this was consistent with the nacl rejection of both membranes as shown in fig 7 88 6 for tfc membrane but 87 9 for tfn membrane the reverse salt flux of tfc and tfn membranes in this work was again much higher than that of most literature as depicted in table 7 hence the fo flux achieved by the tfc and tfn membranes in this work in treating the produced water was strongly diminished in short the higher reverse salt flux of tfn membrane as well as the severe icp in fo process had restricted the fo flux improvement of tfn membrane in this work for produced water treatment in spite of this the tfn membrane still outperformed the tfc membrane in terms of fo water flux more importantly the tfn membrane exhibited improved swelling resistance against oil emulsion than the tfc membrane which is important in developing a membrane for long term produced water treatment therefore the tfn membrane developed in this work serves as a platform for further improvement in future work specifically future work can be aimed at reducing the reverse salt flux by improving the formation of polyamide film for higher nacl selectivity in addition further study on psf support membrane synthesis can be carried out to optimize its structure and reduce the degree of icp in fo process by doing so the improvement of tfn membrane in this work can be further maximized for the treatment of produced water 4 conclusions in this work a tfn membrane incorporated with pss coated zif 8 particles was synthesized to improve the membrane water permeability and swelling resistance the self synthesized zif 8 particles in this work demonstrated poor stability in water however after coating with pss the zif 8 particles became stable in water due to electrosteric stabilization the pss coated zif 8 particles allowed the proper formation of tfn membrane with similar water permeability and nacl rejection as the tfc membrane in contrast the tfn membrane containing uncoated zif 8 particles was very poorly crosslinked and thus could only achieve a low nacl rejection of 61 1 by further introducing tea as an acid acceptor during interfacial polymerization the tfn membrane having pss coated zif 8 particles possessed 116 2 higher pure water permeability with comparable nacl rejection as the tfn membrane synthesized without tea this was due to the formation of a thinner and rougher polyamide film as well as the protruding of hydrophilic and less tortuous zif 8 particles from membrane surface the tfn membrane also demonstrated better swelling resistance against both water and oil emulsion compared to the tfc membrane attributed to the rigidification of polyamide matrix by zif 8 particles and the charged nature of zif 8 particles respectively the chemically stable tfn membrane was able to reject more than 99 of oil particles from both synthetic oil emulsion and real produced water with a stable fo flux up to 90 min of filtration time acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the financial support provided by ministry of energy science

14153,the generation of large volume of produced water necessitates a chemically stable membrane with high water permeability for the removal of oil emulsion in this work a zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif 8 based thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane with improved pure water permeability and chemical stability was developed it was found that poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss coating could stabilize the zif 8 particles against dissolution in water this subsequently allowed the proper formation of tfn membrane with comparable separation properties as the thin film composite tfc membrane with the further use of triethylamine tea as an acid acceptor in interfacial polymerization the pure water permeability of tfn membrane improved significantly over both tfc and tfn membranes synthesized without tea with minimal loss in nacl rejection the enhanced water transport of tfn membrane was further manifested by the higher flux of tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane in forward osmosis fo filtration of both synthetic high salinity oil emulsion and real produced water in addition due to the chemically stable zif 8 particles the tfn membrane was demonstrated to have a better swelling resistance against produced water than the tfc membrane keywords produced water thin film nanocomposite membrane zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate triethylamine 1 introduction the increase of oil and gas exploration in the past century has witnessed the generation of large volume of high salinity oil emulsion wastewater known as produced water 1 4 the environmental concern on the discharge of produced water has gradually led to global attention on produced water treatment in this context membrane technology such as forward osmosis fo is a promising alternative in treating produced water 1 5 fo offers unrivalled benefits over other membrane processes such as lower energy demand 3 and lower fouling propensity 6 9 thin film composite tfc membrane is a typical membrane used in fo process due to the need for a dense rejection layer to minimize the loss of draw solute from draw solution to feed solution in view of the huge volume of global produced water generated daily substantial research effort has been focused on improving the water flux of tfc membrane one of the methods in enhancing membrane water transport is the development of thin film nanocomposite tfn membrane pioneered by hoek et al 10 this technique involves the incorporation of nanomaterial such as zeolite 11 13 and carbon nanotubes 14 16 into the polyamide rejection layer the nanomaterial can be introduced either via aqueous or organic reactive phase during interfacial polymerization generally it is reported that the nanomaterial improves the tfn membrane water flux without sacrificing the salt rejection 11 15 16 however it has been found that nanomaterial agglomeration occurs easily at high loading due to its poor interaction with polyamide matrix thus creating membrane defects 11 13 15 in view of this metal organic framework mof has been suggested as an alternative nanofiller to promote its better interaction with polyamide zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 zif 8 a type of mof has been increasingly used in preparing the tfn membrane 17 19 this is due to its aperture size of 3 4 Ã¥ which is between the size of typical hydrated salt ions 6 6 8 6 Ã¥ 20 and the size of water molecules 2 7 Ã¥ 11 making it an ideal molecular sieve for water separation zif 8 also demonstrates excellent chemical stability against hydrocarbon which can be found in produced water 21 however it has been reported recently that zif 8 demonstrates poor stability in water 22 23 liu et al discovered that the zif 8 crystalline framework was lost after its hydrothermal treatment with water 22 similar finding was also reported by zhang et al where the zif 8 was hydrolyzed by water to cause its dissolution in water 23 this indicated that the zif 8 had lost its aperture size and could no longer serve as a molecular sieve the poor zif 8 stability in water thus challenges the development of zif 8 based tfn membrane via aqueous phase dosing several works have been carried out to improve the zif 8 stability in water by substituting the 2 methylimidazole ligands at the zif 8 outer surface with a more hydrophobic imidazole ligand such as 5 6 dimethylbenzimidazole 22 24 in both studies the zif 8 framework and crystallinity were successfully retained in water after the surface ligand exchange process thus preserving the zif 8 stability in water 22 24 apart from tfn membrane development the use of acid acceptor such as triethylamine tea in interfacial polymerization has also been studied for enhancement of membrane water transport in essence hydrogen chloride is formed as a byproduct in interfacial polymerization it is widely accepted that tea helps to remove the hydrogen chloride to drive further reaction 25 26 hence tea can promote polyamide film crosslinking to induce diffusion controlled polyamide film growth this then reduces the polyamide film thickness to improve membrane water transport the increase of membrane water flux with the use of tea has been reported in other study 26 tea also brings other benefit besides water transport improvement van goethem et al produced a zif 8 based tfn membrane and found that zif 8 was degraded by the hydrogen chloride generated during interfacial polymerization 27 however this was successfully overcome with the use of tea which removed the hydrogen chloride from system thus preventing the zif 8 degradation and preserving its molecular sieving ability 27 the objective of this study is to develop a zif 8 based tfn membrane with high water permeability for fo treatment of high salinity oil emulsion wastewater in view of the zif 8 instability in water this work introduces the coating of poly sodium 4 styrenesulfonate pss an anionic polymer onto the zif 8 particle surface as an electrosteric stabilizer moreover the use of tea in interfacial polymerization is proposed in developing the tfn membrane this work aims to provide a clearer understanding on the actual role of tea during interfacial polymerization of tfn membrane besides acting as an acid acceptor the tfc and tfn membranes synthesized under the influence of pss coating and tea were then evaluated for their changes in morphology and separation properties lastly the membranes were tested for the treatment of synthetic high salinity oil emulsion wastewater and real produced water using fo process to evaluate their potential in treating oily wastewater 2 experimental 2 1 synthesis of zif 8 particles zif 8 particles were prepared by reacting 2 methylimidazole sigma aldrich and zinc nitrate hexahydrate sigma aldrich reactants both reactants were first dissolved individually in methanol merck to obtain clear reactant solutions having a concentration of 0 4 m and 3 2 m respectively the temperature of reactant solutions was then reduced to 5 c by immersing them in an ice bath after reaching 5 c the zinc nitrate hexahydrate solution was added to the 2 methylimidazole solution at 10 ml each to initiate the reaction under a stirring speed of 250 rpm ice was added to control the ice bath temperature at 5 c after 10 min the reaction mixture was diluted using methanol to 100 ml volume to quench the reaction the reaction mixture was then subjected to 8000 rpm of centrifugation process for 20 min to recover the zif 8 particles next the zif 8 particles were purified via washing with methanol followed by centrifugation the washing and centrifugation process was repeated for two times lastly the zif 8 particles were dispersed in either pure or mixture of methanol and water to obtain zif 8 suspensions for further characterization surface modification by pss or tfn membrane synthesis 2 2 surface modification of zif 8 particles via pss coating the zif 8 particles synthesized in section 2 1 underwent surface modification by pss molecules to improve the zif 8 particle stability in water thus enabling the tfn membrane synthesis via aqueous phase zif 8 dosing during interfacial polymerization a series of pss solutions were first prepared by dissolving 0 4604 g of pss sigma aldrich in different solvents with the composition as listed in table 1 meanwhile the zif 8 particles synthesized in section 2 1 were also dispersed in different solvents with the composition as listed in table 1 via 10 min of sonication upon the final cycle of centrifugation the zif 8 particle suspension was added to the pss solution prepared previously to obtain 50 ml of coating solution the pss coating solution was then stirred for 24 h under a stirring speed of 250 rpm to promote the adsorption of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface after 24 h the pss coated zif 8 particles were recovered via 8000 rpm of centrifugation process for 20 min finally the zif 8 particles were dispersed in deionized water via 10 min of sonication to form a stable suspension for characterization and tfn membrane synthesis 2 3 preparation of polysulfone psf support membrane the polysulfone psf support membrane was prepared via phase inversion process firstly the psf casting dope was prepared by dissolving 16 wt of psf udel p 1700 solvay advanced polymer l l c and 17 wt of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 10 sigma aldrich in n methylpyrrolidone nmp merck the casting dope was stirred for 24 h for homogenization the casting dope was degassed then poured evenly on top of a woven polyester fabric style 0715 dacron fabric texlon corporation on a glass plate at a thickness of 150 Î¼m the glass plate was transferred immediately into a distilled water bath to initiate the phase inversion the membrane casting was performed at room temperature after 24 h the psf support membrane was harvested and stored in deionized water until further use 2 4 synthesis of tfc and tfn membranes a series of tfc and tfn membranes were synthesized in this work in order to evaluate the separation properties and specifically the improvement of membrane water transport under the influence of pss coating of zif 8 particles and the use of tea in interfacial polymerization the synthesis conditions of all membranes are summarized in table 2 the tfc membranes were synthesized by reacting trimesoyl chloride tmc sigma aldrich and m phenylenediamine mpd merck via interfacial polymerization firstly the aqueous phase monomer solution was prepared by dissolving mpd with without tea merck in deionized water milli q meanwhile the organic phase monomer solution was prepared by dissolving tmc in n hexane merck in the meantime the psf support membrane was fixed onto a flat teflon chamber plate the psf support membrane was immersed with mpd solution for 10 min excess mpd solution was then removed from the psf support membrane surface using a rubber roller next the psf support membrane surface was contacted with tmc solution for 60 s the tfc membrane then underwent heat curing treatment in an oven at 60 c for 15 min the tfc membrane was finally dried in air for one day prior to its further use the tfn membranes were synthesized by loading the zif 8 particles into membrane via aqueous phase dosing the tfn membrane synthesis followed the similar protocol as the synthesis of tfc membrane with a slightly different method in preparing the aqueous phase monomer solution firstly mpd was dissolved with without tea in deionized water to form a portion of monomer solution meanwhile the zif 8 particles were prepared separately in the form of an aqueous suspension for uncoated zif 8 particles the particles were dispersed in deionized water via 10 min of sonication after the final cycle of centrifugation at the end of zif 8 particle synthesis section 2 1 for pss coated zif 8 particles the particles were dispersed in deionized water via 10 min of sonication after their recovery from coating solution via centrifugation section 2 2 finally the zif 8 suspension was mixed with the mpd monomer solution with without tea to obtain the aqueous phase monomer solution for interfacial polymerization 2 5 evaluation of membrane reverse osmosis ro separation properties reverse osmosis ro filtration test was performed to assess the separation properties of tfc and tfn membranes pure water permeability and nacl rejection before filtration test the membrane was pretreated to enhance its ro water flux firstly the membrane was immersed in deionized water for 10 min this was followed by its immersion in an ethanol merck water solution at 30 vol ethanol for 24 h finally the membrane was transferred into deionized water for 10 min followed by the immediate filtration experiment the filtration test was carried out at room temperature by using a dead end stirred cell sterlitech hp4750 having an effective membrane area of 14 6 cm2 the membrane was first pressurized for 1 h at 16 5 bar using nitrogen gas after that ro filtration test was conducted under a stirring speed of 350 rpm with two test feeds 18 2 mÏ deionized water milli q and aqueous nacl merck solution at 10 mm concentration for every test feed the process was equilibrated for 30 min before data collection began pure water filtration was conducted at a transmembrane pressure of 7 15 bar with an increment of 2 bar the flux was determined with eq 1 the slope for the linear plot of flux transmembrane pressure was determined as the pure water permeability based on eq 2 1 j w Î´ v a m Î´ t 2 j w a Î´ p where jw is pure water flux l m2 h Î´v is permeate volume l am is effective membrane area m2 Î´t is time h a is pure water permeability l m2 h bar and Î´p is transmembrane pressure bar the filtration of nacl solution was performed at a transmembrane pressure of 15 bar eq 3 was used to determine the nacl rejection both feed and permeate nacl concentrations were determined with a conductivity meter starter 300c ohaus the initial and final feed concentrations were averaged to obtain the bulk feed concentration meanwhile two permeate concentration readings were averaged to obtain the permeate concentration nacl permeability was then determined by eq 4 based on solution diffusion theory the solution osmotic pressure term in eq 4 was estimated by using the van t hoff s equation eq 5 nacl permeability was subsequently used for calculation of fo water flux and structural parameter of psf support membrane which will be described in section 2 6 3 r s 1

performance for the treatment of high salinity oil emulsion the performance of tfc and tfn membranes for the treatment of high salinity oil emulsion was evaluated via fo filtration test the membrane was pretreated using the same protocol as outlined in section 2 5 prior to the fo filtration test to improve the membrane flux fo filtration test was then carried out at room temperature using a crossflow membrane cell assembly sterlitech cf042 having an effective membrane area of 42 cm2 the feed and draw solutions were circulated at a volumetric flow rate of 0 76 l min 12 gph and 0 51 l min 8 gph respectively the feed solution was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer while the mass of draw solution was measured with an electronic balance the fo filtration test was carried out in a countercurrent scheme for 90 min in each run a number of test feeds were run including pure water synthetic seawater 500 ppm synthetic high salinity oil emulsion and real produced water the content of each feed solution is summarized in table 3 for both synthetic oil emulsion and real produced water the feed was sonicated for 5 min followed by instant fo filtration test meanwhile the draw solution used was 1 m of aqueous nacl solution freshly prepared for every change of test feed both feed and draw solutions were prepared at a volume of 1 l for every fo filtration run between two runs of different test feeds both feed and draw solution flow systems were subjected to flushing to remove any trapped solutes in the systems by circulating deionized water through the systems for 15 min the fo flux was determined gravimetrically based on the change of mass of the draw solution as measured by the electronic balance at an interval of 5 s mathematically fo flux is described by eq 6 28 6 j v Î´ v d a m Î´ t Î´ m d Ï f a m Î´ t where jv is fo flux l m2 h Î´vd is change of volume of draw solution l am is effective membrane area m2 Î´t is time h Î´md is change of mass of draw solution g and Ïf is feed solution density g l jv was determined every 5 min based on the slope of the linear plot of Î´vd am against Î´t hence the temporal evolution of fo flux could be evaluated the capability of membrane in retaining oil particles was evaluated by measuring the oil concentration in feed and draw solutions for both synthetic high salinity oil emulsion and real produced water for synthetic oil emulsion the oil concentration was determined with an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer the sample absorbance was measured and converted to the oil concentration via a calibration curve meanwhile for real produced water the oil concentration was determined with a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph the oil rejection was subsequently calculated as similar to eq 3 with only the permeate concentration term replaced by the draw solution concentration instead the reverse salt flux was also calculated reverse salt flux is an indicator of the degree of loss of draw solute from the draw solution to feed solution generally a lower reverse salt flux is desirable to minimize the loss of draw solute and preserve the fo driving force the reverse salt flux was calculated based on the mass balance of draw solute in the draw solution eq 7 using pure water filtration data 7 j s c d i v d i c d f v d f a m Î´ t where js is reverse salt flux mol m2 h cd

icp of fo process in this study the structural parameter was calculated using eq 8 which is derived based on the mass balance of draw solute at the interface between polyamide film and support membrane surface 28 29 pure water filtration data were used for the calculation the structural parameter calculated was compared to that of the literature to check the suitability of psf support

average particle size was determined from a minimum of three dls runs in addition the average zeta potential of sample was evaluated from at least three dls runs using the same instrument 2 7 2 transmission electron microscopy tem the morphology of zif 8 particles was viewed by transmission electron microscopy tem with philips cm12 transmission electron microscope a few drops of zif 8

infrared atr ftir spectroscopy the zif 8 particles were analyzed via attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy before and after pss coating by using thermo scientific nicolet is10 ftir spectrometer to check the presence of pss coating on zif 8 particle surface the scanning was conducted at a resolution of 4 cm 1 for 32 times from wavenumber of 1600 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 comparison was made between the ftir spectrum of zif 8 particles before and after pss coating to identify the presence of additional peaks associated with pss which would then confirm the successful coating of pss molecules onto zif 8 particle surface 2 7 4 field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem the surface morphology of tfc and tfn membranes was viewed via field emission

sections were finally collected on the copper grids and viewed at an accelerating voltage of 200 kv 2 7 6 water contact angle measurement the surface wettability of tfc and tfn membranes was evaluated via water contact angle measurement by using ramÃ© hart instrument co model 300 contact angle goniometer firstly the membrane sample was taped flatly on a glass slide 10 Î¼l of deionized water was dropped onto the sample surface the image of sessile drop was analyzed using dropimage software to measure the water contact angle for each sample the average water contact angle was evaluated based on the readings from at least five different spots on the sample surface 2 7 7 atomic force microscopy afm atomic force microscopy afm analysis was carried out using park systems xe 100 atomic force microscope to assess the surface roughness of tfc and tfn membranes firstly the membrane sample was cut into a small coupon and taped firmly onto the sample holder afm scanning was then carried out in non contact mode the surface roughness of sample was determined by analyzing the afm image with xei software for each sample a minimum of two different spots were scanned to obtain the average membrane surface roughness 2 7 8 thermogravimetric analysis tga thermogravimetric analysis tga was used to assess the swelling behavior of tfc and tfn membranes under fo filtration test using perkinelmer sta 6000 thermogravimetric analyzer the analysis was performed from 30 c to 400 c by heating at a rate of 5 c min under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen at a flowrate of 10 ml min tga was performed on both tfc and tfn membranes before and after fo filtration test the percent weight loss of sample was then evaluated to verify the presence of water and oil in the sample which indicated the occurrence of swelling phenomenon for that particular membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 stability study of zif 8 particles in water via pss coating this work intends to introduce zif 8 particles into the tfn membrane via aqueous phase dosing during interfacial polymerization in this context zif 8 particle stability in water is an important factor in ensuring the proper synthesis of tfn membrane hence the zif 8 particles synthesized in section 2 1 were dispersed in water and compared to those that were dispersed in methanol which was the zif 8 synthesis solvent dls analysis was conducted to evaluate the size and zeta potential of zif 8 particles dispersed in both solvents table 4 shows the results obtained from dls analysis the zif 8 particles achieved a stable size of 131 87 nm with low polydispersity index of 0 105 when dispersed in methanol however the zif 8 particle size increased significantly to 2417 90 nm when dispersed in water the sudden and extreme increase in zif 8 particle size strongly suggested the instability of zif 8 particles in water attributed to the agglomeration of some zif 8 particles in water in addition the polydispersity index of zif 8 particles increased substantially from 0 105 to 0 889 when the dispersion solvent was changed from methanol to water again this hinted that zif 8 particle agglomeration occurred in water environment as part of the zif 8 particles agglomerated while some remained dispersed individually a wide range of zif 8 particle size was obtained hence the zif 8 particles became very polydisperse with a high polydispersity index of 0 889 which was close to the maximum value of one in order to understand the nature of zif 8 particle instability in water the zeta potential of zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol and water was compared generally a zeta potential with absolute value of greater than 30 mv indicates a stable dispersion while limited stability is observed for a suspension with absolute zeta potential of below 20 mv 30 31 moreover agglomeration is evident when the absolute zeta potential of a dispersion is lower than 5 mv 30 table 4 shows that the zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol exhibited a zeta potential of 34 60 mv this indicated that the zif 8 particles were sufficiently stable in methanol the positive value of the zeta potential measured was accrued from the zinc ions that were present at the surface of zif 8 particles in contrast the zeta potential of zif 8 particles reduced significantly from 34 60 mv to 6 01 mv when the dispersion solvent was changed from methanol to water the closeness of this value to the empirical threshold of instability absolute value of lower than 5 mv 30 indicated that agglomeration was likely to occur for the zif 8 particles dispersed in water in fact it was unusual for the zif 8 particles to lose their stability to the extent such that the zeta potential changed sign under the change of dispersion solvent hence it was suspected that the zif 8 particles suffered from dissolution in water for instance some zif 8 particles might decay in water starting from the loss of zinc ions at the outer surface of zif 8 particles this would then expose the imidazolate anions in the inner zif 8 framework to possibly lead to a negative value of zeta potential the zif 8 particle agglomeration was then likely to occur due to the possibility of attraction between the zif 8 particles having positively charged zinc ions and negatively charged imidazolate anions at the outer surface respectively in order to verify the occurrence of zif 8 particle degradation in water tem imaging was conducted on the zif 8 particles dispersed in both methanol and water fig 1 displays the tem images of zif 8 particles dispersed in different solvents fig 1 a depicts that the zif 8 particles preserved their roughly spherical shape in methanol with a well defined boundary between individual zif 8 particles however after changing the dispersion solvent to water the zif 8 particles began to experience dissolution as highlighted by the red circles in fig 1 b some zif 8 particles were no longer spherical in shape and had a highly irregular surface morphology this indicated that the zif 8 particles already lost their framework structure and crystallinity hence they were no longer suitable for tfn membrane synthesis the dissolution of zif 8 particles in water was due to the hydrolysis of zif 8 particle framework by water molecules the hydrolysis of zif 8 particles is illustrated by the chemical equation below where n is the number of zif 8 units that form a zif 8 particle while m is the number of zif 8 units that dissolve in water 23 by le chatelier s principle the hydrolysis of zif 8 particles is inhibited by the zif 8 precursors zinc ions and 2 methylimidazole in water however since the zif 8 particles were dispersed in pure water without any precursors the zif 8 particles were highly susceptible to hydrolysis by water molecules the dissolution of zif 8 particles in aqueous solution had also been observed in the work of zhang et al 23 meanwhile the zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol did not suffer from any degradation as the hydrolysis was prevented by the non dissociable nature of methanol this was unlike water molecule which dissociates readily into h and oh ions during hydrolysis step zn 2 mim 2 n 2m h2o zn 2 mim 2 n m 2m oh m zn2 2m h2 mim both dls analysis and tem imaging unequivocally confirmed that the zif 8 particles degraded and thus were unstable in water therefore prior to using the zif 8 particles for tfn membrane synthesis it is necessary to stabilize the zif 8 particles against dissolution in water in this work pss coating was introduced to modify the surface of zif 8 particles in order to stabilize them in water it is believed that pss which is an anionic polymer can impart water stability to the zif 8 particles via electrosteric stabilization the pss coating was carried out using a number of coating solvents with varying composition of methanol and water similarly dls analysis and tem imaging were performed to assess the stability of zif 8 particles after pss coating the results of dls analysis are shown in table 5 it was important to first confirm the successful coating of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface since methanol had been proven to produce a stable zif 8 suspension the zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol were first analyzed it was noted during the preparation of pss coating solvent that pss had poor solubility in pure methanol some solid pss still remained in the coating solution during the coating process hence methanol was not a suitable coating solvent for performing the pss coating of zif 8 particles in contrast pss dissolved excellently in pure water hence water was an ideal solvent for the pss coating of zif 8 particles in fact pss molecules were successfully adsorbed onto the surface of zif 8 particles as suggested by the negative zeta potential in table 5 the change of zeta potential from 34 60 mv table 4 to 14 56 mv table 5 indicated that the zinc ions at the surface of zif 8 particles had been coated with the negatively charged pss molecules unfortunately the zif 8 particle size and its polydispersity index increased tremendously after the pss coating this suggested that zif 8 particle agglomeration still occurred it was deduced that the zif 8 particle aggregation was not due to the instability of zif 8 particles in methanol as methanol was generally a good solvent to disperse zif 8 particles and their zeta potential still suggested moderate stability instead zif 8 particle agglomeration occurred during the coating process as discussed earlier the zif 8 particles were unstable in water hence during pss coating it was impossible to totally avoid the contact between zif 8 particles and water as a result some zif 8 particles degraded and agglomerated during the coating process up to this point it is clear that a balance must be attained between methanol and water in order to achieve successful pss coating of zif 8 particles in particular the coating solvent should contain some methanol to maintain the stability of zif 8 particles during pss coating at the same time the coating solvent should also contain sufficient water to aid the dissolution of pss which was necessary to conduct successful coating procedure hence the pss coating of zif 8 particles was further carried out using methanol water mixture with 75 vol and 50 vol of methanol as the coating solvent from table 5 by gradually increasing the methanol content in coating solvent from pure water the zif 8 particles showed an increasingly negative zeta potential this proved that a better adsorption of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface occurred which resulted in the improved zif 8 particle stability in methanol hence a more effective coating process was achieved by using methanol water as the coating solvent instead of pure solvent besides the zif 8 particle size and its polydispersity index decreased significantly to almost similar order of magnitude as those of the zif 8 particles before pss coating table 4 hence the zif 8 particle dissolution and agglomeration were successfully minimized after the coating process nevertheless it was not surprising that the zif 8 particles became larger after pss coating due to the pss polymer brush surrounding the original zif 8 particles the dls results for methanol dispersion of zif 8 particles had proven the successful coating of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface as well as promising zif 8 particle stability after pss coating it was then crucial to evaluate the zif 8 particle stability in water as shown in table 5 by using pure water as the coating solvent large zif 8 particle size and high polydispersity index were observed this suggested severe zif 8 particle agglomeration as postulated previously besides the near zero zeta potential indicated extremely poor zif 8 particle stability in water due to the zif 8 particle degradation and agglomeration in water during pss coating most of the zif 8 particles already lost their stability despite the apparent successful pss coating shown by the dls results for methanol dispersion of zif 8 particles however upon introducing methanol into the coating solvent table 5 shows a similar trend for both methanol and aqueous dispersion of zif 8 particles with a gradually decreasing zif 8 particle size and polydispersity index as well as an increasingly negative zeta potential again these results confirmed the improved pss adsorption onto the zif 8 particle surface and thus enhanced zif 8 particle stability in water in fact the size and zeta potential of zif 8 particles dispersed in methanol and water almost converged after pss coating with the coating solvent of 75 vol methanol water this indicated that the pss coating process had stabilized the zif 8 particles sufficiently in both methanol and water from table 5 75 vol methanol water coating solvent resulted in the best pss coating condition since the pss coated zif 8 particles exhibited the best stability and minimal particle agglomeration however dls analysis could only prove the successful pss coating implicitly hence the zif 8 particles were analyzed via tem and atr ftir to confirm the adsorption of pss molecules onto the zif 8 particle surface by comparing the tem images in fig 2 a and b black dots were found to be scattered randomly across the surface of zif 8 particles after pss coating indeed the black dots were the coated pss molecules in their coil up form hence the zif 8 particles were successfully coated with pss molecules the pss coating could be further verified by comparing the ftir spectrum of zif 8 particles before and after pss coating as shown in fig 3 an additional absorption peak was found to appear at 1038 cm 1 after pss coating indeed this absorption peak is associated to the soh and in plane vibration of the aromatic ring of sulfonate group in pss structure 32 34 therefore ftir analysis again confirmed that pss had been coated successfully onto the zif 8 particle surface this in turn imparted water stability to the zif 8 particles the pss coated zif 8 particles could then be utilized for tfn membrane development via aqueous phase dosing 3 2 tfn membrane synthesis with pss coated zif 8 particles the influence of pss coated zif 8 particles on the tfn membrane morphology and separation properties was investigated in this section two tfn membranes were synthesized by incorporating pss coated and uncoated zif 8 particles into the membrane by aqueous phase dosing during interfacial polymerization a tfc membrane was also synthesized as the control membrane for comparison the surface and cross sectional morphology of all membranes are depicted in fig 4 fig 4 a left shows that the tfc membrane had a typical ridge and valley surface morphology similar ridge and valley surface structure was also observed for the tfn membrane containing pss coated zif 8 particles tfn zif pss as shown in fig 4 b left however with the introduction of uncoated zif 8 particles the surface morphology of tfn membrane changed from ridge and valley structure to elongated leaf like feature that was sparsely distributed across the membrane surface fig 4 c left this meant that the tfn membrane containing uncoated zif 8 particles tfn zif had a significantly looser surface than both tfc and tfn zif pss membranes in addition the cross sectional morphology of all three membranes was also different fig 4 a right illustrates a smooth and thin polyamide film with thickness of about 250 nm for tfc membrane the thin polyamide film was resulted from the high mpd concentration employed in tfc membrane synthesis as reported in the previous work 35 however the integration of pss coated zif 8 particles increased the polyamide film thickness significantly to roughly 1050 nm as depicted in fig 4 b right meanwhile tfn zif membrane possessed a polyamide film with thickness of roughly 280 nm fig 4 c right which was similar to that of tfc membrane apart from film thickness difference the tfn membrane generally had a rougher surface than the tfc membrane regardless of the type of zif 8 particles added as shown in the right images of fig 4 this was proven by afm analysis which showed surface roughness of 0 273 Î¼m and 0 227 Î¼m for tfn zif and tfn zif pss membranes but 0 146 Î¼m for tfc membrane the substantial difference in the surface and cross sectional structure of tfc tfn zif and tfn zif pss membranes indicated that the interfacial polymerization of tfn membrane was influenced strongly by the pss coating of zif 8 particles in the typical interfacial polymerization of tfc membrane only a narrow miscibility zone existed due to the very low solubility of tmc in aqueous phase 36 as such mpd had to diffuse across the growing polyamide film to the organic phase for reaction with tmc to sustain the polyamide film growth however the miscibility zone widened substantially with the use of pss coated zif 8 particles in preparing the tfn zif pss membrane in essence pss molecule is of amphiphilic nature due to the presence of both long hydrophobic organic polystyrene moiety and hydrophilic inorganic sulfonate group in its structure hence the pss coated zif 8 particles could act like a surfactant to improve the miscibility between aqueous and organic phase during interfacial polymerization 37 the wider miscibility zone allowed tmc to diffuse freely into it to react with mpd for polyamide film growth 38 as a result a significantly thicker polyamide film was formed for tfn zif pss membrane fig 4 b right compared to tfc membrane fig 4 a right the substantial increase of polyamide film thickness gave rise to the significant increase of cocl crosslinking sites in the reaction zone however there was insufficient mpd to react with the large quantity of cocl crosslinking sites hence the crosslinking degree or the density of tfn zif pss membrane was lower than that of tfc membrane the wider miscibility zone was further confirmed as the pss coated zif 8 particles were found to reside not only inside the polyamide matrix but also near to the surface of tfn zif pss membrane as highlighted in fig 4 b right meanwhile the dissolution of uncoated zif 8 particles in water released plenty of zif 8 residues as the zif 8 residues were partitioned into the organic phase together with mpd they became obstacles inside the narrow miscibility zone this prevented mpd and tmc from contacting with each other effectively for polyamide film growth hence tfn zif membrane fig 4 c right had a significantly thinner polyamide film than tfn zif pss membrane fig 4 b right the zif 8 residues also obstructed mpd from contacting effectively with the cocl crosslinking sites in the polyamide film this led to a significantly lower crosslinking degree for tfn zif membrane compared to both tfc and tfn zif pss membranes hence it was not surprising that tfn zif membrane fig 4 c left possessed a much looser surface than both tfc membrane fig 4 a left and tfn zif pss membrane fig 4 b left the influence of pss coated zif 8 particles on tfn membrane formation is further manifested in the substantially contrasting membrane separation properties for water and nacl as illustrated in fig 5 from the perspective of water transport tfn zif pss membrane had a pure water permeability comparable to that of tfc membrane although its polyamide film was substantially thicker than that of tfc membrane theoretically a thicker polyamide film is not favorable for water transport due to higher transport resistance besides due to the thicker polyamide film the zif 8 particles remained embedded in the polyamide film as shown in fig 4 b right this negated the effectiveness of zif 8 particles in improving the water transport via hydrophilicity originating from their charged nature this indicated that other factors were responsible for the significantly lower water transport resistance within the polyamide film embedded with pss coated zif 8 particles firstly the zif 8 particles provided a preferential less tortuous pathway for water transport via their crystalline pore network compared to the denser polyamide film besides tfn zif pss membrane was looser than tfc membrane due to its lower crosslinking degree moreover nanogaps were unavoidable at the interface between polyamide and zif 8 particles as a result of the electrostatic repulsion between them this interaction arose because both polyamide film and zif 8 particles were negatively charged as proven in the previous work 35 and table 5 respectively principally nanogaps are interfacial voids that provide additional pathways for water transport 39 hence all these factors worked together to overcome the polyamide film thickness increment in governing the water transport this explained the similar pure water permeability between tfc and tfn zif pss membranes meanwhile nanogaps are non selective by nature and thus also allowed nacl to pass through them easily 40 this coupled with the looser polyamide film to negate the molecular sieving effect brought by the crystalline framework of zif 8 particles as a result nacl rejection decreased slightly for tfn zif pss membrane compared to tfc membrane on the other hand tfn zif membrane showed 21 1 higher pure water permeability and 32 8 reduction in nacl rejection compared to tfc membrane here polyamide film thickness did not play a major role in controlling the water transport since tfn zif and tfc membranes had a similar polyamide film thickness however tfn zif membrane had a much lower crosslinking degree than tfc membrane the significantly looser polyamide film thus improved the water transport of tfn zif membrane over tfc membrane meanwhile the uncoated zif 8 particles could no longer perform molecular sieving attributed to the loss of crystalline framework and aperture size under degradation by water this combined with the much looser polyamide film aforementioned to result in a severe drop in nacl rejection for tfn zif membrane compared to tfc membrane 3 3 tfn membrane synthesis under the aid of tea during interfacial polymerization section 3 2 demonstrates that it was essential to incorporate pss coated zif 8 particles in order to obtain a tfn membrane with better separation properties however tfn zif pss membrane still had a similar water permeability as tfc membrane fig 5 as discussed in section 3 2 this was due to the thicker polyamide film fig 4 b right which culminated in a very high water transport resistance and masked the possible water transport improvement induced by zif 8 hydrophilicity hence this section aims to reduce the polyamide film thickness by introducing tea as an acid acceptor during interfacial polymerization theoretically tea helps to remove the hydrogen chloride formed during interfacial polymerization which then promotes further reaction 25 26 it is postulated that tea can help to promote polyamide film crosslinking to induce diffusion controlled polyamide film growth thus reducing the polyamide film thickness a tfc membrane was also synthesized with the use of tea during interfacial polymerization to assess the lone effect of tea on polyamide film formation fig 6 depicts the surface and cross sectional morphology of tfc and tfn membranes synthesized with and without the use of tea during interfacial polymerization all membranes exhibited a ridge and valley surface morphology however the ridge and valley structure was loosened up slightly by using tea during interfacial polymerization for both tfc and tfn membranes meanwhile tea brought different changes to the cross sectional morphology of tfc and tfn membranes for tfc membrane a thicker polyamide film 350 nm with much rougher surface was formed by introducing tea during interfacial polymerization in contrast for tfn membrane the polyamide film thickness reduced from 1050 nm to 450 nm by using tea during polyamide film formation the contrasting trend of tfc and tfn membranes as well as the discrepancy between the experimental observation and postulation merited further investigation on the role of tea in governing the polyamide film formation in this study mpd was used as the amine monomer for polyamide film formation it is known that among the many amine monomers used for interfacial polymerization mpd has a relatively much higher partitioning ability into the organic phase 41 however by introducing tea in aqueous phase monomer solution for tfc membrane synthesis the partitioning ability of mpd decreased due to the competition and inhibition by tea 26 41 42 this lowered the amount of mpd that partitioned into the organic phase thus although tea could promote a faster reaction the lower amount of mpd indicated that less cocl crosslinking sites in the polyamide film were reacted by mpd hence the crosslinking degree of polyamide film for tfc tea membrane was slightly lower than that of tfc membrane mpd could then diffuse across the looser polyamide film more easily to participate in further polyamide film growth however owing to the inhibiting effect of tea on mpd the quantity of mpd available for polyamide film growth was limited as a result a slightly thicker polyamide film was formed for tfc tea membrane fig 6 b right compared to tfc membrane fig 6 a right since tea also promoted tmc hydrolysis 25 26 as the reaction progressed only little unhydrolyzed tmc remained for reaction at random locations on the membrane surface this explained the much rougher surface for tfc tea membrane fig 6 b right compared to tfc membrane fig 6 a right the non uniformity of membrane synthesized with the use of tea had also been reported in the literature 26 42 the tmc hydrolysis also reduced the crosslinking degree at the polyamide film surface 25 26 consequently tfc tea membrane fig 6 b left had a looser polyamide film surface than tfc membrane fig 6 a left meanwhile for tfn membrane synthesis it was discussed earlier that pss coated zif 8 particles widened the miscibility zone by virtue of the amphiphilic nature of pss in spite of this mpd was unable to occupy fully the wide miscibility zone to take part in reaction firstly tea restricted the amount of mpd that partitioned into the miscibility zone in addition the mpd that entered the miscibility zone was quickly reacted off due to the faster reaction promoted by tea hence most of the mpd was consumed for crosslinking reaction near the bottom of polyamide film instead of polyamide film growth which required tmc to diffuse across the wide miscibility zone in order to contact with mpd for reaction consequently the crosslinking degree of the bottom part of polyamide film increased rapidly this subsequently restricted mpd diffusion across the polyamide film for further reaction hence a significantly thinner polyamide film was formed for tfn tea zif pss membrane fig 6 d right than tfn zif pss membrane fig 6 c right the thinner polyamide film also allowed the zif 8 particles to protrude from the surface of tfn tea zif pss membrane as highlighted in fig 6 d right this was in contrast to tfn zif pss membrane fig 6 c right where the zif 8 particles remained embedded within the thicker polyamide film despite being able to diffuse deep into the miscibility zone moreover the inhibited mpd diffusion and tmc hydrolysis induced by tea lowered the crosslinking degree at the polyamide film surface hence tfn tea zif pss membrane fig 6 d left had a looser surface than tfn zif pss membrane fig 6 c left the use of tea in interfacial polymerization imparted substantial changes to the tfc and tfn membrane morphology and thus altered their separation properties as shown in fig 7 for tfc membrane the pure water permeability increased by 90 1 with the use of tea in membrane synthesis although the polyamide film of tfc tea membrane fig 6 b right was slightly thicker than that of tfc membrane fig 6 a right the polyamide film also had a lower crosslinking degree relative to that of tfc membrane besides tfc tea membrane fig 6 b right had a much rougher polyamide film surface than tfc membrane fig 6 a right as analyzed by afm the surface roughness of tfc tea membrane 0 382 Î¼m was 161 2 higher than the surface roughness of tfc membrane 0 146 Î¼m this improved the membrane surface wettability significantly as proven by its much lower water contact angle 34 8 2 6 compared to tfc membrane 65 5 2 4 this coupled with the looser polyamide film to overcome the polyamide film thickness increment in improving the water transport hence the pure water permeability of tfc tea membrane was significantly higher than that of tfc membrane meanwhile the nacl rejection of tfc tea membrane reduced by 2 5 compared to tfc membrane this was due to the formation of polyamide film with lower crosslinking degree which diminished its molecular sieving ability the improvement of pure water permeability with the use of tea was even higher for tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane as shown in fig 7 as illustrated in fig 6 c and d right a significantly thinner polyamide film was formed for tfn tea zif pss membrane compared to tfn zif pss membrane besides the zif 8 particles provided a less tortuous pathway for water transport as discussed earlier more importantly plenty of zif 8 particles were found to protrude from the membrane surface in fig 6 d right this meant that zif 8 hydrophilicity could now play its role effectively in impacting the water transport a rougher tfn membrane surface was also resulted by the protruding zif 8 as proven by the increase in surface roughness from 0 227 Î¼m tfn zif pss membrane to 0 253 Î¼m tfn tea zif pss membrane with the use of tea this coupled with zif 8 hydrophilicity to improve the membrane hydrophilicity as proven by the lower water contact angle of tfn tea zif pss membrane 56 4 2 7 compared to tfn zif pss membrane 64 7 3 0 the thinner and more hydrophilic polyamide film as well as the lower tortuosity of zif 8 particles ensured that the water transport was significantly improved as shown by the much higher pure water permeability for tfn tea zif pss membrane than tfn zif pss membrane meanwhile the nacl rejection remained similar regardless of whether tea was used in tfn membrane synthesis although the presence of nanogaps at the interface between polyamide and zif 8 particles was expected this was offset by the higher crosslinking degree of polyamide film for tfn tea zif pss membrane compared to tfn zif pss membrane hence the overall molecular sieving effect of tfn tea zif pss and tfn zif pss membranes was similar this explained the similar nacl rejection between both tfn membranes synthesized in short the use of tea in interfacial polymerization helped in improving the water transport of both tfc and tfn membranes specifically for tfn membrane synthesis the use of tea allowed the pss coated zif 8 particles to protrude from the membrane surface hence the water transport improvement induced by zif 8 hydrophilicity and polyamide film roughness could be effectively realized this allowed the tfn membrane to eventually outperform the tfc membrane in achieving higher pure water permeability while attaining only minimal loss in nacl rejection at the same time in view of the better performance of tfn membrane synthesized using tea in interfacial polymerization this membrane was selected for the fo treatment of high salinity oil emulsion in the subsequent section 3 4 fo treatment of high salinity oil emulsion using tfn membrane in this section the tfn membrane synthesized with the use of tea during interfacial polymerization was tested for the fo treatment of synthetic high salinity oil emulsion as well as real produced water the tfc membrane synthesized with the use of tea during interfacial polymerization was also tested as the control membrane for comparison apart from synthetic and real oil emulsion pure water and synthetic seawater were also run to assess the influence of the increasingly complex feed content on the fo performance of tfn membrane the fo flux of different feed solutions is shown in fig 8 for both tfc and tfn membranes the trend in fig 8 could be explained by the varying content of feed solutions as well as the interaction between the feed contents and membrane the highest fo flux was achieved by pure water for both tfc and tfn membranes principally the driving force of fo flux is the osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution and feed solution with a higher osmotic pressure difference giving higher fo flux 28 since the draw solution was freshly prepared and fixed at 1 l of aqueous nacl solution at a concentration of 1 m for every fo run the osmotic pressure of draw solution was similar for every fo run hence the fo flux was governed by the osmotic pressure of feed solution by using pure water as the feed zero osmotic pressure was contributed by the feed solution this maximized the osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution and feed solution hence pure water demonstrated the highest fo flux among the three feed solutions regardless of the type of membrane tested nevertheless the fo flux of pure water was still different between the tfc and tfn membranes as shown in fig 8 the tfn membrane consistently had a higher fo flux than the tfc membrane throughout the whole fo filtration run indeed this result matched with the finding in fig 7 whereby the tfn membrane had a higher pure water permeability than the tfc membrane as discussed earlier the enhancement of water transport for tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane was mainly attributed to the increased hydrophilicity and surface roughness induced by the zif 8 particles protruding from the membrane surface in addition fig 8 depicts that stable fo pure water flux could only be achieved by tfn membrane but not tfc membrane which showed an increasing fo pure water flux with time this was theorized to be due to the swelling of membrane by water during fo filtration and would be discussed in detail later meanwhile after changing the feed from pure water to synthetic seawater the fo flux decreased significantly by an average of 75 2 for both tfc and tfn membranes by using synthetic seawater as the feed the seasalts dissolved in water created osmotic pressure in the feed solution this reduced the osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution and feed solution significantly by taking the specification of seasalts used as the basis for calculation the synthetic seawater feed resulted in 57 5 loss of osmotic pressure difference compared to pure water feed with such substantial loss of fo driving force it was thus not surprising that the fo flux decreased severely after switching the feed solution from pure water to synthetic seawater regardless of the type of membrane tested however it is noted that the degree of loss of fo driving force 57 5 was still lower than the degree of fo flux reduction 75 2 by average this difference was due to the two unavoidable phenomena in a typical fo process using an asymmetric membrane reverse salt flux and icp in essence both reverse salt flux and icp further reduce the driving force and thus fo flux such scenarios were not accounted for the loss of fo driving force which was calculated based on the bulk concentration of feed and draw solutions prepared hence the actual loss of fo driving force was underestimated resulting in the disparity between the predicted and actual degree of fo flux reduction moving onto synthetic high salinity oil emulsion feed fig 8 displays a dissimilar fo flux between tfc and tfn membranes for tfc membrane the fo flux of oil emulsion was initially lower than that of synthetic seawater however it gradually increased and converged at almost similar value as the fo flux of synthetic seawater at the end of fo filtration run the increasing fo flux of tfc membrane with time was also observed previously for pure water feed this was due to the swelling of tfc membrane by water and oil emulsion hexadecane as water diffused into the polyamide film during fo filtration of pure water the free volume of membrane increased to accommodate water inside its matrix 43 45 hence more water pathways appeared in the polyamide film over time which gradually increased the fo flux of pure water meanwhile the rate of flux increment was found to be even higher for synthetic oil emulsion feed 0 020 l m2 h min than pure water feed 0 014 l m2 h min by comparing the slope for the linear best fit line of fo flux of both feeds this meant that membrane swelling was more significant with the presence of hexadecane in this work the hexadecane had been emulsified by triton x 100 surfactant this helped in improving the miscibility between the polyamide film and hexadecane resulting in the dissolution of hexadecane into the polyamide network hence the emulsified hexadecane exacerbated the swelling of tfc membrane that already occurred while running pure water feed as a result the tfc membrane experienced an even higher degree of swelling for oil emulsion feed compared to pure water feed swelling of polyamide membrane by oil emulsion had also been reported by past studies 46 49 in contrast the tfn membrane did not show any swelling as indicated by its stable fo flux for both pure water and synthetic oil emulsion feed in fig 8 this was attributed to the rigidification of polyamide matrix by zif 8 particles via their solid and crystalline framework which restricted the significant movement of polyamide chains the stiffening of membrane under the presence of zif 8 particles had also been reported by others 50 52 besides the charged zif 8 particles at the membrane surface further prevented the membrane solvation by hexadecane consequently the tfn membrane had a better resistance against swelling by both water and oil emulsion compared to the tfc membrane in order to verify the occurrence of membrane swelling tga was carried out on both tfc and tfn membranes before and after fo filtration run the tga profiles of all membranes are depicted in fig 9 from fig 9 a by increasing the temperature of tga to 350 c a weight difference was found between the tfc membrane before and after fo filtration run this was caused by both evaporation of water and oil emulsion that swelled the membrane during fo filtration in contrast the tga profile in fig 9 b shows no difference for the tfn membrane before and after fo filtration run this proved that the tfn membrane did not experience any swelling during fo filtration therefore tga successfully confirmed the improved swelling resistance of tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane meanwhile the substantial weight loss from 350 c onwards in both fig 9 a and b was due to the thermal degradation of tfc and tfn membrane respectively up to now it has been proven that the tfn membrane had a better resistance against swelling by water and oil emulsion compared to tfc membrane both membranes were then tested for the fo filtration of real produced water to reflect their capability in treating the oil emulsion fig 10 shows the fo flux of both tfc and tfn membranes by using real produced water as the feed similar to fig 8 the tfc membrane depicted an increasing fo flux with time while the tfn membrane demonstrated a stable fo flux in running real produced water feed again this proved the role of oil emulsion in inducing membrane swelling as well as the better swelling resistance of tfn membrane compared to tfc membrane nevertheless it was unfair to directly compare the fo flux between synthetic oil emulsion and real produced water owing to the much different feed properties including salinity and oil concentration therefore the fo performance of both oil emulsion feeds is summarized in table 6 together with their feed conditions to better illustrate the capability of both tfc and tfn membranes in treating such feeds using fo process it should be noted that the real produced water had a lower salinity than the synthetic oil emulsion this meant that using real produced water as the feed led to a lower loss of fo driving force hence it was not surprising that the fo flux of real produced water was higher than that of synthetic oil emulsion the real produced water also had a lower oil concentration than the synthetic oil emulsion this suggested that the tfc membrane should suffer from less severe swelling when it was brought into contact with the real produced water compared to the synthetic oil emulsion indeed this was proven by the rate of flux increment of tfc membrane for both oil emulsion feeds from table 6 changing the feed from synthetic oil emulsion to real produced water decreased the rate of flux increment by 21 6 from 0 020 l m2 h min to 0 016 l m2 h min the degree of reduction was indeed comparable to the degree of reduction of feed oil concentration 24 4 with the change of feed from synthetic oil emulsion to real produced water meanwhile the oil rejection was found to be higher than 99 regardless of the feeds and membranes tested this was because the oil particle size for both synthetic oil emulsion and real produced water table 6 was in nanometer range which was significantly larger than either the typical free volume size of polyamide film 1 nm 53 or the aperture size of zif 8 particles 0 34 nm 54 hence it was virtually impossible for the oil particles to penetrate through the membrane and high oil rejection was achieved by both membranes as discussed earlier icp and reverse salt flux are two phenomena in fo process that are detrimental to the fo flux these two parameters were also evaluated to better characterize the overall fo process performance principally icp reduces the effective fo driving force due to development of draw solute concentration profile inside the porous membrane support as a result of draw solute transport resistance across it by theory the degree of icp is indicated by the structural parameter of support membrane with a higher structural parameter indicating more severe icp the structural parameter of psf support membrane in this work was 2 565 mm this value was compared to that of other literature in table 7 the structural parameter in this work was found to be higher than that of most literature indicating serious icp during fo process this meant that the psf support membrane used in this work still gave relatively high resistance to nacl diffusion across it hence its structure should be further optimized in future work to lower down the level of icp for increased fo flux meanwhile reverse salt flux refers to the diffusion of draw solute from draw solution to feed solution this also reduces the effective driving force and thus deteriorates the fo flux by theory higher reverse salt flux is undesirable as it limits the attainable fo flux the reverse salt flux of tfc and tfn membranes was calculated to be 0 259 mol m2 h and 0 494 mol m2 h respectively the higher reverse salt flux of tfn membrane was attributed to its poorer ability in retaining nacl compared to tfc membrane as a result of the presence of nanogaps in tfn membrane this was consistent with the nacl rejection of both membranes as shown in fig 7 88 6 for tfc membrane but 87 9 for tfn membrane the reverse salt flux of tfc and tfn membranes in this work was again much higher than that of most literature as depicted in table 7 hence the fo flux achieved by the tfc and tfn membranes in this work in treating the produced water was strongly diminished in short the higher reverse salt flux of tfn membrane as well as the severe icp in fo process had restricted the fo flux improvement of tfn membrane in this work for produced water treatment in spite of this the tfn membrane still outperformed the tfc membrane in terms of fo water flux more importantly the tfn membrane exhibited improved swelling resistance against oil emulsion than the tfc membrane which is important in developing a membrane for long term produced water treatment therefore the tfn membrane developed in this work serves as a platform for further improvement in future work specifically future work can be aimed at reducing the reverse salt flux by improving the formation of polyamide film for higher nacl selectivity in addition further study on psf support membrane synthesis can be carried out to optimize its structure and reduce the degree of icp in fo process by doing so the improvement of tfn membrane in this work can be further maximized for the treatment of produced water 4 conclusions in this work a tfn membrane incorporated with pss coated zif 8 particles was synthesized to improve the membrane water permeability and swelling resistance the self synthesized zif 8 particles in this work demonstrated poor stability in water however after coating with pss the zif 8 particles became stable in water due to electrosteric stabilization the pss coated zif 8 particles allowed the proper formation of tfn membrane with similar water permeability and nacl rejection as the tfc membrane in contrast the tfn membrane containing uncoated zif 8 particles was very poorly crosslinked and thus could only achieve a low nacl rejection of 61 1 by further introducing tea as an acid acceptor during interfacial polymerization the tfn membrane having pss coated zif 8 particles possessed 116 2 higher pure water permeability with comparable nacl rejection as the tfn membrane synthesized without tea this was due to the formation of a thinner and rougher polyamide film as well as the protruding of hydrophilic and less tortuous zif 8 particles from membrane surface the tfn membrane also demonstrated better swelling resistance against both water and oil emulsion compared to the tfc membrane attributed to the rigidification of polyamide matrix by zif 8 particles and the charged nature of zif 8 particles respectively the chemically stable tfn membrane was able to reject more than 99 of oil particles from both synthetic oil emulsion and real produced water with a stable fo flux up to 90 min of filtration time acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the financial support provided by ministry of energy science

14154,la3 exchanged bentonite phoslock is a well known adsorbent for phosphate but it is incapable of simultaneously removing nitrate from aqueous solution in this study montmorillonite mt was modified stepwise by lanthanum and a cationic gemini surfactant for co adsorption of phosphate and nitrate x ray diffraction patterns revealed that lanthanum existed as laco3oh and the gemini surfactant intercalated into the interlayer space of mt the contents of lanthanum and gemini surfactant in obtained nanocomposite laomt were estimated using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and elemental analysis which are 0 163 and 0 435 mmol g respectively based on fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy uptake of phosphate was attributed to ligand exchange with hydroxyl and electrostatic attraction on positively charged laco3oh and that of nitrate mainly resulted from the ion exchange with bromide ion and interactions with r4n groups released from mt layers the estimated adsorption capacities of laomt to nitrate and phosphate were 0 84 and 0 39 mmol g respectively adsorption of phosphate was negligibly affected by nitrate but the presence of phosphate facilitated the hydration of laomt and improved nitrate uptake compared with commercial phoslock laomt demonstrated comparable adsorption performance in terms of phosphate removal considering the simultaneous uptake of nitrate and stable adsorption performance when ubiquitous anions coexisted laomt is a promising adsorbent for remediation of phosphate and nitrate contaminated wastewater keywords lanthanum gemini surfactant simultaneous removal phosphate nitrate 1 introduction with the increase of the global population the food requirement stimulates the extensive use of fertilizers to enhance crop yields generally speaking the nutrients of fertilizers including phosphate and nitrate were partially used by the plants and the rest were carried away by runoff resulting in a series of multidimensional environmental problems such as aquatic eutrophication and soil salination 1 the maximum concentration of phosphorus in water to prevent algae blooms was recommended as 50 Î¼g l by the united states environmental protection agency 2 and the most of phosphorus from wastewater are in orthophosphate species besides the nitrate in drinking water in sufficiently high concentration induces the methemoglobinemia popularly known as blue baby syndrome in infants and the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines and the permission level was set as 10 mg l by world health organization 3 hence to provide cost effective solutions to sequestrate phosphate and nitrate from water bodies is imperative at present the chemical biological and physical treatment technologies are commonly used for removal of phosphate and or nitrate from wastewater 2 4 among which the chemical and biological technologies are sensitive to the variations in temperature and concentration and cause secondary pollution by chemical agents and microbes by contrast adsorption is an arguably more straightforward and cost efficient process especially for remediation of the media polluted with low concentrations of contaminants recently lots of adsorbents have been synthesized for removal of phosphate and or nitrate such as metals la zr fe or mg or cationic surfactants doped carbon or clay minerals composites 1 5 14 amine grafted agricultural waste 15 16 quaternized chitosan melamine glutaraldehyde resin 17 etc while only a small fraction of them were capable of removing phosphate and nitrate simultaneously 6 10 16 17 moreover in the natural water environment or municipal wastewater phosphate generally coexists with nitrate 18 19 to develop multifunctional adsorbents for co adsorption of phosphate and nitrate is of great concern the commercial phoslock developed by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization us patent no 6 350 383 is primarily la3 exchanged bentonite with the la content of 4 4 5 w w 20 21 this product has been used for remediation of more than 200 eutrophic water bodies through immobilizing phosphate as an insoluble phase lapo4 solubility product at 25 c k sp 1 74 10 25 with high stability 7 however the removal efficiency of phosphate by phoslock was inevitably affected by various coexisting substances in the natural environment 22 also the electrostatically adsorbed la3 may be exchanged by other coexisting cations especially by poorly hydrated ions such as ammonium or coordinated with humic substances exerting toxicity to aquatic organisms 23 25 thus the transformation of la3 into la oh 3 and la2o3 has been performed to circumvent these disadvantages and intriguingly the outstanding adsorption capacities for phosphate were obtained 26 27 however removing nitrate simultaneously on lanthanum coated materials is still rarely addressed 6 28 alkyl quaternary ammonium modified montmorillonite mt is one of the most well known organo clays and shows favorable performance on adsorption of various contaminants particularly for the poorly hydrated anions such as no3 clo4 reo4 11 29 adsorption characteristic of anion on such an organo mt is strongly dependent on the hydration energy where the anion with high hydration energy such as po4 3 Î´ghÂº 2773 kj mol is energetically unfavorable 29 30 in other words this organo mt can effectively remove nitrate but is incapable of phosphate adsorption inspired by the above principles lanthanum and gemini alkyl quaternary ammonium salts were used stepwise to fabricate mt to achieve a novel nanocomposite that could be competent in co adsorption of phosphate and nitrate to the best of the authors knowledge modification of mt by metal in conjunction with a gemini cationic surfactant for simultaneous removal of inorganic anions has not yet been explored and studied in this study to avoid the loss of adsorption sites for phosphate the lanthanum ion was transformed as the precipitate phase meanwhile instead of the conventional alkyl quaternary ammonium salts the emerging gemini cationic surfactant was applied to restrain the release of modifiers which generally caused the secondary pollution of treated media 31 moreover the introduction of surfactants into lanthanum doped mt would significantly enhance the separability of the final composite the samples were multiply characterized and the adsorption characteristics including kinetics selectivity and isotherms of phosphate and nitrate on the resultant nanocomposite were investigated 2

solid was separated and dispersed in 100 ml of 45 5 mmol l gemini surfactant solution for further organic modification the mixture was shaken for 15 h at 25 c and the slurry like product was washed dried and ground to obtain the final composite laomt with the particle size smaller than 150 Î¼m in diameter 2 3 characterization of the original mt and laomt powder x ray diffraction xrd was

adsorption experiments the stock solutions of 10 mmol l phosphate and nitrate were prepared through dissolving the appropriate amount of kh2po4 and kno3 in deionized water respectively and the working

solution in a 40 ml polyethylene vial the sealed vials were shaken 150 rpm under 25 c per the experimental protocol a vial was fetched at the desired time for sampling after filtration through the 0 45 Î¼m cellulose membrane the concentrations of phosphate and nitrate in the filtrate were measured by spectrophotometric methods 6 33 using a spectrophotometer l5 inesa shanghai china the amount of adsorbed phosphate and nitrate at the designed time was calculated from the differences between the initial and final concentrations based on the experimental results the pseudo first order model eq 1 pseudo second order model eq 2 and elovich model eq 3 were used to clarify the adsorption characteristics 34 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 2 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t 3 q t 1 Î² ln Î± Î² 1 Î² ln t where q e

corresponding models and Î² g mmol 1 is the adsorption constant of elovich model the selectivity of laomt to phosphate and nitrate were studied through mixing with several ubiquitous co existing anions chloride carbonate and sulfate in the same concentration 0 1 mmol l the influence of these co existing anions on the adsorption kinetics of phosphate and nitrate was also addressed through comparing with the case without interference to understand the possible synergistic or antagonistic effects between phosphate and nitrate in terms of their adsorption performance four systems were established namely when the initial concentration of one adsorbate was fixed at low n 0 0 165 0 048 mm p 0 0 150 0 003 mm or high concentrations n 0 3 16 0 039 mm p 0 4 09 0 099 mm and that of another adsorbate was varied within 0 3 7 mm these batch mode experiments were carried out with the solid liquid ratio of 20 mg 25 ml at 25 c for 24 h to ensure the equilibrium the solid separated from the solution with high concentrations of phosphate and nitrate n 0 3 69 mm p 0 4 06 mm was freeze dried for characterization to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of laomt 3 1 1 x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the original mt and laomt samples are shown in fig 1 a the starting sample shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of mt and in which the cristobalite and quartz as impurities were also detected 23 however combined with the results of cec measurement calcium mt should be the dominant component of the starting sample the 001 reflection at 2Î¸ 5 7 of the original mt corresponds to a 0 58 nm distance of interlayer space where the hydrated calcium ions are accommodated 35 loading of lanthanum and gemini surfactants expanded the interlayer space as supported by the smaller 2Î¸ values of 001 reflection of laomt 3 4 and 4 9 inset of fig 1 a two 001 reflections suggest the heterogeneity of laomt resulting from the different configurations of the intercalated gemini surfactants combined with the distance of interlayer space of laomt and the size of gemini surfactant used 31 it can be inferred that the reflection at 2Î¸ 3 4 was likely to caused by the pseudo trilayer and or paraffin like monolayer configurations and the latter 2Î¸ 4 9 might be attributed to the lateral configuration laco3oh as the predominant crystalline phase of lanthanum in laomt was observed which was caused by the exposure of la oh 3 to co2 in the air during the synthetic procedure 36 37 3 1 2 ftir spectra ftir spectrum of the original mt sample shows the characteristic peaks of the mt layer and the physically adsorbed water fig 1 b and the relative intensities of those vibration bands changed after modification the intensity ratio of the symmetric vibration band of hydroxyl from metal hydroxyl interactions Î½ s moh to that from physically adsorbed water Î½ s hoh increased which was ascribed to the formation of laoh and the increased hydrophobicity the successful loading of gemini surfactant on mt was supported by the appearance of the intensive vibration bands of ch2 at 2923 2852 and 1471 cm 1 increasing the hydrophobicity of the resultant product 38 after separation of the peak approximately at 1475 cm 1 the inset of fig 1 b except the bending vibration of ch2 Î´ ch2 at 1471 cm 1 two additional weak bands at 1497 and 1415 cm 1 assigned to the carbonate of laco3oh were obtained 36 this further evidenced that the lanthanum is mainly presenting as laco3oh phase and the amount of laco3oh is relatively small in synthesized laomt 3 1 3 tg dtg analyses dehydration of samples resulted in the mass loss in the first stage 25 170 c fig 2 and there were two peaks in the dtg curves for both the original mt and laomt the peaks displayed at relatively low temperatures 44 and 61 c were caused by the physically adsorbed water and those at 85 and 132 c of laomt and the original mt were attributed to the decomposition of laco3oh eq 4 and the dehydration of hydrated calcium ions respectively 37 39 compared to the physically adsorbed water the hydration water of calcium ions was much smaller probably because the used ca mt was not stocked in the desiccator notably the observed dehydration temperatures are relatively high and could be influenced by sample property and experimental conditions for instance the sample with larger size and more densely packed showed higher dehydration temperatures 40 in this dehydration stage the mass loss decreased from 15 of the original mt to 4 6 of modified mt because the loading of gemini surfactant increased the hydrophobicity in the following stage 170 500 c the decomposition of gemini surfactant and dehydroxylation of the lanthanum compounds eq 5 cooperatively contributed to the mass loss 31 37 the gemini surfactant in laomt decomposed stepwise was caused by the different distribution and existing types according to the decomposition of octadecyl trimethyl ammonium modified mt 41 peaks were observed in three temperature ranges i e 170 205 c 270 290 c and 370 385 c resulting from the decomposition of the external adsorbed surfactants interlayer adsorbed surfactant molecules and intercalated surfactant cations respectively thus in this study the sharp peak at 250 c and the broad peak 445 c of dtg curves were likely attributed to the decomposition of surfactants located on the external surface and in the interlayer space respectively the higher decomposition temperatures of laomt could be ascribed to the different thermal properties of used surfactants dehydroxylation of mt layers 630 c and decarbonization of la2o2co3 eq 6 accounted for the mass loss in the third stage 500 800 c 4 laco3oh la2o co3 2 xh2o yh2o 5 la2o co3 2 xh2o la2o2co3 xh2o co2 6 la2o2co3 la2o3 co2 3 1 4 morphology observation tem images of the original mt and laomt were shown in fig 3 flake like aggregates with lamellar structure and ridged edges are observed for the original mt fig 3 a and the modification visibly expanded the interlayer space and maintained the fine layered structure fig 3 d however the estimated distances of interlayer space of original mt and laomt by tem images are smaller with respect to by xrd patterns which was the same as reported results and ascribed to the tilted rather than the vertical distribution of the 00 l planes of observed particles 31 different from the reported rod and or wafer like morphology 36 several nanosized particles of laco3oh with different shapes were observed in resultant laomt fig 3 e as shown in fig 3 f and g the homogeneous distribution of br and la implied the successful modification of mt by the lanthanum and gemini surfactants adsorption of phosphate and nitrate insignificantly influences the morphology of laomt fig 3 e and h 3 2 simultaneous adsorption characteristics of phosphate and nitrate on laomt 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics of phosphate and nitrate on laomt are shown in fig 4 and the parameters for the three models used for fitting of the experimental data are summarized in table 1 phosphate adsorption on laomt increased rapidly within the first 90 min and the rate was significantly decreased in the following 150 min however the equilibrium was still not reached after 240 min in contrast the equilibrium of nitrate uptake was achieved within 20 min the much higher rate constants k 1 k 2 and Î± further supported the faster adsorption rate of nitrate than phosphate based on the values of the correlation coefficients r 2 and rss the adsorption of phosphate was well fitted by the elovich model which was generally used to describe a biphasic reaction process including the initial prompt sorption and followed slow accumulation 34 the fitting result suggests that phosphate uptake was a diffusion limited process because some adsorption sites of phosphate were embedded and became gradually available through the hydration of laomt in solutions the good fitting of nitrate uptake by the pseudo second order model indicated that the chemisorption dominated the adsorption process which might involve the valency forces through sharing or exchanging electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent 8 42 a similar result was also reported on the adsorption of nitrate by hexadecyl pyridinium modified mt 11 3 2 2 adsorption selectivity chloride carbonate and sulfate ions generally coexist with phosphate and nitrate in the aquatic environment and their influences on adsorption of phosphate and nitrate on laomt are shown in fig 5 apart from the sulfate ion other anions negligibly affected the adsorption kinetics and the amount of adsorbed phosphate or nitrate because the positively charged head groups in the gemini surfactant r4n are non specific anion binding sites the affinity of studied anions to the adsorption sites obeys the hofmeister order i e po4 3 co3 2 so4 2 cl br no3 30 with the same concentration sulfate cannot exchange the counterion bromide and is hard to pose effects on nitrate uptake however this proposal contradicted to the experimental results where nitrate uptake was increased when sulfate co existed this phenomenon can be rationalized by the relatively large ion size 0 218 nm and high hydration energy 1090 kj mol of sulfate 30 which would facilitate the hydration of laomt and expose more available r4n sites increasing the amount of nitrate adsorbed 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms to obtain the maximum uptakes of laomt for phosphate and nitrate the adsorption isotherms were conducted tables s1 and s2 when the initial concentration of nitrate was maintained constant i e 0 165 or 3 16 mm the isotherms of phosphate uptake show l type curves fig 6 a indicating the high affinity at the beginning with the increase of concentration the adsorption sites were progressively occupied and it became difficult to find available sites for phosphate the maximum monolayer adsorption capacities of laomt to phosphate predicted by the langmuir model were 0 392 and 0 358 mmol g for two systems with the different initial concentrations of nitrate respectively the fitting parameters are summarized in table s2 the insignificant difference 0 034 mmol g suggests the negligible influence of nitrate on phosphate uptake in contrast the adsorption isotherms of nitrate when mixed with different initial concentrations of phosphate exhibit the s shaped curves suggesting the relatively low affinity of nitrate to laomt at low nitrate concentrations increasing to a certain concentration the slop was increased rapidly and achieved a plateau this tendency was well fitted by the sips isotherm model fig 6 b and table s2 the observed phenomenon could be attributed to the cooperative adsorption 43 and the exposure of embedded ion exchanging sites r4n in laomt via hydration swelling driven by concentration gradients of phosphate and nitrate 3 3 adsorption mechanism the intensive peak of p 2p orbit after adsorption suggests the successful phosphate uptake fig 7 which was also supported by the homogeneous distribution of phosphorus in laomt fig 3 j moreover the decreased ratio of peak intensity of Î½ s moh to Î½ si o si and the appearance of the intensive peak assigned to the la o stretching vibration at 498 cm 1 after phosphate adsorption implied the occurrence of ligand exchange eq 7 fig 8 due to the higher affinity of phosphate with respect to hydroxyl to lanthanum 44 although the binding energy of la 3d was not changed after adsorption fig 7 the blue shift assigned to phosphate vibration from 1300 to 1279 cm 1 45 fig 8 should be ascribed to the complexation of phosphate with lanthanum lanthanum existed as laco3oh phase in the resultant laomt fig 1 a and the evaluated point of zero charge phzpc of laco3oh is 9 8 46 this is higher than the solution ph of 5 0 0 2 suggesting that the electrostatic interaction eq 8 might also partially be responsible for uptake of phosphate mainly in h2po4 species fig s2 ion exchange with the counterion br of gemini surfactant seems not available considering the higher hydration energy of phosphate with respect to br 7 la oh2 h2po4 la h2po4 h2o 8 la oh2 h2po4 la oh2 h2po4 different from phosphate uptake nitrate uptake on laomt should be mainly attributed to the ion exchange with the counterion 1 11 the disappearance of the peak for br 3d orbit fig 7 and the appearance of no stretching vibration at 1385 cm 1 fig 8 suggests the completion of the ion exchange process eq 9 between nitrate and br 47 such a process could occur readily because some of the r4n sites distributed on the external surface and would interact with nitrate rapidly 41 showing the high adsorption rate table 1 however the adsorption kinetics and capacities of anions onto organo mt were affected by surfactant configuration associated with the molecular structure and the amount of surfactant used for synthesis 31 48 49 the compact surfactant configuration corresponds to the poor swelling property of modified mt derived from the rehydration process consequently the slower adsorption kinetics were observed due to more time consumed on rehydration of adsorbent and traveling of target anion to the newly exposed ion exchanging sites in addition because of the poorer swelling property some ion exchanging sites embedded might be hard to access decreasing the adsorption capacity 9 r4n br no3 r4n no3 br the poorly hydrated anions would replace mt layers to interact with r4n sites which strongly depends on the ion concentration 50 as shown in fig 7 the nitrogen atoms in gemini surfactants demonstrate two binding energies e b corresponding to the interactions with inorganic anions 402 1 ev and mt layers 399 4 ev respectively the intensity ratio of i 402 i 399 increased from 1 75 to 4 58 after adsorption suggesting the replacement of mt layers by nitrate eq 10 the process occurrence was accompanied by the change of configuration and or distribution of gemini surfactant as supported by the increased intensity ratio of i 286 2 i 284 6 fig 7 if all interactions between r4n and mt layers were disintegrated by nitrate the maximum uptake of nitrate on laomt would be 0 87 mmol g eq 11 with a c e around 3 0 mm nitrate uptake is close to the proposed maximum value fig 6 to get a complete exchange of mt by nitrate is unlikely to occur considering the spatial restriction of gemini surfactants in mt interlayers this can be supported by the presence of r4n mt interaction after adsorption n 1s orbit in fig 7 thus other mechanisms might contribute to nitrate uptake such as electrostatic attraction by positively charged laco3oh and or existing as nitrate salt in interlayer space 51 52 10 r4n mt no3 r4n no3 mt 11 f 1000 w w 2 n n n c m c 0 87 mmol g where w is the total carbon content w 16 9 obtained from elemental analysis w 2 refers to the carbon content derived from laco3oh w 2 0 2 calculated based on the la content which was estimated semi quantitatively by sem eds n n and n c represent the nitrogen and carbon number in a gemini surfactant molecule respectively and m c represents the carbon weight m c 12 g mol 3 4 comparison with other adsorbents because the adsorption rate of contaminants on adsorbent is crucial for evaluating the feasibility in practical treatment of wastewater the synthesized laomt was compared with commercial phoslock in terms of adsorption kinetics of phosphate as depicted in fig 4 it is comparable regarding the time spent on reaching the saturation of phosphate uptake on laomt and phoslock this was also supported by the similar rate constant of phosphate uptake k 2 listed in tables 1 and s3 notably the amount of adsorbed phosphate on laomt was slightly lower than that on phoslock at equilibrium which could be ascribed to the different amounts and properties of adsorption sites 1 phoslock was synthesized through repeatedly soaking high purity bentonite in 0 1 mmol l lacl3 solution with a solid liquid mass ratio of 1 100 and mt was dispersed in 0 02 mmol l lacl3 solution in the solid liquid mass ratio of 1 20 for one time to get the starting la3 exchanged mt the lanthanum content in phoslock 4 4 5 wt is higher than that in the final laomt 2 27 wt estimated by sem eds 2 lanthanum existed as ionic la3 and crystalline laco3oh in phoslock and laomt respectively and the former would readily precipitate with phosphate as rhabdophane lapo4 nh2o 20 whereas electrostatic attraction phzpc 9 8 phsolution 5 0 and or ligand exchange between hydroxide and phosphate are responsible for phosphate uptake on the later thus the lanthanum species is another factor affecting phosphate removal significantly compared with several adsorbents developed in recent years for simultaneous removal of phosphate and nitrate table 2 such as fe modified chitosan carbon beads 34 zirconium oxyhydroxide capped chitosan kaolin framework 53 la doped magnetic rgo nanocomposites 6 chitosan grafted quaternized resin 47 etc laomt showed comparable adsorption capacities and even at low concentration of adsorbate the adsorption performance was stably maintained against the co existing competitive anions fig 5 in addition laomt could be readily synthesized as mentioned earlier adsorption of phosphate and nitrate on laomt are mainly attributed to the compositions of laco3oh and gemini surfactants however compared with laomt the physically mixed laco3oh particles and gemini surfactant modified mt may show poorer adsorption performance for phosphate and nitrate considering that the nano sized laco3oh particles would be hard to separate from aqueous solution and readily influenced by the ubiquitously existing organic matter in the practical water environment in the laomt composite laco3oh particles were well distributed on mt that possesses the large surface area fig 3 g and the gemini surfactant generated steric hindrance that would mitigate the negative effects of large organic matter thus further optimization from perspectives including the effect of ubiquitously present humic acid 54 lanthanum content and species the molecular structure of gemini surfactant and dosage of lanthanum to gemini surfactant should be performed to meet the needs of the treatment of various contaminated water bodies with different phosphate and nitrate concentrations 4 conclusions the laco3oh gemini surfactant modified montmorillonite laomt was developed for simultaneous adsorption of phosphate and nitrate according to the experimental results and the langmuir fitting the adsorption capacities of laomt to nitrate and phosphate were 0 84 and 0 39 mmol g respectively compared with the commercial phoslock laomt showed comparable adsorption performance even at low phosphate concentration p 0 0 1 mm ligand exchange with hydroxyl and electrostatic attraction on the positively charged laco3oh accounted for the removal of phosphate nitrate uptake was mainly ascribed to the electrostatic interaction with r4n and might be partially attributed to electrostatic attraction by laco3oh and or formation of inorganic salt in interlayer space the presence of phosphate facilitated the hydration of laomt increasing nitrate uptake excellent adsorption performance of laomt to phosphate and nitrate suggests the

14154,la3 exchanged bentonite phoslock is a well known adsorbent for phosphate but it is incapable of simultaneously removing nitrate from aqueous solution in this study montmorillonite mt was modified stepwise by lanthanum and a cationic gemini surfactant for co adsorption of phosphate and nitrate x ray diffraction patterns revealed that lanthanum existed as laco3oh and the gemini surfactant intercalated into the interlayer space of mt the contents of lanthanum and gemini surfactant in obtained nanocomposite laomt were estimated using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and elemental analysis which are 0 163 and 0 435 mmol g respectively based on fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy uptake of phosphate was attributed to ligand exchange with hydroxyl and electrostatic attraction on positively charged laco3oh and that of nitrate mainly resulted from the ion exchange with bromide ion and interactions with r4n groups released from mt layers the estimated adsorption capacities of laomt to nitrate and phosphate were 0 84 and 0 39 mmol g respectively adsorption of phosphate was negligibly affected by nitrate but the presence of phosphate facilitated the hydration of laomt and improved nitrate uptake compared with commercial phoslock laomt demonstrated comparable adsorption performance in terms of phosphate removal considering the simultaneous uptake of nitrate and stable adsorption performance when ubiquitous anions coexisted laomt is a promising adsorbent for remediation of phosphate and nitrate contaminated wastewater keywords lanthanum gemini surfactant simultaneous removal phosphate nitrate 1 introduction with the increase of the global population the food requirement stimulates the extensive use of fertilizers to enhance crop yields generally speaking the nutrients of fertilizers including phosphate and nitrate were partially used by the plants and the rest were carried away by runoff resulting in a series of multidimensional environmental problems such as aquatic eutrophication and soil salination 1 the maximum concentration of phosphorus in water to prevent algae blooms was recommended as 50 Î¼g l by the united states environmental protection agency 2 and the most of phosphorus from wastewater are in orthophosphate species besides the nitrate in drinking water in sufficiently high concentration induces the methemoglobinemia popularly known as blue baby syndrome in infants and the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines and the permission level was set as 10 mg l by world health organization 3 hence to provide cost effective solutions to sequestrate phosphate and nitrate from water bodies is imperative at present the chemical biological and physical treatment technologies are commonly used for removal of phosphate and or nitrate from wastewater 2 4 among which the chemical and biological technologies are sensitive to the variations in temperature and concentration and cause secondary pollution by chemical agents and microbes by contrast adsorption is an arguably more straightforward and cost efficient process especially for remediation of the media polluted with low concentrations of contaminants recently lots of adsorbents have been synthesized for removal of phosphate and or nitrate such as metals la zr fe or mg or cationic surfactants doped carbon or clay minerals composites 1 5 14 amine grafted agricultural waste 15 16 quaternized chitosan melamine glutaraldehyde resin 17 etc while only a small fraction of them were capable of removing phosphate and nitrate simultaneously 6 10 16 17 moreover in the natural water environment or municipal wastewater phosphate generally coexists with nitrate 18 19 to develop multifunctional adsorbents for co adsorption of phosphate and nitrate is of great concern the commercial phoslock developed by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization us patent no 6 350 383 is primarily la3 exchanged bentonite with the la content of 4 4 5 w w 20 21 this product has been used for remediation of more than 200 eutrophic water bodies through immobilizing phosphate as an insoluble phase lapo4 solubility product at 25 c k sp 1 74 10 25 with high stability 7 however the removal efficiency of phosphate by phoslock was inevitably affected by various coexisting substances in the natural environment 22 also the electrostatically adsorbed la3 may be exchanged by other coexisting cations especially by poorly hydrated ions such as ammonium or coordinated with humic substances exerting toxicity to aquatic organisms 23 25 thus the transformation of la3 into la oh 3 and la2o3 has been performed to circumvent these disadvantages and intriguingly the outstanding adsorption capacities for phosphate were obtained 26 27 however removing nitrate simultaneously on lanthanum coated materials is still rarely addressed 6 28 alkyl quaternary ammonium modified montmorillonite mt is one of the most well known organo clays and shows favorable performance on adsorption of various contaminants particularly for the poorly hydrated anions such as no3 clo4 reo4 11 29 adsorption characteristic of anion on such an organo mt is strongly dependent on the hydration energy where the anion with high hydration energy such as po4 3 Î´ghÂº 2773 kj mol is energetically unfavorable 29 30 in other words this organo mt can effectively remove nitrate but is incapable of phosphate adsorption inspired by the above principles lanthanum and gemini alkyl quaternary ammonium salts were used stepwise to fabricate mt to achieve a novel nanocomposite that could be competent in co adsorption of phosphate and nitrate to the best of the authors knowledge modification of mt by metal in conjunction with a gemini cationic surfactant for simultaneous removal of inorganic anions has not yet been explored and studied in this study to avoid the loss of adsorption sites for phosphate the lanthanum ion was transformed as the precipitate phase meanwhile instead of the conventional alkyl quaternary ammonium salts the emerging gemini cationic surfactant was applied to restrain the release of modifiers which generally caused the secondary pollution of treated media 31 moreover the introduction of surfactants into lanthanum doped mt would significantly enhance the separability of the final composite the samples were multiply characterized and the adsorption characteristics including kinetics selectivity and isotherms of phosphate and nitrate on the resultant nanocomposite were investigated 2

ltd 2 2 synthesis of laomt the original mt 5 g was added slowly into 100 ml of 20 mmol l lacl3 aqueous solution and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 4 h to get the la3 exchanged mt afterwards the solid was collected through filtration and re dispersed in 100 ml deionized water to precipitate la3 through dropwise adding 0 5 mol l naoh to ph of 11 5 5 after precipitating for 20 h at 25 c the solid was separated and dispersed in 100 ml of 45 5 mmol l gemini surfactant solution for further organic modification the mixture was shaken for 15 h at 25 c and the slurry like product was washed dried and ground to obtain the final composite laomt with the particle size smaller than 150 Î¼m in diameter 2 3 characterization of the original mt and laomt powder x ray diffraction xrd was

a nicolet is5 spectrometer thermo scientific massachusetts usa through averaging 64 scans with the resolution of 4 cm 1 thermogravimetric analysis tg dtg was performed on a thermal gravimetric

electron microscopy tem tecnai g2 20 fei oregon usa operated at 20 and 200 kv respectively the content of gemini surfactant was determined on an elemental analyzer cs744 leco michigan usa 2 4 batch adsorption experiments the stock solutions of 10 mmol l phosphate and nitrate were prepared through dissolving the appropriate amount of kh2po4 and kno3 in deionized water respectively and the working solutions were prepared through specific dilution of the stock solutions for the tests of adsorption kinetics 20 mg of laomt or phoslock was suspended in 25 ml of 0 1 mmol l phosphate and nitrate solution in a 40 ml polyethylene vial the sealed vials were shaken 150 rpm under 25 c per the experimental protocol a vial was fetched at the desired time for sampling after filtration through the 0 45 Î¼m cellulose membrane the concentrations of phosphate and nitrate in the filtrate were measured by spectrophotometric methods 6 33 using a spectrophotometer l5 inesa shanghai china the amount of adsorbed phosphate and nitrate at the designed time was calculated from the differences between the initial and final concentrations based on the experimental results the pseudo first order model eq 1 pseudo second order model eq 2 and elovich model eq 3 were used to clarify the adsorption characteristics 34 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 2 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t 3 q t 1 Î² ln Î± Î² 1 Î² ln t where q e and q t mmol g denote the amount of phosphate or nitrate adsorbed at equilibrium and time t min respectively k 1 min 1 k 2 g mmol 1 min 1 and Î± mmol g 1 min 1 represent the rate constants of corresponding models and Î² g mmol 1 is the adsorption constant of elovich model the selectivity of laomt to phosphate and nitrate were studied through mixing with several ubiquitous co existing anions chloride carbonate and sulfate in the same concentration 0 1 mmol l the influence of these co existing anions on the adsorption kinetics of phosphate and nitrate was also addressed through comparing with the case without interference to understand the possible synergistic or antagonistic effects between phosphate and nitrate in terms of their adsorption performance four systems were established namely when the initial concentration of one adsorbate was fixed at low n 0 0 165 0 048 mm p 0 0 150 0 003 mm or high concentrations n 0 3 16 0 039 mm p 0 4 09 0 099 mm and that of another adsorbate was varied within 0 3 7 mm these batch mode experiments were carried out with the solid liquid ratio of 20 mg 25 ml at 25 c for 24 h to ensure the equilibrium the solid separated from the solution with high concentrations of phosphate and nitrate n 0 3 69 mm p 0 4 06 mm was freeze dried for characterization to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of laomt 3 1 1 x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the original mt and laomt samples are shown in fig 1 a the starting sample shows the characteristic diffraction peaks of mt and in which the cristobalite and quartz as impurities were also detected 23 however combined with the results of cec measurement calcium mt should be the dominant component of the starting sample the 001 reflection at 2Î¸ 5 7 of the original mt corresponds to a 0 58 nm distance of interlayer space where the hydrated calcium ions are accommodated 35 loading of lanthanum and gemini surfactants expanded the interlayer space as supported by the smaller 2Î¸ values of 001 reflection of laomt 3 4 and 4 9 inset of fig 1 a two 001 reflections suggest the heterogeneity of laomt resulting from the different configurations of the intercalated gemini surfactants combined with the distance of interlayer space of laomt and the size of gemini surfactant used 31 it can be inferred that the reflection at 2Î¸ 3 4 was likely to caused by the pseudo trilayer and or paraffin like monolayer configurations and the latter 2Î¸ 4 9 might be attributed to the lateral configuration laco3oh as the predominant crystalline phase of lanthanum in laomt was observed which was caused by the exposure of la oh 3 to co2 in the air during the synthetic procedure 36 37 3 1 2 ftir spectra ftir spectrum of the original mt sample shows the characteristic peaks of the mt layer and the physically adsorbed water fig 1 b and the relative intensities of those vibration bands changed after modification the intensity ratio of the symmetric vibration band of hydroxyl from metal hydroxyl interactions Î½ s moh to that from physically adsorbed water Î½ s hoh increased which was ascribed to the formation of laoh and the increased hydrophobicity the successful loading of gemini surfactant on mt was supported by the appearance of the intensive vibration bands of ch2 at 2923 2852 and 1471 cm 1 increasing the hydrophobicity of the resultant product 38 after separation of the peak approximately at 1475 cm 1 the inset of fig 1 b except the bending vibration of ch2 Î´ ch2 at 1471 cm 1 two additional weak bands at 1497 and 1415 cm 1 assigned to the carbonate of laco3oh were obtained 36 this further evidenced that the lanthanum is mainly presenting as laco3oh phase and the amount of laco3oh is relatively small in synthesized laomt 3 1 3 tg dtg analyses dehydration of samples resulted in the mass loss in the first stage 25 170 c fig 2 and there were two peaks in the dtg curves for both the original mt and laomt the peaks displayed at relatively low temperatures 44 and 61 c were caused by the physically adsorbed water and those at 85 and 132 c of laomt and the original mt were attributed to the decomposition of laco3oh eq 4 and the dehydration of hydrated calcium ions respectively 37 39 compared to the physically adsorbed water the hydration water of calcium ions was much smaller probably because the used ca mt was not stocked in the desiccator notably the observed dehydration temperatures are relatively high and could be influenced by sample property and experimental conditions for instance the sample with larger size and more densely packed showed higher dehydration temperatures 40 in this dehydration stage the mass loss decreased from 15 of the original mt to 4 6 of modified mt because the loading of gemini surfactant increased the hydrophobicity in the following stage 170 500 c the decomposition of gemini surfactant and dehydroxylation of the lanthanum compounds eq 5 cooperatively contributed to the mass loss 31 37 the gemini surfactant in laomt decomposed stepwise was caused by the different distribution and existing types according to the decomposition of octadecyl trimethyl ammonium modified mt 41 peaks were observed in three temperature ranges i e 170 205 c 270 290 c and 370 385 c resulting from the decomposition of the external adsorbed surfactants interlayer adsorbed surfactant molecules and intercalated surfactant cations respectively thus in this study the sharp peak at 250 c and the broad peak 445 c of dtg curves were likely attributed to the decomposition of surfactants located on the external surface and in the interlayer space respectively the higher decomposition temperatures of laomt could be ascribed to the different thermal properties of used surfactants dehydroxylation of mt layers 630 c and decarbonization of la2o2co3 eq 6 accounted for the mass loss in the third stage 500 800 c 4 laco3oh la2o co3 2 xh2o yh2o 5 la2o co3 2 xh2o la2o2co3 xh2o co2 6 la2o2co3 la2o3 co2 3 1 4 morphology observation tem images of the original mt and laomt were shown in fig 3 flake like aggregates with lamellar structure and ridged edges are observed for the original mt fig 3 a and the modification visibly expanded the interlayer space and maintained the fine layered structure fig 3 d however the estimated distances of interlayer space of original mt and laomt by tem images are smaller with respect to by xrd patterns which was the same as reported results and ascribed to the tilted rather than the vertical distribution of the 00 l planes of observed particles 31 different from the reported rod and or wafer like morphology 36 several nanosized particles of laco3oh with different shapes were observed in resultant laomt fig 3 e as shown in fig 3 f and g the homogeneous distribution of br and la implied the successful modification of mt by the lanthanum and gemini surfactants adsorption of phosphate and nitrate insignificantly influences the morphology of laomt fig 3 e and h 3 2 simultaneous adsorption characteristics of phosphate and nitrate on laomt 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics of phosphate and nitrate on laomt are shown in fig 4 and the parameters for the three models used for fitting of the experimental data are summarized in table 1 phosphate adsorption on laomt increased rapidly within the first 90 min and the rate was significantly decreased in the following 150 min however the equilibrium was still not reached after 240 min in contrast the equilibrium of nitrate uptake was achieved within 20 min the much higher rate constants k 1 k 2 and Î± further supported the faster adsorption rate of nitrate than phosphate based on the values of the correlation coefficients r 2 and rss the adsorption of phosphate was well fitted by the elovich model which was generally used to describe a biphasic reaction process including the initial prompt sorption and followed slow accumulation 34 the fitting result suggests that phosphate uptake was a diffusion limited process because some adsorption sites of phosphate were embedded and became gradually available through the hydration of laomt in solutions the good fitting of nitrate uptake by the pseudo second order model indicated that the chemisorption dominated the adsorption process which might involve the valency forces through sharing or exchanging electrons between adsorbate and adsorbent 8 42 a similar result was also reported on the adsorption of nitrate by hexadecyl pyridinium modified mt 11 3 2 2 adsorption selectivity chloride carbonate and sulfate ions generally coexist with phosphate and nitrate in the aquatic environment and their influences on adsorption of phosphate and nitrate on laomt are shown in fig 5 apart from the sulfate ion other anions negligibly affected the adsorption kinetics and the amount of adsorbed phosphate or nitrate because the positively charged head groups in the gemini surfactant r4n are non specific anion binding sites the affinity of studied anions to the adsorption sites obeys the hofmeister order i e po4 3 co3 2 so4 2 cl br no3 30 with the same concentration sulfate cannot exchange the counterion bromide and is hard to pose effects on nitrate uptake however this proposal contradicted to the experimental results where nitrate uptake was increased when sulfate co existed this phenomenon can be rationalized by the relatively large ion size 0 218 nm and high hydration energy 1090 kj mol of sulfate 30 which would facilitate the hydration of laomt and expose more available r4n sites increasing the amount of nitrate adsorbed 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms to obtain the maximum uptakes of laomt for phosphate and nitrate the adsorption isotherms were conducted tables s1 and s2 when the initial concentration of nitrate was maintained constant i e 0 165 or 3 16 mm the isotherms of phosphate uptake show l type curves fig 6 a indicating the high affinity at the beginning with the increase of concentration the adsorption sites were progressively occupied and it became difficult to find available sites for phosphate the maximum monolayer adsorption capacities of laomt to phosphate predicted by the langmuir model were 0 392 and 0 358 mmol g for two systems with the different initial concentrations of nitrate respectively the fitting parameters are summarized in table s2 the insignificant difference 0 034 mmol g suggests the negligible influence of nitrate on phosphate uptake in contrast the adsorption isotherms of nitrate when mixed with different initial concentrations of phosphate exhibit the s shaped curves suggesting the relatively low affinity of nitrate to laomt at low nitrate concentrations increasing to a certain concentration the slop was increased rapidly and achieved a plateau this tendency was well fitted by the sips isotherm model fig 6 b and table s2 the observed phenomenon could be attributed to the cooperative adsorption 43 and the exposure of embedded ion exchanging sites r4n in laomt via hydration swelling driven by concentration gradients of phosphate and nitrate 3 3 adsorption mechanism the intensive peak of p 2p orbit after adsorption suggests the successful phosphate uptake fig 7 which was also supported by the homogeneous distribution of phosphorus in laomt fig 3 j moreover the decreased ratio of peak intensity of Î½ s moh to Î½ si o si and the appearance of the intensive peak assigned to the la o stretching vibration at 498 cm 1 after phosphate adsorption implied the occurrence of ligand exchange eq 7 fig 8 due to the higher affinity of phosphate with respect to hydroxyl to lanthanum 44 although the binding energy of la 3d was not changed after adsorption fig 7 the blue shift assigned to phosphate vibration from 1300 to 1279 cm 1 45 fig 8 should be ascribed to the complexation of phosphate with lanthanum lanthanum existed as laco3oh phase in the resultant laomt fig 1 a and the evaluated point of zero charge phzpc of laco3oh is 9 8 46 this is higher than the solution ph of 5 0 0 2 suggesting that the electrostatic interaction eq 8 might also partially be responsible for uptake of phosphate mainly in h2po4 species fig s2 ion exchange with the counterion br of gemini surfactant seems not available considering the higher hydration energy of phosphate with respect to br 7 la oh2 h2po4 la h2po4 h2o 8 la oh2 h2po4 la oh2 h2po4 different from phosphate uptake nitrate uptake on laomt should be mainly attributed to the ion exchange with the counterion 1 11 the disappearance of the peak for br 3d orbit fig 7 and the appearance of no stretching vibration at 1385 cm 1 fig 8 suggests the completion of the ion exchange process eq 9 between nitrate and br 47 such a process could occur readily because some of the r4n sites distributed on the external surface and would interact with nitrate rapidly 41 showing the high adsorption rate table 1 however the adsorption kinetics and capacities of anions onto organo mt were affected by surfactant configuration associated with the molecular structure and the amount of surfactant used for synthesis 31 48 49 the compact surfactant configuration corresponds to the poor swelling property of modified mt derived from the rehydration process consequently the slower adsorption kinetics were observed due to more time consumed on rehydration of adsorbent and traveling of target anion to the newly exposed ion exchanging sites in addition because of the poorer swelling property some ion exchanging sites embedded might be hard to access decreasing the adsorption capacity 9 r4n br no3 r4n no3 br the poorly hydrated anions would replace mt layers to interact with r4n sites which strongly depends on the ion concentration 50 as shown in fig 7 the nitrogen atoms in gemini surfactants demonstrate two binding energies e b corresponding to the interactions with inorganic anions 402 1 ev and mt layers 399 4 ev respectively the intensity ratio of i 402 i 399 increased from 1 75 to 4 58 after adsorption suggesting the replacement of mt layers by nitrate eq 10 the process occurrence was accompanied by the change of configuration and or distribution of gemini surfactant as supported by the increased intensity ratio of i 286 2 i 284 6 fig 7 if all interactions between r4n and mt layers were disintegrated by nitrate the maximum uptake of nitrate on laomt would be 0 87 mmol g eq 11 with a c e around 3 0 mm nitrate uptake is close to the proposed maximum value fig 6 to get a complete exchange of mt by nitrate is unlikely to occur considering the spatial restriction of gemini surfactants in mt interlayers this can be supported by the presence of r4n mt interaction after adsorption n 1s orbit in fig 7 thus other mechanisms might contribute to nitrate uptake such as electrostatic attraction by positively charged laco3oh and or existing as nitrate salt in interlayer space 51 52 10 r4n mt no3 r4n no3 mt 11 f 1000 w w 2 n n n c m c 0 87 mmol g where w is the total carbon content w 16 9 obtained from elemental analysis w 2 refers to the carbon content derived from

and m c represents the carbon weight m c 12 g mol 3 4 comparison with other adsorbents because the adsorption rate of contaminants on adsorbent is crucial for evaluating the feasibility in practical treatment of wastewater the synthesized laomt was compared with commercial phoslock in terms of adsorption kinetics of phosphate as depicted in fig 4 it is comparable regarding the time spent on reaching the saturation of phosphate uptake on laomt and phoslock this was also supported by the similar rate constant of phosphate uptake k 2 listed in tables 1 and s3 notably the amount of adsorbed phosphate on laomt was slightly lower than that on phoslock at equilibrium which could be ascribed to the different amounts and properties of adsorption sites 1 phoslock was synthesized through repeatedly soaking high purity bentonite in 0 1 mmol l lacl3 solution with a solid liquid mass ratio of 1 100 and mt was dispersed in 0 02 mmol l lacl3 solution in the solid liquid mass ratio of 1 20 for one time to get the starting la3 exchanged mt the lanthanum content in phoslock 4 4 5 wt is higher than that in the final laomt 2 27 wt estimated by sem eds 2 lanthanum existed as ionic la3 and crystalline laco3oh in phoslock and laomt respectively and the former would readily precipitate with phosphate as rhabdophane lapo4 nh2o 20 whereas electrostatic attraction phzpc 9 8 phsolution 5 0 and or ligand exchange between hydroxide and phosphate are responsible for phosphate uptake on the later thus the lanthanum species is another factor affecting phosphate removal significantly compared with several adsorbents developed in recent years for simultaneous removal of phosphate and nitrate table 2 such as fe modified chitosan carbon beads 34 zirconium oxyhydroxide capped chitosan kaolin framework 53 la doped magnetic rgo nanocomposites 6 chitosan grafted quaternized resin 47 etc laomt showed comparable adsorption capacities and even at low concentration of adsorbate the adsorption performance was stably maintained against the co existing competitive anions fig 5 in addition laomt could be readily synthesized as mentioned earlier adsorption of phosphate and nitrate on laomt are mainly attributed to the compositions of laco3oh and gemini surfactants however compared with laomt the physically mixed laco3oh particles and gemini surfactant modified mt may show poorer adsorption performance for phosphate and nitrate considering that the nano sized laco3oh particles would be hard to separate from aqueous solution and readily influenced by the ubiquitously existing organic matter in the practical water environment in the laomt composite laco3oh particles were well distributed on mt that possesses the large surface area fig 3 g and the gemini surfactant generated steric hindrance that would mitigate the negative effects of large organic matter thus further optimization from perspectives including the effect of ubiquitously present humic acid 54 lanthanum content and species the molecular structure of gemini surfactant and dosage of lanthanum to gemini surfactant should be performed to meet the needs of the treatment of various contaminated water bodies with different phosphate and nitrate concentrations 4 conclusions the laco3oh gemini surfactant modified montmorillonite laomt was developed for simultaneous adsorption of phosphate and nitrate according to the experimental results and the langmuir fitting the adsorption capacities of laomt to nitrate and phosphate were 0 84 and 0 39 mmol g respectively compared with the commercial phoslock laomt showed comparable adsorption performance even at low phosphate concentration p 0 0 1 mm ligand exchange with hydroxyl and electrostatic attraction on the positively charged laco3oh accounted for the removal of phosphate nitrate uptake was mainly ascribed to the electrostatic interaction with r4n and might be partially attributed to electrostatic attraction by laco3oh and or formation of inorganic salt in interlayer space the presence of phosphate facilitated the hydration of laomt increasing nitrate uptake excellent adsorption performance of laomt to phosphate and nitrate suggests the feasibility for remediation of the contaminated water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
