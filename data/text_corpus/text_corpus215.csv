role on plankton abundance the present study has been aimed to devise an alternative strategy for integrated assessment of plankton abundance in riverine system to accomplish this integrated modeling strategy has been applied considering a case of tropical river narmada in india very often the plankton abundance is recorded in count phytoplankton cell density or zooplankton abundance and typical

hydrologic distance on the phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance of river 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located along the river narmada locally known as rewa which is one of the large fluvial hydro systems of the country india having catchment area of 94 235 km2 it is the fifth longest and the largest west flowing river which flows through the central states viz madhya pradesh gujarat and maharashtra in india the river has experienced various morpho ecological alterations such as abolishment of the shallow marsh lands facilitating formation of slow moving riverine environment unni 1996 destruction of feeding and spawning ground of many fishes bhaumik et al 2017 removal of forest cover kale 2002 water quality change malviya and dwivedi 2015 patel et al 2015 damages in the river course and its associated ecosystems unni 1996 thereby it has received attention of geo morphologists and ecologists for the present study information pertinent to study area and data was collected from published report singh 2009 that was emanated from an exploratory survey conducted by icar central inland fisheries research institute on the river narmada during the year 1998 1999 according to this report the study area was extended from amarkantak latitude 22 45 n longitude 81 43 e to bhadbhut latitude 21 41 n longitude 72 51 e the sampling sites were distributed over different physiographic divisions of i mandla uplands ii satpura range iii vindhyan scarp iv nimad plateau v dhar uplands vi chota udaipur highlands and vii bharooch plains and a total of 28 sampling sites were selected after dividing the river length into four stretches described in table 1 and depicted in fig 1 2 2 plankton and water quality data we intended to characterize and predict plankton abundance phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance with respect to the river aquatic environment in terms of the water quality and longitudinal distance for this

hardness th mgl 1 chloride mgl 1 phosphate mgl 1 nitrate mgl 1 and silicate mgl 1 representing physico chemical attributes of water and plankton abundance phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance were selected from the same published report singh 2009 the minimum and maximum values were available for each of the above variables and we have taken the mean value to maintain uniformity of the data for each variables longitudinal distance data was generated in the present study as described in the following subsection 2 3 generation of hydrologic distance data precise estimation of hydrologic distance was generated through geo processing to represent the longitudinal distance since hydrologic distance connected through water flow is more pertinent to plankton abundance than areal distance in a riverine system first srtm dem data was downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov and processed to generate the river network from which the hydrologic distance matrix was computed using the network analyst tool under arc gis 9 3 esri 2008 this facilitated to compute desired cumulative hydrologic distance from the origin amarkantak to the end bhadbhut of study area thus total river main channel length and the length of the study stretch were computed as 1506 34 km and 1357 38 km respectively resulting in 90 of the total river length being covered in the investigation 2 4 model based analytical framework best suitable multivariate analyses were used to quantify the influences of water quality parameters on the phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance the analytical strategy involved two key statistical techniques fig 2 first hierarchical cluster analysis technique was carried out for grouping the sampling sites on the basis of similarity of water quality parameters then regression modeling was applied to assess simultaneously the influence of water quality parameters on the phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance and to unravel their longitudinal pattern typically multiple linear regression is used to accomplish this but predictive power and precision of the estimates of parameters depends highly on two vital assumptions firstly the relationship between response variable phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance and explanatory variables water quality parameters and longitudinal distance is assumed to be linear but rivers and streams may be regarded as a hierarchical system of patches that differ in age size and environmental conditions thereby plankton colonization along longitudinal distance may not be monotonically increasing or decreasing secondly response variable here phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance is assumed to be normally distributed and shapiro wilk s test has been applied to check this normality assumption so we looked beyond multiple linear regression and generalized additive model gam was specifically chosen for modelling to capture nonlinear relationship of unknown functional form further we assumed poisson error distribution of the plankton abundance which is more reasonable than normal distribution mathematically gam wood and augustin 2002 for count data as in the present case is written as y i p o i s s o n λ i log λ i f d i β 1 x 1 β p x p where yi is the plankton count λi is the mean phytoplankton cell density or zooplankton count f is unknown functional form of distance of i th site from the first site amarkantak βj j 1 2 p is regression coefficient corresponding to the xj th explanatory variables here water quality parameters while non linear component f d facilitates prediction against hydrologic distance discounting the effect of explanatory variables the estimates regression coefficients enable to quantify the influence of x1 x2 xn here water quality parameters after accommodating spatial dependence through f d number of water quality parameters thirteen in the present case recorded at each site were relatively large number with respect to 28 sites only moreover in riverine aquatic ecosystem multicollinearity among water quality parameters arises due to spatial dependence and the interdependency among the water quality parameters these lead to overfitting and produce misleading results the presence of multicollinearity was detected by examining the simple correlation matrix we employed variance inflation factor vif analysis to overcome multicolinearity so that data interpretation in terms of original variables became feasible the relative importance of water quality parameter of final model was computed by the square of standardized regression coefficient corresponding to each parameter all the statistical analyses were executed by using r software r core team 2015 environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 plankton distribution primary production in an aquatic ecosystem mainly depends upon the phytoplankton biomass in the present study plankton abundance exhibited the horizontal variations phyto and zooplankton in the selected stretches of narmada river the average cellular density of phytoplankton recorded varied from 32 to 203 cells l 1 in the stretch of amarkantak to gadarwada 258 to 515 cells l 1 in the stretch from gadarwada to harsud 76 to 207 cells l 1 in the stretch from harsud to surpan and 63 to 1161 cells l 1 in the stretch below surpan to gulf of cambay during the study period compositions based on cell counts of four major bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae cyanophyceae and dinophyceae algal classes chlorophyceae 48 79 shared highest followed by bacillariophyceae 34 84 across the stretches fig 3 a similarly five major groups copepoda rotifera cladocera protozoa and ostracoda of zooplankton copepods 35 07 and rotifers 20 30 dominated across the stretches fig 3 b sharma et al 2015 reported the dominant compositions of phytoplankton in order of chlorophyceae 47 cyanophyceae 27 bacillariophyceae 23 and euglenophyceae 3 at dogarwadaghat of river narmada among zooplankton rotifers showed highest dominance 36 8 followed by cladocerans 21 05 copepods 21 05 and protozoans 14 47 with the least contribution of ostracods 6 58 in river narmada yadava et al 2018 sharma and mankodi 2011 had also reported similar pattern of occurrence in zooplankton communities protozoans and arthropods which corroborated to the present findings 3 2 clustering of sites the hierarchical cluster analysis has revealed the existence of six statistical clusters fig 4 based on similarity among thirteen physico chemical water quality parameters downstream wise six statistically coherent clusters formed are as follows 1 amarkantak dindori 2 mandla gadarwada 3 sandia mola 4 maheshwar surpan 5 vedgam ankleshwar and 6 shakkarpura bhadbhut fig 1 though the sampling sites were physically divided into four stretches two extra clusters have been formed fig 4 fig 1 and as expected they belong to separate physio graphic zones shakkarpura bhadbhut has been fragmented from l4 stretch that may be due to the effect of industrial effluent induced pollution to the downstream resulting in distinct group these six statistical clusters bear significance for future reference of data collection strategies for dividing the stretches more objectively and precisely the cluster specific mean and standard deviation of 13 physico chemical parameters has been presented intable 2 it has been observed that clusters 4 5 and 6 are relatively warmer than the others the transparency of cluster 5 and 3 are relatively higher than the others cluster 1 has high instability of transparency due to insufficient number of sampling sites only two due to the tidal ingress of saline water specific conductivity is relatively higher in the sixth cluster than the others the elevated chloride level table 2 of cluster 6 provides an indication of pollution this is evident due to the industrial effluents discharge from ankaleshwar and bharooch silicates level increases from cluster 1 to cluster 6 which has been formed according to elevation along the river flows this may be due to the fact that numerous stream flows associated in the system in upstream rocky regions have induced the elevated silicate along the downstream flows of the river sharma and subramanian 2008 showed the influence of rock weathering on the concentration of major ions in the surface water of river narmada and tapti which is also in conformity with our findings with higher silicate values 6 0 17 36 mgl 1 3 3 effect of river environmental factors on plankton abundance the shapiro wilk s test has established the non normality of the distribution of both the phytoplankton cell density test statistic w 0 844 p value 0 01 and zooplankton abundance test statistic w 0 706 p value 0 01 indicating towards alternative modeling other than classical multiple regression significant correlation is observed among the 13 water quality parameters table 3 for example high statistically significant correlation between total hardness versus calcium and total hardness versus phosphate are 0 88 and 0 79 respectively this result has provided evidence of multicolinearity among the water quality parameters the range of vif values lies between 2 64 and 22 06 in general vif values between 5 and 10 and the same above 10 are suspected to have moderate and high multicolinearity effect respectively thus the parameters temperature transparency total alkalinity and nitrate with vif values 5 05 4 35 4 16 and 3 10 respectively are good enough to explain the water quality variability in the study area after eliminating the moderate and high multicolinearity effect in view of the results from vif four key filtered physico chemical water quality parameters have been incorporated for model building in addition nonlinear function of cumulative hydrologic distance has been incorporated in gam framework the gam explained 66 and 88 deviance of phytoplankton and zooplankton density respectively table 4 it is observed that temperature and transparency have positive significant effect total alkalinity and nitrate have negative effect on the plankton abundance table 4 in case of zooplankton temperature has positive significant effect and nitrate has negative significant effect according to relative importance order of influence of water quality parameters are as follows transparency nitrate temperature total alkalinity for phytoplankton cell density and temperature nitrate transparency total alkalinity for zooplankton abundance table 4 the nonlinear effect of hydrologic distance from the highest altitude has been found to be statistically significant for both the phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance it has been predicted that middle portion of the river stretch has relatively higher plankton abundance figs 5 and 6 than that in upper and lower stretches in view of river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 phytoplankton production and abundance is regulated mainly by discharge which is related to residence time channel depth and dilution rate and affects water transparency and sedimentation process reynolds 1995 their development is favoured by presence of lower grazing pressure by the zooplankton and less sedimentation rate in large rivers cole et al 1992 gosselain et al 1998 the middle portion of the river is expected to have high resident time of water facilitating growth of plankton communities which has resulted relatively high plankton abundance similar pattern was found in case of congo river descy et al 2016 without providing any prediction bhaumik et al 2017 reported the percentage contributions of three major algal groups bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae were varied in time and space which was mainly influenced by the abiotic factors like temperature total alkalinity and nutrients in narmada river the author reported in total 111 zooplankton species from upper and middle zones where zooplankton abundance was higher 59 3132 ind l 1 in upper stretch compared to middle stretches 8 3 14 4 ind l 1 we have not only identified the longitudinal pattern of plankton abundance but have provided model based prediction after noise reduction due to the effect of water quality parameters with reasonable accuracy 66 and 88 deviance of phytoplankton and zooplankton density respectively this is the novelty of the present study in comparison to previous studies where only observatory explanation has been provided present investigation has identified four key influential physico chemical parameters temperature transparency alkalinity and nitrate for phytoplankton in the studied river of these transparency has had highest influence followed by nitrate temperature and alkalinity on phytoplankton density transparency secchi depth defines the potential photic zone of a water body which is responsible for primary productivity and trophic status of the hydro ecosystem carlson 1977 moreover positive impact of elevated water temperature on photosynthetic activity and phytoplankton biomass such as diatom and blue green algae have also been reported from low land aquatic ecosystem and associated water bodies roger and kulasooriya 1980 sobrino and neale 2007 water temperature has major influence on phytoplankton productions schabhüttl et al 2013 investigated in controlled laboratory conditions of exposing taxa composition to constant temperature of 12 c 18 c and 24 c the combined effect of temperature and diversity of phytoplankton growth of monoculture and mixed communities of species richness the authors observed the increased species richness had positive effect on phytoplankton growth rate and phosphorous content in all temperature levels with maximum values occurring at 18 c higher temperatures resulted in higher fractions of cyanobacteria in phytoplankton communities where green algae and diatoms performed better at lower temperature denicola 1996 schabhüttl et al 2013 rasconi et al 2015 has also reported that warming of aquatic ecosystems by 3 c may shift to the planktonic food web functioning more dominated by fast growing small sized species their study detected that late summer fall period favoured the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic picophytoplankton urrea clos et al 2014 depicted the influential pattern of various environmental factors on benthic chl a distribution in a watershed of guadiana river which showed positive correlation between benthic algal biomass and total alkalinity in their benthic biomass model in contrast our findings have shown negative effect on the phytoplankton which may be due to rocky habitat of the river bed nitrate is one of the key nutrients which are utilized by phyplankton community for their physiological growth and development thomaz et al 2004 and moritsch et al 2011 reported negative correlation between phytoplankton community and nitrate in an ecological survey in associated ecosystem of parana river and in the san francisco bay respectively which is in line to our present findings the species diversity and biomass diversity of zooplankton are often used to determine the strength of a biological system they also can survive in a wide range of ecological condition in which various physico chemical parameters with temperature as limiting factor parmar et al 2016 the increase in temperature is more closely associated with the abundance and diversity of zooplankton in aquatic ecosystems castro et al 2005 park and marshall 2000 which corroborated with the present findings in a model based experiment gillooly 2000 addressed a relationship between generation time embryonic and post embryonic development and temperature among zooplankton group such as rotifera copepoda and cladocera and explained that the generation time was positively correlated with the body mass of calanoid copepod at 5 and 10 c and 20 c for cladocera dorak 2013 stated the increase in temperature coinciding maximum abundance of zooplankton with higher zooplankton diversity in lower sakarya river basin turkey similarly sohani 2015 reported considering plankton as a whole the peak growth during pre monsoon in narmada river with gradual increase in temperature which supports our present findings that temperature had an positive effect on zooplankton abundance spatio temporal variation of zooplankton especially in arthropods was mainly influenced by the impact of tidal water effluent discharges freshwater inflow nanda 2003 sharma and mankodi 2011 and macrophytes shukla and sholanki 2016 in narmada river the lower abundance of zooplankton observed as well as predictive abundance at ankaleswar in the present study might be due to the effect of huge industrial discharge into the river 4 conclusion we have demonstrated an alternative model aided analytical approach to study potamoplankton in relation to river environment to this end integrated assessment has been carried out to quantify influence of water quality parameter and hydrologic distance on plankton abundance in a riverine system the clusters emanated from this study can be helpful to devise sampling protocol for river ecological assessment for the first time this present study has made an attempt to assess the plankto environment interaction with the novel application of poisson modeling the unique character of this modeling approach is the inclusion of nonlinear function of hydrologic distance into the model this has facilitated 1 reasonably accurate prediction of plankton abundance against hydrologic distance with noise reduction due to water quality parameters and 2 simultaneous identification of most influential physico chemical parameters in order of relative importance to explain variability of plankton abundance after accommodating spatial dependence among sampling sites the applied gam model which has been very effective for explaining variability of plankton abundance in riverine system is a quite flexible and general and can easily be implemented on other riverine systems this model however has the limitation in quantitatively characterizing interaction among plankton species conflict of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest ethical statement the research was done according to ethical standards

abundance were selected from the same published report singh 2009 the minimum and maximum values were available for each of the above variables and we have taken the mean value to maintain uniformity of the data for each variables longitudinal distance data was generated in the present study as described in the following subsection 2 3 generation of hydrologic distance data precise estimation of hydrologic distance was generated through geo processing to represent the longitudinal distance since hydrologic distance connected through water flow is more pertinent to plankton abundance than areal distance in a riverine system first srtm dem data was downloaded from https earthexplorer usgs gov and processed to generate the river network from which the hydrologic distance matrix was computed using the network analyst tool under arc gis 9 3 esri 2008 this facilitated to compute desired cumulative hydrologic distance from the origin amarkantak to the end bhadbhut of study area thus total river main channel length and the length of the study stretch were computed as 1506 34 km and 1357 38 km respectively resulting in 90 of the total river length being covered in the investigation 2 4 model based analytical framework best suitable multivariate analyses were used to quantify the influences of water quality parameters on the phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance the analytical strategy involved two key statistical techniques fig 2 first hierarchical cluster analysis technique was carried out for grouping the sampling sites on the basis of similarity of water quality parameters then regression modeling was applied to assess simultaneously the influence of water quality parameters on the phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance and to unravel their longitudinal pattern typically multiple linear regression is used to accomplish this but predictive power and precision of the estimates of parameters depends highly on two vital assumptions firstly the relationship between response variable phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance and explanatory variables water quality parameters and longitudinal distance is assumed to be linear but rivers and streams may be regarded as a hierarchical system of patches that differ in age size and environmental conditions thereby plankton colonization along longitudinal distance may not be monotonically increasing or decreasing secondly response variable here phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance is assumed to be normally distributed and shapiro wilk s test has been applied to check this normality assumption so we looked beyond multiple linear regression and generalized additive model gam was specifically chosen for modelling to capture nonlinear relationship of unknown functional form further we assumed poisson error distribution of the plankton abundance which is more reasonable than normal distribution mathematically gam wood and augustin 2002 for count data as in the present case is written as y i p o i s s o n λ i log λ i f d i β 1 x 1 β p x p where yi is the plankton count λi is the mean phytoplankton cell density or zooplankton count f is unknown functional form of distance of i th site from the first site amarkantak βj j 1 2 p is regression coefficient corresponding to the xj th explanatory variables here water quality parameters while non linear component f d facilitates prediction against hydrologic distance discounting the effect of explanatory variables the estimates regression coefficients enable to quantify the influence of x1 x2 xn here water quality parameters after accommodating spatial dependence through f d number of water quality parameters thirteen in the present case recorded at each site were relatively large number with respect to 28 sites only moreover in riverine aquatic ecosystem multicollinearity among water quality parameters arises due to spatial dependence and the interdependency among the water quality parameters these lead to overfitting and produce misleading results the presence of multicollinearity was detected by examining the simple correlation matrix we employed variance inflation factor vif analysis to overcome multicolinearity so that data interpretation in terms of original variables became feasible the relative importance of water quality parameter of final model was computed by the square of standardized regression coefficient corresponding to each parameter all the statistical analyses were executed by using r software r core team 2015 environment 3 results and discussion 3 1 plankton distribution primary production in an aquatic ecosystem mainly depends upon the phytoplankton biomass in the present study plankton abundance exhibited the horizontal variations phyto and zooplankton in the selected stretches of narmada river the average cellular density of phytoplankton recorded varied from 32 to 203 cells l 1 in the stretch of amarkantak to gadarwada 258 to 515 cells l 1 in the stretch from gadarwada to harsud 76 to 207 cells l 1 in the stretch from harsud to surpan and 63 to 1161 cells l 1 in the stretch below surpan to gulf of cambay during the study period compositions based on cell counts of four major bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae cyanophyceae and dinophyceae algal classes chlorophyceae 48 79 shared highest followed by bacillariophyceae 34 84 across the stretches fig 3 a similarly five major groups copepoda rotifera cladocera protozoa and ostracoda of zooplankton copepods 35 07 and rotifers 20 30 dominated across the stretches fig 3 b sharma et al 2015 reported the dominant compositions of phytoplankton in order of chlorophyceae 47 cyanophyceae 27 bacillariophyceae 23 and euglenophyceae 3 at dogarwadaghat of river narmada among zooplankton rotifers showed highest dominance 36 8 followed by cladocerans 21 05 copepods 21 05 and protozoans 14 47 with the least contribution of ostracods 6 58 in river narmada yadava et al 2018 sharma and mankodi 2011 had also reported similar pattern of occurrence in zooplankton communities protozoans and arthropods which corroborated to the present findings 3 2 clustering of sites the hierarchical cluster analysis has revealed the existence of six statistical clusters fig 4 based on similarity among thirteen physico chemical water quality parameters downstream wise six statistically coherent clusters formed are as follows 1 amarkantak dindori 2 mandla gadarwada 3 sandia mola 4 maheshwar surpan 5 vedgam ankleshwar and 6 shakkarpura bhadbhut fig 1 though the sampling sites were physically divided into four stretches two extra clusters have been formed fig 4 fig 1 and as expected they belong to separate physio graphic zones shakkarpura bhadbhut has been fragmented from l4 stretch that may be due to the effect of industrial effluent induced pollution to the downstream resulting in distinct group these six statistical clusters bear significance for future reference of data collection strategies for dividing the stretches more objectively and precisely the cluster specific mean and standard deviation of 13 physico chemical parameters has been presented intable 2 it has been observed that clusters 4 5 and 6 are relatively warmer than the others the transparency of cluster 5 and 3 are relatively higher than the others cluster 1 has high instability of transparency due to insufficient number of sampling sites only two due to the tidal ingress of saline water specific conductivity is relatively higher in the sixth cluster than the others the elevated chloride level table 2 of cluster 6 provides an indication of pollution this is evident due to the industrial effluents discharge from ankaleshwar and bharooch silicates level increases from cluster 1 to cluster 6 which has been formed according to elevation along the river flows this may be due to the fact that numerous stream flows associated in the system in upstream rocky regions have induced the elevated silicate along the downstream flows of the river sharma and subramanian 2008 showed the influence of rock weathering on the concentration of major ions in the surface water of river narmada and tapti which is also in conformity with our findings with higher silicate values 6 0 17 36 mgl 1 3 3 effect of river environmental factors on plankton abundance the shapiro wilk s test has established the non normality of the distribution of both the phytoplankton cell density test statistic w 0 844 p value 0 01 and zooplankton abundance test statistic w 0 706 p value 0 01 indicating towards alternative modeling other than classical multiple regression significant correlation is observed among the 13 water quality parameters table 3 for example high statistically significant correlation between total hardness versus calcium and total hardness versus phosphate are 0 88 and 0 79 respectively this result has provided evidence of multicolinearity among the water quality parameters the range of vif values lies between 2 64 and 22 06 in general vif values between 5 and 10 and the same above 10 are suspected to have moderate and high multicolinearity effect respectively thus the parameters temperature transparency total alkalinity and nitrate with vif values 5 05 4 35 4 16 and 3 10 respectively are good enough to explain the water quality variability in the study area after eliminating the moderate and high multicolinearity effect in view of the results from vif four key filtered physico chemical water quality parameters have been incorporated for model building in addition nonlinear function of cumulative hydrologic distance has been incorporated in gam framework the gam explained 66 and 88 deviance of phytoplankton and zooplankton density respectively table 4 it is observed that temperature and transparency have positive significant effect total alkalinity and nitrate have negative effect on the plankton abundance table 4 in case of zooplankton temperature has positive significant effect and nitrate has negative significant effect according to relative importance order of influence of water quality parameters are as follows transparency nitrate temperature total alkalinity for phytoplankton cell density and temperature nitrate transparency total alkalinity for zooplankton abundance table 4 the nonlinear effect of hydrologic distance from the highest altitude has been found to be statistically significant for both the phytoplankton cell density and zooplankton abundance it has been predicted that middle portion of the river stretch has relatively higher plankton abundance figs 5 and 6 than that in upper and lower stretches in view of river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 phytoplankton production and abundance is regulated mainly by discharge which is related to residence time channel depth and dilution rate and affects water transparency and sedimentation process reynolds 1995 their development is favoured by presence of lower grazing pressure by the zooplankton and less sedimentation rate in large rivers cole et al 1992 gosselain et al 1998 the middle portion of the river is expected to have high resident time of water facilitating growth of plankton communities which has resulted relatively high plankton abundance similar pattern was found in case of congo river descy et al 2016 without providing any prediction bhaumik et al 2017 reported the percentage contributions of three major algal groups bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae were varied in time and space which was mainly influenced by the abiotic factors like temperature total alkalinity and nutrients in narmada river the author reported in total 111 zooplankton species from upper and middle zones where zooplankton abundance was higher 59 3132 ind l 1 in upper stretch compared to middle stretches 8 3 14 4 ind l 1 we have not only identified the longitudinal pattern of plankton abundance but have provided model based prediction after noise reduction due to the effect of water quality parameters with reasonable accuracy 66 and 88 deviance of phytoplankton and zooplankton density respectively this is the novelty of the present study in comparison to previous studies where only observatory explanation has been provided present investigation has identified four key influential physico chemical parameters temperature transparency alkalinity and nitrate for phytoplankton in the studied river of these transparency has had highest influence followed by nitrate temperature and alkalinity on phytoplankton density transparency secchi depth defines the potential photic zone of a water body which is responsible for primary productivity and trophic status of the hydro ecosystem carlson 1977 moreover positive impact of elevated water temperature on photosynthetic activity and phytoplankton biomass such as diatom and blue green algae have also been reported from low land aquatic ecosystem and associated water bodies roger and kulasooriya 1980 sobrino and neale 2007 water temperature has major influence on phytoplankton productions schabhüttl et al 2013 investigated in controlled laboratory conditions of exposing taxa composition to constant temperature of 12 c 18 c and 24 c the combined effect of temperature and diversity of phytoplankton growth of monoculture and mixed communities of species richness the authors observed the increased species richness had positive effect on phytoplankton growth rate and phosphorous content in all temperature levels with maximum values occurring at 18 c higher temperatures resulted in higher fractions of cyanobacteria in phytoplankton communities where green algae and diatoms performed better at lower temperature denicola 1996 schabhüttl et al 2013 rasconi et al 2015 has also reported that warming of aquatic ecosystems by 3 c may shift to the planktonic food web functioning more dominated by fast growing small sized species their study detected that late summer fall period favoured the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic picophytoplankton urrea clos et al 2014 depicted the influential pattern of various environmental factors on benthic chl a distribution in a watershed of guadiana river which showed positive correlation between benthic algal biomass and total alkalinity in their benthic biomass model in contrast our findings have shown negative effect on the phytoplankton which may be due to rocky habitat of the river bed nitrate is one of the key nutrients which are utilized by phyplankton community for their physiological growth and development thomaz et al 2004 and moritsch et al 2011 reported negative correlation between phytoplankton community and nitrate in an ecological survey in associated ecosystem of parana river and in the san francisco bay respectively which is in line to our present findings the species diversity and biomass diversity of zooplankton are often used to determine the strength of a biological system they also can survive in a wide range of ecological condition in which various physico chemical parameters with temperature as limiting factor parmar et al 2016 the increase in temperature is more closely associated with the abundance and diversity of zooplankton in aquatic ecosystems castro et al 2005 park and marshall 2000 which corroborated with the present findings in a model based experiment gillooly 2000 addressed a relationship between generation time embryonic and post embryonic development and temperature among zooplankton group such as rotifera copepoda and cladocera and explained that the generation time was positively correlated with the body mass of calanoid copepod at 5 and 10 c and 20 c for cladocera dorak 2013 stated the increase in temperature coinciding maximum abundance of zooplankton with higher zooplankton diversity in lower sakarya river basin turkey similarly sohani 2015 reported considering plankton as a whole the peak growth during pre monsoon in narmada river with gradual increase in temperature which supports our present findings that temperature had an positive effect on zooplankton abundance spatio temporal variation of zooplankton especially in arthropods was mainly influenced by the impact of tidal water effluent discharges freshwater inflow nanda 2003 sharma and mankodi 2011 and macrophytes shukla and sholanki 2016 in narmada river the lower abundance of zooplankton observed as well as predictive abundance at ankaleswar in the present study might be due to the effect of huge industrial discharge into the river 4 conclusion we have demonstrated an alternative model aided analytical approach to study potamoplankton in relation to river environment to this end integrated assessment has been carried out to quantify influence of water quality parameter and hydrologic distance on plankton abundance in a riverine system the clusters emanated from this study can be helpful to devise sampling protocol for river ecological assessment for the first time this present study has made an attempt to assess the plankto environment interaction with the novel application of poisson modeling the unique character of this modeling approach is the inclusion of nonlinear function of hydrologic distance into the model this has facilitated 1 reasonably accurate prediction of plankton abundance against hydrologic distance with noise reduction due to water quality parameters and 2 simultaneous identification of most influential physico chemical parameters in order of relative importance to explain variability of plankton abundance after accommodating spatial dependence among sampling sites the applied gam model which has been very effective for explaining variability of plankton abundance in riverine system is a quite flexible and general and can easily be implemented on other riverine systems this model however has the limitation in quantitatively

1076,the aim of the study was to assess the efficiency of mineral aggregates in orthophosphate op removal from hypolimentic water hw withdrawn from eutrophic lakes four p reactive materials were tested in sorption experiments light weight expanded aggregate leca zeolite zl dolomite dm and limestone ls the two materials proved to be most effective in op binding were ls and leca for these agents we conducted further investigations to reveal the effect of variable ph and temperature in the range commonly found in hw withdrawn from eutrophic lakes 6 0 8 0 and 5 15 c respectively kinetic studies under varying op concentrations 0 1 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 in synthetic solutions and hw were involved to check influence of hypolimnion chemistry on op fixation ls was the most efficient in op removal followed by leca dolomite and zeolite op sorption by ls and leca increased with decreasing ph and increasing temperature and was faster and higher in hw as compared to standard solution the results indicate that op fixation onto these materials would be most efficient in case of lakes with acidic and relatively warm bottom layer hypolimnion warming which is often observed in restored lakes will further enhance op removal use of ls mixed with leca was recommended for a potential treatment of hw withdrawn from eutrophic lakes op retention before hypolimnion transport downstream can mitigate side effects of hypolimnion removal by preventing eutrophication of receiving water bodies which can be regarded as substantial improvement of this lakes restoration method keywords hypolimnetic withdrawal phosphorus removal leca limestone calcite 1 introduction hypolimnion withdrawal is a restoration method developed for eutrophic stratified lakes and is based on selective removal of the near bottom water as hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes is enriched in phosphorus p and nitrogen n compounds coming from sedimentation and decay of organic matter as well as from sedimentary release withdrawal of water from this layer allows for enhanced nutrients export from the treated lake jeppesen et al 2009 hypolimnion is removed through a pipeline placed on the lake s bottom with inlet usually installed in the deepest part of the lake and outlet located in a downstream river or a creek as the pipeline can work as a siphon the method is considered simple and cost effective long term hypolimnion withdrawal usually leads to decline in p content in the bottom layer and extent of anoxia which results in reduced internal loading nürnberg 2007 jeppesen et al 2009 thus the method has been frequently applied for restoration of eutrophic lakes dunalska 2002 lathrop et al 2005 nürnberg 2005 2007 kostecki 2012 however hypolimnetic withdrawal can contribute to the pollution of downstream water bodies with nutrients and reduced substances such as hydrogen sulfide typically present in the eutrophic hypolimnion nürnberg 2007 jeppesen et al 2009 tandyrak et al 2016 thus treatment of the hypolimnetic water before its export to receiving water bodies is frequently required nürnberg 2007 as p is the main nutrient causing eutrophication of the surface waters corel 1998 dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 schindler et al 2016 its removal from hypolimnetic water is especially important to avoid degradation of downstream ecosystems phosphorus can be stripped from water by reactive materials showing availability to sorb inorganic dissolved p orthophosphate op reactive materials can be applied as sorption beds for op removal from wastewater and surface water in different types of constructed wetlands gajewska et al 2014 penn et al 2017 or as suspended reactive filters karczmarczyk and bus 2017 and for ground water purification as permeable reactive barriers izydoryczk et al 2013 frątczak et al 2019 however agent selection for op removal purposes should be carefully considered as available media exhibit wide range of sorption capacity johansson westholm 2006 vohla et al 2011 bus et al 2019 due to variability of physical properties such as surface area and grain size cucarella and renman 2009 as well as prevailing fixation mechanisms being determined by al fe and ca mg content in the material penn et al 2017 qin et al 2018 moreover sorption capacity of reactive materials is fundamentally influenced by reaction conditions such as contact time temperature ph and op concentration cucarella and renman 2009 moharami and jalali 2013 lyngsie et al 2014 dunets et al 2015 as well as chemistry of the target solution hedström and rastas 2006 sø et al 2011 thus in this work we tested four mineral aggregates as potential reactive materials for onsite op removal from hypolimnetic water light expanded clay aggregate leca and zeolite which are aluminium silicates rich in al and dolomite and limestone which are crushed carbonate rocks rich in ca mg the aim of the study was to assess p removal efficiency of the aggregates under op concentrations typically present in hypolimnetic water for the two selected materials we further investigated effect of ph and temperature on op removal to predict variability of their performance in potentially treated lakes kinetic studies under varying op concentrations in synthetic solutions and actual hypolimnetic water were involved to check influence of chemistry of the hypolimnion on op sorption for this purpose we used hypolimnetic water from lake kortowskie in olsztyn poland which was the first lake restored using hypolimentic withdrawal method dunalska 2002 dunalska et al 2007 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactive materials reactive materials were chosen from mineral aggregates easily available in poland light expanded clay aggregate leca zeolite zl dolomite dm and limestone lm the materials differ in their chemical and mineral composition bet surface area and porosity tables 1 and 2 leca and zl consist mainly of clay minerals aluminium silicates 91 main phases in leca are smektite illite and chlorite accompanied by quartz calcite and dolomite whereas zeolite is mainly composed of klinoptylolite mica and plagioclase with small share of crystalobarite and quartz consequently the elemental composition of leca and zl is dominated by si with considerable amount of al table 1 ls and dm are crushed sedimentary rocks from deposits in south western poland containing mainly carbonates calcium carbonate in form of calcite 96 and calcium magnesium carbonate in form of dolomite 98 respectively in terms of metal content ls composition is dominated by ca whereas in dm ca is accompanied by substantial amount of mg table 1 2 2 types of solutions performance of the reactive materials was tested in two types of solutions standard op solution and hypolimnetic water standard op solution was prepared by dissolving kh2po4 reagent grade dried to constant weight at 120 c in double distilled water to achieve op concentrations of 0 1 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 depending on the experimental step see section 2 4 ph of the standard solutions was adjusted to 7 0 0 05 using 1 m naoh and or 1 m hcl except for the step 2 where ph range 6 0 8 0 was employed table 4 hypolimnetic water was sampled from outlet of a withdrawal pipeline in the kortowskie lake located in olsztyn poland fig 1 at the end of july 2017 as middle summer represents period of the highest near bottom concentration of nutrients water removed from the hypolimnion is directed to a small stream kortówka fig 1 dunalska 2003 contributing to its eutrophication due to high p and n concentrations at the lake bottom dunalska 2002 tandyrak et al 2016 hypolimnetic water sampled for the experiments was characterised by low temperature nearly neutral ph and high op and ammonia concentration due to anoxia table 3 2 3 sorption experiments sorption experiments were performed to test op removal efficacy and its variability depending on ph and temperature experimental design was described in section 2 4 reactive materials were placed in polypropylene containers and shaken in the op containing solution 150 rpm at contact time varying in different experimental steps table 4 as previously described experiments were performed in two types of solution op standard solution and hypolimnetic water withdrawn from kortowskie lake for detailed information about the solutions see section 2 5 reaction time of 24 h was involved in all the experimental steps except for kinetic studies table 4 after shaking ph of the supernatant was measured see section 2 5 for details for subsequent determination of op concentration see section 2 5 the solution was centrifuged 4000 rpm 20 min and filtered through membrane cellulose filters 0 45 µm 2 4 experimental design experimental design included four steps of the sorption experiments table 4 to determine the most efficient reactive materials and their optimal dose step 1 all the aggregates were tested in the op standard solution using materials doses ranging from 50 to 500 g l 1 at the reaction time of 24 h for the media and dose selected in the first step leca and ls 100 g l 1 further experiments were performed in the op standard solution to investigate variability of op removal under ph and thermal conditions relevant for hypolimnetic waters withdrawn from eutrophic lakes step 2 tested ph values and temperature ranged from 6 0 to 8 0 and from 5 c to 20 c respectively table 4 this ph range and temperatures between 5 and 15 c represent conditions recorded in the hypolimnion layer and in hypolimnetic water outflowing from the pipelines installed in the restored lakes dunalska et al 2013 golterman 2004 lathrop et al 2005 nürnberg 2005 2007 temperature of 20 c was involved to ensure comparability of the results with available literature data as commonly applied procedure of sorption experiments refers to 20 c limousin et al 2007 step 3 focused on the kinetics of op sorption onto leca and ls under varying op concentrations 0 1 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 which cover the range typically recorded in the hypolimnion of the kortowskie lake 0 1 1 5 mg po4 3 l 1 dunalska et al 2007 maximum adsorption of leca and ls step 4 was determined in op standard solution and hypolimnetic water at the temperature of 10 c representing actual conditions in the water withdrawn from restored lakes as previously described and 20 c only op standard solution for comparison with literature data as already explained at the same gradient of op concentrations as employed in the step 3 0 1 to 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 2 5 chemical analysis ph was measured potentiometrically using standard electrodes epp 1 hanna instrument usa other measurements were performed in water samples filtered through cellulose membrane filters 0 45 µm op concentration was determined using molybdenum blue method according to the standard procedure pn en iso 6878 at the wavelength of 880 nm and optical path length of 50 mm with nanocolour uv vis spectrophotometer macherey nagel germany ionic composition of the hypolimnetic water table 3 was measured using hplc chromatography shimadzu analyser prominence system japan except for nh4 which was determined colourimetrically using merck hc 568916 test and sq 118 photometer merck germany at optical path length of 40 mm 2 6 data analysis the load of op removed from the solutions by unit mass of the reactive materials q was calculated as the difference in initial and final concentration according to the formula q c f c i v m where q is amount of op removed per unit mass of the reactive material mg g 1 ci and cf are initial and final op concentrations mg l 1 respectively v is solution volume l and m is mass of the reactive material g for quantitative description of op adsorption onto reactive materials and for determination of the theoretical maximum op adsorption the monolayer langmuir adsorption model was used the langmuir isotherm model is given by the following equation limousin et al 2007 q q m a x k c f 1 k c f where q mg g 1 is the amount of op adsorbed per unit mass of the reactive material at equilibrium qmax is the maximum adsorption mg g 1 k is adsorption energy coefficient l mg 1 and cf is the final op concentration mg l 1 3 results 3 1 selection of reactive material and dose efficacy of mineral aggregates in op removal from the solution was highly variable and dependent on the dose of the material fig 2 in the lowest dose 10 g l 1 all the aggregates showed similar op removal efficacy 14 20 however at higher additions leca and ls sorbed much more op than zl and dm for example at dose of 100 g l 1 corresponding removal rates were 88 98 63 and 75 further increase in material addition caused higher removal rates up to 98 for leca 81 for zl and 96 for dm at 300 g l 1 whereas efficacy of ls did not change removal rates accounted for 98 99 in the dose range of 100 300 g l 1 high reduction of op concentration by 90 was achieved when using leca and ls in relatively low dose of 100 g l 1 thus leca and ls were selected for further investigations as regarded to be potentially most efficient agents which could be used in hypolymnetic water treatment 3 2 effect of ph and temperature op sorption by both materials leca and ls was strongly affected by experimental conditions and increased with decreasing ph and increasing temperature of the solution fig 3 however clear enhancement of op removal was recorded only when temperature increased up to 15 and 20 c fig 3 whereas no difference was noted between 5 c and 10 c fig 3 a and b for leca the most important rise in op sorption was recorded when temperature increased from 5 10 c to 15 c fig 3 for example at initial ph 7 op removal increased from 35 to 36 5 10 c to 48 15 c and 53 20 c respectively in case of limestone op fixation was relatively stable within the temperature range 5 10 c and increased slightly at 15 c but the most pronounced increase took place at 20 c fig 3 b for example at initial ph 7 removal rates accounted for 52 53 at 5 10 c 57 at 15 c and 83 at 20 c both materials differed to some extent in their reaction to changing ph op sorption onto leca was much more sensitive to ph than onto limestone fig 3 a and b for example in the temperature of 5 c leca removed 1 7 times more op at initial ph 6 0 than at initial ph 8 0 the respective removal rates were 39 and 22 fig 3 a whereas for limestone the sorption was only 1 2 times higher corresponding removal rates were 55 and 46 fig 3 b the same relations were observed under higher temperatures fig 3 irrespectively of initial ph and temperature ls was much more efficient in op sorption than leca corresponding op removal rates were 48 91 and 24 75 depending on ph and temperature which confirms results derived from comparison of different doses of the materials fig 2 3 3 kinetics of op removal removal of op onto leca and limestone was strongly affected by contact time of the material with the solution and increased with prolonged reaction time fig 4 both materials however show different kinetic behaviour in standard solution leca removed only small amounts of op within first 6 h of the experiment 5 20 depending on initial op concentration but its efficiency rapidly increased after 12 h recorded removal rates ranged from 55 to 89 fig 4 a whereas efficiency of limestone was enhanced gradually fig 4 c as compared to standard solution in the hypolimnetic water a clear sorption acceleration can be seen fig 4 this effect was most profound in case of leca due to slow op fixation in a standard solution for example in a standard solution leca removed only 12 of the op after 6 h at initial concentration of 1 0 mg po4 3 l 1 whereas in hypolimnetic water two times higher removal of 21 was achieved after only 1 h fig 4 a and b for both materials favouring effect of hypolimnetic water on kinetics and rate of op sorption seems to become more important with increasing initial op concentration for example at contact time of 6 h and intermediate initial op concentration 1 0 mg po4 3 l 1 leca removed five times more op in hypolimnetic water 60 than in a standard solution 12 whereas at the highest initial op concentration 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 almost 10 fold difference in removal rates was recorded 48 in hypolimnetic water as compared to 5 in standard solution fig 4 a and b in case of ls at the intermediate initial op concentration 1 0 mg po4 3 l 1 contact time needed to achieve removal rate of 60 was 1 5 times longer in standard solution than in hypolimnetic water 6 h versus 4 h respectively whereas at the highest initial op concentration 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 the difference in time was 4 fold times needed were 24 h in a standard solution and 6 h in the hypolimnetic water fig 4 c and d kinetics of op removal is also reflected in changing course and slope of the sorption isotherms fig 5 prolonged time of the reaction resulted in increasing op loads and decreasing equilibrium concentration in the solution at the longest reaction times 12 and 24 h in hypolimnetic water initial slope of the isotherms for ls substantially increased fig 5 d indicating higher affinity of the material to op under these conditions the isotherms reveal again favouring effect of enhanced temperature on the op sorption onto leca and limestone fig 5 a and c 3 4 maximum adsorption capacity after reaction time of 24 h isotherms for leca and ls could be satisfactorily fitted using langmuir adsorption model table 5 theoretical maximum sorption calculated using langmuir equation 0 014 0 017 mg po4 3 g 1 for leca and 0 013 0 020 mg po4 3 g 1 for ls table 5 was slightly higher than the maximum loads obtained in our experiments 0 015 mg po4 3 g 1 except for ls in hypolimnetic water where the maximum load accounted for 0 017 mg po4 3 g 1 fig 5 d theoretical maximum sorption increased with temperature table 5 which confirms the promoting effect of temperature on op fixation onto these materials as observed in experimental step no 2 interestingly maximum sorption of leca and especially ls was higher in hypolimnetic water than in standard solution table 5 this indicates again that op binding onto these materials was favoured in the hypolimnetic water as compared to standard solution interestingly in standard solution at 20 c maximum sorption of leca was slightly higher than of ls whereas in the hypolimnetic water the relation was opposite table 5 4 discussion 4 1 sorption properties of leca and limestone maximum adsorption calculated based on langmuir model for leca 0 014 0 017 mg po4 3 g 1 table 5 is of similar order as obtained by yaghi and hartikainen 2013 who reported the maximum adsorption of 0 076 mg po4 3 g 1 in ph 7 in low op concentrations 0 0 61 mg po4 3 l 1 table 6 however these authors used much smaller grains 0 63 1 mm as compared to our study 10 30 mm which explains about 5 times higher sorption obtained in their work however other researchers reported distinctly higher op binding capacity of leca 0 3 36 7 mg po4 3 g 1 table 6 similarly maximum adsorption calculated in our study for limestone 0 013 0 020 mg po4 3 g 1 table 5 is substantially lower than maximum sorption usually reported in the literature table 6 this is probably due to the fact that most of the authors calculated maximum sorption based on the difference between initial and final concentration of the solute table 6 which leads to overestimation of the fixation capacity as compared to langmuir model arias et al 2001 johansson westholm 2006 vohla et al 2011 moreover most of the studies table 6 tested relatively fine materials grain size up to 14 mm applied in much smaller doses 1 30 g l 1 under substantially higher op concentration up to 1500 mg po4 3 l 1 as compared to our experimental conditions 10 30 mm 100 g l 1 and 0 2 mg po4 3 l 1 respectively table 4 these are likely reasons for much higher op sorption capacity obtained in cited investigations as op removal efficiency usually increases with decreasing grain size decreasing solid to solution ratio and increasing initial op concentration cucarella and renman 2009 lyngsie et al 2014 smaller grain size is reflected in greater surface area armstead 1999 while high op concentrations lead to precipitation processes which are characterised by much bigger op loads than pure adsorption which takes place at low op concentrations cucarella and renman 2009 for example li et al 2017 observed about 22 fold increase in op sorption onto calcite the main component of limestone when initial op concentration increased from 1 5 to 30 6 mg po4 3 l 1 at ph 7 7 the above discussion clearly shows that comparable information on leca and limestone efficiency in op removal under low op concentrations typically recorded in freshwater bodies is very limited or missing moreover another factor limiting comparability of the results with literature data is variability of leca composition as it depends upon source material for example zhu et al 1997 investigated seven lecas and observed high variability of op sorption 37 3460 mg p kg 1 which was strongly related to variable content of metals in the aggregates 140 739 mg g 1 4 2 variability of op removal under hypolimnion relevant ph and temperature our study showed strong dependency of op removal onto leca and limestone on ph and temperature in the range typically observed in hypolimnetic water withdrawn from eutrophic lakes fig 3 decrease of op sorption onto leca with ph increasing in the range 6 0 8 0 is in compliance with other studies investigating op removal onto leca yaghi and hartikainen 2013 and clays characterised by high content of illite which is one of the main mineral phases in our leca edzwald et al 1976 hamdi and srasra 2008 differences in op fixation under varying ph can be attributed to phosphate ions speciation edzwald et al 1976 another possible reason for hampering op sorption onto leca with ph increasing within the range 6 0 8 0 is competitive influence of oh shaheen and rinklebe 2015 and or more negative surface loading at higher oh concentration yaghi and hartikainen 2013 however the point of zero charge for leca is difficult to predict due to complex mineralogical matrix of this material for the main clay minerals present in our leca smectite and illite phpzc ranging from strongly acidic phpzc 2 0 blume et al 2015 to basic levels phpzc 8 2 afraoui et al 2012 were reported moreover surface charge of leca and its relation to ph is probably also affected by other minerals present in its matrix including carbonates differences in op removal by leca with changing ph can also result from different mechanisms taking place under acidic and neutral alkaline conditions acidic ph could enhance the sorption by promoting op binding with fe and al over ca vohla et al 2011 as fe and al based mechanisms of op sorption are more efficient than ca based penn et al 2016 on the other hand favouring effect of decreasing ph on op removal could be likely related to leca dissolution becoming more intense with lower ph which can be assumed based on ph of the solutions recorded after experiment table s1 in supplementary material dissolution must have resulted in liberation of metals from the solid material which may potentially get involved in sorption via formation of complexes with phosphate and or precipitation however due to low op concentration in the solution 1 mg po4 3 l 1 precipitation processes in our experiments were probably limited cucarella and renman 2009 nevertheless dissolution seems to be important as the highest and lowest op removal recorded in the experimental step 3 75 and 23 fig 3 a were accompanied by the highest and lowest leca dissolution rates ph increased by 1 7 and 0 5 respectively table s1 in supplementary material sorption of op onto limestone also decreased with increasing ph this is surprising as alkaline ph is known to promote all the processes potentially involved in op fixation onto calcite adsorption sø et al 2011 calcium phosphate precipitation sanciolo et al 2008 and op co precipitation with newly forming calcite crystals house 1999 however there are numerous studies showing decrease of op sorption onto calcite in standard solutions with ph increasing in the range 6 0 8 0 liu et al 2012 moharami and jalali 2013 xu et al 2014 similarly to our results at ph 8 0 the surface of ls was probably close to approach the point of zero charge which is reported for calcite to be achieved in ph between 8 0 and 8 7 karageorgiou et al 2007 liu et al 2012 another possible reason for hampering op sorption onto limestone with ph increasing in the tested range is the competitive effect of oh moharami and jalali 2013 on the other hand xu et al 2014 attributed promoting effect of lower ph on the op removal to dissolution of calcite which liberates calcium ions and thus stimulates op precipitation klasa et al 2013 that is why in undersaturated solutions op precipitation with calcium is the dominating mechanism of op fixation onto calcite berg et al 2004 under our experimental conditions the standard solutions were by definition initially undersaturated with respect to calcite which resulted in limestone dissolution confirmed by small ph increase with slightly higher dissolution rates in acidic conditions table s1 in supplementary material although precipitation is rather unlikely to occur under our experimental conditions due to low op concentration 1 mg po4 3 l 1 kinetic studies clearly suggest this process we observed gradual increase in op removal within 24 h figs 4 c and d 5 c and d whereas pure adsorption of op onto calcite is completed within 3 h sø et al 2011 moreover calcium ions liberated from dissolving ls could form complexes such as cahpo4 0 aq which were reported to be the main species adsorbing on the surface of calcite lin and singer 2006 removal of op by both tested materials leca and limestone was also strongly influenced by temperature fig 3 this is not surprising as temperature affects op sorption on many reactive materials cucarella and renman 2009 lyngsie et al 2014 zhu et al 2003 observed decrease in op removal by 24 64 for different grain size of the tested leca when temperature decreased from 20 c to 5 c in our study corresponding change in op sorption on leca were similar and accounted for 34 49 depending on the initial ph of the solution assuming that precipitation of op with calcium took place in our experiments as discussed in the previous section promoting effect of temperature can result from decreasing solubility of calcium phosphates in the tested temperature range song et al 2002 positive coupling between temperature and op fixation onto ls is also due to endodermic nature of op adsorption onto calcite surface griffin and jurinak 1973 4 3 effect of solution type our study revealed that fixation of op onto leca and especially ls was greater in hypolimnetic water than in standard solution which was shown by higher removal rates figs 3 and 4 obtained loads fig 5 and calculated maximum sorption capacity based on langmuir model for the contact time of 24 h table 5 this result is somehow surprising as in natural waters and wastewaters usually lower removal is observed than in synthetic standard solutions due to presence of microorganisms and substances affecting the sorption processes johansson westholm 2006 hedström and rastas 2006 bus and karczmarczyk 2018 kinetic tests revealed that differences in sorption were mainly related to accelerated removal of op in hypolimentic water as compared to standard solution figs 4 and 5 consequently at high op concentrations 1 5 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 the equilibrium was not achieved in standard solution after 24 h fig 4 a and c therefore the calculated maximum sorption capacity in standard solution should be probably accessed at longer contact time possible reason for faster op depletion is the presence of iron although its concentration was not measured it can be assumed that reduced iron fe2 was present in the anoxic hypolimnetic water and could undergo oxidation to fe3 during experiments with concomitant op fixation another likely factor enhancing and accelerating op sorption in hypolimnetic water is presence of calcium table 3 calcium ions enhance op removal on reactive materials trough precipitation processes brix et al 2001 cucurella and renman 2009 precipitation of op with calcium compounds seems not likely as previously discussed due to low initial op concentrations however as already mentioned in case of ls precipitation of ca po4 minerals is supported by the fact that increase in op removal lasted for 24 h figs 4 d and 5 d while pure adsorption onto calcite is completed within 3 h sø et al 2011 additionally in case of ls presence of calcium could also enhance op removal as ca2 promotes phosphate adsorption onto calcite millero et al 2001 sawada et al 2003 song et al 2002 lin and singer 2006 nevertheless ca2 must have been present during experiments also in standard solutions as leca and ls dissolved to some extent during batch tests as discussed in section 4 2 however in standard solution some time was surely needed for ca2 to appear from dissolution while in hypolimnetic water ca2 was present from the start of the experiments it is also likely that aggregates dissolved to some extent in hypolimentic water additionally enhancing ca2 content in this medium this explains why the op sorption in hypolimnetic water proceeded faster as compared to standard solution fig 4 4 4 implications for a potential field application according to our study leca and limestone were the most promising in terms of op removal among tested mineral aggregates but their performance was strongly affected by ph and temperature in the range typically found in hypolimnetic water withdrawn from eutrophic lakes ph 6 0 8 0 and temperature 5 15 c fig 3 due to the fact that efficiency of leca and ls was the higher the lower the ph was use of these aggregates seems to be especially suitable for op removal from hypolimnion withdrawn from lakes experiencing acidic conditions in the bottom layer hypolimnetic ph in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs usually falls in the neutral range 7 0 7 5 but prolonged anoxia can lower the ph to acidic levels 6 0 6 5 due to co2 and h2s production during anaerobic organic matter decay jaeger 1994 golterman 2004 diao et al 2017 on the other hand a promoting effect of the temperature on op sorption by leca and ls indicates that these aggregates can be especially suitable for hypolimnion treatment in lakes with relatively warm bottom layers moreover potential treatment system made of leca and or ls will undergo seasonal variability due to hypolimnion warming which is often observed in restored lakes dunalska 2003 for example in kortowskie lake during withdrawal season from june to september the temperature of bottom layer increased by 5 6 c dunalska et al 2013 assuming temperature rise from 10 c to 15 c in the hypolimnetic water within withdrawal season op removal efficiency of the materials can be expected to increase about 1 5 1 6 and 1 1 1 2 times for leca and ls respectively as in the given temperature range observed op removal increased from 23 38 to 35 62 in case of leca and from 48 55 to 53 65 in case of ls depending on the ph fig 3 in case of both materials op removal efficiency will be strongly affected by initial op concentration in the withdrawn water figs 4 and 5 in the op range typically found in kortowskie lake 0 1 1 5 mg po4 3 l 1 dunalska et al 2007 performance of op removal at short contact time 1 h changed in a very wide range of 14 46 in case of leca and 11 40 in case of ls fig 4 b and d longer reaction times resulted in more stable removal rates for example after 6 h corresponding values were 54 77 and 71 84 fig 4 b and d due to strong influence of contact time on op sorption onto both materials figs 4 and 5 potential purification system should allow prolonged retention of the withdrawn water this can also result in an increase of water temperature during treatment which will enhance op sorption as already discussed from the two aggregates investigated in detail ls seems to be more suitable for purification of water withdrawn from hypolimnion due to the fact that op sorption onto this material is less dependent on temperature and ph than onto leca in the range typically found in the hypolimnion of treated lakes fig 3 this indicates that op removal efficacy onto ls will be more stable during the withdrawal season and more invariable among potentially restored lakes ls showed also higher op sorption than leca in standard solution and hypolimentic water figs 3 5 although mainly at longer reaction times moreover ls shows high performance in op fixation under reduced conditions ann et al 1999 which are typically present in hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes due to anoxia and high concentrations of reducing substances another important issue are side effects of these materials on the treated water the results show that ls caused much smaller ph changes than leca table s1 in supplementary material which supports better ls suitability for a potential field application however leca should also be considered as potential reactive material for treatment of hypolimnetic water as its surface favours growth of bacteria enabling transformations and removal of nitrogen compounds lekang and kleppe 2000 vohla et al 2011 this is important as hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes contains high concentrations of organic and inorganic n and thus hypolimnion withdrawal contributes to pollution of downstream water bodies with n for example mean concentration of total n in hypolimentic water withdrawn from kortowskie lake to kortówka river was 3 2 mg n l 1 tandyrak et al 2016 another advantage of leca is its high porosity 78 table 2 which is important for hydraulic conductivity of sorption beds johansson westholm 2006 thus for a potential treatment of hypolimnetic water we recommend use of mixture of both materials ls and leca to ensure proper hydraulic conductivity of a potential treatment system with possibly high and stable op retention with concomitant n removal 5 summary and conclusions our study revealed that leca and ls are suitable for op removal from hypolimnetic water withdrawn from eutrophic lakes op sorption onto both materials was promoted by acidic ph and high temperatures and was faster and higher in hypolimentic water as compared to standard solutions the results indicate that op fixation onto these materials would be most efficient in case of lakes with acidic and warm bottom layer and favoured by distinct hypolimnion warming which is expected in restored lakes from the two aggregates ls seems to be more suitable for inactivation of op in water removed from hypolimnion due to the fact that op sorption onto this medium is less dependent on temperature and ph than onto leca in the range typical for hypolimnion of treated lakes this indicates that op removal efficacy onto ls will be more stable during the withdrawal season and more invariable among potentially restored lakes however due to low porosity of ls use of ls mixed with leca can be recommended for onsite treatment of hypolimnetic water to ensure hydraulic conductivity of a potential sorption bed op retention onto mineral aggregates can mitigate side effect of hypolimnion removal by preventing eutrophication of downsteram water bodies and should be regarded as substantial improvement of this lakes restoration method ethical statement authors state that the research was

1076,the aim of the study was to assess the efficiency of mineral aggregates in orthophosphate op removal from hypolimentic water hw withdrawn from eutrophic lakes four p reactive materials were tested in sorption experiments light weight expanded aggregate leca zeolite zl dolomite dm and limestone ls the two materials proved to be most effective in op binding were ls and leca for these agents we conducted further investigations to reveal the effect of variable ph and temperature in the range commonly found in hw withdrawn from eutrophic lakes 6 0 8 0 and 5 15 c respectively kinetic studies under varying op concentrations 0 1 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 in synthetic solutions and hw were involved to check influence of hypolimnion chemistry on op fixation ls was the most efficient in op removal followed by leca dolomite and zeolite op sorption by ls and leca increased with decreasing ph and increasing temperature and was faster and higher in hw as compared to standard solution the results indicate that op fixation onto these materials would be most efficient in case of lakes with acidic and relatively warm bottom layer hypolimnion warming which is often observed in restored lakes will further enhance op removal use of ls mixed with leca was recommended for a potential treatment of hw withdrawn from eutrophic lakes op retention before hypolimnion transport downstream can mitigate side effects of hypolimnion removal by preventing eutrophication of receiving water bodies which can be regarded as substantial improvement of this lakes restoration method keywords hypolimnetic withdrawal phosphorus removal leca limestone calcite 1 introduction hypolimnion withdrawal is a restoration method developed for eutrophic stratified lakes and is based on selective removal of the near bottom water as hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes is enriched in phosphorus p and nitrogen n compounds coming from sedimentation and decay of organic matter as well as from sedimentary release withdrawal of water from this layer allows for enhanced nutrients export from the treated lake jeppesen et al 2009 hypolimnion is removed through a pipeline placed on the lake s bottom with inlet usually installed in the deepest part of the lake and outlet located in a downstream river or a creek as the pipeline can work as a siphon the method is considered simple and cost effective long term hypolimnion withdrawal usually leads to decline in p content in the bottom layer and extent of anoxia which results in reduced internal loading nürnberg 2007 jeppesen et al 2009 thus the method has been frequently applied for restoration of eutrophic lakes dunalska 2002 lathrop et al 2005 nürnberg 2005 2007 kostecki 2012 however hypolimnetic withdrawal can contribute to the pollution of downstream water bodies with nutrients and reduced substances such as hydrogen sulfide typically present in the eutrophic hypolimnion nürnberg 2007 jeppesen et al 2009 tandyrak et al 2016 thus treatment of the hypolimnetic water before its export to receiving water bodies is frequently required nürnberg 2007 as p is the main nutrient causing eutrophication of the surface waters corel 1998 dunalska and wiśniewski 2016 schindler et al 2016 its removal from hypolimnetic water is especially important to avoid degradation of downstream ecosystems phosphorus can be stripped from water by reactive materials showing availability to sorb inorganic dissolved p orthophosphate op reactive materials can be applied as sorption beds for op removal from wastewater and surface water in different types of constructed wetlands gajewska et al 2014 penn et al 2017 or as suspended reactive filters karczmarczyk and bus 2017 and for ground water purification as permeable reactive barriers izydoryczk et al 2013 frątczak et al 2019 however agent selection for op removal purposes should be carefully considered as available media exhibit wide range of sorption capacity johansson westholm 2006 vohla et al 2011 bus et al 2019 due to variability of physical properties such as surface area and grain size cucarella and renman 2009 as well as prevailing fixation mechanisms being determined by al fe and ca mg content in the material penn et al 2017 qin et al 2018 moreover sorption capacity of reactive materials is fundamentally influenced by reaction conditions such as contact time temperature ph and op concentration cucarella and renman 2009 moharami and jalali 2013 lyngsie et al 2014 dunets et al 2015 as well as chemistry of the target solution hedström and rastas 2006 sø et al 2011 thus in this work we tested four mineral aggregates as potential reactive materials for onsite op removal from hypolimnetic water light expanded clay aggregate leca and zeolite which are aluminium silicates rich in al and dolomite and limestone which are crushed carbonate rocks rich in ca mg the aim of the study was to assess p removal efficiency of the aggregates under op concentrations typically present in hypolimnetic water for the two selected materials we further investigated effect of ph and temperature on op removal to predict variability of their performance in potentially treated lakes kinetic studies under varying op concentrations in synthetic solutions and actual hypolimnetic water were involved to check influence of chemistry of the hypolimnion on op sorption for this purpose we used hypolimnetic water from lake kortowskie in olsztyn poland which was the first lake restored using hypolimentic withdrawal method dunalska 2002 dunalska et al 2007 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactive materials reactive materials were chosen from mineral aggregates easily available in poland light expanded clay aggregate leca zeolite zl dolomite dm and limestone lm the materials differ in their chemical and mineral composition bet surface area and porosity tables 1 and 2 leca and zl consist mainly of clay minerals aluminium silicates 91 main phases in leca are smektite illite and chlorite accompanied by quartz calcite and dolomite whereas zeolite is mainly composed of klinoptylolite mica and plagioclase with small share of crystalobarite and quartz consequently the elemental composition of leca and zl is dominated by si with considerable amount of al table 1 ls and dm are crushed sedimentary rocks from deposits in south western poland containing mainly carbonates calcium carbonate in form of calcite 96 and calcium magnesium carbonate in form of dolomite 98 respectively in terms of metal content ls composition is dominated by ca whereas in dm ca is accompanied by substantial amount of mg table 1 2 2 types of solutions performance of the reactive materials was tested in two types of solutions standard op solution and hypolimnetic water standard op solution was prepared by dissolving kh2po4 reagent grade dried to constant weight at 120 c in double distilled water to achieve op concentrations of 0 1 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 depending on the experimental step see section 2 4 ph of the standard solutions was adjusted to 7 0 0 05 using 1 m naoh and or 1 m hcl except for the step 2 where ph range 6 0 8 0 was employed table 4 hypolimnetic water was sampled from outlet of a withdrawal pipeline in the kortowskie lake located in olsztyn poland fig 1 at the end of july 2017 as middle summer represents period of the highest near bottom concentration of nutrients water removed from the hypolimnion is directed to a small stream kortówka fig 1 dunalska 2003 contributing to its eutrophication due to high p and n concentrations at the lake bottom dunalska 2002 tandyrak et al 2016 hypolimnetic water sampled for the experiments was characterised by low temperature nearly neutral ph and high op and ammonia concentration due to anoxia table 3 2 3 sorption experiments sorption experiments were performed to test op removal efficacy and its variability depending on ph and temperature experimental design was described in section 2 4 reactive materials were placed in polypropylene containers and shaken in the op containing solution 150 rpm at contact time varying in different experimental steps table 4 as previously described experiments were performed in two types of solution op standard solution and hypolimnetic water withdrawn from kortowskie lake for detailed information about the solutions see section 2 5 reaction time of 24 h was involved in all the experimental steps except for kinetic studies table 4 after shaking ph of the supernatant was measured see section 2 5 for details for subsequent determination of op concentration see section 2 5 the solution was centrifuged 4000 rpm 20 min and filtered through membrane cellulose filters 0 45 µm 2 4 experimental design experimental design included four steps of the sorption experiments table 4 to determine the most efficient reactive materials and their optimal dose step 1 all the aggregates were tested in the op standard solution using materials doses ranging from 50 to 500 g l 1 at the reaction time of 24 h for the media and dose selected in the first step leca and ls 100 g l 1 further experiments were performed in the op standard solution to investigate variability of op removal under ph and thermal conditions relevant for hypolimnetic waters withdrawn from eutrophic lakes step 2 tested ph values and temperature ranged from 6 0 to 8 0 and from 5 c to 20 c respectively table 4 this ph range and temperatures between 5 and 15 c represent conditions recorded in the hypolimnion layer and in hypolimnetic water outflowing from the pipelines installed in the restored lakes dunalska et al 2013 golterman 2004 lathrop et al 2005 nürnberg 2005 2007 temperature of 20 c was involved to ensure comparability of the results with available literature data as commonly applied procedure of sorption experiments refers to 20 c limousin et al 2007 step 3 focused on the kinetics of op sorption onto leca and ls under varying op concentrations 0 1 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 which cover the range typically recorded in the hypolimnion of the kortowskie lake 0 1 1 5 mg po4 3 l 1 dunalska et al 2007 maximum adsorption of leca and ls step 4 was determined in op standard solution and hypolimnetic water at the temperature of 10 c representing actual conditions in the water withdrawn from restored lakes as previously described and 20 c only op standard solution for comparison with literature data as already explained at the same gradient of op concentrations as employed in the step 3 0 1 to 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 2 5 chemical analysis ph was measured potentiometrically using standard electrodes epp 1 hanna instrument usa other measurements were performed in water samples filtered through cellulose membrane filters 0 45 µm op concentration was determined using molybdenum blue method according to the standard procedure pn en iso 6878 at the wavelength of 880 nm and optical path length of 50 mm with nanocolour uv vis spectrophotometer macherey nagel germany ionic composition of the hypolimnetic water table 3 was measured using hplc chromatography shimadzu analyser prominence system japan except for nh4 which was determined colourimetrically using merck hc 568916 test and sq 118 photometer merck germany at optical path length of 40 mm 2 6 data analysis the load of op removed from the solutions by unit mass of the reactive materials q was calculated as the difference in initial and final concentration according to the formula q c f c i v m where q is amount of op removed per unit mass of the reactive material mg g 1 ci and cf are initial and final op concentrations mg l 1 respectively v is solution volume l and m is mass of the reactive material g for quantitative description of op adsorption onto reactive materials and for determination of the theoretical maximum op adsorption the monolayer langmuir adsorption model was used the langmuir isotherm model is given by the following equation limousin et al 2007 q q m a x k c f 1 k c f where q mg g 1 is the amount of op adsorbed per unit mass of the reactive material at equilibrium qmax is the maximum adsorption mg g 1 k is adsorption energy coefficient l mg 1 and cf is the final op concentration mg l 1 3 results 3 1 selection of reactive material and dose efficacy of mineral aggregates in op removal from the solution was highly variable and dependent on the dose of the material fig 2 in the lowest dose 10 g l 1 all the aggregates showed similar op removal efficacy 14 20 however at higher additions leca and ls sorbed much more op than zl and dm for example at dose of 100 g l 1 corresponding removal rates were 88 98 63 and 75 further increase in material addition caused higher removal rates up to 98 for leca 81 for zl and 96 for dm at 300 g l 1 whereas efficacy of ls did not change removal rates accounted for 98 99 in the dose range of 100 300 g l 1 high reduction of op concentration by 90 was achieved when using leca and ls in relatively low dose of 100 g l 1 thus leca and ls were selected for further investigations as regarded to be potentially most efficient agents which could be used in hypolymnetic water treatment 3 2 effect of ph and temperature op sorption by both materials leca and ls was strongly affected by experimental conditions and increased with decreasing ph and increasing temperature of the solution fig 3 however clear enhancement of op removal was recorded only when temperature increased up to 15 and 20 c fig 3 whereas no difference was noted between 5 c and 10 c fig 3 a and b for leca the most important rise in op sorption was recorded when temperature increased from 5 10 c to 15 c fig 3 for example at initial ph 7 op removal increased from 35 to 36 5 10 c to 48 15 c and 53 20 c respectively in case of limestone op fixation was relatively stable within the temperature range 5 10 c and increased slightly at 15 c but the most pronounced increase took place at 20 c fig 3 b for example at initial ph 7 removal rates accounted for 52 53 at 5 10 c 57 at 15 c and 83 at 20 c both materials differed to some extent in their reaction to changing ph op sorption onto leca was much more sensitive to ph than onto limestone fig 3 a and b for example in the temperature of 5 c leca removed 1 7 times more op at initial ph 6 0 than at initial ph 8 0 the respective removal rates were 39 and 22 fig 3 a whereas for limestone the sorption was only 1 2 times higher corresponding removal rates were 55 and 46 fig 3 b the same relations were observed under higher temperatures fig 3 irrespectively of initial ph and temperature ls was much more efficient in op sorption than leca corresponding op removal rates were 48 91 and 24 75 depending on ph and temperature which confirms results derived from comparison of different doses of the materials fig 2 3 3 kinetics of op removal removal of op onto leca and limestone was strongly affected by contact time of the material with the solution and increased with prolonged reaction time fig 4 both materials however show different kinetic behaviour in standard solution leca removed only small amounts of op within first 6 h of the experiment 5 20 depending on initial op concentration but its efficiency rapidly increased after 12 h recorded removal rates ranged from 55 to 89 fig 4 a whereas efficiency of limestone was enhanced gradually fig 4 c as compared to standard solution in the hypolimnetic water a clear sorption acceleration can be seen fig 4 this effect was most profound in case of leca due to slow op fixation in a standard solution for example in a standard solution leca removed only 12 of the op after 6 h at initial concentration of 1 0 mg po4 3 l 1 whereas in hypolimnetic water two times higher removal of 21 was achieved after only 1 h fig 4 a and b for both materials favouring effect of hypolimnetic water on kinetics and rate of op sorption seems to become more important with increasing initial op concentration for example at contact time of 6 h and intermediate initial op concentration 1 0 mg po4 3 l 1 leca removed five times more op in hypolimnetic water 60 than in a standard solution 12 whereas at the highest initial op concentration 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 almost 10 fold difference in removal rates was recorded 48 in hypolimnetic water as compared to 5 in standard solution fig 4 a and b in case of ls at the intermediate initial op concentration 1 0 mg po4 3 l 1 contact time needed to achieve removal rate of 60 was 1 5 times longer in standard solution than in hypolimnetic water 6 h versus 4 h respectively whereas at the highest initial op concentration 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 the difference in time was 4 fold times needed were 24 h in a standard solution and 6 h in the hypolimnetic water fig 4 c and d kinetics of op removal is also reflected in changing course and slope of the sorption isotherms fig 5 prolonged time of the reaction resulted in increasing op loads and decreasing equilibrium concentration in the solution at the longest reaction times 12 and 24 h in hypolimnetic water initial slope of the isotherms for ls substantially increased fig 5 d indicating higher affinity of the material to op under these conditions the isotherms reveal again favouring effect of enhanced temperature on the op sorption onto leca and limestone fig 5 a and c 3 4 maximum adsorption capacity after reaction time of 24 h isotherms for leca and ls could be satisfactorily fitted using langmuir adsorption model table 5 theoretical maximum sorption calculated using langmuir equation 0 014 0 017 mg po4 3 g 1 for leca and 0 013 0 020 mg po4 3 g 1 for ls table 5 was slightly higher than the maximum loads obtained in our experiments 0 015 mg po4 3 g 1 except for ls in hypolimnetic water where the maximum load accounted for 0 017 mg po4 3 g 1 fig 5 d theoretical maximum sorption increased with temperature table 5 which confirms the promoting effect of temperature on op fixation onto these materials as observed in experimental step no 2 interestingly maximum sorption of leca and especially ls was higher in hypolimnetic water than in standard solution table 5 this indicates again that op binding onto these materials was favoured in the hypolimnetic water as compared to standard solution interestingly in standard solution at 20 c maximum sorption of leca was slightly higher than of ls whereas in the hypolimnetic water the relation was opposite table 5 4 discussion 4 1 sorption properties of leca and limestone maximum adsorption calculated based on langmuir model for leca 0 014 0 017 mg po4 3 g 1 table 5 is of similar order as obtained by yaghi and hartikainen 2013 who reported the maximum adsorption of 0 076 mg po4 3 g 1 in ph 7 in low op concentrations 0 0 61 mg po4 3 l 1 table 6 however these authors used much smaller grains 0 63 1 mm as compared to our study 10 30 mm which explains about 5 times higher sorption obtained in their work however other researchers reported distinctly higher op binding capacity of leca 0 3 36 7 mg po4 3 g 1 table 6 similarly maximum adsorption calculated in our study for limestone 0 013 0 020 mg po4 3 g 1 table 5 is substantially lower than maximum sorption usually reported in the literature table 6 this is probably due to the fact that most of the authors calculated maximum sorption based on the difference between initial and final concentration of the solute table 6 which leads to overestimation of the fixation capacity as compared to langmuir model arias et al 2001 johansson westholm 2006 vohla et al 2011 moreover most of the studies table 6 tested relatively fine materials grain size up to 14 mm applied in much smaller doses 1 30 g l 1 under substantially higher op concentration up to 1500 mg po4 3 l 1 as compared to our experimental conditions 10 30 mm 100 g l 1 and 0 2 mg po4 3 l 1 respectively table 4 these are likely reasons for much higher op sorption capacity obtained in cited investigations as op removal efficiency usually increases with decreasing grain size decreasing solid to solution ratio and increasing initial op concentration cucarella and renman 2009 lyngsie et al 2014 smaller grain size is reflected in greater surface area armstead 1999 while high op concentrations lead to precipitation processes which are characterised by much bigger op loads than pure adsorption which takes place at low op concentrations cucarella and renman 2009 for example li et al 2017 observed about 22 fold increase in op sorption onto calcite the main component of limestone when initial op concentration increased from 1 5 to 30 6 mg po4 3 l 1 at ph 7 7 the above discussion clearly shows that comparable information on leca and limestone efficiency in op removal under low op concentrations typically recorded in freshwater bodies is very limited or missing moreover another factor limiting comparability of the results with literature data is variability of leca composition as it depends upon source material for example zhu et al 1997 investigated seven lecas and observed high variability of op sorption 37 3460 mg p kg 1 which was strongly related to variable content of metals in the aggregates 140 739 mg g 1 4 2 variability of op removal under hypolimnion relevant ph and temperature our study showed strong dependency of op removal onto leca and limestone on ph and temperature in the range typically observed in hypolimnetic water withdrawn from eutrophic lakes fig 3 decrease of op sorption onto leca with ph increasing in the range 6 0 8 0 is in compliance with other studies investigating op removal onto leca yaghi and hartikainen 2013 and clays characterised by high content of illite which is one of the main mineral phases in our leca edzwald et al 1976 hamdi and srasra 2008 differences in op fixation under varying ph can be attributed to phosphate ions speciation edzwald et al 1976 another possible reason for hampering op sorption onto leca with ph increasing within the range 6 0 8 0 is competitive influence of oh shaheen and rinklebe 2015 and or more negative surface loading at higher oh concentration yaghi and hartikainen 2013 however the point of zero charge for leca is difficult to predict due to complex mineralogical matrix of this material for the main clay minerals present in our leca smectite and illite phpzc ranging from strongly acidic phpzc 2 0 blume et al 2015 to basic levels phpzc 8 2 afraoui et al 2012 were reported moreover surface charge of leca and its relation to ph is probably also affected by other minerals present in its matrix including carbonates differences in op removal by leca with changing ph can also result from different mechanisms taking place under acidic and neutral alkaline conditions acidic ph could enhance the sorption by promoting op binding with fe and al over ca vohla et al 2011 as fe and al based mechanisms of op sorption are more efficient than ca based penn et al 2016 on the other hand favouring effect of decreasing ph on op removal could be likely related to leca dissolution becoming more intense with lower ph which can be assumed based on ph of the solutions recorded after experiment table s1 in supplementary material dissolution must have resulted in liberation of metals from the solid material which may potentially get involved in sorption via formation of complexes with phosphate and or precipitation however due to low op concentration in the solution 1 mg po4 3 l 1 precipitation processes in our experiments were probably limited cucarella and renman 2009 nevertheless dissolution seems to be important as the highest and lowest op removal recorded in the experimental step 3 75 and 23 fig 3 a were accompanied by the highest and lowest leca dissolution rates ph increased by 1 7 and 0 5 respectively table s1 in supplementary material sorption of op onto limestone also decreased with increasing ph this is surprising as alkaline ph is known to promote all the processes potentially involved in op fixation onto calcite adsorption sø et al 2011 calcium phosphate precipitation sanciolo et al 2008 and op co precipitation with newly forming calcite crystals house 1999 however there are numerous studies showing decrease of op sorption onto calcite in standard solutions with ph increasing in the range 6 0 8 0 liu et al 2012 moharami and jalali 2013 xu et al 2014 similarly to our results at ph 8 0 the surface of ls was probably close to approach the point of zero charge which is reported for calcite to be achieved in ph between 8 0 and 8 7 karageorgiou et al 2007 liu et al 2012 another possible reason for hampering op sorption onto limestone with ph increasing in the tested range is the competitive effect of oh moharami and jalali 2013 on the other hand xu et al 2014 attributed promoting effect of lower ph on the op removal to dissolution of calcite which liberates calcium ions and thus stimulates op precipitation klasa et al 2013 that is why in undersaturated solutions op precipitation with calcium is the dominating mechanism of op fixation onto calcite berg et al 2004 under our experimental conditions the standard solutions were by definition initially undersaturated with respect to calcite which resulted in limestone dissolution confirmed by small ph increase with slightly higher dissolution rates in acidic conditions table s1 in supplementary material although precipitation is rather unlikely to occur under our experimental conditions due to low op concentration 1 mg po4 3 l 1 kinetic studies clearly suggest this process we observed gradual increase in op removal within 24 h figs 4 c and d 5 c and d whereas pure adsorption of op onto calcite is completed within 3 h sø et al 2011 moreover calcium ions liberated from dissolving ls could form complexes such as cahpo4 0 aq which were reported to be the main species adsorbing on the surface of calcite lin and singer 2006 removal of op by both tested materials leca and limestone was also strongly influenced by temperature fig 3 this is not surprising as temperature affects op sorption on many reactive materials cucarella and renman 2009 lyngsie et al 2014 zhu et al 2003 observed decrease in op removal by 24 64 for different grain size of the tested leca when temperature decreased from 20 c to 5 c in our study corresponding change in op sorption on leca were similar and accounted for 34 49 depending on the initial ph of the solution assuming that precipitation of op with calcium took place in our experiments as discussed in the previous section promoting effect of temperature can result from decreasing solubility of calcium phosphates in the tested temperature range song et al 2002 positive coupling between temperature and op fixation onto ls is also due to endodermic nature of op adsorption onto calcite surface griffin and jurinak 1973 4 3 effect of solution type our study revealed that fixation of op onto leca and especially ls was greater in hypolimnetic water than in standard solution which was shown by higher removal rates figs 3 and 4 obtained loads fig 5 and calculated maximum sorption capacity based on langmuir model for the contact time of 24 h table 5 this result is somehow surprising as in natural waters and wastewaters usually lower removal is observed than in synthetic standard solutions due to presence of microorganisms and substances affecting the sorption processes johansson westholm 2006 hedström and rastas 2006 bus and karczmarczyk 2018 kinetic tests revealed that differences in sorption were mainly related to accelerated removal of op in hypolimentic water as compared to standard solution figs 4 and 5 consequently at high op concentrations 1 5 2 0 mg po4 3 l 1 the equilibrium was not achieved in standard solution after 24 h fig 4 a and c therefore the calculated maximum sorption capacity in standard solution should be probably accessed at longer contact time possible reason for faster op depletion is the presence of iron although its concentration was not measured it can be assumed that reduced iron fe2 was present in the anoxic hypolimnetic water and could undergo oxidation to fe3 during experiments with concomitant op fixation another likely factor enhancing and accelerating op sorption in hypolimnetic water is presence of calcium table 3 calcium ions enhance op removal on reactive materials trough precipitation processes brix et al 2001 cucurella and renman 2009 precipitation of op with calcium compounds seems not likely as previously discussed due to low initial op concentrations however as already mentioned in case of ls precipitation of ca po4 minerals is supported by the fact that increase in op removal lasted for 24 h figs 4 d and 5 d while pure adsorption onto calcite is completed within 3 h sø et al 2011 additionally in case of ls presence of calcium could also enhance op removal as ca2 promotes phosphate adsorption onto calcite millero et al 2001 sawada et al 2003 song et al 2002 lin and singer 2006 nevertheless ca2 must have been present during experiments also in standard solutions as leca and ls dissolved to some extent during batch tests as discussed in section 4 2 however in standard solution some time was surely needed for ca2 to appear from dissolution while in hypolimnetic water ca2 was present from the start of the experiments it is also likely that aggregates dissolved to some extent in hypolimentic water additionally enhancing ca2 content in this medium this explains why the op sorption in hypolimnetic water proceeded faster as compared to standard solution fig 4 4 4 implications for a potential field application according to our study leca and limestone were the most promising in terms of op removal among tested mineral aggregates but their performance was strongly affected by ph and temperature in the range typically found in hypolimnetic water withdrawn from eutrophic lakes ph 6 0 8 0 and temperature 5 15 c fig 3 due to the fact that efficiency of leca and ls was the higher the lower the ph was use of these aggregates seems to be especially suitable for op removal from hypolimnion withdrawn from lakes experiencing acidic conditions in the bottom layer hypolimnetic ph in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs usually falls in the neutral range 7 0 7 5 but prolonged anoxia can lower the ph to acidic levels 6 0 6 5 due to co2 and h2s production during anaerobic organic matter decay jaeger 1994 golterman 2004 diao et al 2017 on the other hand a promoting effect of the temperature on op sorption by leca and ls indicates that these aggregates can be especially suitable for hypolimnion treatment in lakes with relatively warm bottom layers moreover potential treatment system made of leca and or ls will undergo seasonal variability due to hypolimnion warming which is often observed in restored lakes dunalska 2003 for example in kortowskie lake during withdrawal season from june to september the temperature of bottom layer increased by 5 6 c dunalska et al 2013 assuming temperature rise from 10 c to 15 c in the hypolimnetic water within withdrawal season op removal efficiency of the materials can be expected to increase about 1 5 1 6 and 1 1 1 2 times for leca and ls respectively as in the given temperature range observed op removal increased from 23 38 to 35 62 in case of leca and from 48 55 to 53 65 in case of ls depending on the ph fig 3 in case of both materials op removal efficiency will be strongly affected by initial op concentration in the withdrawn water figs 4 and 5 in the op range typically found in kortowskie lake 0 1 1 5 mg po4 3 l 1 dunalska et al 2007 performance of op removal at short contact time 1 h changed in a very wide range of 14 46 in case of leca and 11 40 in case of ls fig 4 b and d longer reaction times resulted in more stable removal rates for example after 6 h corresponding values were 54 77 and 71 84 fig 4 b and d due to strong influence of contact time on op sorption onto both materials figs 4 and 5 potential purification system should allow prolonged retention of the withdrawn water this can also result in an increase of water temperature during treatment which will enhance op sorption as already discussed from the two aggregates investigated in detail ls seems to be more suitable for purification of water withdrawn from hypolimnion due to the fact that op sorption onto this material is less dependent on temperature and ph than onto leca in the range typically found in the hypolimnion of treated lakes fig 3 this indicates that op removal efficacy onto ls will be more stable during the withdrawal season and more invariable among potentially restored lakes ls showed also higher op sorption than leca in standard solution and hypolimentic water figs 3 5 although mainly at longer reaction times moreover ls shows high performance in op fixation under reduced conditions ann et al 1999 which are typically present in hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes due to anoxia and high concentrations of reducing substances another important issue are side effects of these materials on the treated water the results show that ls caused much smaller ph changes than leca table s1 in supplementary material which supports better ls suitability for a potential field application however leca should also be considered as potential reactive material for treatment of hypolimnetic water as its surface favours growth of bacteria enabling transformations and removal of nitrogen compounds lekang and kleppe 2000 vohla et al 2011 this is important as hypolimnion of eutrophic lakes contains high concentrations of organic and inorganic n and thus hypolimnion withdrawal contributes to pollution of downstream water bodies with n for example mean concentration of total n in hypolimentic water withdrawn from kortowskie lake to kortówka river was 3 2 mg n l 1 tandyrak et al 2016 another advantage of leca is its high porosity 78 table 2 which is important for hydraulic conductivity of sorption beds johansson westholm 2006 thus for a potential treatment of hypolimnetic water we recommend use of mixture of both materials ls and leca to ensure proper hydraulic conductivity of a potential treatment system with possibly high and stable op retention with concomitant n removal 5 summary and conclusions our study revealed that leca and ls are suitable for op removal from hypolimnetic water withdrawn from eutrophic lakes op sorption onto both materials was promoted by acidic ph and high temperatures and was faster and higher in hypolimentic water as compared to standard solutions the results indicate that op fixation onto these materials would be most efficient in case of lakes with acidic and warm bottom layer and favoured by distinct hypolimnion warming which is expected in restored lakes from the two aggregates ls seems to be more suitable for inactivation of op in water removed from hypolimnion due to the fact that op sorption onto this medium is less dependent on temperature and ph than onto leca in the range typical for hypolimnion of treated lakes this indicates that op removal efficacy onto ls will be more stable during the withdrawal season and more invariable among potentially restored lakes however due to low porosity of ls use of ls mixed with leca can be recommended for onsite treatment of hypolimnetic water to ensure hydraulic conductivity of a potential sorption bed op retention onto mineral aggregates can mitigate side effect of hypolimnion removal by preventing eutrophication of downsteram water bodies and should be regarded as substantial improvement of this lakes restoration method ethical statement authors state that the research was

1077,bioengineering is a technical option which uses selected biological elements to retain soil and rehabilitate areas with gullies with this aim bioengineering practices were implemented to recover areas affected by gully erosion in a micro watershed located in the mixteca an important region in the mexican state of oaxaca the restoration plan was to rehabilitate an old stone check dam located in the lower part of the watershed and the establishment of live barriers with erytrina americana miller upstream in the main gullies contributing to the drainage system to assess the morphometry of the micro watershed a digital elevation model was generated by a drone to assess the efficiency of rehabilitation practices the volume of sediments retained by the structures was quantified by topographic surveys results show that the live barriers combined with the check dam retained as sediments weight 1 304 99 mg as the micro watershed area is 37 06 hectares without bioengineering structures the specific degradation would have reached 35 27 mg ha 1y 1 thus sediments retention obtained with the bioengineering system has proven to be efficient in decreasing waterflow speed and initiating the rehabilitation of gullied lands keywords live barriers bioengineering gullies specific degradation sediments 1 introduction the mixteca is a mountainous area with high rates of environmental deterioration caused by forest resources overexploitation loss of biodiversity soil erosion water scarcity overgrazing and abandonment of traditional practices of soil and water conservation and accelerated desertification process martínez 2006 nuñez and marten 2013 rivas et al 2008 early in the 1990s the mixteca region showed 39 of moderate 46 high and 13 very high erosion with extensive gullied lands areas narváez 1991 according to historical records of land use the region experienced abandonment of farmlands which increased at the mid 2000 2010 and up to 95 of eroded territory contreras et al 2005 simosa 1985 gullies resulted from the advanced erosion process by deficient soil conservation practices from several years ago and for human impacts as has happened in iran where deforestation agriculture and overgrazing have prevailed and contributed to the problem ghosh and guchhait 2020 soufi et al 2020 lack of soil conservation practices in la mixteca increases surface runoff and water flow concentration generating channels on the surface of the soil and reach deep to the subsoil which causes the abandonment of the land gullies expand in length width and depth osman 2013 poesen et al 1996 soil susceptibility to erosion influences formation and development of gullies erosion susceptibility is known as the erodibility or k factor in the universal soil loss equation ramírez ortíz et al 2009 erodibility is determined by soil texture stability of soil structure clay mineralogy soil chemistry organic matter content and soil permeability other features that also influence the formation and growth of the gullies are the lands and channels slopes and runoff flow velocity sediment load and daily discharge gullies erosion cause the loss of arable land increases crops production costs obstructs the agricultural machinery operation increases drainage density reduces the runoff time concentration and reduces the humidity available for plant growth further gullies erosion produces sediment loads that reduces the embankment storage capacity and favors water bodies pollution gómez et al 2011 poesen et al 2003 valentin et al 2005 gully development is a dynamic process in the active phase the gully grows then it stabilizes with alternating series of erosion and deposition gómez et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2005 dynamic growth of each gully and the irregularity along their sections hinder the generalization of control strategies and application of hydrodynamic models these models have been used to determine the strength of the materials water flow capacity to detach and transport soil particles and to predict the gully growth and its morphometric characteristics rose et al 2014 indicate that there are important differences between the materials deposited and those of the original profile origin influences their resistance to removal by flow and further complicates the morphometric analysis of the gullies morphometric analysis allows identifying the characteristics of such areas contributing to runoff and sediment production relating some of these variables with the dimensions and shape of the gullies to select the alternatives for stabilization and control kompani zare et al 2011 this characterization requires basic and high precision information which can come from detailed topographical surveys of the area of interest digital elevation models generated from lidar light detection ranging records of rainfall intensity runoff discharge and volume and soil mechanics studies james et al 2007 different approaches have been used to quantify sediment yield in gullies some apply indirect estimates from periodically measuring cross sections in different distances in order to assess accumulative sediment determinations in water embankments or other works to control sediments other studies are based on the social tournament to explore how the people coexist under this conditions use and conserve the eroded soils in their benefits ayele et al 2018 zegeye et al 2018 anton and martínez casasnovas 2001 and martinez casasnovas 2003 propose the use of geographic information systems digital elevation models and multi temporal aerial photographs to estimate sediment production this procedure applied in some gullies in murcia spain allowed to calculate sedimentation rates of 1322 142 mg ha 1 y 1 gully control strategies can use retaining walls or dams to control sediments made with permanent or temporary structures of inert materials also bioengineering using living plants to perform technical engineering functions gobinath et al 2020 can be used consisting of permanent bio structural works in strategic sections of the gullies bio structures include live barriers built with woody and grass vegetation planted in the streambed of the gullies bioengineering in gullies uses vegetation to protect the soil against channel erosion and reduces the surface runoff ability to detach and transport soil particles however it is not feasible to establish vegetation in every section of the gullies in those areas where the soil has been completely lost the alternative is to combine revegetation with mechanical barriers such as riprap walls or stone dams reubens et al 2008 in order to increase the effectiveness of erosion control in gullies mehretie and bewket 2012 described the construction of timber and dirt small dams associated with plantations of sesbania sesban l merrill arundo donax l and ipomoea carnea jacq as a system implemented by producers in the towns of gayta

species too have contributed to hold on soils due to their structural and functional traits lira caballero et al 2018 erosion control practices in gullies have aimed at reducing the speed of the flow which causes the deposition of soil particles dragged by runoff efficiency evaluation of bioengineering works to retain sediments and recover gullied lands is a type of evaluation based on specific degradation this is defined as the quantification of the total sediments transported in a drainage watershed measured in a reference cross section at a specific time bodoque et al 2001 rey and burylo 2014 measured the volume retained in hedgerows built with salix sp in different periods results obtained were for the first year between 0 27 and 1 47 m3 of sediments retained by structure and 0 30 to 2 84 m3 after three years in our research bioengineering practices for the recovery of gullied lands in a micro watershed of the mixteca in oaxaca mexico were implemented and evaluated in order to know if there could be signs of rehabilitation in less than six months the objectives were 1 to make the morphometric characterization of the micro watershed 2 to try bioengineering for sediments retention and 3 to quantify reduction in the specific degradation of the gullied land areas treated with bioengineering practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the santa maria tiltepec micro watershed located in the municipality of san pedro topiltepec northwest of the mexican state of oaxaca between 17 28 49 72 17 28 10 40 north and 97 21 30 20 and 97 21 14 02 west with an extent of 37 06 ha the climate is sub humid temperate c w1 garcía and conabio 1998 with an average annual rainfall of 661 mm and an average annual temperature of 16 6 c smn 2010 the geological material is extrusive igneous andesite and sedimentary siltstone sandstone inegi 1988 induced grassland was established as a result of the clearing of the natural oak grassland forest inegi 2011 in the area there are small flat areas used for agriculture or abandoned areas where natural revegetation occurs areas without vegetation dominate in streambeds tops and slopes of the gullies and in isolated spots the accumulation of sediments and vegetal recruitment is observed as a product of abandoned sediments retention works community people collaborated in the establishment of bioengineering works and practices for the control of eroded soils with the support of material provided by the world wildlife foundation through the oaxaca community foundation 2 2 micro watershed morphometry the area of gullies and the drainage network formed by a set of gullies of different dimensions were characterized to start out a google earth satellite image from march 23 2012 was used and field trips were arranged to validate it identifying the main gully and its primary tributary channels an unmanned aerial vehicle uav e384 mapping drone event 38 2019 was used in the area fig 1 to obtain an ortho mosaic of images taken with canon powershot s100 camera with gps plus image stabilizer and a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 0 264 m per pixel dem was used to depict the gully system in detail the dem was processed in qgis to obtain the morphometric parameters of the micro watershed watershed divide area perimeter shape index topographic relief main gully length average slope number and cumulative length of gullies channel ranking drainage density hydrographic density and bifurcation ratio the longitudinal profile of the main gully started from the stone check dam with the use of measuring tape and hosed leveler every 10 m at each station topographic relief was recorded and also the width of the area covered by sediments was measured along 397 m as they were retained by the stone check dam 2 3 problem zone recovery plan the land recovery strategy considered rehabilitating and increasing the height of the stone check dam this is the main hydraulic structure in the drainage system located at 97 21 72 72 west 17 28 12 69 north and 2185 m altitude measures of the stone check dam retaining wall were height 3 88 m crown 1 m width 10 46 m slope 1 12 1 and a total construction volume of 128 44 m3 the stony scour protection built with light mortar had a construction volume of 15 77 m3 and was undermined by seepage as it was the spillway on the top stone check dam capacity was increased to retain sediments the top was raised over 1 m high and in the central part a spillway was built 3 m long by 1 m wide and 0 5 m high the new constructed section over the crest had a volume of 9 08 m3 fig 2 2 4 bioengineering works the complete bioengineering system in assistance with the community members consisted of establishing eight live barriers in the four main gullies fig 3 in gully 1 barrier 1 in gully 2 the barrier 2 four barriers 4 5 6 and 7 were built in gully 3 which is the main one and in gully 4 the barriers 3 and 8 live barriers made with support stakes and branches of erythrina americana miller fabaceae tree known as pipal o colorín were placed perpendicular to the cross section of each of the selected gullies with spacing between stakes of 0 5 to 1 m embedded in the streambed of the gully at depths of 0 3 to 0 5 m and an effective barrier height from 1 to 1 5 m fig 4 a e americana is a native species in the area which can be propagated by stakes support stakes selected for the live retaining structures were wider than 10 cm of diameter and branches were placed between the stakes intercrossed or tied for support fig 4b in the upstream direction of the live barrier were placed some dodonaea viscosa jacq branches and other shrubs to retain sediments but allowing some runoff fig 4c while downstream from the live barrier some branches or stones were placed to play the function of a filter blanket fig 4d 2 5 efficacy of rehabilitation practices the volume of soil retained by the stone check dam wall was estimated with a topographic survey the stone check dam wall was overloaded with sediments and that retention was estimated with the height area capacity curve determined with the topographic survey the magnitude in the reduction of the specific degradation of the areas of gullies was estimated in 2015 where the live barriers and the stone check dam were placed whilst estimation of the volume stored in the height increased wall was made after the rainy season of that same year 2015 it was assumed that the sediments were deposited proportionally along the longitudinal gully profile the sediments retained in the live barriers were estimated with topographic surveys of cross sections of the gullies carried out in the total of stations the first topographic survey was made prior to the construction of the live barriers in cross sections every 5 m and in five to six points per section top slopes and gully bed up to 50 m upstream direction the second topographic survey was carried out with the same procedure but after the rainy season the surface analysis module was used to process digital elevation model dem and to quantify the volume of sediment retained in each live barrier with the spatial analyst extension of the arcmap program the cut fill tool allowed us to assess the volume intersected between the two dems profiled before and after the rainy season 2 6 physico chemical analysis of soils and sediments the sediments retained by the live barriers were sampled after the rainy season of 2015 the sediment samples were taken at 15 cm depth in each live barrier and also a soil sample was taken as control sediment and soil samples were determined for texture bulk density field capacity permanent wilting point and potassium nitrogen and organic matter contents 3 results and discussion 3 1 micro watershed morphometry the micro watershed of santa maría tiltepec is elongated with a shape index of 0 24 over a surface of 37 ha it measures 2525 m in perimeter it has a slope of 13 with a total decrease in topographic relief of 160 m from the watershed divide to stone check dam the drainage system is complex with 711 gullies of different sizes and lengths in constant growth the main one of 1232 m and a cumulative length of 21 680 m of gullies there appear both high drainage density 586 m ha 1 and hydrographic density of 19 gullies ha 1 which confer high capacity for removal and transport of soil particles by surface runoff based on the stream classification system strahler 1952 for river networks six bifurcation branching orders 711 currents were detected and the average bifurcation ratio rb is 3 72 table 1 this indicates that about 4 gullies of one given order discharge water and sediments in a gully of immediate superior order in the santa

1077,bioengineering is a technical option which uses selected biological elements to retain soil and rehabilitate areas with gullies with this aim bioengineering practices were implemented to recover areas affected by gully erosion in a micro watershed located in the mixteca an important region in the mexican state of oaxaca the restoration plan was to rehabilitate an old stone check dam located in the lower part of the watershed and the establishment of live barriers with erytrina americana miller upstream in the main gullies contributing to the drainage system to assess the morphometry of the micro watershed a digital elevation model was generated by a drone to assess the efficiency of rehabilitation practices the volume of sediments retained by the structures was quantified by topographic surveys results show that the live barriers combined with the check dam retained as sediments weight 1 304 99 mg as the micro watershed area is 37 06 hectares without bioengineering structures the specific degradation would have reached 35 27 mg ha 1y 1 thus sediments retention obtained with the bioengineering system has proven to be efficient in decreasing waterflow speed and initiating the rehabilitation of gullied lands keywords live barriers bioengineering gullies specific degradation sediments 1 introduction the mixteca is a mountainous area with high rates of environmental deterioration caused by forest resources overexploitation loss of biodiversity soil erosion water scarcity overgrazing and abandonment of traditional practices of soil and water conservation and accelerated desertification process martínez 2006 nuñez and marten 2013 rivas et al 2008 early in the 1990s the mixteca region showed 39 of moderate 46 high and 13 very high erosion with extensive gullied lands areas narváez 1991 according to historical records of land use the region experienced abandonment of farmlands which increased at the mid 2000 2010 and up to 95 of eroded territory contreras et al 2005 simosa 1985 gullies resulted from the advanced erosion process by deficient soil conservation practices from several years ago and for human impacts as has happened in iran where deforestation agriculture and overgrazing have prevailed and contributed to the problem ghosh and guchhait 2020 soufi et al 2020 lack of soil conservation practices in la mixteca increases surface runoff and water flow concentration generating channels on the surface of the soil and reach deep to the subsoil which causes the abandonment of the land gullies expand in length width and depth osman 2013 poesen et al 1996 soil susceptibility to erosion influences formation and development of gullies erosion susceptibility is known as the erodibility or k factor in the universal soil loss equation ramírez ortíz et al 2009 erodibility is determined by soil texture stability of soil structure clay mineralogy soil chemistry organic matter content and soil permeability other features that also influence the formation and growth of the gullies are the lands and channels slopes and runoff flow velocity sediment load and daily discharge gullies erosion cause the loss of arable land increases crops production costs obstructs the agricultural machinery operation increases drainage density reduces the runoff time concentration and reduces the humidity available for plant growth further gullies erosion produces sediment loads that reduces the embankment storage capacity and favors water bodies pollution gómez et al 2011 poesen et al 2003 valentin et al 2005 gully development is a dynamic process in the active phase the gully grows then it stabilizes with alternating series of erosion and deposition gómez et al 2011 rodríguez et al 2005 dynamic growth of each gully and the irregularity along their sections hinder the generalization of control strategies and application of hydrodynamic models these models have been used to determine the strength of the materials water flow capacity to detach and transport soil particles and to predict the gully growth and its morphometric characteristics rose et al 2014 indicate that there are important differences between the materials deposited and those of the original profile origin influences their resistance to removal by flow and further complicates the morphometric analysis of the gullies morphometric analysis allows identifying the characteristics of such areas contributing to runoff and sediment production relating some of these variables with the dimensions and shape of the gullies to select the alternatives for stabilization and control kompani zare et al 2011 this characterization requires basic and high precision information which can come from detailed topographical surveys of the area of interest digital elevation models generated from lidar light detection ranging records of rainfall intensity runoff discharge and volume and soil mechanics studies james et al 2007 different approaches have been used to quantify sediment yield in gullies some apply indirect estimates from periodically measuring cross sections in different distances in order to assess accumulative sediment determinations in water embankments or other works to control sediments other studies are based on the social tournament to explore how the people coexist under this conditions use and conserve the eroded soils in their benefits ayele et al 2018 zegeye et al 2018 anton and martínez casasnovas 2001 and martinez casasnovas 2003 propose the use of geographic information systems digital elevation models and multi temporal aerial photographs to estimate sediment production this procedure applied in some gullies in murcia spain allowed to calculate sedimentation rates of 1322 142 mg ha 1 y 1 gully control strategies can use retaining walls or dams to control sediments made with permanent or temporary structures of inert materials also bioengineering using living plants to perform technical engineering functions gobinath et al 2020 can be used consisting of permanent bio structural works in strategic sections of the gullies bio structures include live barriers built with woody and grass vegetation planted in the streambed of the gullies bioengineering in gullies uses vegetation to protect the soil against channel erosion and reduces the surface runoff ability to detach and transport soil particles however it is not feasible to establish vegetation in every section of the gullies in those areas where the soil has been completely lost the alternative is to combine revegetation with mechanical barriers such as riprap walls or stone dams reubens et al 2008 in order to increase the effectiveness of erosion control in gullies mehretie and bewket 2012 described the construction of timber and dirt small dams associated with plantations of sesbania sesban l merrill arundo donax l and ipomoea carnea jacq as a system implemented by producers in the towns of gayta and dubi in dangila ethiopia plants with a fibrous root system grasses and a tree acacia decurrens wild and good tensile strength eleusine floccifolia spreng grass tephrosia vogelii hook tree and rosa abyssinica r br shrub provided better cohesion of soil particles facilitating the stability of sediments and potentially contributing to rehabilitation of the gullies in the debre mawi watershed ethiopia zegeye et al 2017 in the same watershed the canopy coverage by crops teff wheat millet and maize shown an inverse relation between size of plants and loss of soil zegeye et al 2010 for the region of our interest la mixteca mexico native grasses as bouteloua triaena trin ex spreng scribn hilaria cenchroides kunt shrubs as dalea lutea cav willd dodonaea viscosa l jack and other plant species too have contributed to hold on soils due to their structural and functional traits lira caballero et al 2018 erosion control practices in gullies have aimed at reducing the speed of the flow which causes the deposition of soil particles dragged by runoff efficiency evaluation of bioengineering works to retain sediments and recover gullied lands is a type of evaluation based on specific degradation this is defined as the quantification of the total sediments transported in a drainage watershed measured in a reference cross section at a specific time bodoque et al 2001 rey and burylo 2014 measured the volume retained in hedgerows built with salix sp in different periods results obtained were for the first year between 0 27 and 1 47 m3 of sediments retained by structure and 0 30 to 2 84 m3 after three years in our research bioengineering practices for the recovery of gullied lands in a micro watershed of the mixteca in oaxaca mexico were implemented and evaluated in order to know if there could be signs of rehabilitation in less than six months the objectives were 1 to make the morphometric characterization of the micro watershed 2 to try bioengineering for sediments retention and 3 to quantify reduction in the specific degradation of the gullied land areas treated with bioengineering practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the santa maria tiltepec micro watershed located in the municipality of san pedro topiltepec northwest of the mexican state of oaxaca between 17 28 49 72 17 28 10 40 north and 97 21 30 20 and 97 21 14 02 west with an extent of 37 06 ha the climate is sub humid temperate c w1 garcía and conabio 1998 with an average annual rainfall of 661 mm and an average annual temperature of 16 6 c smn 2010 the geological material is extrusive igneous andesite and sedimentary siltstone sandstone inegi 1988 induced grassland was established as a result of the clearing of the natural oak grassland forest inegi 2011 in the area there are small flat areas used for agriculture or abandoned areas where natural revegetation occurs areas without vegetation dominate in streambeds tops and slopes of the gullies and in isolated spots the accumulation of sediments and vegetal recruitment is observed as a product of abandoned sediments retention works community people collaborated in the establishment of bioengineering works and practices for the control of eroded soils with the support of material provided by the world wildlife foundation through the oaxaca community foundation 2 2 micro watershed morphometry the area of gullies and the drainage network formed by a set of gullies of different dimensions were characterized to start out a google earth satellite image from march 23 2012 was used and field trips were arranged to validate it identifying the main gully and its primary tributary channels an unmanned aerial vehicle uav e384 mapping drone event 38 2019 was used in the area fig 1 to obtain an ortho mosaic of images taken with canon powershot s100 camera with gps plus image stabilizer and a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 0 264 m per pixel dem was used to depict the gully system in detail the dem was processed in qgis to obtain the morphometric parameters of the micro watershed watershed divide area perimeter shape index topographic relief main gully length average slope number and cumulative length of gullies channel ranking drainage density hydrographic density and bifurcation ratio the longitudinal profile of the main gully started from the stone check dam with the use of measuring tape and hosed leveler every 10 m at each station topographic relief was recorded and also the width of the area covered by sediments was measured along 397 m as they were retained by the stone check dam 2 3 problem zone recovery plan the land recovery strategy considered rehabilitating and increasing the height of the stone check dam this is the main hydraulic structure in the drainage system located at 97 21 72 72 west 17 28 12 69 north and 2185 m altitude measures of the stone check dam retaining wall were height 3 88 m crown 1 m width 10 46 m slope 1 12 1 and a total construction volume of 128 44 m3 the stony scour protection built with light mortar had a construction volume of 15 77 m3 and was undermined by seepage as it was the spillway on the top stone check dam capacity was increased to retain sediments the top was raised over 1 m high and in the central part a spillway was built 3 m long by 1 m wide and 0 5 m high the new constructed section over the crest had a volume of 9 08 m3 fig 2 2 4 bioengineering works the complete bioengineering system in assistance with the community members consisted of establishing eight live barriers in the four main gullies fig 3 in gully 1 barrier 1 in gully 2 the barrier 2 four barriers 4 5 6 and 7 were built in gully 3 which is the main one and in gully 4 the barriers 3 and 8 live barriers made with support stakes and branches of erythrina americana miller fabaceae tree known as pipal o colorín were placed perpendicular to the cross section of each of the selected gullies with spacing between stakes of 0 5 to 1 m embedded in the streambed of the gully at depths of 0 3 to 0 5 m and an effective barrier height from 1 to 1 5 m fig 4 a e americana is a native species in the area which can be propagated by stakes support stakes selected for the live retaining structures were wider than 10 cm of diameter and branches were placed between the stakes intercrossed or tied for support fig 4b in the upstream direction of the live barrier were placed some dodonaea viscosa jacq branches and other shrubs to retain sediments but allowing some runoff fig 4c while downstream from the live barrier some branches or stones were placed to play the function of a filter blanket fig 4d 2 5 efficacy of rehabilitation practices the volume of soil retained by the stone check dam wall was estimated with a topographic survey the stone check dam wall was overloaded with sediments and that retention was estimated with the height area capacity curve determined with the topographic survey the magnitude in the reduction of the specific degradation of the areas of gullies was estimated in 2015 where the live barriers and the stone check dam were placed whilst estimation of the volume stored in the height increased wall was made after the rainy season of that same year 2015 it was assumed that the sediments were deposited proportionally along the longitudinal gully profile the sediments retained in the live barriers were estimated with topographic surveys of cross sections of the gullies carried out in the total of stations the first topographic survey was made prior to the construction of the live barriers in cross sections every 5 m and in five to six points per section top slopes and gully bed up to 50 m upstream direction the second topographic survey was carried out with the same procedure but after the rainy season the surface analysis module was used to process digital elevation model dem and to quantify the volume of sediment retained in each live barrier with the spatial analyst extension of the arcmap program the cut fill tool allowed us to assess the volume intersected between the two dems profiled before and after the rainy season 2 6 physico chemical analysis of soils and sediments the sediments retained by the live barriers were sampled after the rainy season of 2015 the sediment samples were taken at 15 cm depth in each live barrier and also a soil sample was taken as control sediment and soil samples were determined for texture bulk density field capacity permanent wilting point and potassium nitrogen and organic matter contents 3 results and discussion 3 1 micro watershed morphometry the micro watershed of santa maría tiltepec is elongated with a shape index of 0 24 over a surface of 37 ha it measures 2525 m in perimeter it has a slope of 13 with a total decrease in topographic relief of 160 m from the watershed divide to stone check dam the drainage system is complex with 711 gullies of different sizes and lengths in constant growth the main one of 1232 m and a cumulative length of 21 680 m of gullies there appear both high drainage density 586 m ha 1 and hydrographic density of 19 gullies ha 1 which confer high capacity for removal and transport of soil particles by surface runoff based on the stream classification system strahler 1952 for river networks six bifurcation branching orders 711 currents were detected and the average bifurcation ratio rb is 3 72 table 1 this indicates that about 4 gullies of one given order discharge water and sediments in a gully of immediate superior order in the santa

specifically designed for alluvial channels simon et al 2008 it is programmed in the microsoft excel environment data input along with the various subroutines are included in different worksheets including input geometry bank material bank vegetation and protection bank model output and toe model output simon et al 2000 bstem has three sub models bank stability model toe erosion model and riproot model the sub models are interlinked and their combined output determines the stability conditions of the gully either of them can directly affect the factor of safety of the gully bank the detailed descriptions of the three sub models are given below 2 1 1 bank stability model the bank stability model combines three different limit equilibrium method models to calculate factor of safety fs for multi layer stream banks these are horizontal layers simon et al 2000 vertical slices with tension crack morgenstern and price 1965 langendoen and simon 2008b and cantilever failures thorne and

effects of toe protection are incorporated into the analysis by changing the characteristics of the toe material in the model the effects of erosion protection on the bank and toe can be incorporated to show the effects of erosion control measures the model estimates boundary shear stress from channel geometry and flow depth and considers critical shear stress and erodibility of two separate zones

reinforcement provided by roots of riparian vegetation pollen and simon 2005 riproot accounts for both root breaking and root pullout to estimate root reinforcement pollen and simon 2005 de baets et al 2008 a vegetation assemblage can be created by accessing the species database contained in the sub model the user enters species approximate vegetation ages and approximate percent cover of each species at each site to estimate root density alternatively the plant root tensile strength and number of roots at each specified depth can be entered by the user root reinforcement values are then calculated automatically using riproot s progressive root breaking algorithm values for native plants are reported by zegeye et al 2018b 2 2 study area the study was conducted in the debre mawi watershed located about 30 km south of lake tana at 11 20 13 n and 37 25 55 e the watershed drains an area of 608 ha the elevation ranges from 2194 to 2362 m above sea level the slope in the watershed ranges from 1 to 2 for flat bottom lands and up to 30 elsewhere rainfall is unimodal and averages 1240 mm annually more than 70 of the annual rainfall occurs during june july and august the average monthly temperature is 18 c at the time of the study about 92 of the watershed was cultivated 6 were communal grazing areas in the periodically saturated bottom lands and 2 were shrubs and eucalyptus woodlots the main soil types are nitisol vertisol and regosol amare et al 2014 nitisols are located in the upper parts of the watershed and are highly suitable for crop production vertisols are found in the lower portion of the watershed where crops such as teff eragrostis tef chickpea cicer arietinum and grass pea lathyrus sativus are cultivated regosols occur on the steep hill slopes and highly eroded parts of the watershed while the watershed is located in the most agriculturally productive part of ethiopia the land is being destroyed by expanding gully networks fig 1 and to a lesser degree by sheet and rill erosion on the cultivated slopes zegeye et al 2010 langendoen et al 2013 2014 amare et al 2014 mhiret et al 2019 the gully networks are primarily found in the periodically saturated valley bottom lands abiy 2009 tebebu et al 2010 the bstem model was employed in one selected gully located at the periodically saturated bottom lands of the watershed with elevation ranging from 2215 to 2227 m and with a channel slope 0 03 about 17 4 ha drain into this gully the surficial area of the studied gully at the start of the study in 2013 was 9110 m2 and the average depth was about 4 5 m the total length of the gully was 389 m the gully had two rectangular weirs at the inlet and outlet of the gully to measure flow and suspended sediment concentration which data served other but similar studies zegeye et al 2018a 2 3 data collection and analysis as bstem is a mechanistic model the data required to operate the model are all related to quantifying the driving and resisting forces that control the hydraulic and geotechnical erosion processes some of the driving factors to gully erosion assessed in this study are groundwater table bank angle bank height and tension crack depth whereas the resisting factors are soil shear strength cohesion and friction angle plant root reinforcement and bank toe erosion control measures two options are available to provide the required input data 1 obtaining primary data using field survey and 2 using the default model values simon et al 2000 required data fall into three broad categories bank geometry hydraulic data and geotechnical data 2 3 1 bank geometry we used a tape meter and inclinometer to survey the gully geometry parameters listed in table 1 the bank and toe control measures such as gabion check dams regrading and vegetation were simulated by the model to simulate the efficiency of plant roots on bank stability we used one of the studied grass species digitaria abyssinica locally called godir which could increase soil strength by 33 kpa up to 0 2 m depth of soil and 6 4 kpa up to one meter depth zegeye et al 2018b the tension crack depth zc is usually equated to the depth at which the active pressure is zero and can therefore be calculated from soil strength parameters e g lambe and whitman 1969 2 z c 2 c γ tan 45 ϕ 2 where γ is bulk soil unit weight kn m3 tension crack depth can often be obtained from the heights of the vertical faces observed in the field and is typically half the maximum tension crack depth according to lohnes and handy 1968 the bank stability analyses are conducted for two tension crack depths 1 no tension crack at the gully bank and 2 a 1 72 m deep tension crack 2 3 2 hydraulic data piezometers approximately 5 cm diameter were installed on the gully banks prior to the rainy season in 2013 and 2014 to measure groundwater surface elevation each piezometer was installed to a maximum depth of 3 m using an auger the depth was chosen because the water table is usually less than 3 m from the surface during the rainy monsoon season tebebu et al 2010 measurements were taken twice a day at dawn and dusk the average flow depth in the gully was taken as 0 8 m which is a typical value of flow depth during larger runoff events table 1 2 3 3 geotechnical data cohesion c and internal friction angle ϕ are the primary soil parameters contributing to soil shear strength cohesion is a measure of the forces that cement soil particles whereas internal friction angle is the measure of the soil shear strength due to friction between soil particles to determine shear strength variability along the gully banks four undisturbed soil samples were collected from four layers of the left gully bank near the gully head a direct shear box was used in the laboratory to evaluate effective cohesion and the effective angle of internal friction léonard and richard 2004 the laboratory experiments were done on saturated samples μ a μ w 0 for three different normal stress values 60 120 and 240 kpa respectively values of effective normal stress and shear stress were then plotted to determine the cohesion and friction angle by linear regression fig 2 2 3 4 particle size distribution a total of eight soil samples were collected from four layers of each bank to determine the proportion of clay silt and sand the collected soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 mm sieve particle size distribution was determined using the hydrometer method day 1965 the median grain size was used to estimate soil critical shear stress below 2 3 5 estimating soil critical shear stress and soil erodibility the critical shear stress τ c is defined as the stress at which soil detachment is initiated hanson et al 2002 to estimate the critical shear stress of the study gully bank material we adopted the following formula of smerdon and beasley 1961 3 τ c 3 54 10 26 1 d 50 where d 50 median particle size m once the critical shear strength is determined we used the bstem 5 4 version to calculate erodibility 4 k 0 1 τ c 0 5 for τ c 0 2 3 6 model calibration bstem was used to determine stable head cut and sidewall slopes for the studied gully in the debre mawi watershed given the measured bank material properties however the measured cohesive strength of the clay soils comprising the gully boundary materials was quite large table 2 which does not generally represent the characteristics of the gully conditions the 85 bank angle with water table at the ground surface did not indicate a bank failure fs 1 73 without tension crack using the measured cohesion and friction angle values therefore there was a need to calibrate the model until it better predicted the measured failure width at the left bank where the soil samples were collected 2 4 model scenarios two sets of model scenarios were evaluated the first set of bstem simulations assessed the efficiency of various gully bank stabilization measures as a function of gully depth and groundwater table depth the second set of bstem simulations evaluated the required stabilization measures for a 5 m deep gully at varying groundwater table depths these scenarios will establish the level of protection that is required for shallow depth 2 m intermediate depth 2 4 m and deep 4 m gullies for both modeling scenarios we simulated 12 h of fluvial erosion for the first model scenario group the following parameters were evaluated 1 groundwater table depth 0 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 m 2 gully depth 2 3 4 and 5 m 3 tension crack presence and 4 bank protection measures the assessed bank protection measures were 1 no protection 2 riprap bank toe protection 3 vegetation planted along upper slope of the bank and 4 a combination of measures 2 and 3 the bank slope was set at 45 for the second model scenario group the following parameters were evaluated 1 groundwater table depth 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 m 2 bank grade 45 55 65 75 and 85 and 3 bank protection measures none vegetation on upper bank face and toe protection plus vegetation on upper bank face this scenario assesses the cumulative effects of bank regrading and bank protection measures on bank stability 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the model calibration in the debre mawi watershed was performed by carefully selecting values for model input parameters and comparing model predictions output for a given set of assumed conditions with observed data for the same conditions the calibrated parameters were the cohesion and the friction angles for the four bank layers table 2 as a reference for comparison with the model output we used the 2013 measured failure width at the left gully bank where the soil samples were collected and piezometer p2 was installed first we determined the relationship between the measured cohesion c and friction angle ϕ values then we expressed friction angle in terms of cohesion values c 0 6 ϕ 30 kpa after testing different values of cohesion we obtained comparable predictions of failure width 2 43 m with the measured failure width 3 2 m when one third of the measured cohesion and the corresponding values of friction angle were used as a model input table 2 3 2 effects of gully depth tension crack and gully protection measures on bank stability fig 3 shows that gully bank stability is greatly affected by gully and groundwater table depths when a tension crack is present a 5 m high gully bank with an angle of 45 is unstable fs 1 3 even with bank toe and top protection fig 3 similarly a 4 m deep gully with the same bank angle will require bank protection measures to be stable when tension cracks are absent a 45 bank angle without any protection measures will only be stable when the gully depth is less than 4 m when tension crack formation can be prevented vegetation becomes more effective in stabilizing the gully bank when the gully depth decreases thus gullies less than 5 m deep are stable at the specified bank angle 45 and planted with vegetation on the top portion of the bank fig 3a however when tension cracks are present the effect of vegetation is limited in the presence of tension cracks a 5 m deep gully for groundwater table depths exceeding 0 5 m can be stabilized at the bank angle of 45 fig 3b without tension cracks the gully banks are stable for all groundwater table depths at this bank angle this shows that tension cracks are an important factor causing bank failure consequently reducing the depth of tension cracks making the bank less steep and filling in the gully will significantly reduce the probability of bank failure 3 3 effects of groundwater table bank angle and gully protection measures on bank stability as shown in fig 4 the bank angle groundwater table and bank top and toe protection measures can significantly affect the stability of the banks of a 5 m deep gully the existing gully banks whose original bank angles equaled 85 are not stable fs 1 3 even when the groundwater table is below the gully bottom 5 m depth the same outcome was simulated when the vegetation digitaria abyssinica which adds a cohesion of 6 4 kpa to the top one meter of bank soil was included however the gully bank at this angle was stable when the bank toe is protected fig 4 in this case the vegetation only increased the fs by 0 04 whereas the riprap at the toe increased the fs by 0 14 as toe erosion which steepens the base of the bank was prevented however a 5 m groundwater table depth only occurs during the dry season in the study area in the wet season the groundwater table usually reaches the surface fig 5 thereby destabilizing the bank under fully saturated conditions the gully bank can only be conditionally stable if the bank angle is reduced to 45 fig 4 consequently the regrading of gully bank may not be sufficient to stabilize the gully when the groundwater elevation is near or at the surface when the bank toe is protected against fluvial erosion and the upper gully surface is vegetated the fs would increase to a value of 1 36 even when the groundwater table depth is near or at the surface when the groundwater table is lowered to 0 5 m below the surface the bank toe is protected and vegetation is present on the bank top the fs increased to a value of 1 43 fig 4 according to the bstem model for a groundwater depth in the gully bank that varies between 0 55 and 1 66 m below the surface the gully bank should be regraded to 45 50 and vegetated with plant species such as digitaria abyssinica which could increase soil strength by 6 4 kpa in addition the toe should be protected from erosion using for example riprap or gabion check dam these integrated measures would increase factor of safety from 1 3 to 1 5 therefore stabilizing the gully bank fig 4 the results indicate that an integrated approach is required to halt gully erosion in the ethiopian highlands amare et al 2019 suggested that an integrated landscape approach that accounts for the combined subsurface and surface drainage is needed to ensure effective implementation of gully rehabilitation measures 3 4 implementation of recommended gully treatment 2014 the above model recommendation was used to treat the 5 m high bank of the study gully at the location where bank materials were analyzed prior to 2014 rainy season fig 6 first a gabion check dam near the headcut and wooden check dams about four meter below the gabion were installed to dissipate the flow energy and hence to protect against bank toe erosion second the right bank was regraded to 45 and the left bank was regraded to 65 we were unable to regrade the left bank to slopes lower than 65 because of a nearby eucalyptus tree stand third elephant grass and sesbania which could enhance soil shear strength up to 7 kpa and 12 kpa respectively zegeye et al 2018b were planted on the regraded banks as they are fast growing and easily accessible plant species this treatment was successful in controlling the linear retreat of the gully headcut but was only partially successful to mitigate lateral bank erosion fig 6 since the bank toe of the regraded bank was not fully protected a high runoff event damaged the wooden check dams that accumulate a lot of sediment and scoured the bank toe and formed undercuts and hence significantly reduced factor of safety the total sediment yield and sediment concentration decreased by 52 and 19 at the outlet in 2014 as compared to 2013 while it was approximately equal at the inlet in the two rainy seasons table 3 similar results were obtained by simon et al 2011 that is the addition of toe protection to eroding streambanks can reduce overall volumes of eroded sediment up to 85 100 langendoen et al 2014 also reported that gully heads and banks with angles not exceeding 45 should be stable under fully saturated conditions they also showed in similar studies that bstem predicted stable bank slopes between 75 for a bank height of 3 m to 47 for a bank height of 6 m 3 5 lessons learnt from the application of the bstem we learned that if the gully head is treated thereby arresting its upward migration gully expansion can be significantly reduced and hence also the downstream sediment load the installed check dams at the bank toe below the planted vegetation and the regraded sidewall banks were not maintained after the high runoff damaged the protecting materials which resulted in some failures towards the end of the rainy season to limit the impact of scouring the bank toe underneath the regraded bank needs to be protected and maintained therefore maintenance of gully protecting measures is critical to sustain the benefit of structures further it would be better to plant vegetation towards the end of the rainy season so that plants can get enough time at least nine months until the next monsoon season to establish their above and below ground biomass to resist failures by high runoff events as also reported by simon et al 2011 furthermore peak runoff and its recurrence are critical design parameters for erosion control measures in this regard dagnew et al 2017b for a nearby study area found that a single 10 minute event caused sediment loss of 22 of the annual sediment yield and 30 75 of the sediment yield was contributed by the largest daily event in each year similar studies such as tollner 2002 tebebu et al 2017 amare et al 2019 and mihret et al 2019 supported the contribution of peak runoff on annual soil loss dagnew et al 2017b recommended that to effectively reduce sediment loss conservation measures should be directed to decreasing runoff during large storms therefore the peak runoff in the catchment should be estimated before designing gully bank protecting structures so that it can resist the peak runoff generated during the most intense storm 4 conclusion a continuous expansion of the gully network was observed throughout the debre mawi watershed deep tension cracks and pipe networks continuously develop near the gully edges that promote gully bank failure even with minimum rainfall in this paper we demonstrated the applicability of bstem in evaluating the bank stability conditions by considering different scenarios the results suggest that considering various factors including subsurface and surface drainage gully depth peak rainfall events and soil types is crucial to halt gully erosion in the sub humid ethiopian highlands further using deep rooted plant species when planted at the top surface of the regraded bank can prevent bank collapse especially in the absence of tension cracks finally the results of the study support that bstem could be used by land managers to evaluate and implement gully control measures under variable environmental conditions in general an integrated approach that combines both regrading of the gully banks and bio engineered gully rehabilitation measures could reduce gully erosion and associated negative consequences conflict

al 2008 a vegetation assemblage can be created by accessing the species database contained in the sub model the user enters species approximate vegetation ages and approximate percent cover of each species at each site to estimate root density alternatively the plant root tensile strength and number of roots at each specified depth can be entered by the user root reinforcement values are then calculated automatically using riproot s progressive root breaking algorithm values for native plants are reported by zegeye et al 2018b 2 2 study area the study was conducted in the debre mawi watershed located about 30 km south of lake tana at 11 20 13 n and 37 25 55 e the watershed drains an area of 608 ha the elevation ranges from 2194 to 2362 m above sea level the slope in the watershed ranges from 1 to 2 for flat bottom lands and up to 30 elsewhere rainfall is unimodal and averages 1240 mm annually more than 70 of the annual rainfall occurs during june july and august the average monthly temperature is 18 c at the time of the study about 92 of the watershed was cultivated 6 were communal grazing areas in the periodically saturated bottom lands and 2 were shrubs and eucalyptus woodlots the main soil types are nitisol vertisol and regosol amare et al 2014 nitisols are located in the upper parts of the watershed and are highly suitable for crop production vertisols are found in the lower portion of the watershed where crops such as teff eragrostis tef chickpea cicer arietinum and grass pea lathyrus sativus are cultivated regosols occur on the steep hill slopes and highly eroded parts of the watershed while the watershed is located in the most agriculturally productive part of ethiopia the land is being destroyed by expanding gully networks fig 1 and to a lesser degree by sheet and rill erosion on the cultivated slopes zegeye et al 2010 langendoen et al 2013 2014 amare et al 2014 mhiret et al 2019 the gully networks are primarily found in the periodically saturated valley bottom lands abiy 2009 tebebu et al 2010 the bstem model was employed in one selected gully located at the periodically saturated bottom lands of the watershed with elevation ranging from 2215 to 2227 m and with a channel slope 0 03 about 17 4 ha drain into this gully the surficial area of the studied gully at the start of the study in 2013 was 9110 m2 and the average depth was about 4 5 m the total length of the gully was 389 m the gully had two rectangular weirs at the inlet and outlet of the gully to measure flow and suspended sediment concentration which data served other but similar studies zegeye et al 2018a 2 3 data collection and analysis as bstem is a mechanistic model the data required to operate the model are all related to quantifying the driving and resisting forces that control the hydraulic and geotechnical erosion processes some of the driving factors to gully erosion assessed in this study are groundwater table bank angle bank height and tension crack depth whereas the resisting factors are soil shear strength cohesion and friction angle plant root reinforcement and bank toe erosion control measures two options are available to provide the required input data 1 obtaining primary data using field survey and 2 using the default model values simon et al 2000 required data fall into three broad categories bank geometry hydraulic data and geotechnical data 2 3 1 bank geometry we used a tape meter and inclinometer to survey the gully geometry parameters listed in table 1 the bank and toe control measures such as gabion check dams regrading and vegetation were simulated by the model to simulate the efficiency of plant roots on bank stability we used one of the studied grass species digitaria abyssinica locally called godir which could increase soil strength by 33 kpa up to 0 2 m depth of soil and 6 4 kpa up to one meter depth zegeye et al 2018b the tension crack depth zc is usually equated to the depth at which the active pressure is zero and can therefore be calculated from soil strength parameters e g lambe and whitman 1969 2 z c 2 c γ tan 45 ϕ 2 where γ is bulk soil unit weight kn m3 tension crack depth can often be obtained from the heights of the vertical faces observed in the field and is typically half the maximum tension crack depth according to lohnes and handy 1968 the bank stability analyses are conducted for two tension crack depths 1 no tension crack at the gully bank and 2 a 1 72 m deep tension crack 2 3 2 hydraulic data piezometers approximately 5 cm diameter were installed on the gully banks prior to the rainy season in 2013 and 2014 to measure groundwater surface elevation each piezometer was installed to a maximum depth of 3 m using an auger the depth was chosen because the water table is usually less than 3 m from the surface during the rainy monsoon season tebebu et al 2010 measurements were taken twice a day at dawn and dusk the average flow depth in the gully was taken as 0 8 m which is a typical value of flow depth during larger runoff events table 1 2 3 3 geotechnical data cohesion c and internal friction angle ϕ are the primary soil parameters contributing to soil shear strength cohesion is a measure of the forces that cement soil particles whereas internal friction angle is the measure of the soil shear strength due to friction between soil particles to determine shear strength variability along the gully banks four undisturbed soil samples were collected from four layers of the left gully bank near the gully head a direct shear box was used in the laboratory to evaluate effective cohesion and the effective angle of internal friction léonard and richard 2004 the laboratory experiments were done on saturated samples μ a μ w 0 for three different normal stress values 60 120 and 240 kpa respectively values of effective normal stress and shear stress were then plotted to determine the cohesion and friction angle by linear regression fig 2 2 3 4 particle size distribution a total of eight soil samples were collected from four layers of each bank to determine the proportion of clay silt and sand the collected soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 2 mm sieve particle size distribution was determined using the hydrometer method day 1965 the median grain size was used to estimate soil critical shear stress below 2 3 5 estimating soil critical shear stress and soil erodibility the critical shear stress τ c is defined as the stress at which soil detachment is initiated hanson et al 2002 to estimate the critical shear stress of the study gully bank material we adopted the following formula of smerdon and beasley 1961 3 τ c 3 54 10 26 1 d 50 where d 50 median particle size m once the critical shear strength is determined we used the bstem 5 4 version to calculate erodibility 4 k 0 1 τ c 0 5 for τ c 0 2 3 6 model calibration bstem was used to determine stable head cut and sidewall slopes for the studied gully in the debre mawi watershed given the measured bank material properties however the measured cohesive strength of the clay soils comprising the gully boundary materials was quite large table 2 which does not generally represent the characteristics of the gully conditions the 85 bank angle with water table at the ground surface did not indicate a bank failure fs 1 73 without tension crack using the measured cohesion and friction angle values therefore there was a need to calibrate the model until it better predicted the measured failure width at the left bank where the soil samples were collected 2 4 model scenarios two sets of model scenarios were evaluated the first set of bstem simulations assessed the efficiency of various gully bank stabilization measures as a function of gully depth and groundwater table depth the second set of bstem simulations evaluated the required stabilization measures for a 5 m deep gully at varying groundwater table depths these scenarios will establish the level of protection that is required for shallow depth 2 m intermediate depth 2 4 m and deep 4 m gullies for both modeling scenarios we simulated 12 h of fluvial erosion for the first model scenario group the following parameters were evaluated 1 groundwater table depth 0 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 m 2 gully depth 2 3 4 and 5 m 3 tension crack presence and 4 bank protection measures the assessed bank protection measures were 1 no protection 2 riprap bank toe protection 3 vegetation planted along upper slope of the bank and 4 a combination of measures 2 and 3 the bank slope was set at 45 for the second model scenario group the following parameters were evaluated 1 groundwater table depth 0 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 m 2 bank grade 45 55 65 75 and 85 and 3 bank protection measures none vegetation on upper bank face and toe protection plus vegetation on upper bank face this scenario assesses the cumulative effects of bank regrading and bank protection measures on bank stability 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the model calibration in the debre mawi watershed was performed by carefully selecting values for model input parameters and comparing model predictions output for a given set of assumed conditions with observed data for the same conditions the calibrated parameters were the cohesion and the friction angles for the four bank layers table 2 as a reference for comparison with the model output we used the 2013 measured failure width at the left gully bank where the soil samples were collected and piezometer p2 was installed first we determined the relationship between the measured cohesion c and friction angle ϕ values then we expressed friction angle in terms of cohesion values c 0 6 ϕ 30 kpa after testing different values of cohesion we obtained comparable predictions of failure width 2 43 m with the measured failure width 3 2 m when one third of the measured cohesion and the corresponding values of friction angle were used as a model input table 2 3 2 effects of gully depth tension crack and gully protection measures on bank stability fig 3 shows that gully bank stability is greatly affected by gully and groundwater table depths when a tension crack is present a 5 m high gully bank with an angle of 45 is unstable fs 1 3 even with bank toe and top protection fig 3 similarly a 4 m deep gully with the same bank angle will require bank protection measures to be stable when tension cracks are absent a 45 bank angle without any protection measures will only be stable when the gully depth is less than 4 m when tension crack formation can be prevented vegetation becomes more effective in stabilizing the gully bank when the gully depth decreases thus gullies less than 5 m deep are stable at the specified bank angle 45 and planted with vegetation on the top portion of the bank fig 3a however when tension cracks are present the effect of vegetation is limited in the presence of tension cracks a 5 m deep gully for groundwater table depths exceeding 0 5 m can be stabilized at the bank angle of 45 fig 3b without tension cracks the gully banks are stable for all groundwater table depths at this bank angle this shows that tension cracks are an important factor causing bank failure consequently reducing the depth of tension cracks making the bank less steep and filling in the gully will significantly reduce the probability of bank failure 3 3 effects of groundwater table bank angle and gully protection measures on bank stability as shown in fig 4 the bank angle groundwater table and bank top and toe protection measures can significantly affect the stability of the banks of a 5 m deep gully the existing gully banks whose original bank angles equaled 85 are not stable fs 1 3 even when the groundwater table is below the gully bottom 5 m depth the same outcome was simulated when the vegetation digitaria abyssinica which adds a cohesion of 6 4 kpa to the top one meter of bank soil was included however the gully bank at this angle was stable when the bank toe is protected fig 4 in this case the vegetation only increased the fs by 0 04 whereas the riprap at the toe increased the fs by 0 14 as toe erosion which steepens the base of the bank was prevented however a 5 m groundwater table depth only occurs during the dry season in the study area in the wet season the groundwater table usually reaches the surface fig 5 thereby destabilizing the bank under fully saturated conditions the gully bank can only be conditionally stable if the bank angle is reduced to 45 fig 4 consequently the regrading of gully bank may not be sufficient to stabilize the gully when the groundwater elevation is near or at the surface when the bank toe is protected against fluvial erosion and the upper gully surface is vegetated the fs would increase to a value of 1 36 even when the groundwater table depth is near or at the surface when the groundwater table is lowered to 0 5 m below the surface the bank toe is protected and vegetation is present on the bank top the fs increased to a value of 1 43 fig 4 according to the bstem model for a groundwater depth in the gully bank that varies between 0 55 and 1 66 m below the surface the gully bank should be regraded to 45 50 and vegetated with plant species such as digitaria abyssinica which could increase soil strength by 6 4 kpa in addition the toe should be protected from erosion using for example riprap or gabion check dam these integrated measures would increase factor of safety from 1 3 to 1 5 therefore stabilizing the gully bank fig 4 the results indicate that an integrated approach is required to halt gully erosion in the ethiopian highlands amare et al 2019 suggested that an integrated landscape approach that accounts for the combined subsurface and surface drainage is needed to ensure effective implementation of gully rehabilitation measures 3 4 implementation of recommended gully treatment 2014 the above model recommendation was used to treat the 5 m high bank of the study gully at the location where bank materials were analyzed prior to 2014 rainy season fig 6 first a gabion check dam near the headcut and wooden check dams about four meter below the gabion were installed to dissipate the flow energy and hence to protect against bank toe erosion second the right bank was regraded to 45 and the left bank was regraded to 65 we were unable to regrade the left bank to slopes lower than 65 because of a nearby eucalyptus tree stand third elephant grass and sesbania which could enhance soil shear strength up to 7 kpa and 12 kpa respectively zegeye et al 2018b were planted on the regraded banks as they are fast growing and easily accessible plant species this treatment was successful in controlling the linear retreat of the gully headcut but was only partially successful to mitigate lateral bank erosion fig 6 since the bank toe of the regraded bank was not fully protected a high runoff event damaged the wooden check dams that accumulate a lot of sediment and scoured the bank toe and formed undercuts and hence significantly reduced factor of safety the total sediment yield and sediment concentration decreased by 52 and 19 at the outlet in 2014 as compared to 2013 while it was approximately equal at the inlet in the two rainy seasons table 3 similar results were obtained by simon et al 2011 that is the addition of toe protection to eroding streambanks can reduce overall volumes of eroded sediment up to 85 100 langendoen et al 2014 also reported that gully heads and banks with angles not exceeding 45 should be stable under fully saturated conditions they also showed in similar studies that bstem predicted stable bank slopes between 75 for a bank height of 3 m to 47 for a bank height of 6 m 3 5 lessons learnt from the application of the bstem we learned that if the gully head is treated thereby arresting its upward migration gully expansion can be significantly reduced and hence also the downstream sediment load the installed check dams at the bank toe below the planted vegetation and the regraded sidewall banks were not maintained after the high runoff damaged the protecting materials which resulted in some failures towards the end of the rainy season to limit the impact of scouring the bank toe underneath the regraded bank needs to be protected and maintained therefore maintenance of gully protecting measures is critical to sustain the benefit of structures further it would be better to plant vegetation towards the end of the rainy season so that plants can get enough time at least nine months until the next monsoon season to establish their above and below ground biomass to resist failures by high runoff events as also reported by simon et al 2011 furthermore peak runoff and its recurrence are critical design parameters for erosion control measures in this regard dagnew et al 2017b for a nearby study area found that a single 10 minute event caused sediment loss of 22 of the annual sediment yield and 30 75 of the sediment yield was contributed by the largest daily event in each year similar studies such as tollner 2002 tebebu et al 2017 amare et al 2019 and mihret et al 2019 supported the contribution of peak runoff on annual soil loss dagnew et al 2017b recommended that to effectively reduce sediment loss conservation measures should be directed to decreasing runoff during large storms therefore the peak runoff in the catchment should be estimated before designing gully bank protecting structures so that it can resist the peak runoff generated during the most intense storm 4 conclusion a continuous expansion of the gully network was observed throughout the debre mawi watershed deep tension cracks and pipe networks continuously develop near the gully edges that promote gully bank failure even with minimum rainfall in this paper we demonstrated the applicability of bstem in evaluating the bank stability conditions by considering different scenarios the results suggest that considering various factors including subsurface and surface drainage gully depth peak rainfall events and soil types is crucial to halt gully erosion in the sub humid ethiopian highlands further using deep rooted plant species when planted at the top surface of the regraded bank can prevent bank collapse especially in the absence of tension cracks finally the results of the study support that bstem could be used by land managers to evaluate and implement gully control measures under variable environmental conditions in general an integrated approach that combines both regrading of the gully banks and bio engineered gully rehabilitation measures could reduce gully erosion and associated negative consequences conflict

prevalent and diverse in winter samples which harbored the intl1 gene and genes encoding resistance to beta lactams mls antibiotics sulfonamides and tetracyclines the bla oxa and bla ctx m genes were detected only in two autumn samples the bla tem gene was prevalent in all samples regardless of the time and place of sampling variations in the prevalence of args were not observed along the analyzed

genes seasonal variations pilica river ecohydrology 1 introduction antibiotics have been used extensively and often inappropriately ever since alexander fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 kardos and demain 2011 the overuse and misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and genes args which decrease the effectiveness of antibacterial treatment pruneau et al 2011 marti et al 2014a b the above poses a very serious problem in clinical practice where antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for infectious diseases antibiotic resistance ar spurs the search for new and stronger drugs which are evacuated with hospital and municipal waste due to excessive drug consumption and inappropriate management of unused drugs rodriguez mozaz and weinberg 2010 antibiotics are widely used in human and veterinary medicine and agriculture and they are present in surface runoffs and treated wastewater which contributes to their spread in the natural environment

health kümmerer 2009a river pollution exerts selective pressure on bacteria which develop adaptive mechanisms enabling them to grow and develop in aquatic ecosystems with high antibiotic loads therefore water can serve as a vector of pollution promoting the spread of arb and args in the environment xi et al 2009 stalder et al 2012 galvin et al 2010 due to the ease of bacterial transfer across considerable distances and the exchange of args between microorganisms galvin et al 2010 the microbiological quality of water is particularly compromised in densely populated urban areas where treated wastewater from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is discharged to rivers according to cano et al 2009 and fahrenfeld et al 2013 wwtps are particularly predisposed to the proliferation and spread of arb and args despite the fact that microorganisms are effectively removed from raw sewage in wwtps bacteria including arb are evacuated with treated wastewater to the aquatic environment where they contribute to the spread of ar and args novo et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 storteboom et al 2010 point source pollution including wwtps and nonpoint source pollution such as runoffs from

unweighted pair group with average linkages as clustering method the analysis was performed in molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega7 software kumar et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 prevalence of beta lactams resistance genes the bla tem gene was detected in dna isolated from river water samples collected in all seasons of the year table 3 fig 2 a in the group of genes encoding resistance to beta lactams bla tem is most often identified in environmental samples korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 which was also the case in this study bla tem was also among the most prevalent environmental genes identified by allen et al 2010 and mroczkowska and barlow 2008 whereas korzeniewska and harnisz 2013 detected beta lactam resistance genes in 15 of water samples collected from the łyna river in olsztyn the widespread distribution of the bla tem gene in the environment can be attributed to the fact that this gene is carried by a plasmid encoding resistance to broad spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins which is easily transmitted during horizontal gene transfer the bla tem gene can reach river water with treated effluents and soil runoffs in the present study sampling sites were located in the vicinity of effluent discharge points moreover the floodplains are covered in part by agricultural areas including fields fertilized by animal manure and pastures fecal contaminants of animal origin can be transferred to soil during fertilization and directly during grazing demanèche et al 2008 detected the bla tem gene in soil samples from large scale and family farms the bla tem gene was present in soil regardless of the type of agricultural production in vegetable and fruit farms and orchards water used for irrigation and fertilizers is a potential source of soil contamination with pathogenic bacteria including arb these bacteria can be transferred from soil to the aquatic environment where they lead to the spread of ar berger et al 2010 quiro santiago et al 2009 antibiotic resistant bacteria and genesis river water pose a considerable environmental hazard and a public health risk amos et al 2014 the bla oxa gene was detected in the dna of the sample collected in przedbórz r1 in november au and the bla ctx m gene was identified in the sample collected in warka r7 in the same season table 3 fig 2a the areas surrounding this sampling site are small urban buildings and arable fields kiedrzyńska et al 2014 a single detection could be indicative of short term water pollution or the removal of bacteria carrying the relevant genes during wastewater treatment beta lactams are widely used in the treatment of bacterial infections but they are effectively removed during wastewater treatment and are very rarely or rarely identified in environmental samples harnisz et al 2015 beta lactams are also rapidly hydrolyzed in the environment and therefore they do not exert selective pressure on arb the high frequency of occurrence of genes responsible for beta lactam resistance in analyzed river samples may be related to the prevalence of transformation products tps of antibiotics whose presence in even trace amounts in the environment may affect the appearance of these genes antibiotics and their tps arb and args can penetrate the surface water rural groundwater supplies drinking water soil and plants growing in soil irrigated with contaminated water this process is a direct risk to human and animal health because drugs args and arb transported to the environment can be transferred back to people and animals korzeniewska and harnisz 2019 the bla shv gene was not detected in any of the tested samples table 3 according to korzeniewska and harnisz 2013 this gene rarely occurs in the natural environment 3 2 prevalence of tetracyclines resistance genes interestingly the tet e gene was detected in all water samples collected in april sp table 3 fig 2b but according to harnisz et al 2015 tet a is the most prevalent determinant of tetracycline resistance in the aquatic environment in the present study the tet a gene was identified sporadically in samples collected in february wi and april sp tet b and tet c were also detected sporadically whereas tet d was not observed in any of the tested samples it should be noted that tet b is relatively ubiquitous in the environment according to harnisz et al 2015 it is prevalence in river water is strongly correlated with the presence of other tetracycline resistance genes dissolved oxygen concentration temperature and antibiotic levels in water the sporadic presence of tet b and tet c genes and the absence of tet d observed in our study confirm that ar patterns can be specific to local environmental conditions su et al 2012 variations in the prevalence of tet genes were not observed with an increase in distance from the river source 3 3 prevalence of other antibiotics resistance determinants the ermf gene encoding resistance to mls antibiotics was noted in the samples collected in przedbórz r1 and sulejów r2 in february wi and april sp table 3 fig 2c this gene was also detected in the samples collected from the remaining sites in july su the presence of the ermf gene in february samples could be attributed to higher antibiotic consumption and higher excretion of antibiotics to municipal wastewater in winter awad et al 2014 treated effluents containing residual antibiotics are evacuated to the river where they increase arb and args loads in spring and summer animal grazing in pastures surrounding the river is responsible for higher levels of fecal contamination fecal contaminants of animal origin reach the river with surface runoffs chen and zhang 2013 detected args including ermf in environmental dna isolated from livestock feces and biofilters in wwtps which indicates that animal feces and wastewater significantly contribute to the spread of args in the aquatic environment the results of our previous study related to wwtps effluents discharged to pilica river confirm this statement czatzkowska et al 2019 the prevalence of intl1 and sul1 genes was similar in the tested samples table 3 these genes can be closely related due to the presence of gene cassettes that transfer resistance genes between microorganisms antunes et al 2005 the sul1 gene encodes dihydropteroate synthase which confers resistance to sulfonamides and is usually present in class 1 integrons that also contain other args mohapatra et al 2008 the prevalence of sul1 and intl1in the pilica river could be associated with the presence of pastures fields and pens with animals and therefore sources of antibiotics fecal bacteria arb and args that reach river water with surface runoffs the sul1 gene encoding resistance to sulfonamides is abundant in the aquatic environment and it is transferred horizontally within and between bacterial species in both sewage mukherjee and chakraborty 2006 and river water khan et al 2013 the highest levels of args including sul1 are also directly associated with high concentrations of sulfonamides in the environment khan et al 2013 khan et al 2013 reported high antibiotic concentrations and the presence of the sul1 gene in the downstream segment of a river in the vicinity of urban areas ham et al 2012 demonstrated that the presence of arb and args in samples of river water collected in an urban area was related with fecal contamination korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 observed the highest counts of sul1 copies in samples of wwtps effluents among all args analyzed srinivasan et al 2005 detected sul1 in bacterial isolates from fecal suspensions collected in dairy farms they suggested that livestock feces are a source of arb and args which are easily transferred from closed farms to pastures in the current study the lina gene was observed mainly in samples of river water collected in april sp fig 2c at five sites sulejów r2 smardzewice r3 spała r4 nowe miasto r5 and białobrzegi

a seasonal basis which could be directly linked with a higher number of infections in the corresponding period in particular infections caused by anaerobic bacteria eitel et al 2013 the prevalence of lina in bacteroides strains was determined at 21 7 by eitel et al 2013 niestępski et al 2019 were observed lina gene in 11 of 61 18 03 resistant strains from bacteroides fragilis group our findings give cause for concern and indicate that further research is required to halt the spread of ar in the environment the aac 6 ib cr gene was not detected in this study table 3 this gene encodes the production of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase which decreases sensitivity to ciprofloxacin a fluoroquinolone antibiotic the aac 6 ib cr gene is rarely detected in environmental samples the problem is that it is difficult to detect this gene from genomic dna because it occurs on the plasmid and the standard pcr method does not always detect it pai et al 2007 lapara et al 2011 osińska et al 2016 fluoroquinolones are used mainly in hospitals and they are rarely prescribed by general practitioners in outpatient clinics none of the studied sites on the pilica river are located in the direct vicinity of hospital therefore fluoroquinolone resistant bacteria and the genes encoding resistance to fluoroquinolones could be undetectable due to considerable water dilution class 1 integrase plays an important role in the transfer and spread of args and previous research khan et al 2013 demonstrated a higher prevalence of the inti1 gene in anthropogenic environments in the present study the high frequency of occurrence of args and the inti1 gene could be correlated with high antibiotic concentrations in the analyzed river section our findings also indicate that environmental bacteria could contribute to the development of ar in clinical strains in a study by pei et al 2007 the prevalence of args was significantly higher in samples of river water collected in the vicinity of cities than in nature close areas which indicates that urban agricultural and industrial pollution significantly affect args level lapara et al 2011 zhang and zhang 2011 3 4 seasonal changes in the occurrence of args the prevalence of args differed considerably in the dna isolated from river water samples in different seasons of the year antibiotic resistance genes were most abundant and diverse

one february wi sample spring samples collected in april sp were also characterized by high prevalence and diversity of arb and args relative to winter samples it is likely that this is connected with high number of infections and high drug consumption awad et al 2014 the lowest prevalence and lack of some args was determined in the autumn season au table 3 fig 2 the results for samples collected on that season are similar to each other and they stand out from the rest of samples seasons as a separate cluster in dendrogram fig 3 knapp et al 2012 in their study recorded that in water column of the river the levels of args were more spatially variable in the dry season than the wet season with the proximity of waste outfalls strongly influencing numbers of args zheng et al 2018 also observed seasonal variations in args and the transport of bacterial communities they observed the highest absolute abundance of args occurred in summer and the 3 47 5 58 times increasing of arg abundances in a peri urban river near farmland and villages in comparison to source the abundance of args in water samples collected throughout the year points to high pollutant loads in the analyzed river which contributes to microbial development and the spread of arb and args the identified args indicate that the pilica river is a receiver of both point source wwtps and nonpoint source pollution agricultural production in the catchment treated wastewater evacuated from urban areas significantly compromises the microbiological quality of river water and contributes to the spread of arb and args zhang and zhang 2011 4 conclusions no differences in the prevalence of args were found along the studied section of the pilica river antibiotic resistance genes and the intl1 gene which participates in horizontal gene transfer between microbial communities were frequently encountered in water samples from all sites the abundance of args could be attributed to antibiotic overuse which leads to the permanence of args in the environment and poses a serious threat for public health antibiotic resistance genes were most abundant and diverse in water samples collected in winter bla tem tet a tet b ermf sul1 intl1 when bacterial infections are more prevalent the results of the study indicate that pollution of the pilica river by args is probably caused by anthropogenic processes pollutant loads contribute to the high prevalence and diversity of arb and args in river water which is polluted by point sources as well as outflow from agriculture and tourism the spread of arb and args in the food chain and the environment carries immense health risks further ecohydrological research is needed to determine distribution of arb and args and the microbiological contamination along

1079,the aim of study was to analyze the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes args in the pilica river seasonal variations in the occurrence of args in river water were also determined water samples were collected in 7 sites situated along a 186 km section of the pilica river from przedbórz to estuary river water was sampled four times between november 2017 and july 2018 environmental dna was isolated from water samples and selected genes encoding resistance to tetracyclines tet a tet b tet c tet d tet e beta lactams bla oxa bla shv bla tem bla ctx m macrolide lincosamide and streptogramin mls antibiotics ermf and lina sulfonamides sul1 fluoroquinolones aac 6 ib cr as well as the integrase 1 intl1 gene and the 16s rrna gene were amplified by standard pcr args were most prevalent and diverse in winter samples which harbored the intl1 gene and genes encoding resistance to beta lactams mls antibiotics sulfonamides and tetracyclines the bla oxa and bla ctx m genes were detected only in two autumn samples the bla tem gene was prevalent in all samples regardless of the time and place of sampling variations in the prevalence of args were not observed along the analyzed section of the pilica river which indicates that pollutant loads did not increase along the river continuum it should be noted that selected genes bla tem tet a tet e ermf lina were present in all or nearly all water samples regardless of sampling date or sampling site which indicates that these args are ubiquitous in the environment keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes seasonal variations pilica river ecohydrology 1 introduction antibiotics have been used extensively and often inappropriately ever since alexander fleming discovered penicillin in 1928 kardos and demain 2011 the overuse and misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and genes args which decrease the effectiveness of antibacterial treatment pruneau et al 2011 marti et al 2014a b the above poses a very serious problem in clinical practice where antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for infectious diseases antibiotic resistance ar spurs the search for new and stronger drugs which are evacuated with hospital and municipal waste due to excessive drug consumption and inappropriate management of unused drugs rodriguez mozaz and weinberg 2010 antibiotics are widely used in human and veterinary medicine and agriculture and they are present in surface runoffs and treated wastewater which contributes to their spread in the natural environment including soil air lakes and rivers kümmerer 2009a b antibiotics and their metabolites can directly influence the composition and structure of microbial communities in water aminov and mackie 2007 baran et al 2011 and the functioning of aquatic ecosystems costanzo et al 2005 schmitt et al 2006 surface runoffs from urban areas carry significant amounts of chemical pollutants and microorganisms and they considerably contribute to the contamination of rivers cano et al 2009 fahrenfeld et al 2013 dacosta et al 2006 cheng et al 2015 ghosh and lapara 2007 joy et al 2013 marti et al 2014a b the resulting public health risks are immense because river water is widely used in agriculture for livestock and crop production zhu et al 2013 coutinho et al 2014 and in tourism and recreation for swimming sailing and fishing coutinho et al 2014 xu et al 2015 yang et al 2014 even at low concentrations antibiotics carried by surface water pose a considerable threat for the environment and public health kümmerer 2009a river pollution exerts selective pressure on bacteria which develop adaptive mechanisms enabling them to grow and develop in aquatic ecosystems with high antibiotic loads therefore water can serve as a vector of pollution promoting the spread of arb and args in the environment xi et al 2009 stalder et al 2012 galvin et al 2010 due to the ease of bacterial transfer across considerable distances and the exchange of args between microorganisms galvin et al 2010 the microbiological quality of water is particularly compromised in densely populated urban areas where treated wastewater from wastewater treatment plants wwtps is discharged to rivers according to cano et al 2009 and fahrenfeld et al 2013 wwtps are particularly predisposed to the proliferation and spread of arb and args despite the fact that microorganisms are effectively removed from raw sewage in wwtps bacteria including arb are evacuated with treated wastewater to the aquatic environment where they contribute to the spread of ar and args novo et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 storteboom et al 2010 point source pollution including wwtps and nonpoint source pollution such as runoffs from catchment areas increase the levels of arb and args in the aquatic environment czekalski et al 2014 lin et al 2005 which has been identified as their reservoir baquero et al 2008 the first principle of ecohydrology is quantification of processes in the riverine catchments to provides scientific understanding of the hydrology biota interactions zalewski 2000 2014 zalewski et al 2016 therefore further research is needed to determine the sources and mechanisms by which args are transferred in aquatic ecosystems in order to propose effective programs for preventing and controlling the spread of ar in the environment the aim of this study was to analyze the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes in the pilica river poland continuum of a 186 km long section of 8341 km2 catchment including a reservoir and the up and down river sections seasonal changes in the prevalence of args were also determined according to river continuum to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first ever study in poland analyzing the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes in water samples collected along a substantial section of river continuum moreover seasonal changes in the prevalence of args in the river water samples were also determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the pilica river 342 km long is the biggest left bank tributary of the vistula river the baltic sea catchment fig 1 the pilica river flows through the southern and central poland and crosses a few regions the upper part of the valley altitudes 360 180 m a s l is located in the kraków częstochowa upland and in the przedbórz upland the lower part 95 170 m a s l is located in the masovia lowland in the middle part of the valley on 136 km of the river from the estuary the sulejów reservoir 2700 ha area is located fig 1 outside the reservoir the natural character of the river channel has been preserved nearly along its entire course including numerous meanders and oxbow lakes the river banks and the floodplains hosting highly efficient floodwater retention and nutrient sedimentation processes are mostly covered by rushes wet meadows and riparian willow communities kiedrzyńska et al 2008a 2008b skłodowski et al 2014 kiedrzyńska et al 2015 pilica river catchment is covered mainly by agricultural areas forests and build up areas including cities factories and touristic infrastructure hence river water is a receiver of point and surface sources of pollutants point sources include 143 wastewater treatment plants among which the major urban wwtps are koniecpol przedbórz sulejów piotrków trybunalski tomaszów mazowiecki nowe miasto białobrzegi and warka kiedrzyńska et al 2014 the catchment area is predominantly agricultural as agricultural lands account for more than 60 of its total area and forests cover about 31 of the catchment on average only 59 of the human population in the pilica river catchment is connected to wastewater treatment plants wwtps the range from 51 3 to 70 5 depending on the region of the catchment kiedrzyńska et al 2014 water samples were collected along a 186 km section of the pilica river fig 1 in seven sites table 1 samples were taken from the bridges site r1 r2 r4 r5 r6 r7 and from the site located just below a dam of the sulejów reservoir r3 2 2 sample collection water samples were collected four times in a one hydrological year one time in 2017 on 29 30 november autumn au and three times in 2018 16 17 february winter wi 16 17 april spring sp and 16 17 july summer su water samples of 400 ml were collected into sterile 500 ml bottles simax they were filtered with the use of vacuum pumps charles austen pumps ltd and passed through polycarbonate membrane filters with a diameter of 47 mm and 0 2 µm pore size nucleopore membrane whatman filters were placed in sterile 15 ml centrifuge tubes 2 3 sample preparation for dna isolation phosphate buffered saline was added in the amount of 10 ml to sterile 15 ml test tubes containing polycarbonate membrane filters and the contents were shaken by inverting the tubes 200 rpm min for 5 h at room temperature the solution and the sediment were transferred to 2 ml eppendorf tubes and centrifuged 9000 rpm min 15 min to separate the pellet from the supernatant the above procedure was repeated several times until the pellet was precipitated from the entire tube 10 ml 2 4 dna isolation and amplification of selected genes dna was isolated with the genomic mini kit a a biotechnology according to the manufacturer s instructions the purity and quantity of dna were determined with a spectrophotometer biophotometer eppendorf ag the 16s rrna gene was amplified by standard pcr to confirm the presence and quality of dna the reaction profiles are presented in table 2 the occurrence of genes encoding resistance to selected antibiotics was determined in river water samples the analyzed antibiotics and their resilience encoding genes are tetracyclines tet a tet b tet c tet d tet e beta lactams bla oxa bla shv bla tem bla ctx m mls antibiotics ermf and lina fluoroquinolones aac 6 ib cr also integrase intl1 and sulfonamides sul1 genes were analyzed standard pcr mixtures without dna template were used as negative controls in all reactions plasmids carrying analyzed genes verified by sequencing isolated in our previous studies by korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 niestępski et al 2019 were used as positive controls pcr products were separated electrophoretically by transferring 5 µl of every amplified dna fragment with 1 µl of loading buffer to 1 5 agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide 0 5 µg ml sigma electrophoresis was conducted for 1 h at 100 v in 1 tbe buffer and the products were visualized 2 5 cluster analysis to determine the similarity of the studied sites and collection time seasons according to the occurrence of args in water the hierarchical cluster analysis was developed the analysis was based on the presence or absence of particular antibiotic resistance determinants the relationship tree dendrogram of the analyzed samples was created with using of dice coefficient as similarity measure and unweighted pair group with average linkages as clustering method the analysis was performed in molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega7 software kumar et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 prevalence of beta lactams resistance genes the bla tem gene was detected in dna isolated from river water samples collected in all seasons of the year table 3 fig 2 a in the group of genes encoding resistance to beta lactams bla tem is most often identified in environmental samples korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 which was also the case in this study bla tem was also among the most prevalent environmental genes identified by allen et al 2010 and mroczkowska and barlow 2008 whereas korzeniewska and harnisz 2013 detected beta lactam resistance genes in 15 of water samples collected from the łyna river in olsztyn the widespread distribution of the bla tem gene in the environment can be attributed to the fact that this gene is carried by a plasmid encoding resistance to broad spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins which is easily transmitted during horizontal gene transfer the bla tem gene can reach river water with treated effluents and soil runoffs in the present study sampling sites were located in the vicinity of effluent discharge points moreover the floodplains are covered in part by agricultural areas including fields fertilized by animal manure and pastures fecal contaminants of animal origin can be transferred to soil during fertilization and directly during grazing demanèche et al 2008 detected the bla tem gene in soil samples from large scale and family farms the bla tem gene was present in soil regardless of the type of agricultural production in vegetable and fruit farms and orchards water used for irrigation and fertilizers is a potential source of soil contamination with pathogenic bacteria including arb these bacteria can be transferred from soil to the aquatic environment where they lead to the spread of ar berger et al 2010 quiro santiago et al 2009 antibiotic resistant bacteria and genesis river water pose a considerable environmental hazard and a public health risk amos et al 2014 the bla oxa gene was detected in the dna of the sample collected in przedbórz r1 in november au and the bla ctx m gene was identified in the sample collected in warka r7 in the same season table 3 fig 2a the areas surrounding this sampling site are small urban buildings and arable fields kiedrzyńska et al 2014 a single detection could be indicative of short term water pollution or the removal of bacteria carrying the relevant genes during wastewater treatment beta lactams are widely used in the treatment of bacterial infections but they are effectively removed during wastewater treatment and are very rarely or rarely identified in environmental samples harnisz et al 2015 beta lactams are also rapidly hydrolyzed in the environment and therefore they do not exert selective pressure on arb the high frequency of occurrence of genes responsible for beta lactam resistance in analyzed river samples may be related to the prevalence of transformation products tps of antibiotics whose presence in even trace amounts in the environment may affect the appearance of these genes antibiotics and their tps arb and args can penetrate the surface water rural groundwater supplies drinking water soil and plants growing in soil irrigated with contaminated water this process is a direct risk to human and animal health because drugs args and arb transported to the environment can be transferred back to people and animals korzeniewska and harnisz 2019 the bla shv gene was not detected in any of the tested samples table 3 according to korzeniewska and harnisz 2013 this gene rarely occurs in the natural environment 3 2 prevalence of tetracyclines resistance genes interestingly the tet e gene was detected in all water samples collected in april sp table 3 fig 2b but according to harnisz et al 2015 tet a is the most prevalent determinant of tetracycline resistance in the aquatic environment in the present study the tet a gene was identified sporadically in samples collected in february wi and april sp tet b and tet c were also detected sporadically whereas tet d was not observed in any of the tested samples it should be noted that tet b is relatively ubiquitous in the environment according to harnisz et al 2015 it is prevalence in river water is strongly correlated with the presence of other tetracycline resistance genes dissolved oxygen concentration temperature and antibiotic levels in water the sporadic presence of tet b and tet c genes and the absence of tet d observed in our study confirm that ar patterns can be specific to local environmental conditions su et al 2012 variations in the prevalence of tet genes were not observed with an increase in distance from the river source 3 3 prevalence of other antibiotics resistance determinants the ermf gene encoding resistance to mls antibiotics was noted in the samples collected in przedbórz r1 and sulejów r2 in february wi and april sp table 3 fig 2c this gene was also detected in the samples collected from the remaining sites in july su the presence of the ermf gene in february samples could be attributed to higher antibiotic consumption and higher excretion of antibiotics to municipal wastewater in winter awad et al 2014 treated effluents containing residual antibiotics are evacuated to the river where they increase arb and args loads in spring and summer animal grazing in pastures surrounding the river is responsible for higher levels of fecal contamination fecal contaminants of animal origin reach the river with surface runoffs chen and zhang 2013 detected args including ermf in environmental dna isolated from livestock feces and biofilters in wwtps which indicates that animal feces and wastewater significantly contribute to the spread of args in the aquatic environment the results of our previous study related to wwtps effluents discharged to pilica river confirm this statement czatzkowska et al 2019 the prevalence of intl1 and sul1 genes was similar in the tested samples table 3 these genes can be closely related due to the presence of gene cassettes that transfer resistance genes between microorganisms antunes et al 2005 the sul1 gene encodes dihydropteroate synthase which confers resistance to sulfonamides and is usually present in class 1 integrons that also contain other args mohapatra et al 2008 the prevalence of sul1 and intl1in the pilica river could be associated with the presence of pastures fields and pens with animals and therefore sources of antibiotics fecal bacteria arb and args that reach river water with surface runoffs the sul1 gene encoding resistance to sulfonamides is abundant in the aquatic environment and it is transferred horizontally within and between bacterial species in both sewage mukherjee and chakraborty 2006 and river water khan et al 2013 the highest levels of args including sul1 are also directly associated with high concentrations of sulfonamides in the environment khan et al 2013 khan et al 2013 reported high antibiotic concentrations and the

urban area was related with fecal contamination korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 observed the highest counts of sul1 copies in samples of wwtps effluents among all args analyzed srinivasan et al 2005 detected sul1 in bacterial isolates from fecal suspensions collected in dairy farms they suggested that livestock feces are a source of arb and args which are easily transferred from closed farms to pastures in the current study the lina gene was observed mainly in samples of river water collected in april sp fig 2c at five sites sulejów r2 smardzewice r3 spała r4 nowe miasto r5 and białobrzegi r6 table 3 the lina gene was also detected once in the samples collected in february wi in nowe miasto r5 and in july sp in przedbórz r1 the gene encoding resistance to mls antibiotics was observed on a seasonal basis which could be directly linked with a higher number of infections in the corresponding period in particular infections caused by anaerobic bacteria eitel et al 2013 the prevalence of lina in bacteroides strains was determined at 21 7 by eitel et al 2013 niestępski et al 2019 were observed lina gene in 11 of 61 18 03 resistant strains from bacteroides fragilis group our findings
