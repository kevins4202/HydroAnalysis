570,existing studies on flow through vegetation have focused mainly on understanding the turbulent structure in vegetated channels of single plant type however in natural riverine environments vegetation also occurs as patches with heterogeneous plant forms the present paper investigates the flow and turbulent characteristics in heterogeneous vegetation patches at a laboratory scale experiments were conducted using different forms grass leafy and cylindrical of natural vegetation planted alternatively and also as a mixed variety of patches in a staggered pattern the results show that the presence of other vegetation forms in mixed heterogeneous patch increases the velocity reduction up to 10 compared to flexible grass moreover additional drag due to mixed vegetation reduces shear generated turbulence at the canopy top and shifts its peak above the canopy in the case of heterogeneous patches spatial heterogeneity in velocity fields and varying zones of increased and diminished turbulence were observed specifically patch form and its alignment significantly control the velocity reduction and momentum transfer between the canopy and overflow regions these findings and furthermore studies on heterogeneous patches may be helpful for riparian management practices in creating ecological and sediment deposition zones graphical abstract image graphical abstract

reported existing research has provided good process based understanding of flow plant interactions in terms of turbulent structure associated with canopies however these studies are limited to particular vegetation type and the influence of plant morphology heterogeneity in their behavior has not been widely discussed which is the prime focus in this paper in natural river environments vegetation can be observed as patches of reeds grasses and heterogeneous plant forms fig 1 also refer to nepf and ghisalberti 2008 considering the importance of vegetation for planform stability and ecological aspects gurnell 2014 the present study attempts to understand the flow behavior in flexible grasses and patches of heterogeneous plant forms which are less focused the objectives of this paper are therefore a to investigate the effect of heterogeneity in plant forms and alignment on the flow and turbulent structure along the vegetated patch and b how their behavior is different from existing studies of single plant type for this objective laboratory experiments were conducted over different vegetation layouts and detailed flow measurements such as velocity and turbulence parameters were carried to describe the flow response to heterogeneous characteristics all the experiments were conducted under submerged conditions where flow depth is greater than vegetation height 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup all experiments were conducted at the water resources engineering laboratory civil engineering department iit guwahati in a 20 m long 1 m wide and 0 72 m deep glass walled flume filled with 0 2 m layer of river sand fig 2 three 10 hp pumps were used to drive and recirculate the flow between overhead tank channel and the underground sump a collecting chamber of 2 8 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m depth with wooden baffles and other roughness elements was placed at the upstream to diminish the turbulence and to straighten the incoming flow to the channel slope of the flume was fixed to 0 0015 throughout the experiments the median sand diameter was d50 0 5 mm and the density was 2650 kg m3 the discharge was measured using a rectangular notch located at the tail end of the flume and the digital point gage was used to measure the flow depth instantaneous velocity measurements were obtained with three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 4 probes 10 mhz vectrino adv manufactured by nortek at a sampling frequency of 200 hz yagci et al 2010 devi 2016 with data collection up to 5 min duration at each point accelerating threshold method was used to post process the time series velocity data for removing the spikes goring and nikora 2002 dey et al 2012 devi 2016 to carry out the experiments test section of 5 m length was chosen at the middle of the flume to minimize the effects of upstream entry and downstream exit the test section starts at a distance of 60 times the flow depth from the flume entry where the flow is in fully developed condition sharma and kumar 2019 natural plants were planted in different configurations along the test section in the staggered pattern and experiments were performed to analyze the turbulent characteristics 2 2 vegetation types and arrangement three different forms of natural vegetation viz bladed leafy and cylindrical vegetation were used to bring out the heterogeneous characteristics in experiments oryza sativa young rice plants for bladed type sprigs of duranta erecta for leafy type and the stems without leaves of sphagneticola trilobata to represent rigid cylinders were used these plants morphologically characterize the real species like flexible grasses leafy bushes and reedy vegetation along the riparian zones of the brahmaputra river fig 1 selected plants represent heterogeneity in terms of their form swaying motion and the drag effect bladed form was flexible to sway leafy vegetation was semi flexible with the stem being rigid and leaves flexible and the cylindrical was rigid in nature additionally the canopy porosity and projected area occupied by these plants also vary differently table 1 shows the physical characteristics of the plant forms used in the study to carry out the experiments four different vegetation layouts fig 3 were framed based on field observations fig 1 along the riparian zones of the brahmaputra river india all the plants were placed in a staggered pattern along the test section with a density of 440 plants m2 2 3 flow conditions and measurement locations experiments were conducted in submerged flow conditions in which flow depth is greater than the vegetation height in the present work considering the bed under no transport condition the main channel depths were maintained lesser than the incipient motion depths devi et al 2016 at incipient motion condition the shields parameter and grain reynolds number were observed to be 0 028 and 7 41 for no vegetation scenario with d50 0 5 mm the corresponding flow depth h and discharge q were 14 2 cm and 0 0389 m3 s table 2 shows the hydraulic conditions maintained in the channel for different vegetation layouts flow measurements were carried at different locations along the channel to study the effect of heterogeneous characteristics of vegetation on flow and turbulent behavior for experiments 1 and 2 measurement locations were positioned at upstream p1 center p3 and downstream p5 of the vegetation patch and in experiments 3 and 4 additional locations p2 and p4 at the transition between the vegetation patches were also considered fig 3 shows the measurement locations numbered p1 to p5 located inside and outside of the vegetation zone along the channel at each position in the vegetation zone three to four plants were removed to provide a clear space for data collection instantaneous velocity components were measured with adv along the flow depth at increments of 0 25 0 3 cm from the near bed thus more than 20 measurement points at each vertical profile were obtained the uncertainty in adv data was also tested by collecting 15 pulses of 30 000 samples each within the test section of mixed heterogeneous vegetation layout deshpande and kumar 2016 table 3 shows uncertainty in time averaged velocity components u v w and root mean square of fluctuating components u v w of sampled data 2 4 flow resistance the type flexible or rigid form plant morphology and the layout of vegetation influences the manning s n due to the difference in flow velocity and energy dissipation in order to understand the heterogeneous effect on flow resistance manning s roughness coefficient was computed noarayanan et al 2012 modified the general manning s equation by writing the same equation for a vegetated and non vegetated channel individually and subtracted the later from former thus the modified equation gives the resistance only due to the vegetation effect the present work utilizes the manning s equation given by

discussion 3 1 homogeneous flexible grass vs mixed heterogeneous vegetation fig 4 a shows vertical distribution of velocity measured inside p3 and outside p1 and p5 of vegetation zone in a flexible grass and mixed heterogeneous vegetated layout at p1 i e upstream of the vegetation zone the flow was fully developed and followed a logarithmic law in the vegetated zone flexible grass or mixed heterogeneous layout i e at p3 a clear distinction in shape of the velocity profile was observed at this location the velocity was highly reduced and the profile no longer followed a logarithmic law in flexible grass layout velocity varied between 0 10 to 0 25 m s in the canopy region and 0 25 to 0 32 m s above the canopy and in mixed heterogeneous layout the same varied between 0 08 to 0 21 m s in canopy region and 0 21 to 0 31 m s above the canopy the additional mean velocity reduction of 10 was observed in mixed heterogeneous vegetation layout the presence of other vegetation forms such as leafy and rigid cylindrical stems relatively offered more resistance to the flow than flexible grass vegetation alone a similar type of velocity profiles was observed by wilson et al 2003 in flexible stipes with and without foliage more characteristics of the plant form response to flow behavior is discussed in later sections the effect of vegetation was observed at non vegetated section p5 where velocity profile is still reduced profiles of the vertical reynold stress u w and streamwise turbulence u rms at p3 clearly differed for both the flexible grass and mixed heterogeneous vegetation layout within the lower canopy region z h 0 0 25 the magnitude of rs u w was relatively greater for mixed heterogeneous in the upper canopy region z h 0 25 0 5 and above the canopy z h 0 5 vertical momentum exchange is higher for flexible grass than observed for mixed heterogeneous vegetation this shows that the presence of uneven canopy porosity and swaying motion of leafy forms can be the reason for higher turbulent stress in lower canopy region of mixed heterogeneous layout whereas in upper canopy region highly flexible nature of grass forms increased the mixing activity between the vegetation and overflow region resulting in higher values of reynolds stress wilson et al 2003 the position of peak rs u w for flexible grass is at z h 0 45 and mixed heterogeneous is at z h 0 54 against the canopy top of z h 0 5 the local depression see fig 4b in peak rs u w of the flexible grass was noticed however this effect was not observed in mixed heterogeneous vegetation where the presence of additional drag at canopy top due to other vegetation forms is more dominating in addition the peak rs u w value was pushed a little above the canopy top fig 4c shows the variability in streamwise turbulence along the patch a relatively higher value of streamwise turbulence at p3 is observed in flexible grass than mixed heterogeneous vegetation layout the analysis of the results suggests that the presence of different vegetation forms as in mixed heterogeneous layout can be helpful for more reduction of flow velocity and vertical momentum exchange than flexible grass of same vegetation density and flow conditions 3 2 flow characteristics in heterogeneous patch 1 3 2 1 velocity profiles in heterogeneous patch 1 patch type varies in longitudinal direction fig 3c fig 5 b shows flow velocity profiles measured along the heterogeneous patch 1 where greater deviation between the individual profiles was noticed with the passage of flow through leafy dynamic bladed flexible grass and cylindrical stem rigid patches the velocity magnitude at different positions varied as p2 p4 p3 p5 p1 at p2 the flow velocity was greatly reduced and mostly uniform in lower canopy region due to higher resistance offered by the leafy patch the average velocity was reduced by 55 at p2 and in lower canopy region significant velocity reduction of 80 was observed this reduction results from complex and congested flow paths due to low flow permeability inside the staggered leafy patch as the flow leaves highly resistant leafy patch zone 1 and reaches p3 of flexible grass patch zone 2 the increase in velocities was noticed in the lower canopy region the velocity profile was showing accelerating trend ranging between 6 15 cm s this high difference in velocity variation may be attributed from flexibility of bladed forms overall the depth averaged velocity reduction of 25 and 50 in the lower canopy region was observed at p3 as flow fully traverses zone 2 and reaches p4 it suddenly encounters rigid cylindrical stems the presence of rigid cylindrical stems at this interface p4 reduced the flow velocity again and made velocity profile approximately constant in lower canopy region the average velocity reduction of 38 over whole region and 60 in the lower canopy region was observed at p4 in the upper canopy region and above the canopy top though the velocity profiles at p2 p3 and p4 were showing accelerating trend there was a noticeable difference in their magnitude the values followed similar order p2 p4 p3 as reported for lower canopy region above the canopy velocities in the vegetated zones were higher than the non vegetated ones this is because of flow obstruction inside the vegetation forms forcing the flow upward and increasing the velocities above the canopy chen et al 2011 at p5 the velocity profile and its magnitude were gradually retaining logarithmic nature as the flow leaves the vegetation patch a fully developed zone would be returned at further downstream of this location 3 2 2 reynold stresses the effect of heterogeneous patch 1 layout on reynold stress variability in vertical rs u w lateral rs u v and stream wise rs v w directions is shown in fig 5c e in this section firstly vertical direction of reynold stress rs u w is discussed followed by other components the shape of rs u w profiles exhibited a strong mixing activity peak value at and slightly above the canopy top z h 0 4 as reported by the other works wilson et al 2003 devi 2016 however the intensity of the peak value differed significantly as the flow traverses through leafy grass and cylindrical patches the magnitude of peak rs u w values at p2 p3 and p4 varied as 14 16 and 24 cm2 s2 in the lower canopy region z h 0 0 2 the profiles were approximately uniform with values ranging between 0 5 1 8 0 2 3 2 and 0 37 0 39 at p2 p3 and p4 respectively these values were significantly lesser than the near bed values of non vegetated positions p1 and p5 to better explain this variability it is necessary to understand the influence of vegetation form on flow structure at p2 significant reduction of reynold stress in all regions was observed with almost negligible values in lower canopy region the shift in peak value to slightly above the canopy top was also noticed this is because the larger drag due to the presence of leaves additional surface area in zone 1 refer to fig 5a alters the momentum transfer by inhibiting the vertical momentum exchange between the vegetated and the over flow region also negative rs u w at near bed is due to negative velocity gradient u z 0 indicating upward momentum transfer siniscalchi et al 2012 the flow field in zone 2 is now through flexible grass patch at p3 the values of rs u w were increased relative to p2 the grass vegetation is such that the plant form is relatively stiff at bottom part as blades are closely spaced than upper part blades are spread this feature is clearly depicted in reynold stress profile as uniform rs u w in the bottom part and accelerating rs u w in the upper part unlike in homogeneous flexible grass layout section 3 1 local depression in peak rs u w into canopy was not observed at p3 this may be explained by the presence of highly resistant leafy patch at the beginning absorbed the flow momentum and thereby reducing the translational speed or weaker enough of kh vortices to deflect the canopy although higher momentum exchange relative to p2 is noticed moreover the availability of sufficient length required for downstream progression of vortices is restricted in this zone ghisalberti and nepf 2002 due to confinement of grass patch between leafy and cylindrical patches at p4 i e the interface between flexible bladed and rigid cylindrical patch a relatively distinct rs u w profile with greater shear interaction at the canopy top and lesser momentum exchange region into the canopy is observed this may be mainly due to two reasons one is unlike leafy and bladed forms rods have no additional surface area like leaves or blades to absorb the shear generated turbulence and second is due to the rigidity of stems the rigidity of the stems made rs u w profile uniform throughout the canopy zone the thickness of active momentum exchange ht is defined as the distance from the canopy top to 10 decay of maximum reynold stress into the canopy nepf and vivoni 2000 in this layout ht clearly showed response to vegetation forms the penetration ratio ht normalized by plant height was higher for bladed form 0 65 at p3 followed by leafy 0 50 at p2 and rigid cylindrical stems 0 45 at p4 a simple conceptual sketch showing the mixing activity and penetration ratio at the canopy top is shown in fig 5a the other components of reynold stress rs u v and rs v w have not shown significant variation over the depth expect for rs u v at p2 and p3 unlike rs u v values at p2 and p3 the uniform velocity distribution or least difference in velocities between the layers of canopy region at p4 may be the reason for lower or unvarying values of lateral reynold stress rs u v this shows vegetation form and its swaying motion is controlling the non homogeneous nature in rs profiles 3 3 flow characteristics in heterogeneous patch 2 in heterogeneous patch 2 layout the vegetation patches are varied in both longitudinal and transverse direction see fig 3d or 6 a there is a patch geometric dissimilarity on either side of the flume center line and at junctions p2 p3 p4 on all sides therefore in this layout the flow and turbulent structure are expected to be different from heterogeneous patch 1 3 3 1 velocity profiles fig 6b shows flow velocity measured inside p2 p3 p4 and outside p1 p5 of heterogeneous patch 2 vegetated zone in this layout the mean velocity along the channel varied as velocity at p1 p5 p2 p4 p3 at p1 the velocity profile strictly followed the logarithmic law and at other positions the flow through different alternative forms of vegetation patches significantly altered the profile characteristics also the varying flow obstruction due to bladed leafy and cylindrical forms along the vegetated zone affected the percentage of velocity reduction to understand the flow behavior depth wise velocity profiles were segregated into three regions viz lower canopy z h 0 0 2 upper canopy region z h 0 2 0 4 and above the canopy top z h 0 4 the depth averaged velocity reduction of 12 at p2 25 at p3 and 17 at p4 was noticed within the lower canopy region more velocity reduction was observed at p3 48 followed by p4 40 and p2 24 this variability could be better explained as follows in the beginning the incoming flow enters through flexible grass and largely porous cylindrical patch see zone 1 in 6a where the flow obstruction is sparse and velocity was less reduced compared to the next zone covered with leafy bladed patch zone 2 and the presence of highly resistant leafy forms and complex flow path due to the reversal of resistance at p3 i e from zone 2 to zone 3 where leafy bladed shifts to bladed leafy resulted in significant velocity reduction than observed at p2 and p4 at p4 two distinct characteristics in the velocity profile were noticed one is the lower canopy region experiences increase in velocity relative to p3 and second is greater velocities above the canopy top the first is maybe due to enhanced flow speed generated due to the sudden shift in canopy porosity from low zone 3 bladed leafy to high zone 4 cylindrical bladed and also variability in flow resistance the latter is possible due to rigid cylindrical stems at p4 interface pushing the flow above the canopy the presence of rigid cylindrical forms at p4 also caused uniform vertical velocity profile in the lower canopy region in upper canopy region and above the canopy velocity profiles were found to be accelerating and mostly similar at p2 p3 and p4 the effect of vegetation starts to disappear gradually as the flow leaving the patch showed a tendency to follow the logarithmic profile at p5 3 3 2 reynold stresses fig 6c e shows the reynold stress profiles in vertical rs u w lateral rs u v and stream wise rs v w directions measured along the heterogeneous patch 2 layout it can be observed that as the flow traverses through the patch heterogeneous characteristics in vegetation significantly altered the shape of reynold stress profiles at various locations generally vegetation reduces the near bed turbulence and shifts the position of the maximum reynolds stress away from the bed and thereby the bed is protected in this layout there was a noticeable difference in depth wise variability of rs u w in vegetated and non vegetated sections and the effect of patch alignment is clearly observed the shape of the rs profiles was distorted at z h 0 to 0 2 the absolute rs u w values ranged from 0 80 1 32 1 20 7 60 0 73 3 62 cm2 s2 at p2 p3 and p4 and 1 02 1 2 2 2 5 1 cm2 s2 at p1 and p5 in lower canopy region vegetation has shown a significant effect on rs u w by reducing its near bed value and showing nearly uniform profiles p2 and p4 this effect is in turn different at p3 where negative near bed rs u w was observed and then showing a rising trend in its profile in the upper canopy region all the rs u w profiles in the vegetated section were on a rising trend with increasing order of variability as p2 p3 and p4 these profile shapes can show a clear variability in vertical momentum exchange activity at p2 though the rs u w profile followed a general trend the amount of mixing activity occurred at canopy top or in upper canopy region was comparatively less than p3 and p4 also above the canopy top z h 0 4 the rs u w profile was fairly uniform this is probably due to diminished turbulence at section a a see fig 6a where the flow through bladed vegetation suddenly encounters highly resistant leafy patch very low canopy porosity but this observation must be further investigated with detailed lateral measurements at the canopy top the discontinuity in vegetation elements induces large scale vertical mixing and generally results in maximum values of rs u w in heterogeneous patch 2 the peak rs u w values were not located as expected which is explained as follows at positions p3 and p4 though the rs u w profiles were similar to other reported works the location of the peak value differed at p3 the peak was nearly at canopy top and in p4 there was a shift in peak value to over canopy region the inhibition of vertical momentum exchange at canopy top of p4 is may be due to one drag discontinuity at the interface two the sudden encounter of flow with rigid cylindrical stems and three resistance variability the velocity profiles at p4 also showed forcible pushing of the flow to over canopy region local regions of negative rs u w was also noticed in lower canopy region of p4 though u z 0 indicating the transfer of turbulent energy to mean flow in over canopy zone the values of the rs u w were found to decreasing with increment in flow depth in this layout the higher thickness of active momentum exchange 40 higher than heterogeneous patch 1 was observed at all locations a simple conceptual sketch showing the mixing activity and penetration ratio at the canopy top is shown in fig 6a fig 6d and e show the variability of reynold stress in lateral rs u v and stream wise rs v w directions it can be seen that absolute values of rs u v in lower canopy region were equally varied as rs u w and especially at p2 the magnitude is relatively higher moreover the shape of rs u v profiles in upper and above the canopy regions showed similar variation as rs u w with opposite sign and lesser magnitude the increase in rs u v value indicates an increase in lateral momentum exchange which is higher at p3 followed by p4 the position of peak rs u v and rising nature of profiles in the upper canopy zone is mostly similar to rs u w at p3 and p4 the plan view at section p3 shows the reversal of patch forms resistance allowing changes in flow pattern and interaction behavior velasco et al 2003 highlight the development of pressure gradients in the form of turbulent wakes generating lateral diffusion of momentum this anisotropic behavior in flow structure clearly shows stream wise and cross stream geometric dissimilarity in vegetation patch forms and their alignment has considerable influence on turbulence measurements also it may be expected that at measurement locations interaction among flow structure due to multiple vegetation patches creates a zone of influence within this zone the turbulent structure can be of varying intensity and depends on vegetation type and alignment hence the turbulent flow structure may be heterogeneous throughout the patch and could be investigated further with more detailed lateral measurements 3 4 variability in roughness coefficient in our experiments though the vegetation density no of plants per m2 remained same plant form canopy porosity and patch alignment has shown a significant effect on flow structure the response of the flow to varying vegetation and its characteristics certainly influences the flow resistance which is computed here in terms of manning s roughness coefficient fig 7 shows the manning s n variability computed by using eqs 1 to 3 of section 2 4 li et al 2014 also refer to errico et al 2018 for different degree of submergence it is observed that manning s n tends to follow similar trend for all the vegetation layouts in the case of heterogeneous layouts manning s n is considerably higher and varied with vegetation patch alignment with an increase in plant deflected height the similar flow conditions in homogeneous flexible grass resulted in lower roughness value due to higher submergence depth while comparing homogeneous flexible grass and mixed heterogeneous layouts an increase in average resistance of 9 is noticed due to the addition of leafy and rigid cylindrical forms to only flexible forms for heterogeneous patch layouts patch 1 offered 25 higher average resistance than patch 2 the presence of highly resistant leafy and rigid stem patches at the beginning and end increased the velocity reduction significantly although manning s n is higher for lower discharges it can be observed that the alignment of vegetation patches significantly increases the flow resistance 4 discussion this section discusses changes in flow structure due to heterogeneity in plant forms and their alignment the depth wise velocity profile in the vegetated channels can be roughly divided into flow through the canopy zone and the over canopy zone klopstra et al 1997 previous studies further divided the canopy zone into lower and upper canopy zones depending on the nature of the velocity profiles huai et al 2009a chen et al 2011 in the present study the flow through different vegetation patches altered the division of velocity profiles due to physical characteristics of the plant form for example the velocity profiles in leafy and rigid cylindrical vegetation can be clearly divided based on its shape in the lower canopy zone velocity is constant and upper canopy zone velocity profile shows accelerating trend due to shear layer interaction while the bladed form has no such distinction due to flexibility of the vegetation causing velocity profile accelerating throughout the canopy zone a similar phenomenon was reported by wilson et al 2003 earlier works have reported that the velocity profile over the canopy zone follows the logarithmic law jarvela 2005 chen et al 2011 li et al 2014 this observation could not be seen in the present study as the experiments were conducted in shallow submerged flow condition flow depth plant height 5 refer to nepf 2012 the results showed that the effect of plant form and alignment of the plant patch is significant in controlling the velocity reduction the presence of mixed vegetation forms fig 3b vs fig 3a and or highly resistant leafy patch at the beginning fig 3c vs fig 3d is favoring for increased velocity reduction when the patch type varies in both the directions fig 3d the difference between the velocities along the patch in upper and over canopy zones is insignificant in flexible submerged canopies under few conditions there is a possibility for the canopy scale or k h vortices to overcome the plant rigidity causing monami effect ghisalberti and nepf 2002 the intensity of the progressive waving and local depression in the canopy increases the turbulent exchange or flux towards the bed causing bed erosion in our study unlike in flexible grass vegetation fig 3a there is no local depression of turbulence flux in mixed heterogeneous layout fig 3b in addition the peak turbulent flux shifted to higher value and more velocity reduction is also noticed a common observation to the previous studies was that inclusion of high resistant vegetation forms like leafy rigid cylindrical stems could help in restricting or prevention of turbulent flux penetration towards the bed next the alignment of vegetation as patches varying its form in longitudinal fig 3c or in both directions fig 3d has also shown interesting flow behavior these observations mostly differed with existing studies which focused on working with single vegetation type like cylindrical form or strips tempest et al 2015 in heterogeneous patch 1 fig 3c the highly flexible bladed patch is confined between highly resistant leafy and rigid cylindrical patches leafy and cylindrical patches favored zones of lower velocities and turbulent stresses which favor bed protection or sediment depositions whereas inside the flexible bladed patch relatively higher mixing activity is observed favoring zones of increased turbulence levels in heterogeneous patch 2 when patch alignment is varied in both directions the cross stream patch dissimilarity induced additional changes to turbulence and significantly changed the flow structure moreover the shape of flow profiles for example reynold stress is distorted in nature to better explain this difference fig 8 is plotted showing comparative analysis between heterogeneous patch 1 and patch 2 table 4 shows the percentage increase in turbulence structure of other locations in patch 1 and 2 with respect to section p2 in patch 1 a high degree of momentum exchange activity rs u w and rs u v and turbulence urms wrms tke is observed in heterogeneous patch 2 this is further supplemented with a higher increase in vertical turbulence intensity levels w rms which is a measure of vortex rotation the overall layouts provide spatial heterogeneity in flow velocity and turbulence field which is important for creating ecological habitat for example guppies poecilia reticulata have shown to prefer staying in varying levels of velocity and turbulence zone for maintaining their life cycle and health trinci et al 2017 other studies have reported that few aquatic species favor zones of high turbulence intensity trinci et al 2017 moderate velocities and low tke hockley et al 2014 showing the importance of heterogeneous flow conditions in rivers the plant swaying motion and k h vortices due to flow instability at the canopy top interacts and transfer the momentum flux by forming an active momentum exchange region ht along the vegetated channel ghisalberti and nepf 2005 wang et al 2009 in the presence of single vegetation type this thickness ht is observed to be gradually increasing for flexible grass chen et al 2011 or uniform for flexible leafy vegetation li et al 2014 along the channel the present work observes non uniform variability in thickness ht depending on the plant forms and patch alignment with patch type varying in both the direction fig 3d a further increase in thickness ht is noticed these observations are conceptually represented in fig 9 manning s roughness coefficient computed for different flow conditions and patch alignment describes the patch type variability effect in changing the flow resistance this information can be helpful in incorporating appropriate manning s value in the river and ecological modeling wu et al 1999 li et al 2014 the study also reveals that horizontal and vertical distributions of plant form patch alignment have a significant effect in controlling flow and turbulent structure and roughness induced to the flow finally it can be said that spatial heterogeneity in flow structure due to heterogeneous vegetation layouts can be helpful for habitat life biodiversity and also promote sedimentation zones unlike flexible grass vegetation heterogeneous vegetation patches can be capable of providing both sedimentation zones and high mixing activity zones in one vegetated bed this observation can be further strengthened with more experiments considering a different combination of heterogeneous patch layouts and eventually helpful for implementing in river restoration schemes 5 conclusions in the present paper an analysis of laboratory experiments conducted to investigate the effect of submerged heterogeneous vegetation patches on flow structure is discussed for this purpose three natural plant forms grass leafy and cylindrical arranged in four different layouts fig 3 namely homogeneous flexible grass mixed heterogeneous patch heterogeneous patch 1 and patch 2 were studied the results of the study provided insights in understanding the effect of heterogeneous characteristics such as plant morphology canopy porosity and patch alignment on flow behavior the major observations in the study lead to the following conclusions first in a mixed heterogeneous patch the additional drag due to the presence of other vegetation forms like leafy and cylindrical stems results in 10 increased velocity reduction than homogeneous flexible grass alone in addition there was no local depression in peak reynold stress at z h 0 54 into the canopy as observed for flexible grass vegetation at z h 0 45 second in heterogeneous patch 1 and patch 2 different zones of increased and diminished turbulence levels varying velocities were observed along the vegetated section plant form and the canopy porosity has significant control on altering the position and intensity of the vertical momentum exchange at the canopy top and also thickness of the active momentum exchange for example in the leafy patch of heterogeneous patch 1 the amount of mixing activity was 50 lesser than other vegetation forms third other than plant form and canopy porosity patch alignment has also controlled the flow structure by inducing additional turbulence to the flow in heterogeneous patch 2 the flow instability aroused due to both longitudinal and cross stream variability of patch forms resulted in increase in turbulence parameters to more than 100 than heterogeneous patch 1 the response of manning s n was highly affected by plant form and patch alignment for different flow conditions this work can be further extended to study with different layouts of heterogeneous patches under varying flow conditions to investigate further detailed measurements in longitudinal and traverse directions will however be helpful for better understanding and justifying the processes in the flow field with further improvement in knowledge heterogeneous vegetation patches can be designed for riparian management practices in improving the ecological behavior and sediment deposition zones acknowledgments the

570,existing studies on flow through vegetation have focused mainly on understanding the turbulent structure in vegetated channels of single plant type however in natural riverine environments vegetation also occurs as patches with heterogeneous plant forms the present paper investigates the flow and turbulent characteristics in heterogeneous vegetation patches at a laboratory scale experiments were conducted using different forms grass leafy and cylindrical of natural vegetation planted alternatively and also as a mixed variety of patches in a staggered pattern the results show that the presence of other vegetation forms in mixed heterogeneous patch increases the velocity reduction up to 10 compared to flexible grass moreover additional drag due to mixed vegetation reduces shear generated turbulence at the canopy top and shifts its peak above the canopy in the case of heterogeneous patches spatial heterogeneity in velocity fields and varying zones of increased and diminished turbulence were observed specifically patch form and its alignment significantly control the velocity reduction and momentum transfer between the canopy and overflow regions these findings and furthermore studies on heterogeneous patches may be helpful for riparian management practices in creating ecological and sediment deposition zones graphical abstract image graphical abstract

reported existing research has provided good process based understanding of flow plant interactions in terms of turbulent structure associated with canopies however these studies are limited to particular vegetation type and the influence of plant morphology heterogeneity in their behavior has not been widely discussed which is the prime focus in this paper in natural river environments vegetation can be observed as patches of reeds grasses and heterogeneous plant forms fig 1 also refer to nepf and ghisalberti 2008 considering the importance of vegetation for planform stability and ecological aspects gurnell 2014 the present study attempts to understand the flow behavior in flexible grasses and patches of heterogeneous plant forms which are less focused the objectives of this paper are therefore a to investigate the effect of heterogeneity in plant forms and alignment on the flow and turbulent structure along the vegetated patch and b how their behavior is different from existing studies of single plant type for this objective laboratory experiments were conducted over different vegetation layouts and detailed flow measurements such as velocity and turbulence parameters were carried to describe the flow response to heterogeneous characteristics all the experiments were conducted under submerged conditions where flow depth is greater than vegetation height 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup all experiments were conducted at the water resources engineering laboratory civil engineering department iit guwahati in a 20 m long 1 m wide and 0 72 m deep glass walled flume filled with 0 2 m layer of river sand fig 2 three 10 hp pumps were used to drive and recirculate the flow between overhead tank channel and the underground sump a collecting chamber of 2 8 m long 1 5 m wide and 1 5 m depth with wooden baffles and other roughness elements was placed at the upstream to diminish the turbulence and to straighten the incoming flow to the channel slope of the flume was fixed to 0 0015 throughout the experiments the median sand diameter was d50 0 5 mm and the density was 2650 kg m3 the discharge was measured using a rectangular notch located at the tail end of the flume and the digital point gage was used to measure the flow depth instantaneous velocity measurements were obtained with three dimensional acoustic doppler velocimeter adv 4 probes 10 mhz vectrino adv manufactured by nortek at a sampling frequency of 200 hz yagci et al 2010 devi 2016 with data collection up to 5 min duration at each point accelerating threshold method was used to post process the time series velocity data for removing the spikes goring and nikora 2002 dey et al 2012 devi 2016 to carry out the experiments test section of 5 m length was chosen at the middle of the flume to minimize the effects of upstream entry and downstream exit the test section starts at a distance of 60 times the flow depth from the flume entry where the flow is in fully developed condition sharma and kumar 2019 natural plants were planted in different configurations along the test section in the staggered pattern and experiments were performed to analyze the turbulent characteristics 2 2 vegetation types and arrangement three different forms of natural vegetation viz bladed leafy and cylindrical vegetation were used to bring out the heterogeneous characteristics in experiments oryza sativa young rice plants for bladed type sprigs of duranta erecta for leafy type and the stems without leaves of sphagneticola trilobata to represent rigid cylinders were used these plants morphologically characterize the real species like flexible grasses leafy bushes and reedy vegetation along the riparian zones of the brahmaputra river fig 1 selected plants represent heterogeneity in terms of their form swaying motion and the drag effect bladed form was flexible to sway leafy vegetation was semi flexible with the stem being rigid and leaves flexible and the cylindrical was rigid in nature additionally the canopy porosity and projected area occupied by these plants also vary differently table 1 shows the physical characteristics of the plant forms used in the study to carry out the experiments four different vegetation layouts fig 3 were framed based on field observations fig 1 along the riparian zones of the brahmaputra river india all the plants were placed in a staggered pattern along the test section with a density of 440 plants m2 2 3 flow conditions and measurement locations experiments were conducted in submerged flow conditions in which flow depth is greater than the vegetation height in the present work considering the bed under no transport condition the main channel depths were maintained lesser than the incipient motion depths devi et al 2016 at incipient motion condition the shields parameter and grain reynolds number were observed to be 0 028 and 7 41 for no vegetation scenario with d50 0 5 mm the corresponding flow depth h and discharge q were 14 2 cm and 0 0389 m3 s table 2 shows the hydraulic conditions maintained in the channel for different vegetation layouts flow measurements were carried at different locations along the channel to study the effect of heterogeneous characteristics of vegetation on flow and turbulent behavior for experiments 1 and 2 measurement locations were positioned at upstream p1 center p3 and downstream p5 of the vegetation patch and in experiments 3 and 4 additional locations p2 and p4 at the transition between the vegetation patches were also considered fig 3 shows the measurement locations numbered p1 to p5 located inside and outside of the vegetation zone along the channel at each position in the vegetation zone three to four plants were removed to provide a clear space for data collection instantaneous velocity components were measured with adv along the flow depth at increments of 0 25 0 3 cm from the near bed thus more than 20 measurement points at each vertical profile were obtained the uncertainty in adv data was also tested by collecting 15 pulses of 30 000 samples each within the test section of mixed heterogeneous vegetation layout deshpande and kumar 2016 table 3 shows uncertainty in time averaged velocity components u v w and root mean square of fluctuating components u v w of sampled data 2 4 flow resistance the type flexible or rigid form plant morphology and the layout of vegetation influences the manning s n due to the difference in flow velocity and energy dissipation in order to understand the heterogeneous effect on flow resistance manning s roughness coefficient was computed noarayanan et al 2012 modified the general manning s equation by writing the same equation for a vegetated and non vegetated channel individually and subtracted the later from former thus the modified equation gives the resistance only due to the vegetation effect the present work utilizes the manning s equation given by

discussion 3 1 homogeneous flexible grass vs mixed heterogeneous vegetation fig 4 a shows vertical distribution of velocity measured inside p3 and outside p1 and p5 of vegetation zone in a flexible grass and mixed heterogeneous vegetated layout at p1 i e upstream of the vegetation zone the flow was fully developed and followed a logarithmic law in the vegetated zone flexible grass or mixed heterogeneous layout i e at p3 a clear distinction in shape of the velocity profile was observed at this location the velocity was highly reduced and the profile no longer followed a logarithmic law in flexible grass layout velocity varied between 0 10 to 0 25 m s in the canopy region and 0 25 to 0 32 m s above the canopy and in mixed heterogeneous layout the same varied between 0 08 to 0 21 m s in canopy region and 0 21 to 0 31 m s above the canopy the additional mean velocity reduction of 10 was observed in mixed heterogeneous vegetation layout the presence of other vegetation forms such as leafy and rigid cylindrical stems relatively offered more resistance to the flow than flexible grass vegetation alone a similar type of velocity profiles was observed by wilson et al 2003 in flexible stipes with and without foliage more characteristics of the plant form response to flow behavior is discussed in later sections the effect of vegetation was observed at non vegetated section p5 where velocity profile is still reduced profiles of the vertical reynold stress u w and streamwise turbulence u rms at p3 clearly differed for both the flexible grass and mixed heterogeneous vegetation layout within the lower canopy region z h 0 0 25 the magnitude of rs u w was relatively greater for mixed heterogeneous in the upper canopy region z h 0 25 0 5 and above the canopy z h 0 5 vertical momentum exchange is higher for flexible grass than observed for mixed heterogeneous vegetation this shows that the presence of uneven canopy porosity and swaying motion of leafy forms can be the reason for higher turbulent stress in lower canopy region of mixed heterogeneous layout whereas in upper canopy region highly flexible nature of grass forms increased the mixing activity between the vegetation and overflow region resulting in higher values of reynolds stress wilson et al 2003 the position of peak rs u w for flexible grass is at z h 0 45 and mixed heterogeneous is at z h 0 54 against the canopy top of z h 0 5 the local depression see fig 4b in peak rs u w of the flexible grass was noticed however this effect was not observed in mixed heterogeneous vegetation where the presence of additional drag at canopy top due to other vegetation forms is more dominating in addition the peak rs u w value was pushed a little above the canopy top fig 4c shows the variability in streamwise turbulence along the patch a relatively higher value of streamwise turbulence at p3 is observed in flexible grass than mixed heterogeneous vegetation layout the analysis of the results suggests that the presence of different vegetation forms as in mixed heterogeneous layout can be helpful for more reduction of flow velocity and vertical momentum exchange than flexible grass of same vegetation density and flow conditions 3 2 flow characteristics in heterogeneous patch 1 3 2 1 velocity profiles in heterogeneous patch 1 patch type varies in longitudinal direction fig 3c fig 5 b shows flow velocity profiles measured along the heterogeneous patch 1 where greater deviation between the individual profiles was noticed with the passage of flow through leafy dynamic bladed flexible grass and cylindrical stem rigid patches the velocity magnitude at different positions varied as p2 p4 p3 p5 p1 at p2 the flow velocity was greatly reduced and mostly uniform in lower canopy region due to higher resistance offered by the leafy patch the average velocity was reduced by 55 at p2 and in lower canopy region significant velocity reduction of 80 was observed this reduction results from complex and congested flow paths due to low flow permeability inside the staggered leafy patch as the flow leaves highly resistant leafy patch zone 1 and reaches p3 of flexible grass patch zone 2 the increase in velocities was noticed in the lower canopy region the velocity profile was showing accelerating trend ranging between 6 15 cm s this high difference in velocity variation may be attributed from flexibility of bladed forms overall the depth averaged velocity reduction of 25 and 50 in the lower canopy region was observed at p3 as flow fully traverses zone 2 and reaches p4 it suddenly encounters rigid cylindrical stems the presence of rigid cylindrical stems at this interface p4 reduced the flow velocity again and made velocity profile approximately constant in lower canopy region the average velocity reduction of 38 over whole region and 60 in the lower canopy region was observed at p4 in the upper canopy region and above the canopy top though the velocity profiles at p2 p3 and p4 were showing accelerating trend there was a noticeable difference in their magnitude the values followed similar order p2 p4 p3 as reported for lower canopy region above the canopy velocities in the vegetated zones were higher than the non vegetated ones this is because of flow obstruction inside the vegetation forms forcing the flow upward and increasing the velocities above the canopy chen et al 2011 at p5 the velocity profile and its magnitude were gradually retaining logarithmic nature as the flow leaves the vegetation patch a fully developed zone would be returned at further downstream of this location 3 2 2 reynold stresses the effect of heterogeneous patch 1 layout on reynold stress variability in vertical rs u w lateral rs u v and stream wise rs v w directions is shown in fig 5c e in this section firstly vertical direction of reynold stress rs u w is discussed followed by other components the shape of rs u w profiles exhibited a strong mixing activity peak value at and slightly above the canopy top z h 0 4 as reported by the other works wilson et al 2003 devi 2016 however the intensity of the peak value differed significantly as the flow traverses through leafy grass and cylindrical patches the magnitude of peak rs u w values at p2 p3 and p4 varied as 14 16 and 24 cm2 s2 in the lower canopy region z h 0 0 2 the profiles were approximately uniform with values ranging between 0 5 1 8 0 2 3 2 and 0 37 0 39 at p2 p3 and p4 respectively these values were significantly lesser than the near bed values of non vegetated positions p1 and p5 to better explain this variability it is necessary to understand the influence of vegetation form on flow structure at p2 significant reduction of reynold stress in all regions was observed with almost negligible values in lower canopy region the shift in peak value to slightly above the canopy top was also noticed this is because the larger drag due to the presence of leaves additional surface area in zone 1 refer to fig 5a alters the momentum transfer by inhibiting the vertical momentum exchange between the vegetated and the over flow region also negative rs u w at near bed is due to negative velocity gradient u z 0 indicating upward momentum transfer siniscalchi et al 2012 the flow field in zone 2 is now through flexible grass patch at p3 the values of rs u w were increased relative to p2 the grass vegetation is such that the plant form is relatively stiff at bottom part as blades are closely spaced than upper part blades are spread this feature is clearly depicted in reynold stress profile as uniform rs u w in the bottom part and accelerating rs u w in the upper part unlike in homogeneous flexible grass layout section 3 1 local depression in peak rs u w into canopy was not observed at p3 this may be explained by the presence of highly resistant leafy patch at the beginning absorbed the flow momentum and thereby reducing the translational speed or weaker enough of kh vortices to deflect the canopy although higher momentum exchange relative to p2 is noticed moreover the availability of sufficient length required for downstream progression of vortices is restricted in this zone ghisalberti and nepf 2002 due to confinement of grass patch between leafy and cylindrical patches at p4 i e the interface between flexible bladed and rigid cylindrical patch a relatively distinct rs u w profile with greater shear interaction at the canopy top and lesser momentum exchange region into the canopy is observed this may be mainly due to two reasons one is unlike leafy and bladed forms rods have no additional surface area like leaves or blades to absorb the shear generated turbulence and second is due to the rigidity of stems the rigidity of the stems made rs u w profile uniform throughout the canopy zone the thickness of active momentum exchange ht is defined as the distance from the canopy top to 10 decay of maximum reynold stress into the canopy nepf and vivoni 2000 in this layout ht clearly showed response to vegetation forms the penetration ratio ht normalized by plant height was higher for bladed form 0 65 at p3 followed by leafy 0 50 at p2 and rigid cylindrical stems 0 45 at p4 a simple conceptual sketch showing the mixing activity and penetration ratio at the canopy top is shown in fig 5a the other components of reynold stress rs u v and rs v w have not shown significant variation over the depth expect for rs u v at p2 and p3 unlike rs u v values at p2 and p3 the uniform velocity distribution or least difference in velocities between the layers of canopy region at p4 may be the reason for lower or unvarying values of lateral reynold stress rs u v this shows vegetation form and its swaying motion is controlling the non homogeneous nature in rs profiles 3 3 flow characteristics in heterogeneous patch 2 in heterogeneous patch 2 layout the vegetation patches are varied in both longitudinal and transverse direction see fig 3d or 6 a there is a patch geometric dissimilarity on either side of the flume center line and at junctions p2 p3 p4 on all sides therefore in this layout the flow and turbulent structure are expected to be different from heterogeneous patch 1 3 3 1 velocity profiles fig 6b shows flow velocity measured inside p2 p3 p4 and outside p1 p5 of heterogeneous patch 2 vegetated zone in this layout the mean velocity along the channel varied as velocity at p1 p5 p2 p4 p3 at p1 the velocity profile strictly followed the logarithmic law and at other positions the flow through different alternative forms of vegetation patches significantly altered the profile characteristics also the varying flow obstruction due to bladed leafy and cylindrical forms along the vegetated zone affected the percentage of velocity reduction to understand the flow behavior depth wise velocity profiles were segregated into three regions viz lower canopy z h 0 0 2 upper canopy region z h 0 2 0 4 and above the canopy top z h 0 4 the depth averaged velocity reduction of 12 at p2 25 at p3 and 17 at p4 was noticed within the lower canopy region more velocity reduction was observed at p3 48 followed by p4 40 and p2 24 this variability could be better explained as follows in the beginning the incoming flow enters through flexible grass and largely porous cylindrical patch see zone 1 in 6a where the flow obstruction is sparse and velocity was less reduced compared to the next zone covered with leafy bladed patch zone 2 and the presence of highly resistant leafy forms and complex flow path due to the reversal of resistance at p3 i e from zone 2 to zone 3 where leafy bladed shifts to bladed leafy resulted in significant velocity reduction than observed at p2 and p4 at p4 two distinct characteristics in the velocity profile were noticed one is the lower canopy region experiences increase in velocity relative to p3 and second is greater velocities above the canopy top the first is maybe due to enhanced flow speed generated due to the sudden shift in canopy porosity from low zone 3 bladed leafy to high zone 4 cylindrical bladed and also variability in flow resistance the latter is possible due to rigid cylindrical stems at p4 interface pushing the flow above the canopy the presence of rigid cylindrical forms at p4 also caused uniform vertical velocity profile in the lower canopy region in upper canopy region and above the canopy velocity profiles were found to be accelerating and mostly similar at p2 p3 and p4 the effect of vegetation starts to disappear gradually as the flow leaving the patch showed a tendency to follow the logarithmic profile at p5 3 3 2 reynold stresses fig 6c e shows the reynold stress profiles in vertical rs u w lateral rs u v and stream wise rs v w directions measured along the heterogeneous patch 2 layout it can be observed that as the flow traverses through the patch heterogeneous characteristics in vegetation significantly altered the shape of reynold stress profiles at various locations generally vegetation reduces the near bed turbulence and shifts the position of the maximum reynolds stress away from the bed and thereby the bed is protected in this layout there was a noticeable difference in depth wise variability of rs u w in vegetated and non vegetated sections and the effect of patch alignment is clearly observed the shape of the rs profiles was distorted at z h 0 to 0 2 the absolute rs u w values ranged from 0 80 1 32 1 20 7 60 0 73 3 62 cm2 s2 at p2 p3 and p4 and 1 02 1 2 2 2 5 1 cm2 s2 at p1 and p5 in lower canopy region vegetation has shown a significant effect on rs u w by reducing its near bed value and showing nearly uniform profiles p2 and p4 this effect is in turn different at p3 where negative near bed rs u w was observed and then showing a rising trend in its profile in the upper canopy region all the rs u w profiles in the vegetated section were on a rising trend with increasing order of variability as p2 p3 and p4 these profile shapes can show a clear variability in vertical momentum exchange activity at p2 though the rs u w profile followed a general trend the amount of mixing activity occurred at canopy top or in upper canopy region was comparatively less than p3 and p4 also above the canopy top z h 0 4 the rs u w profile was fairly uniform this is probably due to diminished turbulence at section a a see fig 6a where the flow through bladed vegetation suddenly encounters highly resistant leafy patch very low canopy porosity but this observation must be further investigated with detailed lateral measurements at the canopy top the discontinuity in vegetation elements induces large scale vertical mixing and generally results in maximum values of rs u w in heterogeneous patch 2 the peak rs u w values were not located as expected which is explained as follows at positions p3 and p4 though the rs u w profiles were similar to other reported works the location of the peak value differed at p3 the peak was nearly at canopy top and in p4 there was a shift in peak value to over canopy region the inhibition of vertical momentum exchange at canopy top of p4 is may be due to one drag discontinuity at the interface two the sudden encounter of flow with rigid cylindrical stems and three resistance variability the velocity profiles at p4 also showed forcible pushing of the flow to over canopy region local regions of negative rs u w was also noticed in lower canopy region of p4 though u z 0 indicating the transfer of turbulent energy to mean flow in over canopy zone the values of the rs u w were found to decreasing with increment in flow depth in this layout the higher thickness of active momentum exchange 40 higher than heterogeneous patch 1 was observed at all locations a simple conceptual sketch showing the mixing activity and penetration ratio at the canopy top is shown in fig 6a fig 6d and e show the variability of reynold stress in lateral rs u v and stream wise rs v w directions it can be seen that absolute values of rs u v in lower canopy region were equally varied as rs u w and especially at p2 the magnitude is relatively higher moreover the shape of rs u v profiles in upper and above the canopy regions showed similar variation as rs u w with opposite sign and lesser magnitude the increase in rs u v value indicates an increase in lateral momentum exchange which is higher at p3 followed by p4 the position of peak rs u v and rising nature of profiles in the upper canopy zone is mostly similar to rs u w at p3 and p4 the plan view at section p3 shows the reversal of patch forms resistance allowing changes in flow pattern and interaction behavior velasco et al 2003 highlight the development of pressure gradients in the form of turbulent wakes generating lateral diffusion of momentum this anisotropic behavior in flow structure clearly shows stream wise and cross stream geometric dissimilarity in vegetation patch forms and their alignment has considerable influence on turbulence measurements also it may be expected that at measurement locations interaction among flow structure due to multiple vegetation patches creates a zone of influence within this zone the turbulent structure can be of varying intensity and depends on vegetation type and alignment hence the turbulent flow structure may be heterogeneous throughout the patch and could be investigated further with more detailed lateral measurements 3 4 variability in roughness coefficient in our experiments though the vegetation density no of plants per m2 remained same plant form canopy porosity and patch alignment has shown a significant effect on flow structure the response of the flow to varying vegetation and its characteristics certainly influences the flow resistance which is computed here in terms of manning s roughness coefficient fig 7 shows the manning s n variability computed by using eqs 1 to 3 of section 2 4 li et al 2014 also refer to errico et al 2018 for different degree of submergence it is observed that manning s n tends to follow similar trend for all the vegetation layouts in the case of heterogeneous layouts manning s n is considerably higher and varied with vegetation patch alignment with an increase in plant deflected height the similar flow conditions in homogeneous flexible grass resulted in lower roughness value due to higher submergence depth while comparing homogeneous flexible grass and mixed heterogeneous layouts an increase in average resistance of 9 is noticed due to the addition of leafy and rigid cylindrical forms to only flexible forms for heterogeneous patch layouts patch 1 offered 25 higher average resistance than patch 2 the presence of highly resistant leafy and rigid stem patches at the beginning and end increased the velocity reduction significantly although manning s n is higher for lower discharges it can be observed that the alignment of vegetation patches significantly increases the flow resistance 4 discussion this section discusses changes in flow structure due to heterogeneity in plant forms and their alignment the depth wise velocity profile in the vegetated channels can be roughly divided into flow through the canopy zone and the over canopy zone klopstra et al 1997 previous studies further divided the canopy zone into lower and upper canopy zones depending on the nature of the velocity profiles huai et al 2009a chen et al 2011 in the present study the flow through different vegetation patches altered the division of velocity profiles due to physical characteristics of the plant form for example the velocity profiles in leafy and rigid cylindrical vegetation can be clearly divided based on its shape in the lower canopy zone velocity is constant and upper canopy zone velocity profile shows accelerating trend due to shear layer interaction while the bladed form has no such distinction due to flexibility of the vegetation causing velocity profile accelerating throughout the canopy zone a similar phenomenon was reported by wilson et al 2003 earlier works have reported that the velocity profile over the canopy zone follows the logarithmic law jarvela 2005 chen et al 2011 li et al 2014 this observation could not be seen in the present study as the experiments were conducted in shallow submerged flow condition flow depth plant height 5 refer to nepf 2012 the results showed that the effect of plant form and alignment of the plant patch is significant in controlling the velocity reduction the presence of mixed vegetation forms fig 3b vs fig 3a and or highly resistant leafy patch at the beginning fig 3c vs fig 3d is favoring for increased velocity reduction when the patch type varies in both the directions fig 3d the difference between the velocities along the patch in upper and over canopy zones is insignificant in flexible submerged canopies under few conditions there is a possibility for the canopy scale or k h vortices to overcome the plant rigidity causing monami effect ghisalberti and nepf 2002 the intensity of the progressive waving and local depression in the canopy increases the turbulent exchange or flux towards the bed causing bed erosion in our study unlike in flexible grass vegetation fig 3a there is no local depression of turbulence flux in mixed heterogeneous layout fig 3b in addition the peak turbulent flux shifted to higher value and more velocity reduction is also noticed a common observation to the previous studies was that inclusion of high resistant vegetation forms like leafy rigid cylindrical stems could help in restricting or prevention of turbulent flux penetration towards the bed next the alignment of vegetation as patches varying its form in longitudinal fig 3c or in both directions fig 3d has also shown interesting flow behavior these observations mostly differed with existing studies which focused on working with single vegetation type like cylindrical form or strips tempest et al 2015 in heterogeneous patch 1 fig 3c the highly flexible bladed patch is confined between highly resistant leafy and rigid cylindrical patches leafy and cylindrical patches favored zones of lower velocities and turbulent stresses which favor bed protection or sediment depositions whereas inside the flexible bladed patch relatively higher mixing activity is observed favoring zones of increased turbulence levels in heterogeneous patch 2 when patch alignment is varied in both directions the cross stream patch dissimilarity induced additional changes to turbulence and significantly changed the flow structure moreover the shape of flow profiles for example reynold stress is distorted in nature to better explain this difference fig 8 is plotted showing comparative analysis between heterogeneous patch 1 and patch 2 table 4 shows the percentage increase in turbulence structure of other locations in patch 1 and 2 with respect to section p2 in patch 1 a high degree of momentum exchange activity rs u w and rs u v and turbulence urms wrms tke is observed in heterogeneous patch 2 this is further supplemented with a higher increase in vertical turbulence intensity levels w rms which is a measure of vortex rotation the overall layouts provide spatial heterogeneity in flow velocity and turbulence field which is important for creating ecological habitat for example guppies poecilia reticulata have shown to prefer staying in varying levels of velocity and turbulence zone for maintaining their life cycle and health trinci et al 2017 other studies have reported that few aquatic species favor zones of high turbulence intensity trinci et al 2017 moderate velocities and low tke hockley et al 2014 showing the importance of heterogeneous flow conditions in rivers the plant swaying motion and k h vortices due to flow instability at the canopy top interacts and transfer the momentum flux by forming an active momentum exchange region ht along the vegetated channel ghisalberti and nepf 2005 wang et al 2009 in the presence of single vegetation type this thickness ht is observed to be gradually increasing for flexible grass chen et al 2011 or uniform for flexible leafy vegetation li et al 2014 along the channel the present work observes non uniform variability in thickness ht depending on the plant forms and patch alignment with patch type varying in both the direction fig 3d a further increase in thickness ht is noticed these observations are conceptually represented in fig 9 manning s roughness coefficient computed for different flow conditions and patch alignment describes the patch type variability effect in changing the flow resistance this information can be helpful in incorporating appropriate manning s value in the river and ecological modeling wu et al 1999 li et al 2014 the study also reveals that horizontal and vertical distributions of plant form patch alignment have a significant effect in controlling flow and turbulent structure and roughness induced to the flow finally it can be said that spatial heterogeneity in flow structure due to heterogeneous vegetation layouts can be helpful for habitat life biodiversity and also promote sedimentation zones unlike flexible grass vegetation heterogeneous vegetation patches can be capable of providing both sedimentation zones and high mixing activity zones in one vegetated bed this observation can be further strengthened with more experiments considering a different combination of heterogeneous patch layouts and eventually helpful for implementing in river restoration schemes 5 conclusions in the present paper an analysis of laboratory experiments conducted to investigate the effect of submerged heterogeneous vegetation patches on flow structure is discussed for this purpose three natural plant forms grass leafy and cylindrical arranged in four different layouts fig 3 namely homogeneous flexible grass mixed heterogeneous patch heterogeneous patch 1 and patch 2 were studied the results of the study provided insights in understanding the effect of heterogeneous characteristics such as plant morphology canopy porosity and patch alignment on flow behavior the major observations in the study lead to the following conclusions first in a mixed heterogeneous patch the additional drag due to the presence of other vegetation forms like leafy and cylindrical stems results in 10 increased velocity reduction than homogeneous flexible grass alone in addition there was no local depression in peak reynold stress at z h 0 54 into the canopy as observed for flexible grass vegetation at z h 0 45 second in heterogeneous patch 1 and patch 2 different zones of increased and diminished turbulence levels varying velocities were observed along the vegetated section plant form and the canopy porosity has significant control on altering the position and intensity of the vertical momentum exchange at the canopy top and also thickness of the active momentum exchange for example in the leafy patch of heterogeneous patch 1 the amount of mixing activity was 50 lesser than other vegetation forms third other than plant form and canopy porosity patch alignment has also controlled the flow structure by inducing additional turbulence to the flow in heterogeneous patch 2 the flow instability aroused due to both longitudinal and cross stream variability of patch forms resulted in increase in turbulence parameters to more than 100 than heterogeneous patch 1 the response of manning s n was highly affected by plant form and patch alignment for different flow conditions this work can be further extended to study with different layouts of heterogeneous patches under varying flow conditions to investigate further detailed measurements in longitudinal and traverse directions will however be helpful for better understanding and justifying the processes in the flow field with further improvement in knowledge heterogeneous vegetation patches can be designed for riparian management practices in improving the ecological behavior and sediment deposition zones acknowledgments the

571,snow is an important component of the water balance of many mountain watersheds worldwide in a warming climate snowmelt modeling and consequent soil water input is often challenged by complex conditions such as rain on snow situations this is why detailed physics based snow models are increasingly being used these models however have much higher input data requirements where in many cases accurate forcing fields are very difficult to provide this study investigates whether the latest advances in the development of snow model framework actually translate into improved discharge simulations to this end we integrated a distributed multi layer energy balance snow model with two recently developed methods of updating snow model mass and energy fluxes using snow observations to improve snow accumulation and depletion predictions surface water input from these simulations was used as input for subsequent streamflow modeling of 25 catchments in the swiss alps over four hydrological years our analysis clearly demonstrates the benefits of accurate snow simulations for hydrological modeling in alpine catchments simulations that included the flux updates improved streamflow predictions and offered best performance at high elevation where snow most prominently affected watershed hydrology these results were consistently achieved when analyzing model performance over entire hydrological years over the snowmelt season only and for individual events keywords energy balance snow model snow observations snowmelt meteorological forcing data runoff modeling alpine catchments 1 introduction in mountainous regions accumulation and melt of seasonal snow plays an important role in the amount and timing of water delivery to the soil column accurate predictions of river runoff for flood or drought forecasts and for resource management related to energy production water supply and ecological interests rely on precise models of snow processes such models are not only used as basis for predictions and decisions of various stakeholders but also quite largely for testing of recent knowledge on snow processes with improving knowledge the complexity of snow models increases and modeling schemes incorporate multiple layers detailed process descriptions and resolve finer spatial and temporal resolutions models are nowadays able to at once represent snow metamorphism as well as capture the spatial variability of snow distribution across a landscape e g lafaysse et al 2017 however numerous studies have shown the constraints of snow models due to limited availability strasser et al 2002 adam et al 2009 viviroli et al 2004 2011 and reliability daly 2006 essery et al 2013 of meteorological input data imperfect process understanding e g dong 2018 and in case of operational applications limited computational power the low computational demands and data requirements of temperature index snow models anderson 1973 1976 and comparable seasonal results to physics based approaches e g franz et al 2008 make these models still an attractive choice snow models based on physics based energy balance equations however are considered to be more accurate walter et al 2005 warscher et al 2013 especially when seasons or events e g rain on snow e g würzer et al 2017 are encountered that differ from the foundations of the temperature index models anderson 1976 kumar et al 2013 the physics based solutions were until recently mainly used when a detailed representation of processes within the snowpack were crucial e g concerning avalanche formation e g hirashima et al 2008 or for simulations of the microstructure within the snowpack e g brown et al 2001 studies conducted over small research basins have also often applied these more complex models e g winstral et al 2014 current increases in computational capabilities are extending physically based snow model applications even into the realm of operational forecasting over larger domains e g hedrick et al 2018 the physics based solutions have the advantage of being robust to all encountered conditions including those typically encountered in rain on snow events kumar et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2016 or when seasonal melt patterns differ from previous trends milly et al 2008 dozier 2011 during rain on snow events melt is sensitive to the turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes marks et al 1998 as well as to the initial snowpack conditions garvelmann et al 2014 würzer et al 2016 increased wind speeds are typical during rain on snow situations e g marks et al 1998 but temperature index models rarely account for turbulent heat exchanges and antecedent snow states and even when they do they are reliant on highly parameterized simplifications e g anderson 2006 physically based snow models on the other hand explicitly capture these processes and states however have much higher data requirements both in terms of quantity and quality accuracy simulations are sensitive to complex meteorological processes that exhibit strong heterogeneities in mountain environments these processes challenge numerical solutions and are often poorly understood e g precipitation wind longwave radiation persistent biases in meteorological forcing data affect model performances dee 2005 auligné et al 2007 and challenge developers and users though the amount of forcing data required by these snow models can often be met by numerical weather forecast products their additional sensitivities and computational requirements remain downsides compared to the simpler temperature dependent simulations to account for erroneous and biased forcing data different approaches have been presented and evaluated possibilities are to make use of ensembles of meteorological input data e g giorgi 2006 or to apply bias correction methods e g johnson and sharma 2011 particularly for operational hydrological modeling data assimilation da has become an important tool da methods differ in their complexity as well as in the type of data that is used to update the model simple methods do not train the model itself but simply replace simulated with observed values even if this might violate the mass balances in contrast complex techniques use observations to tune the model and its parameters to obtain a simulation as close as possible to the measurement taking into account possible measurement errors at the same time for snow models the types of data which are assimilated range from ground based snow depth and snow water equivalent measurements slater and clark 2006 magnusson et al 2014 finger et al 2015 jörg hess et al 2015 to snow covered area data remotely sensed by microwave radiance as presented e g in dechant and moradkhani 2011 the assimilating algorithms also vary with optimal interpolation oi schemes brasnett 1999 liston and hiemstra 2008 the extended kalman filter miller et al 1994 the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and the particle filter pf gordon et al 1993 being the most common methods using enkf and pf lead to improvements for snow models at the point scale charrois et al 2016 magnusson et al 2017 as well as for runoff simulations at the catchment scale andreadis and lettenmeier 2006 nagler et al 2008 griessinger et al 2016 huang et al 2017 however constraints exist for the application of both enkf and pf to our knowledge the pf method is only applicable to points where observations are available and it is therefore not suitable for gridded application with fewer observations than points to be modeled drawbacks of the enkf is the assumption that a gaussian distribution of the model errors exists which is not necessarily realistic moradkhani et al 2005 that correlations exist between observed and unobserved states and that vertical structures within the snowpack are not explicitly updated i e only one snow layer in a multi layer system can be targeted efforts are taken to develop suitable methods for spatially explicit applications with complex multi layer energy balance models an innovative bias detecting ensemble bde method which takes into account all layers of a snowpack is presented in winstral et al 2019 similar to traditional da techniques it uses observed snow data and compares them with an ensemble of model outputs in this case the ensemble is based on prescribed precipitation and energy forcing perturbations biases in the integrated forcing data snow model product are detected and adjustments to the model forcings rather than the modeled states are made this is a promising development that ensures all snow layers evolve in a manner that is physically consistent with observations the bde method has already demonstrated transferability with improved simulations at locations without observations winstral et al 2019 while previous studies e g griessinger et al 2016 have shown the benefits of da in the context of hydrological modeling using conceptual snowmelt models it is yet to be shown what if any improvements are possible when similar and recently developed techniques are applied to physics based snowmelt models to this end we fed output from the multi layer energy balance jules investigation model jim essery et al 2013 to the semi distributed hydrological model streamflow comola et al 2015 gallice et al 2016 we realized three sets of simulations using 1 jim offline with no da as our reference simulation jimnoda 2 using jim with improved meteorological forcing jimoi 3 using jim with improved meteorological forcing and bde to further enhance model forcings jimbde by comparing and validating the model results to measured discharge we were able to test whether improved representation of snowmelt in jim allowed improving stream flow simulations 2 data uncertainties and pre processing 2 1 runoff data and catchment selection we identified 25 catchments detailed in table 1 and illustrated within fig 1 with a large range in sizes 8 420 km2 mean elevations 580 2700 m a s l mean slope angles 11 44 and meteorological conditions for this research model years and catchments were selected based on the availability of required meteorological input data and restricted to basins where the effects of water abstraction or regulation were minimized in addition since we focused on snow processes basins with large glaciers were not considered due to climate and elevation snow season onset and duration varies between individual catchments based on the average dates of snowmelt runoff onset and that in which 75 of total snow water equivalent has disappeared see griessinger et al 2016 for more details we defined a fixed snowmelt season for each catchment foen federal office of the environment provided four years of screened hourly runoff records at the outlet points of the chosen catchments based on mean elevation we grouped the catchments into three elevation classes mean elevation below 1000 m a s l between 1000 and 2000 m a s l and above 2000 m a s l 2 2 topographical data for the division of each catchment into sub watersheds a swisstopo digital elevation model dem of 250 m resolution was used the tool suite taudem tarboton 1997 extracts both the stream network and the corresponding sub watersheds from the dem the stream network was partitioned into reaches and each reach was uniquely associated with a sub watershed taudem was executed using arcgis software by esri the same 250 m dem was used for downscaling of the native 2 km resolution numerical weather prediction forcing data to 250 m horizontal resolution and for performing the snow model simulations further described below 2 3 snow data meteorological forcing data and pre processing both the wsl institute for snow and avalanche research slf and the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss operate snow monitoring networks with numerous stations spread over switzerland we selected screened data from 442 flat field site stations within or outside the catchments that included at least daily snow depth and temperature readings more than 20 of these stations are located above 2000 m a s l within the consortium for small scale modeling cosmo meteoswiss operates numerical weather prediction nwp models providing meteorological data at 2 2 km resolution we used the deterministic cosmo 2 data between 1 september 2013 and 31 december 2015 and data from the equivalent reference run of the ensemble based cosmo e between 1 january 2016 and 31 august 2017 with cosmo e being the successor of cosmo 2 each dataset was only available for one part of the entire investigated period to match the 250 m spatial resolution of the snow model relative humidity incoming longwave radiation and wind data were statistically downscaled wind speed data was additionally bias corrected following winstral et al 2017 in contrast temperature grids were spatially interpolated from station data using a 3 dimensional distance weighting based on a gaussian filter with daily cross validated parameters as described in jörg hess et al 2015 shortwave radiation data was dynamically downscaled using meteoio bavay and egger 2014 in order to account for topographic shading the algorithm swrad 2018 of meteoio uses station specific calculations of sun position and topography to account for local sun angles and shading which are then distributed to a spatial grid in the absence of a dense network for shortwave radiation we represented station data by drawing cosmo data from one grid cell every 10 km 3 methods and models 3 1 snow model snow melt simulations were carried out using the jules investigation model jim which is a multi model framework of physically based energy balance models essery et al 2013 up to three snow layers and five soil layers with a maximum depth of two meters can be handled as a multi model formation jim offers 1701 combinations of process representations the combination chosen here is based on an optimization for predicting daily snow mass and snowpack runoff i e snow hydrological applications as described in magnusson et al 2015 it contains the following parameterizations an empirical snow albedo parameterization which distinguishes cold snow and melting snow douville et al 1995 the empirical snow compaction parameterization described in verseghy 1991 richardson number parameterizations to calculate turbulent heat exchange louis 1979 draining of melt water from layer to layer when reaching the maximum liquid water mass fraction anderson 1976 boone and etchevers 2001 an empirical function for fresh snow density based on air temperature anderson 1976 boone 2002 and an empirical thermal conductivity parameterization douville et al 1995 the model solves mass and energy transfer equations for each snow layer in addition a subgrid parameterization for snow covered fraction helbig et al 2015 helbig et al 2018 and albedo adaptions to account for the variability in albedo decay rates across switzerland e g forest cover see hardy et al 2000 were implemented both extensions are not part of the original jim release jim simulations were conducted at 250 m spatial and hourly temporal resolution with three sets of input data 1 simulations with standard cosmo 2 and cosmo e input data jimnoda 2 simulations using precipitation data corrected to match observations via optimal interpolation jimoi 3 simulations using the corrected precipitation data as in jimoi with an additional step that assessed mass and energy biases in the combined forcing data snow model product jimbde jimnoda and jimoi do not differ in liquid precipitation amounts as the implemented da only affects solid precipitation differences in surface water input between those simulations are due to melt amounts either determined by different energy inputs during the event or swe differences prior to the event which indicates the relevancy of these processes for hydrological modeling in snowmelt dominated catchments 3 1 1 correcting precipitation data using external da applications of da in spatially explicit energy balance multi layer snow models is not straight forward necessitating debatable assumptions about unobserved model states e g slater and clark 2006 sun et al 2004 while substantially increasing computational demands an alternative and computationally efficient da approach of assimilating solid precipitation fluxes has been successfully developed for operational snowmelt forecasting at slf an external conceptual snow model is used for the ensemble model runs needed for da with the purpose of updating solid precipitation inputs via assimilation of snow observations the external module includes a density model for converting observed changes in snow depth to solid precipitation fluxes and takes into account decreasing snow depth due to compaction the updated precipitation forcing fields obtained by optimal interpolation oi can subsequently be used to force the primary energy balance model see magnusson et al 2014 for more details to this end we run an enhanced temperature index snow model that is also presented in magnusson et al 2014 but adapted their equation 10 to feature an hourly timestep to optimize the precipitation phase definition oi is a computationally efficient da approach to leverage point observations to produce gridded fields it is based on a priori defined co variances between errors in the gridded input fields and the observation errors co variances within all prediction errors and co variances within all observation errors here we assume errors in the precipitation input fields to be spatially correlated and observation errors to be spatially uncorrelated further details as well as the demonstrated benefits of oi to improve precipitation forcing fields in this region are available in magnusson et al 2014 here the procedure was used to assimilate observed snow data into the forcing precipitation data for jimoi and jimbde updated gridded daily precipitation data were then disaggregated into hourly values using cosmo precipitation grids 3 1 2 improving energy balance snow simulations using bde the bde technique has been developed recently for distributed physically based snow models with multiple layers and is presented in winstral et al 2019 the method integrates the full modeling chain assessing potential biases in the meteorological driving data and snow model without discriminating between the two sources over 700 model members each with varying precipitation and energy perturbations are run at each snow depth observation station to detect the biases between modeled and observed snow depth days are classified as either snow or melt days on snow days precipitation perturbations are evaluated while on melt days only the energy flux perturbations are analyzed a history of the best performing biases based on simulated and measured snow depths at each site is updated daily based on the assumption that these biases exhibit temporal coherencies daily values are back averaged and spatially interpolated to the modeling grid the back averaging requires a minimum of three days of bias data with snow depth above 2 cm and stretches back in time to a maximum of 14 days for the precipitation multipliers and five days for the energy balance offsets the shorter lookback period for the energy term is to aid in interpreting seasonal transitions of dominant energy fluxes e g increasing solar dependencies in spring in addition to account for misinterpretation of precipitation phase air temperatures are corrected on days when modeled precipitation phase seems to contradict observations at 25 or more observation sites throughout the swiss network the effect of the air temperature adjustments is limited to attaining the best match between simulated and observed precipitation phases on selected days once the simulated precipitation phases are better aligned with observations the air temperature adjustments are removed from the forcing data the distributed precipitation multipliers are used to adjust jimoi precipitation and the energy offset is applied as an additional energy flux to the jim snow model in validating the bde procedure measured snow water equivalent data at stations excluded from the bias evaluations were used fig 2 a and b adapted from winstral et al 2019 illustrate the effect of using the bias detecting method for modeling swe at those stations using jimbde strongly reduces the bias and the rmse compared to jimnoda the offset between observed and simulated snow depth fig 2c is removed in large parts when applying jimbde instead of jimnoda 3 2 hydrological model streamflow is a semi distributed model described in comola et al 2015 and gallice et al 2016 catchments are divided into sub catchments where water transit times through the ground are modelled with a two reservoirs model fast and slow the two reservoirs are governed with the following rules given the infiltration rate i t a part il t min rmax i t drains directly to the lower slow compartment and the rest iu t drains to the upper fast one where rmax is the maximum infiltration rate for both reservoirs the discharge rates of the upper reservoir qup and of the lower reservoir qlow are given by 3 q u p t s u p t τ u p s and 4 q l o w t s l o w t τ l o w s where sup t and slow t are the actual fillings fed by iu t and il t and τup s t and τlow s t are the residence times of the upper and the lower reservoirs of the corresponding sub watershed s for each sub catchment τup s and τlow s are given by 5 τ u p s τ u p a s a t o t 1 3 and 6 τ l o w s τ l o w a s a t o t 1 3 where as is the area of the sub catchment atot the total area of the catchment the coefficients τup and τlow are consistent across each catchment and are obtained by calibration water getting into the stream reach is instantly routed to the next reach of the stream network in stream flow is governed by the taudem structure that specifies that sub watersheds consist of single reaches that maintain independent characteristics the model version 1 2 allows discrete representations of stream reaches in addition the water routing can be done directly to the next stream reach at every time step or with the physically based muskingum cunge diffusive wave approximation cunge 1969 for catchments smaller than 100 km2 we used the former and for larger catchments the latter sublimation from snow covered area and evaporation fluxes over snow free areas were calculated following louis 1979 and linacre 1977 respectively and removed before running streamflow with the surface water input swi from the jim simulations the calibration of the three parameters rmax τup and τlow was based on hourly observed discharge at the outlet with the kling gupta efficiency kge section 3 3 kling et al 2012 used as the objective function a total of 25 000 monte carlo calibration runs were performed for each catchment and each model version for the calibration one water year was selected for each catchment in which the maximal modeled catchment mean swe was below the highest and above the smallest maximal modeled catchment mean swe of all years streamflow was subsequently run with the ten best calibration parameter sets of each catchment for the remaining years for validation purposes 3 3 performance analysis though the calibration was applied to full water years the validation mainly focused on the snowmelt season and on the impact of the three different model versions on discharge we will however also discuss one validation in the late fall a late autumn period was defined depending on the elevation class of the catchment see table 1 we defined the first seven weeks after october 1st for class 3 14th for class 2 or november 1st for class 1 to represent late autumn conditions when precipitation is more likely to fall as rain we compared seasonal kge values for different elevation classes and calculated the two alternative forced choice 2afc scores mason and weigel 2009 for peak flow events during the snowmelt season the kge statistic is the result of the decomposition of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 into a correlation term a variability term and a bias error term expressed as 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between observed and simulated discharge α is the coefficient of variation of simulated discharge over to the coefficient of variation of observed discharge and β is the mean simulated discharge over the mean observed discharge the 2afc score describes the power of a model to predict dichotomous events here peak flow vs no peak flow with 1 being a perfect prediction values above 0 5 indicate that the model prediction is better than a guess peak flow events were defined when observed local maxima exceeded the mean discharge during snowmelt season for every observed event the simulated discharge was screened with the same procedure for the occurrence of a corresponding event within a time window of plus minus three and plus minus 12 h we calculated the percent bias error of the maximal discharge for all detected peak flow events further we compared the performance of our model versions for three special events which took place within the evaluated years one of those was a pure snowmelt event in may 2015 while the others were driven by both rain and snowmelt and happened after the first snow fall in autumn and at the end of the winter respectively 4 results 4 1 surface water input for runoff modeling the differences in swi between the three jim simulations are shown in fig 3 for an exemplary event in autumn 2013 for a catchment in the southern swiss alps riale di calneggia filled red area in fig 1 modelled accumulated jimbde swi over five days ranged from 110 to 160 mm and was nearly twice as large as accumulated swi obtained with jimnoda accumulated swi values of jimoi are in between the largest values of jimnoda and the smallest values of jimbde for all catchments jimbde swi during the snowmelt seasons was on average 10 and 30 larger than jimoi swi and jimnoda swi respectively the particular example from autumn 2013 was chosen to demonstrate the effects da procedures can have to allow for realistic snow model simulations the discharge simulations of this particular event are discussed in chapter 4 6 4 2 streamflow calibration parameters the calibration of streamflow for each model combination and catchment resulted in parameter sets with differences between catchments table 2 details on means and standard deviations of τup s and τlow s per model calibration parameters of jimbde resemble those of jimoi especially both means of τup s and rmax differ however considerably from those of jimnoda given that the 25 catchments and their corresponding sub catchments have diverse topographic characteristic we analyzed the correlation between the calibrated sub catchment streamflow parameters τup s and τlow s and the following specific topographic parameters from each sub catchment based on the 250 m dem maximal minimal mean range and standard deviation of elevation and maximal minimal mean and standard deviation of slope angles and sky view factors sky view factors were computed following helbig et al 2009 τup s was significantly correlated which we define by having a p value smaller than 0 05 with minimal elevation range and standard deviation of elevation standard deviation of slope angle maximal slope angle minimal sky view factor and standard deviation of sky view factor table 3 among these terrain parameters we obtained the largest spearman correlation of 0 6 for standard deviation of slope angle on the contrary τlow s was only found to correlate statistically significant with minimal elevation with a spearman correlation of 0 9 we obtained overall similar significant correlations between topography and calibration parameters independent of jim simulation jimnoda jimoi or jimbde 4 3 yearly kge all catchments validation of the model simulations are presented in fig 4 kge values were calculated for all data except the water year that was used for parameter calibration left panel the center and the right panel show kge values for all catchment specific snowmelt seasons and late autumns except for the calibration year respectively median kge values for the all year comparison range from about 0 6 for jimnoda to 0 7 for jimoi and 0 75 for jimbde thus all simulations achieve best results for the all water year comparisons as validation period kge values for the two shorter periods are lower the smallest model performances between 0 2 and 0 3 median kge values and the largest spread within each model chain are found for the autumn season here the overlap of the three boxes is large and only minor differences between the model versions are apparent concerning the median value of 0 25 jimbde performs worse than jimoi even if the upper whisker shows some values which outperform the best simulations of jimnoda and jimoi for all model versions the model performances are much worse in autumn compared to the snow melt season and all year behavior splitting all snow seasons into shorter periods of accumulation early peak and late melt results in similar patterns though larger spreads in median kge values except for the accumulation phase where the median kge was slightly higher for jimoi than for jimbde we consistently obtain the highest median kge for jimbde and lowest kge for jimnoda data not shown 4 4 snowmelt season kge for all catchment specific snowmelt seasons the median kge values are larger or equal to 0 5 with the best kge of 0 75 for jimbde fig 4 center more details of the model performances can be seen when the catchments are split into elevation classes based on the mean elevation table 1 for the catchments in the lowest elevation class 1 fig 5 left the model performances of jimbde and jimoi are similar with median kge values close to 0 6 the median kge of all model simulations from jimnoda is lower close to 0 5 in the elevation class 2 fig 5 center the spread between the kge values of the different model chains becomes more pronounced for jimbde the median values are well above 0 6 below 0 6 for jimoi and below 0 5 for jimnoda the spread between the three model chains is even more obvious in the elevation class 3 fig 5 right the median kge values from all analyzed simulations of jimbde are above 0 75 close to 0 6 for jimoi and about 0 4 for jimnoda fig 5 shows that the model efficiencies of jimbde simulations increase with higher mean catchment elevation while those of jimnoda decrease with increasing elevations we see only very small variations in median kge of jimoi simulations with altering catchment elevations furthermore the interquartile range of jimoi is nearly unchanged within the highest catchment class the smallest interquartile range and therefore also the smallest spread between upper and lower whisker is shown by jimbde which suggests a consistently good performance of jimbde for this elevation class 4 5 detection of peakflow events during snowmelt season the performances regarding the detection of peakflow events during all snowmelt seasons are evaluated using the 2afc score fig 6 left panel the overlap of the boxes indicates that the range of performances is similar between the model versions as well as between the different time windows as anticipated the median performances are better if a time window of plus minus twelve hours is applied green borders than if a time window of plus minus three hours around an observed peak is applied red borders no scores below 0 5 occur which indicates that all predictions are better than a random guess could achieve compared to other studies that made use of this performance metric e g fundel et al 2013 sahu et al 2017 and considering the fact that only the validation data had been used for the statistical analysis the median 2afc scores indicate sound predictive skills for both time windows with median values of 0 65 three hours and nearly 0 7 twelve hours jimbde performs better than both jimoi and jimnoda which achieve very close median 2afc values jimoi and jimnoda give also similar results in the bias of discharge during peak events fig 6 right panel within the three hours window the absolute bias is slightly larger than within the 12 h window and the boxes of both time windows mainly overlap median biases for jimnoda 14 3 h and 7 12 h and jimoi 12 3 h and 11 12 h are negative which means that the simulations underestimate the observed discharge during peakflow events for both time windows the median bias of jimbde 1 3 h and 0 5 12 h is close to zero indicating a negligible trend of under or overestimation of discharge amounts during peakflow events 4 6 event analysis differences between the three model versions are particularly notable in the analysis of individual events for demonstration purposes we have selected three challenging snow hydrological events fig 7 note that all data shown are from separate validation periods and have not been used for calibration of the model first a rain on snow event which took place at the end of october 2013 in the southern swiss alps that strongly affected the catchment of the riale di calneggia fig 7 left column during that event the peak of observed discharge is 24 m3 s while the ensemble simulations using the ten best calibration parameter configurtions of jimnoda top gives a maximal discharge of 10 m3 s the maximal discharge of the two other model chains is much closer to the observed maximal value jimbde bottom overestimates the discharge throughout the entire event while jimoi middle slightly underestimates the peak and overestimates the runoff during the second day after the peak event the smallest and largest swi blue lines at top of each graph are coming from jimnoda and jimbde respectively which is also shown in fig 3 illustrating the accumulated swi for this particular event second a precipitation event in april and may 2017 which mainly affected the northern parts of switzerland and the catchment of the river biber central column this precipitation and snowmelt event can be separated into two event parts during the first half of the event all jim simulations underestimate the discharge to some extent and also have a time shift of several hours in particular for jimnoda top and jimoi middle the first peaks occur earlier and up to three times weaker in the ensemble simulations than in the observation during the second half of the event may 6th and later a time shift leads to earlier peaks in the simulations and jimoi underestimates while jimnoda top overestimates the discharge in contrast to the first half here jimbde bottom does not underestimate the discharge this example shows the strength of using the bias detecting approach obviously the bde algorithm detected an underestimation of snow melt and consequently surface water input which it was able to compensate the following days the model corrected for this biases which resulted in an increase in summed swi by 54 the last example for a characteristic snow hydrological event is a series of mainly snowmelt driven runoff events taking place in the dischma catchment in the eastern swiss alps in spring 2015 fig 7 right column accumulated swi of jimbde is 30 higher than swi of jimoi during this event the differences in discharge between the three simulations are small during the first six days and become more pronounced later on similar to the two former events jimoi slightly underestimates the observed discharge also jimnoda shows an underestimation but only during the last four days of the event 5 discussion hydrological simulations require intensive calibration between model input and observed runoff for the streamflow calibrations in this study we calibrated each jim model set up for each of the 25 catchments with observation data from one water year one could argue that the overall good performance of our modeled discharge origins in the three calibration parameters to investigate this we performed a correlation analysis between sub catchment streamflow calibration parameters and sub catchment topographic parameters we found statistically significant correlations between several terrain parameters and the residence time of the upper reservoirs τup s and between one terrain parameter and residence time of the lower reservoirs τlow s among the three different jim model set ups we obtained overall similar statistically significant correlations suggesting that model error compensation is less meaningful in the obtained calibration parameters our results show the impact of recent advances in snow modeling frameworks for hydrological simulations jimbde which was forced with corrected cosmo precipitation data and directly incorporated observations into the modeling framework to modulate both mass and energy forcings outperformed both jimoi and jimnoda this finding is consistent over all catchment elevations and independent of whether an entire water year or the snowmelt season was taken as evaluation period while the model efficiency of jimnoda decreased with increasing elevation jimbde shows better results with increasing elevations this indicates that the reference simulations jimnoda seem to struggle with snow prone conditions at high elevations while this deficit could already be mitigated by oi to improve precipitation forcing fields jimoi furthermore the bde reversed the trend seen with jimnoda and actually led to best performance metrics to be found at high elevation where snowmelt is an important driver of runoff formation here complex snow related processes become more prominent and important for catchment behavior while also meteorological data are less reliable e g schirmer and jamieson 2015 further at mid and high elevations runoff events are largely impacted by changes in snowline altitude tobin et al 2012 marks et al 2013 which is captured by the corrected precipitation data used within jimoi and jimbde similar to our results griessinger et al 2016 found improvements due to da more pronounced at high elevation whereas results presented in andreadis and lettenmeier 2006 indicate the opposite in their case degrading performances of using da at high elevations was explained by the general underestimation of swe for deep snowpacks using the assimilated passive microwave remote sensing data pulliainen and hallikainen 2001 the model performances for late autumn show a very different behavior generally the model behavior is considerably worse in this period and differences between the three sets of model simulations are less conclusive during this time of the year precipitation mostly falls as rain and furthermore errors in nwp are high e g frei et al 2003 under these circumstances neither of the two schemes which integrate external snow observation data helped to improve the performance of the hydrological model which is basically bound to the input data as provided while the kge values seem particularly low note that here the performance was assessed with data at hourly resolution where it is obviously much easier to achieve decent performance metrics if input data and model times step are at daily resolution only e g garen and marks 2005 within this particular season jimbde performs similar to jimnoda whereas jimoi outperforms both the reason for this unexpected behavior of jimbde might be that derived biases in this application are based on simulated and measured snow depths within the last 14 snow days therefore for late autumn seasons spring days are included in the bias history seasonal differences of the benefit of using da methods within hydrological simulations have been reported by clark et al 2006 they made use of snow covered area assimilation and indicated smaller effects on hydrological simulations at the end of the snow melt season which can be partly explained by the relative short time between mainly snow covered and mainly snow free areas within our set up however benefits from assimilating snow station data were particularly pronounced during spring our findings in this study demonstrate the importance of accurate input data for successful applications of energy balance snowmelt models also noted by raleigh et al 2015 to achieve improved forcing data our approaches using external snow observation data benefitted from a dense network of station data note that station records may not necessarily represent average snow conditions of the surrounding area e g grünewald and lehning 2015 however both da frameworks used here jimoi and jimbde employ a flux assimilation scheme which mitigates problems potentially arising from offset station readings magnusson et al 2014 in cases with reduced data availability the degree of improvement might be reduced though other da methods which make use of remotely sensed data as applied by kumar et al 2015 or stigter et al 2017 could potentially compensate or even improve upon the current findings jimnoda and jimoi have similar ability of detecting peak flow events and both consistently underestimate the discharge during these events while the range of model performances is similar between all three methods the median results show that with jimbde the detection rate is higher and no trend of under or overestimation is obvious during the snowmelt season jimbde is able to correct for offsets in the energy balance or in the precipitation data while adjusting to actual meteorological patterns this is evident during the event occurring in may 2017 where several peaks in precipitation snowmelt and runoff were observed over several weeks here bde method aptly adjusted to the changing conditions to improve runoff simulations throughout the period huang et al 2017 found that da improvements are linked to the quality of simulations without da if simulations without da already well captured the hydrological processes of a specific catchment using da could not enhance the performances as much as if the simulations without da had shown poor model quality a more detailed separate evaluation of the bde methods winstral et al 2019 arrived at the same conclusion this suggests that the demonstrated improvements from using oi and bde methods in this study may have been accentuated by the fact that the baseline simulations jimnoda had notable weaknesses particularly for high elevation catchments but given the known biases and errors within nwp and the sensitivity of energy balance snow models to their forcings advanced methods incorporating observation data will remain a useful companion for this type of models particularly when used in operational applications 6 conclusions this study demonstrates that advanced snow modeling frameworks in the context of hydrological modeling of alpine watersheds can improve runoff simulations for this purpose a distributed multi layered energy balance snow model was used these types of snow models are required to accurately assess rain on snow kumar et al 2013 winstral et al 2019 and other conditions that involve processes not accounted for in calibrated parametric approaches dozier 2011 milly et al 2008 different approaches that leveraged snow observations were used to frame a set of physics based snow model simulations with increasing accuracy relative to baseline simulations that did not included the observations to this end we employed two methods available for these types of snow models indirect da and bde that do not violate any of the underlying physical principles such as energy and mass balance conservation at any time our results show that surface water input as calculated by the most advanced model framework used here consistently allowed for the best performance of subsequent hydrological modeling while simulations that did not include observations in the modeling framework had decreasing performance with increasing catchment altitude catchments where the expectation is that snowmelt would increasingly influence hydrology the opposite was true for the model framework when indirect da and bde were included these results were consistent when analyzing performance over entire hydrological years over the snowmelt season only and for individual events i e peak flow analysis as long as a sufficient dense station network covering high elevated areas exists the approach making use of indirect da and bde for energy balance snow model forms a promising tool for discharge simulations of alpine catchments while other studies exist to support our results from the perspective of individual and often extreme events this study is based on data from four hydrological years and 25 catchments spanning a large range of both meteorological and topographical conditions the results of our study may seem intuitive and could be taken for granted but given the enormous challenges involved with using complex energy balance snow models in operational settings it is certainly reassuring that these efforts actually do entail improved streamflow forecasts acknowledgments this study was partly

571,snow is an important component of the water balance of many mountain watersheds worldwide in a warming climate snowmelt modeling and consequent soil water input is often challenged by complex conditions such as rain on snow situations this is why detailed physics based snow models are increasingly being used these models however have much higher input data requirements where in many cases accurate forcing fields are very difficult to provide this study investigates whether the latest advances in the development of snow model framework actually translate into improved discharge simulations to this end we integrated a distributed multi layer energy balance snow model with two recently developed methods of updating snow model mass and energy fluxes using snow observations to improve snow accumulation and depletion predictions surface water input from these simulations was used as input for subsequent streamflow modeling of 25 catchments in the swiss alps over four hydrological years our analysis clearly demonstrates the benefits of accurate snow simulations for hydrological modeling in alpine catchments simulations that included the flux updates improved streamflow predictions and offered best performance at high elevation where snow most prominently affected watershed hydrology these results were consistently achieved when analyzing model performance over entire hydrological years over the snowmelt season only and for individual events keywords energy balance snow model snow observations snowmelt meteorological forcing data runoff modeling alpine catchments 1 introduction in mountainous regions accumulation and melt of seasonal snow plays an important role in the amount and timing of water delivery to the soil column accurate predictions of river runoff for flood or drought forecasts and for resource management related to energy production water supply and ecological interests rely on precise models of snow processes such models are not only used as basis for predictions and decisions of various stakeholders but also quite largely for testing of recent knowledge on snow processes with improving knowledge the complexity of snow models increases and modeling schemes incorporate multiple layers detailed process descriptions and resolve finer spatial and temporal resolutions models are nowadays able to at once represent snow metamorphism as well as capture the spatial variability of snow distribution across a landscape e g lafaysse et al 2017 however numerous studies have shown the constraints of snow models due to limited availability strasser et al 2002 adam et al 2009 viviroli et al 2004 2011 and reliability daly 2006 essery et al 2013 of meteorological input data imperfect process understanding e g dong 2018 and in case of operational applications limited computational power the low computational demands and data requirements of temperature index snow models anderson 1973 1976 and comparable seasonal results to physics based approaches e g franz et al 2008 make these models still an attractive choice snow models based on physics based energy balance equations however are considered to be more accurate walter et al 2005 warscher et al 2013 especially when seasons or events e g rain on snow e g würzer et al 2017 are encountered that differ from the foundations of the temperature index models anderson 1976 kumar et al 2013 the physics based solutions were until recently mainly used when a detailed representation of processes within the snowpack were crucial e g concerning avalanche formation e g hirashima et al 2008 or for simulations of the microstructure within the snowpack e g brown et al 2001 studies conducted over small research basins have also often applied these more complex models e g winstral et al 2014 current increases in computational capabilities are extending physically based snow model applications even into the realm of operational forecasting over larger domains e g hedrick et al 2018 the physics based solutions have the advantage of being robust to all encountered conditions including those typically encountered in rain on snow events kumar et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2016 or when seasonal melt patterns differ from previous trends milly et al 2008 dozier 2011 during rain on snow events melt is sensitive to the turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes marks et al 1998 as well as to the initial snowpack conditions garvelmann et al 2014 würzer et al 2016 increased wind speeds are typical during rain on snow situations e g marks et al 1998 but temperature index models rarely account for turbulent heat exchanges and antecedent snow states and even when they do they are reliant on highly parameterized simplifications e g anderson 2006 physically based snow models on the other hand explicitly capture these processes and states however have much higher data requirements both in terms of quantity and quality accuracy simulations are sensitive to complex meteorological processes that exhibit strong heterogeneities in mountain environments these processes challenge numerical solutions and are often poorly understood e g precipitation wind longwave radiation persistent biases in meteorological forcing data affect model performances dee 2005 auligné et al 2007 and challenge developers and users though the amount of forcing data required by these snow models can often be met by numerical weather forecast products their additional sensitivities and computational requirements remain downsides compared to the simpler temperature dependent simulations to account for erroneous and biased forcing data different approaches have been presented and evaluated possibilities are to make use of ensembles of meteorological input data e g giorgi 2006 or to apply bias correction methods e g johnson and sharma 2011 particularly for operational hydrological modeling data assimilation da has become an important tool da methods differ in their complexity as well as in the type of data that is used to update the model simple methods do not train the model itself but simply replace simulated with observed values even if this might violate the mass balances in contrast complex techniques use observations to tune the model and its parameters to obtain a simulation as close as possible to the measurement taking into account possible measurement errors at the same time for snow models the types of data which are assimilated range from ground based snow depth and snow water equivalent measurements slater and clark 2006 magnusson et al 2014 finger et al 2015 jörg hess et al 2015 to snow covered area data remotely sensed by microwave radiance as presented e g in dechant and moradkhani 2011 the assimilating algorithms also vary with optimal interpolation oi schemes brasnett 1999 liston and hiemstra 2008 the extended kalman filter miller et al 1994 the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and the particle filter pf gordon et al 1993 being the most common methods using enkf and pf lead to improvements for snow models at the point scale charrois et al 2016 magnusson et al 2017 as well as for runoff simulations at the catchment scale andreadis and lettenmeier 2006 nagler et al 2008 griessinger et al 2016 huang et al 2017 however constraints exist for the application of both enkf and pf to our knowledge the pf method is only applicable to points where observations are available and it is therefore not suitable for gridded application with fewer observations than points to be modeled drawbacks of the enkf is the assumption that a gaussian distribution of the model errors exists which is not necessarily realistic moradkhani et al 2005 that correlations exist between observed and unobserved states and that vertical structures within the snowpack are not explicitly updated i e only one snow layer in a multi layer system can be targeted efforts are taken to develop suitable methods for spatially explicit applications with complex multi layer energy balance models an innovative bias detecting ensemble bde method which takes into account all layers of a snowpack is presented in winstral et al 2019 similar to traditional da techniques it uses observed snow data and compares them with an ensemble of model outputs in this case the ensemble is based on prescribed precipitation and energy forcing perturbations biases in the integrated forcing data snow model product are detected and adjustments to the model forcings rather than the modeled states are made this is a promising development that ensures all snow layers evolve in a manner that is physically consistent with observations the bde method has already demonstrated transferability with improved simulations at locations without observations winstral et al 2019 while previous studies e g griessinger et al 2016 have shown the benefits of da in the context of hydrological modeling using conceptual snowmelt models it is yet to be shown what if any improvements are possible when similar and recently developed techniques are applied to physics based snowmelt models to this end we fed output from the multi layer energy balance jules investigation model jim essery et al 2013 to the semi distributed hydrological model streamflow comola et al 2015 gallice et al 2016 we realized three sets of simulations using 1 jim offline with no da as our reference simulation jimnoda 2 using jim with improved meteorological forcing jimoi 3 using jim with improved meteorological forcing and bde to further enhance model forcings jimbde by comparing and validating the model results to measured discharge we were able to test whether improved representation of snowmelt in jim allowed improving stream flow simulations 2 data uncertainties and pre processing 2 1 runoff data and catchment selection we identified 25 catchments detailed in table 1 and illustrated within fig 1 with a large range in sizes 8 420 km2 mean elevations 580 2700 m a s l mean slope angles 11 44 and meteorological conditions for this research model years and catchments were selected based on the availability of required meteorological input data and restricted to basins where the effects of water abstraction or regulation were minimized in addition since we focused on snow processes basins with large glaciers were not considered due to climate and elevation snow season onset and duration varies between individual catchments based on the average dates of snowmelt runoff onset and that in which 75 of total snow water equivalent has disappeared see griessinger et al 2016 for more details we defined a fixed snowmelt season for each catchment foen federal office of the environment provided four years of screened hourly runoff records at the outlet points of the chosen catchments based on mean elevation we grouped the catchments into three elevation classes mean elevation below 1000 m a s l between 1000 and 2000 m a s l and above 2000 m a s l 2 2 topographical data for the division of each catchment into sub watersheds a swisstopo digital elevation model dem of 250 m resolution was used the tool suite taudem tarboton 1997 extracts both the stream network and the corresponding sub watersheds from the dem the stream network was partitioned into reaches and each reach was uniquely associated with a sub watershed taudem was executed using arcgis software by esri the same 250 m dem was used for downscaling of the native 2 km resolution numerical weather prediction forcing data to 250 m horizontal resolution and for performing the snow model simulations further described below 2 3 snow data meteorological forcing data and pre processing both the wsl institute for snow and avalanche research slf and the swiss federal office of meteorology and climatology meteoswiss operate snow monitoring networks with numerous stations spread over switzerland we selected screened data from 442 flat field site stations within or outside the catchments that included at least daily snow depth and temperature readings more than 20 of these stations are located above 2000 m a s l within the consortium for small scale modeling cosmo meteoswiss operates numerical weather prediction nwp models providing meteorological data at 2 2 km resolution we used the deterministic cosmo 2 data between 1 september 2013 and 31 december 2015 and data from the equivalent reference run of the ensemble based cosmo e between 1 january 2016 and 31 august 2017 with cosmo e being the successor of cosmo 2 each dataset was only available for one part of the entire investigated period to match the 250 m spatial resolution of the snow model relative humidity incoming longwave radiation and wind data were statistically downscaled wind speed data was additionally bias corrected following winstral et al 2017 in contrast temperature grids were spatially interpolated from station data using a 3 dimensional distance weighting based on a gaussian filter with daily cross validated parameters as described in jörg hess et al 2015 shortwave radiation data was dynamically downscaled using meteoio bavay and egger 2014 in order to account for topographic shading the algorithm swrad 2018 of meteoio uses station specific calculations of sun position and topography to account for local sun angles and shading which are then distributed to a spatial grid in the absence of a dense network for shortwave radiation we represented station data by drawing cosmo data from one grid cell every 10 km 3 methods and models 3 1 snow model snow melt simulations were carried out using the jules investigation model jim which is a multi model framework of physically based energy balance models essery et al 2013 up to three snow layers and five soil layers with a maximum depth of two meters can be handled as a multi model formation jim offers 1701 combinations of process representations the combination chosen here is based on an optimization for predicting daily snow mass and snowpack runoff i e snow hydrological applications as described in magnusson et al 2015 it contains the following parameterizations an empirical snow albedo parameterization which distinguishes cold snow and melting snow douville et al 1995 the empirical snow compaction parameterization described in verseghy 1991 richardson number parameterizations to calculate turbulent heat exchange louis 1979 draining of melt water from layer to layer when reaching the maximum liquid water mass fraction anderson 1976 boone and etchevers 2001 an empirical function for fresh snow density based on air temperature anderson 1976 boone 2002 and an empirical thermal conductivity parameterization douville et al 1995 the model solves mass and energy transfer equations for each snow layer in addition a subgrid parameterization for snow covered fraction helbig et al 2015 helbig et al 2018 and albedo adaptions to account for the variability in albedo decay rates across switzerland e g forest cover see hardy et al 2000 were implemented both extensions are not part of the original jim release jim simulations were conducted at 250 m spatial and hourly temporal resolution with three sets of input data 1 simulations with standard cosmo 2 and cosmo e input data jimnoda 2 simulations using precipitation data corrected to match observations via optimal interpolation jimoi 3 simulations using the corrected precipitation data as in jimoi with an additional step that assessed mass and energy biases in the combined forcing data snow model product jimbde jimnoda and jimoi do not differ in liquid precipitation amounts as the implemented da only affects solid precipitation differences in surface water input between those simulations are due to melt amounts either determined by different energy inputs during the event or swe differences prior to the event which indicates the relevancy of these processes for hydrological modeling in snowmelt dominated catchments 3 1 1 correcting precipitation data using external da applications of da in spatially explicit energy balance multi layer snow models is not straight forward necessitating debatable assumptions about unobserved model states e g slater and clark 2006 sun et al 2004 while substantially increasing computational demands an alternative and computationally efficient da approach of assimilating solid precipitation fluxes has been successfully developed for operational snowmelt forecasting at slf an external conceptual snow model is used for the ensemble model runs needed for da with the purpose of updating solid precipitation inputs via assimilation of snow observations the external module includes a density model for converting observed changes in snow depth to solid precipitation fluxes and takes into account decreasing snow depth due to compaction the updated precipitation forcing fields obtained by optimal interpolation oi can subsequently be used to force the primary energy balance model see magnusson et al 2014 for more details to this end we run an enhanced temperature index snow model that is also presented in magnusson et al 2014 but adapted their equation 10 to feature an hourly timestep to optimize the precipitation phase definition oi is a computationally efficient da approach to leverage point observations to produce gridded fields it is based on a priori defined co variances between errors in the gridded input fields and the observation errors co variances within all prediction errors and co variances within all observation errors here we assume errors in the precipitation input fields to be spatially correlated and observation errors to be spatially uncorrelated further details as well as the demonstrated benefits of oi to improve precipitation forcing fields in this region are available in magnusson et al 2014 here the procedure was used to assimilate observed snow data into the forcing precipitation data for jimoi and jimbde updated gridded daily precipitation data were then disaggregated into hourly values using cosmo precipitation grids 3 1 2 improving energy balance snow simulations using bde the bde technique has been developed recently for distributed physically based snow models with multiple layers and is presented in winstral et al 2019 the method integrates the full modeling chain assessing potential biases in the meteorological driving data and snow model without discriminating between the two sources over 700 model members each with varying precipitation and energy perturbations are run at each snow depth observation station to detect the biases between modeled and observed snow depth days are classified as either snow or melt days on snow days precipitation perturbations are evaluated while on melt days only the energy flux perturbations are analyzed a history of the best performing biases based on simulated and measured snow depths at each site is updated daily based on the assumption that these biases exhibit temporal coherencies daily values are back averaged and spatially interpolated to the modeling grid the back averaging requires a minimum of three days of bias data with snow depth above 2 cm and stretches back in time to a maximum of 14 days for the precipitation multipliers and five days for the energy balance offsets the shorter lookback period for the energy term is to aid in interpreting seasonal transitions of dominant energy fluxes e g increasing solar dependencies in spring in addition to account for misinterpretation of precipitation phase air temperatures are corrected on days when modeled precipitation phase seems to contradict observations at 25 or more observation sites throughout the swiss network the effect of the air temperature adjustments is limited to attaining the best match between simulated and observed precipitation phases on selected days once the simulated precipitation phases are better aligned with observations the air temperature adjustments are removed from the forcing data the distributed precipitation multipliers are used to adjust jimoi precipitation and the energy offset is applied as an additional energy flux to the jim snow model in validating the bde procedure measured snow water equivalent data at stations excluded from the bias evaluations were used fig 2 a and b adapted from winstral et al 2019 illustrate the effect of using the bias detecting method for modeling swe at those stations using jimbde strongly reduces the bias and the rmse compared to jimnoda the offset between observed and simulated snow depth fig 2c is removed in large parts when applying jimbde instead of jimnoda 3 2 hydrological model streamflow is a semi distributed model described in comola et al 2015 and gallice et al 2016 catchments are divided into sub catchments where water transit times through the ground are modelled with a two reservoirs model fast and slow the two reservoirs are governed with the following rules given the infiltration rate i t a part il t min rmax i t drains directly to the lower slow compartment and the rest iu t drains to the upper fast one where rmax is the maximum infiltration rate for both reservoirs the discharge rates of the upper reservoir qup and of the lower reservoir qlow are given by 3 q u p t s u p t τ u p s and 4 q l o w t s l o w t τ l o w s where sup t and slow t are the actual fillings fed by iu t and il t and τup s t and τlow s t are the residence times of the upper and the lower reservoirs of the corresponding sub watershed s for each sub catchment τup s and τlow s are given by 5 τ u p s τ u p a s a t o t 1 3 and 6 τ l o w s τ l o w a s a t o t 1 3 where as is the area of the sub catchment atot the total area of the catchment the coefficients τup and τlow are consistent across each catchment and are obtained by calibration water getting into the stream reach is instantly routed to the next reach of the stream network in stream flow is governed by the taudem structure that specifies that sub watersheds consist of single reaches that maintain independent characteristics the model version 1 2 allows discrete representations of stream reaches in addition the water routing can be done directly to the next stream reach at every time step or with the physically based muskingum cunge diffusive wave approximation cunge 1969 for catchments smaller than 100 km2 we used the former and for larger catchments the latter sublimation from snow covered area and evaporation fluxes over snow free areas were calculated following louis 1979 and linacre 1977 respectively and removed before running streamflow with the surface water input swi from the jim simulations the calibration of the three parameters rmax τup and τlow was based on hourly observed discharge at the outlet with the kling gupta efficiency kge section 3 3 kling et al 2012 used as the objective function a total of 25 000 monte carlo calibration runs were performed for each catchment and each model version for the calibration one water year was selected for each catchment in which the maximal modeled catchment mean swe was below the highest and above the smallest maximal modeled catchment mean swe of all years streamflow was subsequently run with the ten best calibration parameter sets of each catchment for the remaining years for validation purposes 3 3 performance analysis though the calibration was applied to full water years the validation mainly focused on the snowmelt season and on the impact of the three different model versions on discharge we will however also discuss one validation in the late fall a late autumn period was defined depending on the elevation class of the catchment see table 1 we defined the first seven weeks after october 1st for class 3 14th for class 2 or november 1st for class 1 to represent late autumn conditions when precipitation is more likely to fall as rain we compared seasonal kge values for different elevation classes and calculated the two alternative forced choice 2afc scores mason and weigel 2009 for peak flow events during the snowmelt season the kge statistic is the result of the decomposition of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 into a correlation term a variability term and a bias error term expressed as 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between observed and simulated discharge α is the coefficient of variation of simulated discharge over to the coefficient of variation of observed discharge and β is the mean simulated discharge over the mean observed discharge the 2afc score describes the power of a model to predict dichotomous events here peak flow vs no peak flow with 1 being a perfect prediction values above 0 5 indicate that the model prediction is better than a guess peak flow events were defined when observed local maxima exceeded the mean discharge during snowmelt season for every observed event the simulated discharge was screened with the same procedure for the occurrence of a corresponding event within a time window of plus minus three and plus minus 12 h we calculated the percent bias error of the maximal discharge for all detected peak flow events further we compared the performance of our model versions for three special events which took place within the evaluated years one of those was a pure snowmelt event in may 2015 while the others were driven by both rain and snowmelt and happened after the first snow fall in autumn and at the end of the winter respectively 4 results 4 1 surface water input for runoff modeling the differences in swi between the three jim simulations are shown in fig 3 for an exemplary event in autumn 2013 for a catchment in the southern swiss alps riale di calneggia filled red area in fig 1 modelled accumulated jimbde swi over five days ranged from 110 to 160 mm and was nearly twice as large as accumulated swi obtained with jimnoda accumulated swi values of jimoi are in between the largest values of jimnoda and the smallest values of jimbde for all catchments jimbde swi during the snowmelt seasons was on average 10 and 30 larger than jimoi swi and jimnoda swi respectively the particular example from autumn 2013 was chosen to demonstrate the effects da procedures can have to allow for realistic snow model simulations the discharge simulations of this particular event are discussed in chapter 4 6 4 2 streamflow calibration parameters the calibration of streamflow for each model combination and catchment resulted in parameter sets with differences between catchments table 2 details on means and standard deviations of τup s and τlow s per model calibration parameters of jimbde resemble those of jimoi especially both means of τup s and rmax differ however considerably from those of jimnoda given that the 25 catchments and their corresponding sub catchments have diverse topographic characteristic we analyzed the correlation between the calibrated sub catchment streamflow parameters τup s and τlow s and the following specific topographic parameters from each sub catchment based on the 250 m dem maximal minimal mean range and standard deviation of elevation and maximal minimal mean and standard deviation of slope angles and sky view factors sky view factors were computed following helbig et al 2009 τup s was significantly correlated which we define by having a p value smaller than 0 05 with minimal elevation range and standard deviation of elevation standard deviation of slope angle maximal slope angle minimal sky view factor and standard deviation of sky view factor table 3 among these terrain parameters we obtained the largest spearman correlation of 0 6 for standard deviation of slope angle on the contrary τlow s was only found to correlate statistically significant with minimal elevation with a spearman correlation of 0 9 we obtained overall similar significant correlations between topography and calibration parameters independent of jim simulation jimnoda jimoi or jimbde 4 3 yearly kge all catchments validation of the model simulations are presented in fig 4 kge values were calculated for all data except the water year that was used for parameter calibration left panel the center and the right panel show kge values for all catchment specific snowmelt seasons and late autumns except for the calibration year respectively median kge values for the all year comparison range from about 0 6 for jimnoda to 0 7 for jimoi and 0 75 for jimbde thus all simulations achieve best results for the all water year comparisons as validation period kge values for the two shorter periods are lower the smallest model performances between 0 2 and 0 3 median kge values and the largest spread within each model chain are found for the autumn season here the overlap of the three boxes is large and only minor differences between the model versions are apparent concerning the median value of 0 25 jimbde performs worse than jimoi even if the upper whisker shows some values which outperform the best simulations of jimnoda and jimoi for all model versions the model performances are much worse in autumn compared to the snow melt season and all year behavior splitting all snow seasons into shorter periods of accumulation early peak and late melt results in similar patterns though larger spreads in median kge values except for the accumulation phase where the median kge was slightly higher for jimoi than for jimbde we consistently obtain the highest median kge for jimbde and lowest kge for jimnoda data not shown 4 4 snowmelt season kge for all catchment specific snowmelt seasons the median kge values are larger or equal to 0 5 with the best kge of 0 75 for jimbde fig 4 center more details of the model performances can be seen when the catchments are split into elevation classes based on the mean elevation table 1 for the catchments in the lowest elevation class 1 fig 5 left the model performances of jimbde and jimoi are similar with median kge values close to 0 6 the median kge of all model simulations from jimnoda is lower close to 0 5 in the elevation class 2 fig 5 center the spread between the kge values of the different model chains becomes more pronounced for jimbde the median values are well above 0 6 below 0 6 for jimoi and below 0 5 for jimnoda the spread between the three model chains is even more obvious in the elevation class 3 fig 5 right the median kge values from all analyzed simulations of jimbde are above 0 75 close to 0 6 for jimoi and about 0 4 for jimnoda fig 5 shows that the model efficiencies of jimbde simulations increase with higher mean catchment elevation while those of jimnoda decrease with increasing elevations we see only very small variations in median kge of jimoi simulations with altering catchment elevations furthermore the interquartile range of jimoi is nearly unchanged within the highest catchment class the smallest interquartile range and therefore also the smallest spread between upper and lower whisker is shown by jimbde which suggests a consistently good performance of jimbde for this elevation class 4 5 detection of peakflow events during snowmelt season the performances regarding the detection of peakflow events during all snowmelt seasons are evaluated using the 2afc score fig 6 left panel the overlap of the boxes indicates that the range of performances is similar between the model versions as well as between the different time windows as anticipated the median performances are better if a time window of plus minus twelve hours is applied green borders than if a time window of plus minus three hours around an observed peak is applied red borders no scores below 0 5 occur which indicates that all predictions are better than a random guess could achieve compared to other studies that made use of this performance metric e g fundel et al 2013 sahu et al 2017 and considering the fact that only the validation data had been used for the statistical analysis the median 2afc scores indicate sound predictive skills for both time windows with median values of 0 65 three hours and nearly 0 7 twelve hours jimbde performs better than both jimoi and jimnoda which achieve very close median 2afc values jimoi and jimnoda give also similar results in the bias of discharge during peak events fig 6 right panel within the three hours window the absolute bias is slightly larger than within the 12 h window and the boxes of both time windows mainly overlap median biases for jimnoda 14 3 h and 7 12 h and jimoi 12 3 h and 11 12 h are negative which means that the simulations underestimate the observed discharge during peakflow events for both time windows the median bias of jimbde 1 3 h and 0 5 12 h is close to zero indicating a negligible trend of under or overestimation of discharge amounts during peakflow events 4 6 event analysis differences between the three model versions are particularly notable in the analysis of individual events for demonstration purposes we have selected three challenging snow hydrological events fig 7 note that all data shown are from separate validation periods and have not been used for calibration of the model first a rain on snow event which took place at the end of october 2013 in the southern swiss alps that strongly affected the catchment of the riale di calneggia fig 7 left column during that event the peak of observed discharge is 24 m3 s while the ensemble simulations using the ten best calibration parameter configurtions of jimnoda top gives a maximal discharge of 10 m3 s the maximal discharge of the two other model chains is much closer to the observed maximal value jimbde bottom overestimates the discharge throughout the entire event while jimoi middle slightly underestimates the peak and overestimates the runoff during the second day after the peak event the smallest and largest swi blue lines at top of each graph are coming from jimnoda and jimbde respectively which is also shown in fig 3 illustrating the accumulated swi for this particular event second a precipitation event in april and may 2017 which mainly affected the northern parts of switzerland and the catchment of the river biber central column this precipitation and snowmelt event can be separated into two event parts during the first half of the event all jim simulations underestimate the discharge to some extent and also have a time shift of several hours in particular for jimnoda top and jimoi middle the first peaks occur earlier and up to three times weaker in the ensemble simulations than in the observation during the second half of the event may 6th and later a time shift leads to earlier peaks in the simulations and jimoi underestimates while jimnoda top overestimates the discharge in contrast to the first half here jimbde bottom does not underestimate the discharge this example shows the strength of using the bias detecting approach obviously the bde algorithm detected an underestimation of snow melt and consequently surface water input which it was able to compensate the following days the model corrected for this biases which resulted in an increase in summed swi by 54 the last example for a characteristic snow hydrological event is a series of mainly snowmelt driven runoff events taking place in the dischma catchment in the eastern swiss alps in spring 2015 fig 7 right column accumulated swi of jimbde is 30 higher than swi of jimoi during this event the differences in discharge between the three simulations are small during the first six days and become more pronounced later on similar to the two former events jimoi slightly underestimates the observed discharge also jimnoda shows an underestimation but only during the last four days of the event 5 discussion hydrological simulations require intensive calibration between model input and observed runoff for the streamflow calibrations in this study we calibrated each jim model set up for each of the 25 catchments with observation data from one water year one could argue that the overall good performance of our modeled discharge origins in the three calibration parameters to investigate this we performed a correlation analysis between sub catchment streamflow calibration parameters and sub catchment topographic parameters we found statistically significant correlations between several terrain parameters and the residence time of the upper reservoirs τup s and between one terrain parameter and residence time of the lower reservoirs τlow s among the three different jim model set ups we obtained overall similar statistically significant correlations suggesting that model error compensation is less meaningful in the obtained calibration parameters our results show the impact of recent advances in snow modeling frameworks for hydrological simulations jimbde which was forced with corrected cosmo precipitation data and directly incorporated observations into the modeling framework to modulate both mass and energy forcings outperformed both jimoi and jimnoda this finding is consistent over all catchment elevations and independent of whether an entire water year or the snowmelt season was taken as evaluation period while the model efficiency of jimnoda decreased with increasing elevation jimbde shows better results with increasing elevations this indicates that the reference simulations jimnoda seem to struggle with snow prone conditions at high elevations while this deficit could already be mitigated by oi to improve precipitation forcing fields jimoi furthermore the bde reversed the trend seen with jimnoda and actually led to best performance metrics to be found at high elevation where snowmelt is an important driver of runoff formation here complex snow related processes become more prominent and important for catchment behavior while also meteorological data are less reliable e g schirmer and jamieson 2015 further at mid and high elevations runoff events are largely impacted by changes in snowline altitude tobin et al 2012 marks et al 2013 which is captured by the corrected precipitation data used within jimoi and jimbde similar to our results griessinger et al 2016 found improvements due to da more pronounced at high elevation whereas results presented in andreadis and lettenmeier 2006 indicate the opposite in their case degrading performances of using da at high elevations was explained by the general underestimation of swe for deep snowpacks using the assimilated passive microwave remote sensing data pulliainen and hallikainen 2001 the model performances for late autumn show a very different behavior generally the model behavior is considerably worse in this period and differences between the three sets of model simulations are less conclusive during this time of the year precipitation mostly falls as rain and furthermore errors in nwp are high e g frei et al 2003 under these circumstances neither of the two schemes which integrate external snow observation data helped to improve the performance of the hydrological model which is basically bound to the input data as provided while the kge values seem particularly low note that here the performance was assessed with data at hourly resolution where it is obviously much easier to achieve decent performance metrics if input data and model times step are at daily resolution only e g garen and marks 2005 within this particular season jimbde performs similar to jimnoda whereas jimoi outperforms both the reason for this unexpected behavior of jimbde might be that derived biases in this application are based on simulated and measured snow depths within the last 14 snow days therefore for late autumn seasons spring days are included in the bias history seasonal differences of the benefit of using da methods within hydrological simulations have been reported by clark et al 2006 they made use of snow covered area assimilation and indicated smaller effects on hydrological simulations at the end of the snow melt season which can be partly explained by the relative short time between mainly snow covered and mainly snow free areas within our set up however benefits from assimilating snow station data were particularly pronounced during spring our findings in this study demonstrate the importance of accurate input data for successful applications of energy balance snowmelt models also noted by raleigh et al 2015 to achieve improved forcing data our approaches using external snow observation data benefitted from a dense network of station data note that station records may not necessarily represent average snow conditions of the surrounding area e g grünewald and lehning 2015 however both da frameworks used here jimoi and jimbde employ a flux assimilation scheme which mitigates problems potentially arising from offset station readings magnusson et al 2014 in cases with reduced data availability the degree of improvement might be reduced though other da methods which make use of remotely sensed data as applied by kumar et al 2015 or stigter et al 2017 could potentially compensate or even improve upon the current findings jimnoda and jimoi have similar ability of detecting peak flow events and both consistently underestimate the discharge during these events while the range of model performances is similar between all three methods the median results show that with jimbde the detection rate is higher and no trend of under or overestimation is obvious during the snowmelt season jimbde is able to correct for offsets in the energy balance or in the precipitation data while adjusting to actual meteorological patterns this is evident during the event occurring in may 2017 where several peaks in precipitation snowmelt and runoff were observed over several weeks here bde method aptly adjusted to the changing conditions to improve runoff simulations throughout the period huang et al 2017 found that da improvements are linked to the quality of simulations without da if simulations without da already well captured the hydrological processes of a specific catchment using da could not enhance the performances as much as if the simulations without da had shown poor model quality a more detailed separate evaluation of the bde methods winstral et al 2019 arrived at the same conclusion this suggests that the demonstrated improvements from using oi and bde methods in this study may have been accentuated by the fact that the baseline simulations jimnoda had notable weaknesses particularly for high elevation catchments but given the known biases and errors within nwp and the sensitivity of energy balance snow models to their forcings advanced methods incorporating observation data will remain a useful companion for this type of models particularly when used in operational applications 6 conclusions this study demonstrates that advanced snow modeling frameworks in the context of hydrological modeling of alpine watersheds can improve runoff simulations for this purpose a distributed multi layered energy balance snow model was used these types of snow models are required to accurately assess rain on snow kumar et al 2013 winstral et al 2019 and other conditions that involve processes not accounted for in calibrated parametric approaches dozier 2011 milly et al 2008 different approaches that leveraged snow observations were used to frame a set of physics based snow model simulations with increasing accuracy relative to baseline simulations that did not included the observations to this end we employed two methods available for these types of snow models indirect da and bde that do not violate any of the underlying physical principles such as energy and mass balance conservation at any time our results show that surface water input as calculated by the most advanced model framework used here consistently allowed for the best performance of subsequent hydrological modeling while simulations that did not include observations in the modeling framework had decreasing performance with increasing catchment altitude catchments where the expectation is that snowmelt would increasingly influence hydrology the opposite was true for the model framework when indirect da and bde were included these results were consistent when analyzing performance over entire hydrological years over the snowmelt season only and for individual events i e peak flow analysis as long as a sufficient dense station network covering high elevated areas exists the approach making use of indirect da and bde for energy balance snow model forms a promising tool for discharge simulations of alpine catchments while other studies exist to support our results from the perspective of individual and often extreme events this study is based on data from four hydrological years and 25 catchments spanning a large range of both meteorological and topographical conditions the results of our study may seem intuitive and could be taken for granted but given the enormous challenges involved with using complex energy balance snow models in operational settings it is certainly reassuring that these efforts actually do entail improved streamflow forecasts acknowledgments this study was partly

572,spontaneous imbibition in porous media plays a crucial role in many engineering applications such as enhanced oil recovery and geological carbon dioxide storage in which predicting the imbibition rate is of great importance in this work we contribute to developing a novel dynamic pore network model for spontaneous imbibition in porous media multiform idealized pore elements have been used to represent complex pore spaces so that our model bears the potential to quantitatively predict spontaneous imbibition for a real porous medium a number of case studies have been conducted to test the pore network model we show that the capillary force calculated by the young laplace equation is much smaller than that predicted by the pore network model the former is usually used to estimate the capillary force at the wetting front in the widely used single phase imbibition model we conclude that using the capillary force calculated by the young laplace equation with the mean pore radius notably overestimates the imbibition rate moreover we verify that a sharp wetting front across a few pores is maintained throughout the primary imbibition process which is in consistence with experimental observations keywords spontaneous imbibition pore network model porous media capillary force sharp wetting front single phase imbibition model 1 introduction in porous media research imbibition is the process by which a wetting fluid displaces the defending nonwetting fluid there are two kinds of imbibition processes namely spontaneous imbibition and forced imbibition spontaneous imbibition is driven by capillary action while forced imbibition is driven by an imposed pressure gradient across the media domain imbibition is of importance in numerous applications such as enhanced oil recovery eor gao et al 2018 meng et al 2017 morrow and mason 2001 capillary trapping in geological carbon dioxide storage guo et al 2016 valvatne and blunt 2004 paper sensors elizalde et al 2015 and inkjet printing wijshoff 2018 there has been significant research interest in imbibition in porous media one key topic is to predict the imbibition rate and its dependence on material properties the imbibition rate yields a crucial performance factor in several applications for example in eor the recovery rate and the extent to which oil is displaced from the matrix are key issues morrow and mason 2001 in inkjet printing the imbibition rate of ink needs to be strictly controlled to achieve high printing quality at high throughput spontaneous imbibition of water into a porous medium initially fully filled with air is referred to as wicking by assuming a sharp wetting front and neglecting air viscosity and gravity the penetration depth of liquid water can be given by the single phase darcy model 1 l 2 k 0 p c ε μ w t where ε is the porosity μ w pa s is the water dynamic viscosity k 0 m2 is the intrinsic permeability pc pa is the capillary pressure and t s is the imbibition time if the gravity needs to be included and or the viscosity of the nonwetting phase cannot be neglected the equation for the penetration depth is presented in cai et al 2014 kunz et al 2016 zarandi et al 2018 which can be analytically or numerically solved eq 1 has been tested for different porous materials such as sandstone akin et al 2000 porous al2o3 kuijpers et al 2017 and glass fiber wicks zarandi et al 2018 generally experimental data can be matched by slightly tuning permeability and capillary force except for cases where a sharp wetting front does not hold any more to verify and utilize eq 1 however two fundamental questions still need to be answered one is how to estimate the capillary force i e pc in eq 1 at the wetting front for a given porous medium the other is under which conditions the assumption of a sharp wetting front is acceptable the conditions of interest can be related to material properties heterogeneity and the length scale of the domain under consideration for example in the late stage of capillary rise in a porous medium the flow regime behind the wetting front would switch from single phase to two phase where the sharp wetting front assumption fails zarandi and pillai 2018 also it has been suspected that the sharp front assumption is not acceptable for a thin porous layer experimental data of the imbibition rate is very hard to be obtained for thin porous layers because current measurement techniques have limited spatial and temporal resolution to investigate the above issues pore scale numerical studies of imbibition in porous media are very useful although there are many studies based on direct numerical simulation models such as vof volume of fluid model sph smoothed particle hydrodynamics lbm lattice boltzmann model and nsch navier stokes cahn hilliard phase field models these studies are generally restricted by excessive computational efforts kunz et al 2018 raeini et al 2014 shokrpour roudbari et al 2016 therefore usually a small porous medium has been modelled with favorable wettability settings kunz et al 2016 raeini et al 2014 alternatively dynamic pore network models can be used which are much more computational efficient a literature survey shows that most dynamic pore network models were designed with over simplified pore elements which cannot represent realistic porous structures joekar niasar et al 2010 qin 2015 yin et al 2018 although several dynamic pore network models for two phase imbibition have been reported li et al 2017 tørå et al 2012 wang et al 2015 they were developed for simple network structures in those models all pore volumes are assigned to pore throats phase mixing is assumed in volumeless pore bodies it is hard to extend those models to spontaneous imbibition in real porous media in this work we contribute to developing a new dynamic pore network model for imbibition in porous media we consider complex pore elements with triangular square and circular cross sections in the model and therefore enable a more precise description of realistic porous media than previous pore networks moreover the key mechanism of the competition between main terminal meniscus filling and arc menisci filling in a pore body ma et al 1996 has been rigorously implemented because this mechanism is pivotal in spontaneous imbibition multiform pore elements have been widely used in quasi static pore network models blunt et al 2013 oren et al 1998 patzek 2001 valvatne and blunt 2004 in this context good predictions for capillary pressure and relative permeability were reported however its extension to a dynamic pore network model has remained unexplored to test our model we mainly compare the predictions of the imbibition rate by the pore network model and by eq 1 we show that our pnm can help us verify and improve the single phase darcy model for spontaneous imbibition in porous media the verification of our pore network model against the vof volume of fluid based direct numerical simulation model for spontaneous imbibition in a porous medium of sintered glass beads will be presented elsewhere qin et al 2019 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the pore network model in detail including governing equations constitutive relations and numerical implementation in section 3 we first present a stochastic network generator with pre described structure information of a porous medium in addition the sensitivity of key model parameters to the predicted imbibition rate is discussed we also conduct case studies to test the developed model the discussion of model predictions is provided in section 4 which is followed by main conclusions in section 5 2 pore network model in this section we introduce the dynamic pore network model for spontaneous imbibition in porous media its extension to forced imbibition or drainage processes is straightforward the main assumptions in our pore network model are pore spaces are represented by idealized pore bodies no volume is affiliated with pore throats refer to fig 1 this is consistent with the concept of watershed used in pore network extraction gostick 2017 viscous resistances for wetting and nonwetting phases are distributed in both pore bodies and pore throats wetting and nonwetting phases are incompressible and immiscible the imbibition process is isothermal our pore network model has been developed specifically for granular porous materials such as soil sand and typical sandstones therefore the first model assumption in which we assign all pore volume to pore bodies can be well justified our pore network model is not applicable to porous media with elongated channel type pores such as shales and nano porous vycor glass gruener et al 2012 regarding spontaneous imbibition in those porous media a more diffusive wetting front occurred and front roughening was amplified this is because meniscus arrest may occur at asymmetric pore junctions sadjadi and rieger 2013 2 1 governing equations by virtue of the incompressibility assumption conservation of mass of the two phases translates into conservation of volume the volumetric conservation of each phase in a pore body is given as 2 v i d s i α d t j 1 n i k i j α p i α p j α α n w where i is the pore body index ij is the pore throat index n and w indicate the nonwetting and wetting phases respectively ni is the coordination number of pore body i v m3 is the volume s is the saturation k m3 pa s is the conductivity and p pa is the pressure in this work gravity is neglected with the definition of mixture pressure p p n s n p w s w and adding the two conservation equations together eq 2 for the wetting phase and for the nonwetting phase the pressure equation is derived as qin 2015 3 j 1 n i k i j n k i j w p i p j j 1 n i k i j n s i w k i j w 1 s i w p i c k i j w 1 s j w k i j n s j w p j c where the local capillary pressure in pore body i is defined as pc pn pw it is seen that in a pore body we solve for both nonwetting and wetting pressures which are coupled by the capillary pressure under the assumption of local equilibrium 2 2 constitutive relations and local physical rules 2 2 1 idealized pore elements one of the essential components in the development of a pore network model is to represent the porous medium of interest with proper idealized pore elements i e pore bodies and pore throats the choice of idealized pore elements depends on the type of flow and transport process under study qin et al 2016 further constitutive relations and local physical rules are dependent on the used idealized pore elements here three types of straight tubes of constant cross section as shown in fig 2 are employed to approximate complex porous structures namely tubes with triangular cross section tubes with square cross section and tubes with circular cross section a triangular cross section e g fig 2a can be described by the inscribed circle radius r and two corner half angles β1 β2 the third angle follows from β 3 π 2 β 1 β 2 with the convention of0 β 1 β 2 β 3 π 2 we follow mason and morrow 1991 s shape factor definition as 4 g a p 2 where a m2 is the pore cross sectional area and p m is the perimeter for a triangular cross section its shape factor and three corner half angles are related as 5 g 1 4 tan β 1 tan β 2 cot β 1 β 2 therefore by using tubes with triangular cross section we can have a range of shape factors from 0 to the maximum value of 3 36 the latter corresponding to an equilateral triangle with the same definition of shape factor a tube with square cross section has a shape factor value of 0 0625 and a tube with circular cross section is characterized by a shape factor value of 0 0796 in our model both pore bodies and pore throats are represented by the idealized pore elements described in fig 2 however as mentioned in the first model assumption no volume is assigned to pore throats they are mainly used to account for the flow resistance between neighbouring pore bodies they are not considered in the calibration of porosity furthermore pore throat sizes are crucial to determine the trapping of nonwetting phase in pore bodies 2 2 2 relations of capillary pressure and conductance the details of calculating pore body and pore throat capillary pressure and conductance are presented in appendix a in spontaneous imbibition a pore body exhibits either the main terminal meniscus mtm filling or arc menisci ams filling ma et al 1996 as the ams filling the snap off event may be triggered the used criteria for checking the snap off is given by eq a2 in appendix a for a pore body in the case of the mtm filling for simplicity the conductance of both nonwetting and wetting phases is approximated by the single phase conductance given by eq a3 given the fact that its connected pore throats always account for most of the flow resistance for a volumeless pore throat its capillary pressure is approximated by the capillary pressure in its connected upstream pore body if the mtm filling or the snap off occurs the pore throat is fully filled with the wetting phase instantaneously otherwise the pore throat is occupied by both phases the interface curvature is determined by the capillary pressure in both cases the wetting and nonwetting conductance is given in appendix a the flow conductivity from pore body i to pore body j used in eqs 2 3 is calculated as 6 k i j 1 l i 2 g i l j 2 g j l i j g i j where l is the length m and g m4 pa s is the conductance notice that the superscript α for the phase indicator has been omitted here finally the following inequality is checked for the existence of corner flow 7 β θ π 2 obviously for circular pore elements only the mtm filling is possible for triangular pore elements corners may be partially occupied by the wetting phase 2 2 3 competition of corner flow and main terminal meniscus movement in a pore body the imbibition proceeds via both piston type displacement i e ams filling and the mtm displacement as shown in fig 3 the two processes have quite different time scales which compete each other ponomarenko et al 2011 in the piston type the wetting phase grows from the corners at the pore element scale this is much slower than the mtm filling in spontaneous imbibition the mtm pressure is the same as the entry pressure calculated by equations a1 1 a1 5 based on the ms p method mayer and stowe 1965 princen 1970 1969 in our model if one of the following three conditions is satisfied the mtm filling of the pore body is active the first condition is that corner flow is not possible by checking eq 7 the second condition is that a anyone of its connected pore bodies is with the mtm filling as well as its wetting saturation is larger than 0 5 and b the capillary pressure is larger than the mtm pressure the third condition is that a snap off occurs in any of its connected pore bodies and b the capillary pressure is larger than the mtm pressure here the value of 0 5 in the second condition has been selected in the sense of average our numerical tests show that the imbibition rate is insensitive to this value for the air water system if the sub pore scale movement of the mtm is tracked this empirical value will not be needed we leave it for a further study the same triggering mechanism of the mtm filling applies to a pore throat on the other hand when a dry pore body is being invaded and the ams filling is active a thin pre wetting film is assumed at corners which corresponds to a capillary pressure value of 105 pa this value is selected empirically which may be related to solid surface properties of a porous medium fig 4 shows its effect on the filling rate of a pore body with equilateral triangle cross section during the filling the driving force is the capillary pressure of the swelling menisci it is seen that the filling time to the snap off saturation is very sensitive to the assumed pre wetting film this is because the initial wetting phase conductance is determined by the pre wetting film thickness if only the ams filling is used in the model this parameter is critical to the predicted imbibition rate but in spontaneous imbibition we will show later that the mtm filling is dominant as a result this parameter is insensitive to the predicted imbibition rate in our case studies finally we notice that during the cooperative filling blunt 1997 oren et al 1998 of a complex pore body dynamic variations of capillary pressure are expected the relation between capillary pressure and saturation depends on both the pore structure and the wetting condition of neighbouring pore bodies in our model for an mtm filling pore body the capillary pressure is assumed to be constant equal to its mtm entry pressure however one may qualitatively account for the cooperative filling by dynamically revising the mtm entry pressure this aspect will not be further considered in the present study 2 2 4 trapping assumption a natural porous medium usually has a wide distribution of pore sizes in the imbibition process small pores are filled relatively fast compared to large pores due to larger suction forces the magnitude of the difference in the filling speed is closely related to the flow regime of interest nonetheless for a large pore if its surrounding small pores are filled first this may cut off the escape pathways of the nonwetting phase in the large pore in this case the nonwetting phase is locally trapped significant trapping would result in a low saturation value behind the imbibition front for an air water system several experiments at the mini column scale have shown that the region behind the imbibition front is almost saturated kuijpers et al 2017 zarandi et al 2018 in our pore network model without any special treatment of the trapping of nonwetting phase both imbibition rate and wetting saturation behind the imbibition front will be underestimated this is because all connected pore throats are marked as the mtm filling once the wetting saturation of a mtm filling pore body is over 0 5 as mentioned above the value of 0 5 has been selected in the sense of average in reality at the pore scale phase occupation in a pore throat depends on its location relative to the main meniscus in the pore body inclusion of detailed information of pore throat phase occupation to precluded trapping in pore network models is non trivial and a rigorous treatment is beyond the scope of this work we also tried the remobilization mechanism of the trapped nonwetting phase proposed in joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 however no difference was found when the mtm filling is dominant in this work we simply revise the pore throat gas conductivity as follows if a pore throat is marked as the mtm filling its gas conductivity is calculated as 8 k i j n 1 l i 2 g i n l j 2 g j n l i j v g i j n where g i j n is equal to the single phase conductance and v is the correction coefficient v is set to 1 when both wetting saturation values of its connected pore bodies are smaller than 0 96 this saturation value is the same as that at which the capillary pressure fast approaches zero see fig a2 when the wetting saturation value in either of its connected pore bodies is larger than 0 96 v is set to zero meaning that this pore throat blocks the transport of the nonwetting phase here the value of 0 96 has been empirically selected in order to 1 make this value close to 1 corresponding to a fully saturated pore body and 2 match the wetting saturation behind the wetting front which may be obtained by experiments 2 3 numerical implementation the governing eqs 2 and 3 are numerically solved for the primary variables wetting saturation s i w and mixture pressure p i at the end of each time step the remaining quantities such as capillary pressure and phase conductivity are updated based on the primary variables the discretization of the governing equations has been elaborated in qin 2015 in this work the saturation eq 2 is explicitly solved although a semi implicit scheme may stabilize the numerical model it causes mass imbalance joekar niasar et al 2010 qin 2015 further a first order differential function of capillary pressure with respect to the wetting saturation needs to be fitted which is cumbersome for imbibition with complex pore elements the local time interval needed to fully drain or fill a pore body is given by 9 δ t i v i q i w 1 s i w f o r l o c a l i m b i b i t i o n q i w 0 v i q i w s i w f o r l o c a l d r a i n a g e q i w 0 where q i w m3 s is the total flow rate of the wetting phase in out pore body i the standard time step is subsequently obtained as the minimum of the local time intervals we conducted a sensitivity study of the imbibition rate on the time step it shows minor influence this is because in our case studies the mtm filling is dominant however at the late stage of spontaneous imbibition when the ams filling plays a role a large time step may overestimate the imbibition rate due to the used explicit scheme for the saturation equation in all case studies we have used half of the minimum of the local time intervals as our time step finally to prevent infinitesimal time step values we truncate the wetting saturation in a pore body as follows when s i w is smaller than 10 6 we set s i w 0 when 1 s i w is smaller than 10 6 we set s i w 1 3 case studies 3 1 network generation we generate a three dimensional pore network representing a homogeneous porous medium by means of the following six step procedure first a given number of pore bodies are generated which have truncated lognormal distributions of inscribed radius shape factor and length second conforming to a given porosity value and the total volume of generated pore bodies the domain dimensions are determined third the ordered pore bodies in size are randomly distributed into the domain in such a manner that overlaps are prevented fourth a pre described searching length for each pore is used to construct the pore throats fifth an elimination process is conducted pore throats are randomly eliminated according to a pre described probability sixth all pore bodies which are not connected with the outlet pores are deleted the inscribed radius of a pore throat size is estimated by 10 r i j γ n 1 γ min r i r j where γ is the ratio of pore throat size to the smaller size of its two connected pore bodies n is a random number between 0 and 1 the pore throat length is calculated by 11 l i j l i j r i e q r j e q where lij is the center distance between the two pore bodies and r i e q and r j e q are the equivalent radii as spherical pore bodies the pore throat shape factor is estimated by the average value of its two connected pore bodies we notice that it may underestimate the permeability of a real porous media by idealized pore bodies therefore we could tune pore throat lengths to match the permeability given the fact that pore throats are volumeless in our concept of the pore network as illustrated in fig 1 fig 5 shows the 10 10 10 network used in our case studies as well as the pore size and shape factor distributions the network contains 55 pore bodies of square cross section 11 ones of circular cross section and 934 ones of triangular cross section table 1 presents detailed information of the network in addition to the physical parameters used in the imbibition modeling 3 2 sensitivity study of model parameters to the predicted imbibition rate a few empirical settings are required in the developed pore network model here we discuss and show the sensitivity study of two main ones the trapping correction coefficient v in eq 8 and the transition function used to force capillary pressure to zero at the end of the mtm filling fig a2 as mentioned in section 2 2 4 for a pore throat we set v to zero when the wetting saturation in either of the connected pore bodies is larger than 0 96 this refers to the case studies of trapping of air in this work on the other hand it is interesting to test the scenario in which the trapping of air due to the topology of porous structures is neglected this corresponds to always setting v to 1 this refers to the case studies of no trapping of air the pore network and associated physical parameters listed in table 1 are used in the sensitivity study pressure is set to zero in both inlet wetting and outlet nonwetting reservoirs when wetting breakthrough occurs the gradient of capillary pressure is set to zero at the outlet initially the network is saturated with the nonwetting phase i e air fig 6 a shows the effect of the nonwetting trapping on the imbibition rate it is seen that the imbibition rate reduces considerably due to the trapping of air which blocks wetting phase pathways at the rev scale the trapping of air reduces the relative permeability of the wetting phase at the same time as expected the region behind the imbibition front is less saturated in the case of trapping of air as shown in fig 6b severe trapping of air is found for the used stochastically constructed pore network however for a real porous medium its distribution of pores is more or less correlated so that only a small amount of air can be trapped qin et al 2019 although the stochastically constructed pore network see fig 5 has been used throughout this work it does not impact our understanding of the developed imbibition model the modeling of a real porous medium by our pore network model can be found in qin et al 2019 when a pore body is close to be fully filled by the wetting phase a transition function is needed to force the capillary pressure to approach zero three functions are tested here which are plotted in fig a2 type 1 is of exponential form type 2 has relatively slower switch to zero capillary pressure type 3 is of linear form fig 7 shows the influence of the transition function on the predicted imbibition rate for the case with no trapping of air and the case with trapping of air overall the difference of the predicted imbibition rate is minor between type 1 and type 2 as expected a linear transition i e type 3 would slow down the imbibition which is much more pronounced for the case with trapping of air as shown in fig 7b 3 3 results in this section we present the results of the case studies under different static contact angle values and inlet wetting reservoir pressures the same numerical settings as in the sensitivity study are used the transition function of type 1 is used fig 8 shows the distribution of slope values for the curve s t when no trapping of air is assumed fig 8a one can observe that the slope increases to a peak value then decreases a little bit to an average value of around 14 the slope decreases fast in the final stage due to the outlet effect the slight variation of the slope value is caused by the fact that the network size is not large enough to reach the rev representative elementary volume fig 8a also conveys that the network saturation is essentially linearly proportional to t except at the beginning and ending parts similar observations hold when considering the trapping of air as shown in fig 8b except that with time the peak slope value continues to decrease to a value of around 7 this indicates that the inlet effect influences a larger domain compared to the case in fig 8a furthermore the wetting front needs to travel a much longer distance to reach a constant imbibition rate which we have confirmed for a larger pore network of 10 10 50 material wettability plays a crucial role in spontaneous imbibition such wettability is usually characterized by the static contact angle for a real porous medium due to surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity the advancing and receding contact angle values may considerably deviate from the static one forsberg et al 2010 in this work we simulate the primary imbibition therefore the contact angle used in our pnm can be regarded as an apparent advancing contact angle what is more we assume that any pinning effect due to sharp edges and solid wall roughness at the sub pore scale can be accounted for by properly revising the contact angle in our model our model can in principle handle non uniform wettability but in this work we restrict our studies to spontaneous imbibition in porous media with uniform wettability fig 9 a shows the imbibition rates for four different contact angle values as expected the imbibition process slows down considerably with a large contact angle value of 80 fig 9b shows the corresponding slope value distributions with respect to the network saturation the profiles corresponding to the different contact angle values are very similar in shape for the single phase darcy model see eq 1 the capillary pressure is usually estimated by the young laplace equation as p c 2 σ cos θ r where σ is the surface tension and r is the mean pore size here we check if the imbibition rate slope s t can be scaled by cos θ in fig 10 we scale the slope values with the contact angle values of 40 60 and 80 to the case with the contact angle value of 20 it is seen that the four curves almost overlap we conclude that under the assumption of uniform wettability the imbibition rate scales with cos θ fig 11 a shows the imbibition rates under three different inlet wetting reservoir pressure values namely 2000 pa 0 pa and 3000 pa when a positive pressure value of 2000 pa of the inlet wetting reservoir is imposed the imbibition rate is enhanced the enhancement is slight because the imposed pressure value is much smaller than the suction force of a pore body of the mean pore size 20 µm when a relatively small negative pressure value of 3000 is imposed we see that the imbibition process slows down considerably this is mainly because large pores with smaller entry capillary pressure than 3000 pa cannot be invaded by the wetting phase this case may resemble a late stage of the capillary rise in porous media fig 11b shows the corresponding slope value distributions it is seen that the three distribution profiles are similar expect that the medium is least wetted under the inlet pressure of 3000 pa 4 discussion we have shown the details of the case studies of a small pore network of 10 10 10 which can be seen as part of a thin porous layer qin and hassanizadeh 2014 for spontaneous imbibition the saturation slope value behaves relatively constant with different contact angle values to address the first question of how to estimate the capillary force at the wetting front here we compare the predictions of the imbibition rate by our pnm and eq 1 to use eq 1 the assumption of a sharp wetting front should be valid this will be proved later on for a larger network of 20 20 20 to obtain the temporal network saturation we reformulate eq 1 as follows with the assumption of a sharp wetting front and an assumed front wetting saturation sf the analytical solution of the network saturation with respect to the square root of the imbibition time is given by 12 s 2 k p c s f ε μ d 2 t where d is the length of the network and 2 k p c s f ε μ d 2 is the slope the permeability is approximated by k k 0 sf 3 the capillary pressure at the wetting front is approximated by p c 2 σ cos θ r m when the trapping of air is neglected with the intrinsic permeability of 7 darcy calculated by the pnm and an assumed front saturation value of 0 96 the slope value in eq 12 is approximately 19 s 1 2 the mean pore size is often used in the calculation of capillary pressure because it can be obtained by mercury intrusion measurement if we further consider a pore body with triangular cross section its inscribed radius is equal to rm the shape factor is 0 03 which is the mean shape factor of the pore network for a given contact angle value of 20 based on 100 realizations of a triangle with the shape factor of 0 03 the effective mean pore radius is obtained as r m 1 216 r m it can be used by the young laplace equation to estimate the capillary pressure at the wetting front notice that the difference between the mean pore size and the effective one decreases as the increase of the contact angle fig 12 shows the comparison of the three predicted imbibition curves it is seen that eq 12 notably overestimates the imbibition rate by using either the mean pore size or the effective one the slope value is overestimated by around 36 when the mean pore size is used this indicates that the calculation of the capillary pressure with the mean pore size needs to be corrected in this case by a factor of around 0 54 i e p c 0 54 2 σ cos θ r m it is expected that this correction factor depends on the pore size distribution and pore space topology of a porous medium by using the effective mean pore size in eq 12 the discrepancy from the pnm prediction will be slightly reduced however for obtaining the mean shape factor of a porous medium extensive image analysis needs to be conducted fig 13 shows the capillary pressure versus the network saturation obtained from the pore network modeling for the case with no trapping of air and the case with trapping of air it is seen that the capillary pressure keeps almost constant in both cases moreover trapping of air slightly reduces the capillary pressure for the case with no trapping of air the capillary pressure is around 4200 pa throughout the imbibition process this again proves that the capillary pressure calculated by the young laplace equation with the mean pore size is drastically overestimated moreover the capillary pressure of 4200 pa is close to the one of 3704 pa calculated by p c 0 54 2 σ cos θ r m the difference between the two values could be attributed to 1 the approximation of water relative permeability and 2 the scale effect e g for the used small network sf would be overestimated in reference zarandi et al 2018 the authors report that the analytical model over predicts the wicked height in their capillary rise experiments however as time progresses the model prediction curve asymptotically merges with the experimental points if one attributes this observation to an overestimated capillary force in their model it is obvious that the discrepancy decreases as gravity is playing a more and more important role in the capillary rise to verify the assumption of a sharp wetting front we consider a larger pore network we simulate the spontaneous imbibition in a 20 20 20 pore network the same distribution functions as used in the 10 10 10 network for pore size shape factor and pore length are used the trapping of air is neglected here fig 14 shows snapshots of water distribution in the network and the profiles of the cross sectional saturation values along the flow direction the snapshots show that a quite sharp wetting front advances however if we define the wetting front by the region where the cross sectional saturation value is smaller than 0 9 the wetting front or front roughening still spans several pores along the flow direction it is worth noting that our pnm would numerically smear the wetting front to some extent in other words the real front would be even sharper than the pnm prediction further the growth of the roughness is indiscernible in fig 12 experimental results kuijpers et al 2017 also show that a sharp wetting front is maintained during the imbibition along significant distances finally we discuss about further improvements of the present model first an advanced trapping model needs to be developed this is particularly important for highly viscous nonwetting phases such as in a water oil system because the mtm filling is dominant in spontaneous imbibition the relative positions of pore throats to the connected pore body need to be used to determine the situation of phase occupancy in each pore throat in other words details of the mtm movement in a pore body need to be tracked second the cooperative filling of a pore body should be implemented by properly revising the mtm pressure in the pore body 5 conclusions in this work we have developed a novel dynamic pore network model pnm for spontaneous imbibition in porous media complex pore elements are used to represent pore spaces which allow our model to quantitatively predict a real porous medium furthermore we implement the competition mechanism between the main terminal meniscus mtm filling and the arc menisci ams filling of a pore body which is crucial in spontaneous imbibition this model enables simulation of a wide range of imbibition processes including versatile settings of boundary conditions and material properties our model can be used to efficiently evaluate the imbibition capacity of a porous medium which may be difficult and expensive to be obtained by experiments a number of case studies have been conducted to testify the pnm we shed light on the estimation of capillary force at the wetting front we found that the capillary pressure calculated by the young laplace equation with the mean pore size notably overestimates the imbibition rate for the pore network used in this study the imbibition rate is overestimated by 36 when air trapping is neglected we also observed that a sharp wetting front across a few pores maintains and travels through the domain under the assumption of uniform wettability the imbibition rate can scale with cos θ where θ is the static contact angle finally the verification of the present dynamic pore network model against direct numerical simulations of spontaneous imbibition in a porous medium of sintered glass beads is presented in the follow up paper qin et al 2019 declaration of competing interest we

pressure there are two imbibition mechanisms ma et al 1996 for a pore body namely filling from arc menisci ams and the main terminal meniscus mtm for the mtm filling the capillary pressure i e the entry pressure will keep constant as the increase of wetting saturation until a pre set value of saturation is reached in this work we set it to 0 96 then a transition function of the wetting saturation is used to force the capillary pressure to fast approach zero fig a2 shows three types of functions the type 1 is primarily used in this work the capillary entry pressure during the imbibition is calculated by the following nonlinear equations based on the ms p theory mayer and stowe 1965 patzek 2001 princen 1969 a1 1 r a e f f l n w l n s cos θ a1 2 a e f f a r 2 i 1 n cos θ cos

572,spontaneous imbibition in porous media plays a crucial role in many engineering applications such as enhanced oil recovery and geological carbon dioxide storage in which predicting the imbibition rate is of great importance in this work we contribute to developing a novel dynamic pore network model for spontaneous imbibition in porous media multiform idealized pore elements have been used to represent complex pore spaces so that our model bears the potential to quantitatively predict spontaneous imbibition for a real porous medium a number of case studies have been conducted to test the pore network model we show that the capillary force calculated by the young laplace equation is much smaller than that predicted by the pore network model the former is usually used to estimate the capillary force at the wetting front in the widely used single phase imbibition model we conclude that using the capillary force calculated by the young laplace equation with the mean pore radius notably overestimates the imbibition rate moreover we verify that a sharp wetting front across a few pores is maintained throughout the primary imbibition process which is in consistence with experimental observations keywords spontaneous imbibition pore network model porous media capillary force sharp wetting front single phase imbibition model 1 introduction in porous media research imbibition is the process by which a wetting fluid displaces the defending nonwetting fluid there are two kinds of imbibition processes namely spontaneous imbibition and forced imbibition spontaneous imbibition is driven by capillary action while forced imbibition is driven by an imposed pressure gradient across the media domain imbibition is of importance in numerous applications such as enhanced oil recovery eor gao et al 2018 meng et al 2017 morrow and mason 2001 capillary trapping in geological carbon dioxide storage guo et al 2016 valvatne and blunt 2004 paper sensors elizalde et al 2015 and inkjet printing wijshoff 2018 there has been significant research interest in imbibition in porous media one key topic is to predict the imbibition rate and its dependence on material properties the imbibition rate yields a crucial performance factor in several applications for example in eor the recovery rate and the extent to which oil is displaced from the matrix are key issues morrow and mason 2001 in inkjet printing the imbibition rate of ink needs to be strictly controlled to achieve high printing quality at high throughput spontaneous imbibition of water into a porous medium initially fully filled with air is referred to as wicking by assuming a sharp wetting front and neglecting air viscosity and gravity the penetration depth of liquid water can be given by the single phase darcy model 1 l 2 k 0 p c ε μ w t where ε is the porosity μ w pa s is the water dynamic viscosity k 0 m2 is the intrinsic permeability pc pa is the capillary pressure and t s is the imbibition time if the gravity needs to be included and or the viscosity of the nonwetting phase cannot be neglected the equation for the penetration depth is presented in cai et al 2014 kunz et al 2016 zarandi et al 2018 which can be analytically or numerically solved eq 1 has been tested for different porous materials such as sandstone akin et al 2000 porous al2o3 kuijpers et al 2017 and glass fiber wicks zarandi et al 2018 generally experimental data can be matched by slightly tuning permeability and capillary force except for cases where a sharp wetting front does not hold any more to verify and utilize eq 1 however two fundamental questions still need to be answered one is how to estimate the capillary force i e pc in eq 1 at the wetting front for a given porous medium the other is under which conditions the assumption of a sharp wetting front is acceptable the conditions of interest can be related to material properties heterogeneity and the length scale of the domain under consideration for example in the late stage of capillary rise in a porous medium the flow regime behind the wetting front would switch from single phase to two phase where the sharp wetting front assumption fails zarandi and pillai 2018 also it has been suspected that the sharp front assumption is not acceptable for a thin porous layer experimental data of the imbibition rate is very hard to be obtained for thin porous layers because current measurement techniques have limited spatial and temporal resolution to investigate the above issues pore scale numerical studies of imbibition in porous media are very useful although there are many studies based on direct numerical simulation models such as vof volume of fluid model sph smoothed particle hydrodynamics lbm lattice boltzmann model and nsch navier stokes cahn hilliard phase field models these studies are generally restricted by excessive computational efforts kunz et al 2018 raeini et al 2014 shokrpour roudbari et al 2016 therefore usually a small porous medium has been modelled with favorable wettability settings kunz et al 2016 raeini et al 2014 alternatively dynamic pore network models can be used which are much more computational efficient a literature survey shows that most dynamic pore network models were designed with over simplified pore elements which cannot represent realistic porous structures joekar niasar et al 2010 qin 2015 yin et al 2018 although several dynamic pore network models for two phase imbibition have been reported li et al 2017 tørå et al 2012 wang et al 2015 they were developed for simple network structures in those models all pore volumes are assigned to pore throats phase mixing is assumed in volumeless pore bodies it is hard to extend those models to spontaneous imbibition in real porous media in this work we contribute to developing a new dynamic pore network model for imbibition in porous media we consider complex pore elements with triangular square and circular cross sections in the model and therefore enable a more precise description of realistic porous media than previous pore networks moreover the key mechanism of the competition between main terminal meniscus filling and arc menisci filling in a pore body ma et al 1996 has been rigorously implemented because this mechanism is pivotal in spontaneous imbibition multiform pore elements have been widely used in quasi static pore network models blunt et al 2013 oren et al 1998 patzek 2001 valvatne and blunt 2004 in this context good predictions for capillary pressure and relative permeability were reported however its extension to a dynamic pore network model has remained unexplored to test our model we mainly compare the predictions of the imbibition rate by the pore network model and by eq 1 we show that our pnm can help us verify and improve the single phase darcy model for spontaneous imbibition in porous media the verification of our pore network model against the vof volume of fluid based direct numerical simulation model for spontaneous imbibition in a porous medium of sintered glass beads will be presented elsewhere qin et al 2019 the remainder of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the pore network model in detail including governing equations constitutive relations and numerical implementation in section 3 we first present a stochastic network generator with pre described structure information of a porous medium in addition the sensitivity of key model parameters to the predicted imbibition rate is discussed we also conduct case studies to test the developed model the discussion of model predictions is provided in section 4 which is followed by main conclusions in section 5 2 pore network model in this section we introduce the dynamic pore network model for spontaneous imbibition in porous media its extension to forced imbibition or drainage processes is straightforward the main assumptions in our pore network model are pore spaces are represented by idealized pore bodies no volume is affiliated with pore throats refer to fig 1 this is consistent with the concept of watershed used in pore network extraction gostick 2017 viscous resistances for wetting and nonwetting phases are distributed in both pore bodies and pore throats wetting and nonwetting phases are incompressible and immiscible the imbibition process is isothermal our pore network model has been developed specifically for granular porous materials such as soil sand and typical sandstones therefore the first model assumption in which we assign all pore volume to pore bodies can be well justified our pore network model is not applicable to porous media with elongated channel type pores such as shales and nano porous vycor glass gruener et al 2012 regarding spontaneous imbibition in those porous media a more diffusive wetting front occurred and front roughening was amplified this is because meniscus arrest may occur at asymmetric pore junctions sadjadi and rieger 2013 2 1 governing equations by virtue of the incompressibility assumption conservation of mass of the two phases translates into conservation of volume the volumetric conservation of each phase in a pore body is given as 2 v i d s i α d t j 1 n i k i j α p i α p j α α n w where i is the pore body index ij is the pore throat index n and w indicate the nonwetting and wetting phases respectively ni is the coordination number of pore body i v m3 is the volume s is the saturation k m3 pa s is the conductivity and p pa is the pressure in this work gravity is neglected with the definition of mixture pressure p p n s n p w s w and adding the two conservation equations together eq 2 for the wetting phase and for the nonwetting phase the pressure equation is derived as qin 2015 3 j 1 n i k i j n k i j w p i p j j 1 n i k i j n s i w k i j w 1 s i w p i c k i j w 1 s j w k i j n s j w p j c where the local capillary pressure in pore body i is defined as pc pn pw it is seen that in a pore body we solve for both nonwetting and wetting pressures which are coupled by the capillary pressure under the assumption of local equilibrium 2 2 constitutive relations and local physical rules 2 2 1 idealized pore elements one of the essential components in the development of a pore network model is to represent the porous medium of interest with proper idealized pore elements i e pore bodies and pore throats the choice of idealized pore elements depends on the type of flow and transport process under study qin et al 2016 further constitutive relations and local physical rules are dependent on the used idealized pore elements here three types of straight tubes of constant cross section as shown in fig 2 are employed to approximate complex porous structures namely tubes with triangular cross section tubes with square cross section and tubes with circular cross section a triangular cross section e g fig 2a can be described by the inscribed circle radius r and two corner half angles β1 β2 the third angle follows from β 3 π 2 β 1 β 2 with the convention of0 β 1 β 2 β 3 π 2 we follow mason and morrow 1991 s shape factor definition as 4 g a p 2 where a m2 is the pore cross sectional area and p m is the perimeter for a triangular cross section its shape factor and three corner half angles are related as 5 g 1 4 tan β 1 tan β 2 cot β 1 β 2 therefore by using tubes with triangular cross section we can have a range of shape factors from 0 to the maximum value of 3 36 the latter corresponding to an equilateral triangle with the same definition of shape factor a tube with square cross section has a shape factor value of 0 0625 and a tube with circular cross section is characterized by a shape factor value of 0 0796 in our model both pore bodies and pore throats are represented by the idealized pore elements described in fig 2 however as mentioned in the first model assumption no volume is assigned to pore throats they are mainly used to account for the flow resistance between neighbouring pore bodies they are not considered in the calibration of porosity furthermore pore throat sizes are crucial to determine the trapping of nonwetting phase in pore bodies 2 2 2 relations of capillary pressure and conductance the details of calculating pore body and pore throat capillary pressure and conductance are presented in appendix a in spontaneous imbibition a pore body exhibits either the main terminal meniscus mtm filling or arc menisci ams filling ma et al 1996 as the ams filling the snap off event may be triggered the used criteria for checking the snap off is given by eq a2 in appendix a for a pore body in the case of the mtm filling for simplicity the conductance of both nonwetting and wetting phases is approximated by the single phase conductance given by eq a3 given the fact that its connected pore throats always account for most of the flow resistance for a volumeless pore throat its capillary pressure is approximated by the capillary pressure in its connected upstream pore body if the mtm filling or the snap off occurs the pore throat is fully filled with the wetting phase instantaneously otherwise the pore throat is occupied by both phases the interface curvature is determined by the capillary pressure in both cases the wetting and nonwetting conductance is given in appendix a the flow conductivity from pore body i to pore body j used in eqs 2 3 is calculated as 6 k i j 1 l i 2 g i l j 2 g j l i j g i j where l is the length m and g m4 pa s is the conductance notice that the superscript α for the phase indicator has been omitted here finally the following inequality is checked for the existence of corner flow 7 β θ π 2 obviously for circular pore elements only the mtm filling is possible for triangular pore elements corners may be partially occupied by the wetting phase 2 2 3 competition of corner flow and main terminal meniscus movement in a pore body the imbibition proceeds via both piston type displacement i e ams filling and the mtm displacement as shown in fig 3 the two processes have quite different time scales which compete each other ponomarenko et al 2011 in the piston type the wetting phase grows from the corners at the pore element scale this is much slower than the mtm filling in spontaneous imbibition the mtm pressure is the same as the entry pressure calculated by equations a1 1 a1 5 based on the ms p method mayer and stowe 1965 princen 1970 1969 in our model if one of the following three conditions is satisfied the mtm filling of the pore body is active the first condition is that corner flow is not possible by checking eq 7 the second condition is that a anyone of its connected pore bodies is with the mtm filling as well as its wetting saturation is larger than 0 5 and b the capillary pressure is larger than the mtm pressure the third condition is that a snap off occurs in any of its connected pore bodies and b the capillary pressure is larger than the mtm pressure here the value of 0 5 in the second condition has been selected in the sense of average our numerical tests show that the imbibition rate is insensitive to this value for the air water system if the sub pore scale movement of the mtm is tracked this empirical value will not be needed we leave it for a further study the same triggering mechanism of the mtm filling applies to a pore throat on the other hand when a dry pore body is being invaded and the ams filling is active a thin pre wetting film is assumed at corners which corresponds to a capillary pressure value of 105 pa this value is selected empirically which may be related to solid surface properties of a porous medium fig 4 shows its effect on the filling rate of a pore body with equilateral triangle cross section during the filling the driving force is the capillary pressure of the swelling menisci it is seen that the filling time to the snap off saturation is very sensitive to the assumed pre wetting film this is because the initial wetting phase conductance is determined by the pre wetting film thickness if only the ams filling is used in the model this parameter is critical to the predicted imbibition rate but in spontaneous imbibition we will show later that the mtm filling is dominant as a result this parameter is insensitive to the predicted imbibition rate in our case studies finally we notice that during the cooperative filling blunt 1997 oren et al 1998 of a complex pore body dynamic variations of capillary pressure are expected the relation between capillary pressure and saturation depends on both the pore structure and the wetting condition of neighbouring pore bodies in our model for an mtm filling pore body the capillary pressure is assumed to be constant equal to its mtm entry pressure however one may qualitatively account for the cooperative filling by dynamically revising the mtm entry pressure this aspect will not be further considered in the present study 2 2 4 trapping assumption a natural porous medium usually has a wide distribution of pore sizes in the imbibition process small pores are filled relatively fast compared to large pores due to larger suction forces the magnitude of the difference in the filling speed is closely related to the flow regime of interest nonetheless for a large pore if its surrounding small pores are filled first this may cut off the escape pathways of the nonwetting phase in the large pore in this case the nonwetting phase is locally trapped significant trapping would result in a low saturation value behind the imbibition front for an air water system several experiments at the mini column scale have shown that the region behind the imbibition front is almost saturated kuijpers et al 2017 zarandi et al 2018 in our pore network model without any special treatment of the trapping of nonwetting phase both imbibition rate and wetting saturation behind the imbibition front will be underestimated this is because all connected pore throats are marked as the mtm filling once the wetting saturation of a mtm filling pore body is over 0 5 as mentioned above the value of 0 5 has been selected in the sense of average in reality at the pore scale phase occupation in a pore throat depends on its location relative to the main meniscus in the pore body inclusion of detailed information of pore throat phase occupation to precluded trapping in pore network models is non trivial and a rigorous treatment is beyond the scope of this work we also tried the remobilization mechanism of the trapped nonwetting phase proposed in joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 however no difference was found when the mtm filling is dominant in this work we simply revise the pore throat gas conductivity as follows if a pore throat is marked as the mtm filling its gas conductivity is calculated as 8 k i j n 1 l i 2 g i n l j 2 g j n l i j v g i j n where g i j n is equal to the single phase conductance and v is the correction coefficient v is set to 1 when both wetting saturation values of its connected pore bodies are smaller than 0 96 this saturation value is the same as that at which the capillary pressure fast approaches zero see fig a2 when the wetting saturation value in either of its connected pore bodies is larger than 0 96 v is set to zero meaning that this pore throat blocks the transport of the nonwetting phase here the value of 0 96 has been empirically selected in order to 1 make this value close to 1 corresponding to a fully saturated pore body and 2 match the wetting saturation behind the wetting front which may be obtained by experiments 2 3 numerical implementation the governing eqs 2 and 3 are numerically solved for the primary variables wetting saturation s i w and mixture pressure p i at the end of each time step the remaining quantities such as capillary pressure and phase conductivity are updated based on the primary variables the discretization of the governing equations has been elaborated in qin 2015 in this work the saturation eq 2 is explicitly solved although a semi implicit scheme may stabilize the numerical model it causes mass imbalance joekar niasar et al 2010 qin 2015 further a first order differential function of capillary pressure with respect to the wetting saturation needs to be fitted which is cumbersome for imbibition with complex pore elements the local time interval needed to fully drain or fill a pore body is given by 9 δ t i v i q i w 1 s i w f o r l o c a l i m b i b i t i o n q i w 0 v i q i w s i w f o r l o c a l d r a i n a g e q i w 0 where q i w m3 s is the total flow rate of the wetting phase in out pore body i the standard time step is subsequently obtained as the minimum of the local time intervals we conducted a sensitivity study of the imbibition rate on the time step it shows minor influence this is because in our case studies the mtm filling is dominant however at the late stage of spontaneous imbibition when the ams filling plays a role a large time step may overestimate the imbibition rate due to the used explicit scheme for the saturation equation in all case studies we have used half of the minimum of the local time intervals as our time step finally to prevent infinitesimal time step values we truncate the wetting saturation in a pore body as follows when s i w is smaller than 10 6 we set s i w 0 when 1 s i w is smaller than 10 6 we set s i w 1 3 case studies 3 1 network generation we generate a three dimensional pore network representing a homogeneous porous medium by means of the following six step procedure first a given number of pore bodies are generated which have truncated lognormal distributions of inscribed radius shape factor and length second conforming to a given porosity value and the total volume of generated pore bodies the domain dimensions are determined third the ordered pore bodies in size are randomly distributed into the domain in such a manner that overlaps are prevented fourth a pre described searching length for each pore is used to construct the pore throats fifth an elimination process is conducted pore throats are randomly eliminated according to a pre described probability sixth all pore bodies which are not connected with the outlet pores are deleted the inscribed radius of a pore throat size is estimated by 10 r i j γ n 1 γ min r i r j where γ is the ratio of pore throat size to the smaller size of its two connected pore bodies n is a random number between 0 and 1 the pore throat length is calculated by 11 l i j l i j r i e q r j e q where lij is the center distance between the two pore bodies and r i e q and r j e q are the equivalent radii as spherical pore bodies the pore throat shape factor is estimated by the average value of its two connected pore bodies we notice that it may underestimate the permeability of a real porous media by idealized pore bodies therefore we could tune pore throat lengths to match the permeability given the fact that pore throats are volumeless in our concept of the pore network as illustrated in fig 1 fig 5 shows the 10 10 10 network used in our case studies as well as the pore size and shape factor distributions the network contains 55 pore bodies of square cross section 11 ones of circular cross section and 934 ones of triangular cross section table 1 presents detailed information of the network in addition to the physical parameters used in the imbibition modeling 3 2 sensitivity study of model parameters to the predicted imbibition rate a few empirical settings are required in the developed pore network model here we discuss and show the sensitivity study of two main ones the trapping correction coefficient v in eq 8 and the transition function used to force capillary pressure to zero at the end of the mtm filling fig a2 as mentioned in section 2 2 4 for a pore throat we set v to zero when the wetting saturation in either of the connected pore bodies is larger than 0 96 this refers to the case studies of trapping of air in this work on the other hand it is interesting to test the scenario in which the trapping of air due to the topology of porous structures is neglected this corresponds to always setting v to 1 this refers to the case studies of no trapping of air the pore network and associated physical parameters listed in table 1 are used in the sensitivity study pressure is set to zero in both inlet wetting and outlet nonwetting reservoirs when wetting breakthrough occurs the gradient of capillary pressure is set to zero at the outlet initially the network is saturated with the nonwetting phase i e air fig 6 a shows the effect of the nonwetting trapping on the imbibition rate it is seen that the imbibition rate reduces considerably due to the trapping of air which blocks wetting phase pathways at the rev scale the trapping of air reduces the relative permeability of the wetting phase at the same time as expected the region behind the imbibition front is less saturated in the case of trapping of air as shown in fig 6b severe trapping of air is found for the used stochastically constructed pore network however for a real porous medium its distribution of pores is more or less correlated so that only a small amount of air can be trapped qin et al 2019 although the stochastically constructed pore network see fig 5 has been used throughout this work it does not impact our understanding of the developed imbibition model the modeling of a real porous medium by our pore network model can be found in qin et al 2019 when a pore body is close to be fully filled by the wetting phase a transition function is needed to force the capillary pressure to approach zero three functions are tested here which are plotted in fig a2 type 1 is of exponential form type 2 has relatively slower switch to zero capillary pressure type 3 is of linear form fig 7 shows the influence of the transition function on the predicted imbibition rate for the case with no trapping of air and the case with trapping of air overall the difference of the predicted imbibition rate is minor between type 1 and type 2 as expected a linear transition i e type 3 would slow down the imbibition which is much more pronounced for the case with trapping of air as shown in fig 7b 3 3 results in this section we present the results of the case studies under different static contact angle values and inlet wetting reservoir pressures the same numerical settings as in the sensitivity study are used the transition function of type 1 is used fig 8 shows the distribution of slope values for the curve s t when no trapping of air is assumed fig 8a one can observe that the slope increases to a peak value then decreases a little bit to an average value of around 14 the slope decreases fast in the final stage due to the outlet effect the slight variation of the slope value is caused by the fact that the network size is not large enough to reach the rev representative elementary volume fig 8a also conveys that the network saturation is essentially linearly proportional to t except at the beginning and ending parts similar observations hold when considering the trapping of air as shown in fig 8b except that with time the peak slope value continues to decrease to a value of around 7 this indicates that the inlet effect influences a larger domain compared to the case in fig 8a furthermore the wetting front needs to travel a much longer distance to reach a constant imbibition rate which we have confirmed for a larger pore network of 10 10 50 material wettability plays a crucial role in spontaneous imbibition such wettability is usually characterized by the static contact angle for a real porous medium due to surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity the advancing and receding contact angle values may considerably deviate from the static one forsberg et al 2010 in this work we simulate the primary imbibition therefore the contact angle used in our pnm can be regarded as an apparent advancing contact angle what is more we assume that any pinning effect due to sharp edges and solid wall roughness at the sub pore scale can be accounted for by properly revising the contact angle in our model our model can in principle handle non uniform wettability but in this work we restrict our studies to spontaneous imbibition in porous media with uniform wettability fig 9 a shows the imbibition rates for four different contact angle values as expected the imbibition process slows down considerably with a large contact angle value of 80 fig 9b shows the corresponding slope value distributions with respect to the network saturation the profiles corresponding to the different contact angle values are very similar in shape for the single phase darcy model see eq 1 the capillary pressure is usually estimated by the young laplace equation as p c 2 σ cos θ r where σ is the surface tension and r is the mean pore size here we check if the imbibition rate slope s t can be scaled by cos θ in fig 10 we scale the slope values with the contact angle values of 40 60 and 80 to the case with the contact angle value of 20 it is seen that the four curves almost overlap we conclude that under the assumption of uniform wettability the imbibition rate scales with cos θ fig 11 a shows the imbibition rates under three different inlet wetting reservoir pressure values namely 2000 pa 0 pa and 3000 pa when a positive pressure value of 2000 pa of the inlet wetting reservoir is imposed the imbibition rate is enhanced the enhancement is slight because the imposed pressure value is much smaller than the suction force of a pore body of the mean pore size 20 µm when a relatively small negative pressure value of 3000 is imposed we see that the imbibition process slows down considerably this is mainly because large pores with smaller entry capillary pressure than 3000 pa cannot be invaded by the wetting phase this case may resemble a late stage of the capillary rise in porous media fig 11b shows the corresponding slope value distributions it is seen that the three distribution profiles are similar expect that the medium is least wetted under the inlet pressure of 3000 pa 4 discussion we have shown the details of the case studies of a small pore network of 10 10 10 which can be seen as part of a thin porous layer qin and hassanizadeh 2014 for spontaneous imbibition the saturation slope value behaves relatively constant with different contact angle values to address the first question of how to estimate the capillary force at the wetting front here we compare the predictions of the imbibition rate by our pnm and eq 1 to use eq 1 the assumption of a sharp wetting front should be valid this will be proved later on for a larger network of 20 20 20 to obtain the temporal network saturation we reformulate eq 1 as follows with the assumption of a sharp wetting front and an assumed front wetting saturation sf the analytical solution of the network saturation with respect to the square root of the imbibition time is given by 12 s 2 k p c s f ε μ d 2 t where d is the length of the network and 2 k p c s f ε μ d 2 is the slope the permeability is approximated by k k 0 sf 3 the capillary pressure at the wetting front is approximated by p c 2 σ cos θ r m when the trapping of air is neglected with the intrinsic permeability of 7 darcy calculated by the pnm and an assumed front saturation value of 0 96 the slope value in eq 12 is approximately 19 s 1 2 the mean pore size is often used in the calculation of capillary pressure because it can be obtained by mercury intrusion measurement if we further consider a pore body with triangular cross section its inscribed radius is equal to rm the shape factor is 0 03 which is the mean shape factor of the pore network for a given contact angle value of 20 based on 100 realizations of a triangle with the shape factor of 0 03 the effective mean pore radius is obtained as r m 1 216 r m it can be used by the young laplace equation to estimate the capillary pressure at the wetting front notice that the difference between the mean pore size and the effective one decreases as the increase of the contact angle fig 12 shows the comparison of the three predicted imbibition curves it is seen that eq 12 notably overestimates the imbibition rate by using either the mean pore size or the effective one the slope value is overestimated by around 36 when the mean pore size is used this indicates that the calculation of the capillary pressure with the mean pore size needs to be corrected in this case by a factor of around 0 54 i e p c 0 54 2 σ cos θ r m it is expected that this correction factor depends on the pore size distribution and pore space topology of a porous medium by using the effective mean pore size in eq 12 the discrepancy from the pnm prediction will be slightly reduced however for obtaining the mean shape factor of a porous medium extensive image analysis needs to be conducted fig 13 shows the capillary pressure versus the network saturation obtained from the pore network modeling for the case with no trapping of air and the case with trapping of air it is seen that the capillary pressure keeps almost constant in both cases moreover trapping of air slightly reduces the capillary pressure for the case with no trapping of air the capillary pressure is around 4200 pa throughout the imbibition process this again proves that the capillary pressure calculated by the young laplace equation with the mean pore size is drastically overestimated moreover the capillary pressure of 4200 pa is close to the one of 3704 pa calculated by p c 0 54 2 σ cos θ r m the difference between the two values could be attributed to 1 the approximation of water relative permeability and 2 the scale effect e g for the used small network sf would be overestimated in reference zarandi et al 2018 the authors report that the analytical model over predicts the wicked height in their capillary rise experiments however as time progresses the model prediction curve asymptotically merges with the experimental points if one attributes this observation to an overestimated capillary force in their model it is obvious that the discrepancy decreases as gravity is playing a more and more important role in the capillary rise to verify the assumption of a sharp wetting front we consider a larger pore network we simulate the spontaneous imbibition in a 20 20 20 pore network the same distribution functions as used in the 10 10 10 network for pore size shape factor and pore length are used the trapping of air is neglected here fig 14 shows snapshots of water distribution in the network and the profiles of the cross sectional saturation values along the flow direction the snapshots show that a quite sharp wetting front advances however if we define the wetting front by the region where the cross sectional saturation value is smaller than 0 9 the wetting front or front roughening still spans several pores along the flow direction it is worth noting that our pnm would numerically smear the wetting front to some extent in other words the real front would be even sharper than the pnm prediction further the growth of the roughness is indiscernible in fig 12 experimental results kuijpers et al 2017 also show that a sharp wetting front is maintained during the imbibition along significant distances finally we discuss about further improvements of the present model first an advanced trapping model needs to be developed this is particularly important for highly viscous nonwetting phases such as in a water oil system because the mtm filling is dominant in spontaneous imbibition the relative positions of pore throats to the connected pore body need to be used to determine the situation of phase occupancy in each pore throat in other words details of the mtm movement in a pore body need to be tracked second the cooperative filling of a pore body should be implemented by properly revising the mtm pressure in the pore body 5 conclusions in this work we have developed a novel dynamic pore network model pnm for spontaneous imbibition in porous media complex pore elements are used to represent pore spaces which allow our model to quantitatively predict a real porous medium furthermore we implement the competition mechanism between the main terminal meniscus mtm filling and the arc menisci ams filling of a pore body which is crucial in spontaneous imbibition this model enables simulation of a wide range of imbibition processes including versatile settings of boundary conditions and material properties our model can be used to efficiently evaluate the imbibition capacity of a porous medium which may be difficult and expensive to be obtained by experiments a number of case studies have been conducted to testify the pnm we shed light on the estimation of capillary force at the wetting front we found that the capillary pressure calculated by the young laplace equation with the mean pore size notably overestimates the imbibition rate for the pore network used in this study the imbibition rate is overestimated by 36 when air trapping is neglected we also observed that a sharp wetting front across a few pores maintains and travels through the domain under the assumption of uniform wettability the imbibition rate can scale with cos θ where θ is the static contact angle finally the verification of the present dynamic pore network

pressure there are two imbibition mechanisms ma et al 1996 for a pore body namely filling from arc menisci ams and the main terminal meniscus mtm for the mtm filling the capillary pressure i e the entry pressure will keep constant as the increase of wetting saturation until a pre set value of saturation is reached in this work we set it to 0 96 then a transition function of the wetting saturation is used to force the capillary pressure to fast approach zero fig a2 shows three types of functions the type 1 is primarily used in this work the capillary entry pressure during the imbibition is calculated by the following nonlinear equations based on the ms p theory mayer and stowe 1965 patzek 2001 princen 1969 a1 1 r a e f f l n w l n s cos θ a1 2 a e f f a r 2 i 1 n cos θ cos

the cross sectional area of the pore body lnw and lnw denote the length of nonwetting wetting interface and the length of nonwetting wall interface respectively and for the remaining notations one can refer to fig a1 for a pore body with the cross section of right triangle described in fig a1 assumingr 20 μm and the surface tension of 0 073 n m the obtained entry capillary pressure versus the static contact angle is plotted in fig a3 a also the corresponding distances b 1 b 2 and b 3 are plotted the distances go to zero if corner flow cannot be formed for the imbibition filling from ams taking the parameters used in fig a3a the capillary pressure versus saturation curves are plotted in fig a3b for four contact angle values notice that each curve is truncated at its snap off saturation the snap off event is triggered once more than 1 am touch each other for a triangle cross section we check the following three inequalities a2 1 b 1 b 3 l a 0 c 0 a2 2 b 1 b 2 l a 0 b 0 a2 3 b 2 b 3 l b 0 c 0 where l denotes the side length if one or more are false the snap off is triggered when the snap off occurs the nonwetting phase is trapped in the pore body as mentioned in section 2 no volume is assigned to pore throats the capillary pressure in a pore throat is approximated by the capillary pressure in its connected upstream pore body phase conductance flow resistance in both pore bodies and pore throats is taken into account if a pore is fully filled by either nonwetting or wetting phase the single phase conductance is given by patzek and kristensen 2001a a3 g 0 6 g s 2 t r i a n g l e 0 5632 g s 2 0 5 g s 2 s q u a r e c i r c l e where g is the conductance if a pore is occupied by both nonwetting and wetting phases the conductance for wetting phase is calculated as

573,an underwater landslide is a complex multiphase flow phenomenon with potential to cause large waves and destruction particle size is an important parameter that affects flow behaviors of multiphase flows this numerical study examines underwater granular landslides on an inclined plane and their resultant waves with the purpose of exploring how the particle size affects landslide kinematics and wave amplitudes a rheology based multi phase flow model is employed newly incorporating the navier slip condition smooth and rough beds that reflect ideal and practical conditions respectively are simulated five types of particle are used they are very fine sand medium sand coarse sand granules and pebbles the granular masses are initially in the loose packing condition our numerical results demonstrate that a smooth bed results in the faster landslides and the larger impulsive waves than a rough bed the effects of particle size differ between the two bed conditions for the rough bed the relationship between the landslide speed and the particle size is negative and so is the relationship between the wave amplitude and the particle size for the smooth bed the two relationships become concave and non monotonic keywords underwater landslides impulsive waves tsunamis multiphase flow 1 introduction underwater landslides which occur in lakes sigurdsson et al 1987 and fjords hampton et al 1996 can cause large waves tsunamis which endanger human life and devastate artificial structures in affected areas bryant 2014 it is important to investigate underwater landslides and their resulting impulsive waves for risk assessments to explore the fundamental physics involved in underwater landslide previous studies used the collapse of a submerged granular column as an idealized model in laboratory experiments using two dimensional geometries thompson and huppert 2007 meruane et al 2010 rondon et al 2011 wang et al 2017 bougouin and lacaze 2018 the submerged granular material is initially confined by two vertical walls in a two dimensional geometry the collapse of the granular column starts when the front wall is suddenly removed compared with the dry granular column with the same dimension composition and properties the submerged granular column has a slower spreading velocity because of increased drag force meruane et al 2010 the initial aspect ratio thompson and huppert 2007 the initial packing rondon et al 2011 wang et al 2017 and the stokes number the ratio of particle inertia and fluid viscous effects bougouin and lacaze 2018 have significant effects on the collapse process and the finial deposit morphology the effect of initial packing is attributed to pore pressure feedback on the granular flow resulted from the dilatancy contractancy behavior lee and huang 2018 si et al 2018b some studies involved laboratory experiments to investigate the impulsive waves that were caused by underwater landslides these experiments simulated underwater landslides using either submerged rigid blocks heinrich 1992 watts 1998 grilli and watts 2005 liu et al 2005 enet and grilli 2007 ataie ashtiani 2008 or submerged granular materials assier rzadkiewicz et al 1997 ataie ashtiani 2008 grilli et al 2017 the submerged body slid down an inclined plane to generate waves the water surface was initially depressed and then rebounded to form a main wave crest enet and grilli 2007 ataie ashtiani 2008 as waves propagated into the far field their amplitudes and steepnesses gradually decreased but their periods wavelengths and nonlinearities increased ataie ashtiani 2008 ultimately these waves approached a shore and ran up on a beach liu et al 2005 some important parameters that can affect the characteristics of the initial impulsive waves are initial submergence grilli and watts 2005 liu et al 2005 ataie ashtiani 2008 bed slope angle ataie ashtiani 2008 slide volume of the landslide grilli and watts 2005 and initial acceleration of the slide grilli and watts 2005 the landslide length shape and deformation have minor effects on the initial impulsive waves ataie ashtiani 2008 parameters that affect waves during propagation include water depth bed conditions and distance of propagation ataie ashtiani 2008 the run up height is mainly dominated by the size initial submergence and initial motion time history of the submarine landslides liu et al 2005 many numerical models are available to simulate the waves that are generated by underwater landslides most of them treat the hydrodynamics separately from the landslide several models for simulating the hydrodynamics have been developed by solving i depth resolving equations such as the laplace equation grilli and watts 2005 and the navier stokes equations liu et al 2005 fernández nieto et al 2008 ma et al 2013 2015 or ii depth averaged equations e g the shallow water equations yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2015 and the boussinesq equations lynett and liu 2002 solving equations of the former type yields the flow distribution in detail but it requires huge computational resources the simplest approach for simulating the landslide treats the landslide as a rigid block whose motion is specified by empirical equations that derived from laboratory measurements liu et al 2005 lynett and liu 2002 to couple the avalanche dynamics and the fluid dynamics fernández nieto et al 2008 and ma et al 2015 solved one layer depth averaged equations for granular flows and ma et al 2013 considered the released grains to be newtonian fluids the depth averaged shallow models can be applied to simulate real landslides on complex topographies brunet et al 2017 delannay et al 2017 for submarine landslides dilatancy of granular materials and its interaction with pore pressure play important roles recently the dilatancy effects have been considered in depth averaged approaches by using either a relationship between the dilatancy angle and the concentration pailha and pouliquen 2009 or a relationship between the dilatancy angle and the solid pressure bouchut et al 2016 the model of bouchut et al 2016 with the dilatancy effect has been applied to simulate some laboratory scale submarine granular flow with quantitative comparison with experiments bouchut et al 2017 recently several depth resolving multi phase flow models have been developed to simulate the collapse of submerged granular columns si et al 2018b lee and huang 2018 these models have been extended to capture air water interface lee et al 2019 si et al 2018a yu et al 2018 successfully used the multi phase dispersed flow model that was developed by lee et al 2019 to examine waves that are generated by the collapse of submerged granular columns this study investigates impulsive waves that are genearted by underwater landslides on slopes using the numerical model of lee et al 2019 at present it is not well understood how the particle size and the bed condition affect the underwater landslides as well as the resultant waves particle size can significantly affect the fluid particle interactions and the rheology of granular flows trulsson et al 2012 resulting in different slide processes and the generation of waves laboratory experiments have used smooth beds but real beds may be rough changing the sliding velocity and influencing the amplitudes of the generated waves consequently this study will focus on the effects of particle size and bed condition 2 numerical model 2 1 mathematical formulas this section briefly introduces the multi phase dispersed flow model for air water and sediment which was developed from multiphase continuum mechanics by lee et al 2019 this model regards air and water as a single incompressible fluid of variable density and viscosity used to track air water interface the water saturation s is defined as the volumetric ratio of water to the void pore space in a computational cell s 0 1 means that the void in a cell is filled with air water when 0 s 1 the void is filled with both air and water a similar approach is used in the volume of fluid method hirt 1981 given the no slip condition at the air water interface only one velocity vector u f is required to specify both the air and the water velocities the density ρf and the viscosity νf of the air water mixture are determined by 1 ρ f s ρ w 1 s ρ a

used in the volume of fluid methods ferziger and peric 2002 rearranging the mass balance equations for the sediment water and air yields the following three equations 3 c t c u s 0 4 s t s u f s u f 0

when solving eqs 1 7 closer models for t f νft t s ps and τp are required the k ϵ model is applied to determine t f and νft with a correction for low reynolds number lee et al 2016 the turbulent motion of the solid phase at low concentration hinze 1959 and the elastic effect at high concentration hsu et al 2004 are incorporated into the formulas for determining t s and ps furthermore the visco plastic rheological characteristics and the dilatancy behavior forterre and pouliquen 2008 are also considered in computing t s and ps respectively trulsson et al 2012 suggested that the effective friction coefficient η t s p s where ts is the second invariant of t s and the concentration in dense flows depend on a combined dimensionless parameter i i v a i i 2 where iv the viscous number ii the inertial number and a a constant trulsson et al 2012 the viscous number is the ratio of the viscous stress to the quasi static shear stress that is associated with the weight owing to the enduring contact and is defined as i v 2 ρ f ν f d s c p s where νf the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ds the second invariant of the strain rate and d the particle diameter the inertial number given by i i 2 d d s c p s ρ s is the ratio of the inertial stress to the quasi static stress previous studies have suggested some formulas for the c i and η i relationships the following two formulas trulsson et al 2012 are adopted in the model of lee et al 2019 8 η η 1 η 2 η 1 1 i o i 1 2 where η 2 and io are constants and η 1 tan θ s with θs the angle of repose and 9 c c c 1 b i 1 2 where cc the maximum packing fraction of an homogeneously sheared assembly of frictional spheres boyer et al 2011 and b a model parameter to compute the drag force the formula for the particle response time τp suggested by lee and huang 2018 is adopted that formula combines two formulas one applies at low concentration richardson and zaki 1954 and the other at high concentration engelund 1953 the closer models are briefly summarized in appendix a it is remarked that effects of s on the closer models are ignored because this study concerns underwater landslides where s inside the granular mass is always 1 the key parameters are presented in table 1 where k is related to young s modulus and ae as well as be is the model parameter used to compute the particle response time lee et al 2016 suggest a 0 1 for the sediment transport in the sheet flow condition b 1 and c c 0 585 are selected according to the experiments boyer et al 2011 for nearly uniform spherers i o 0 1 was obtained numerically by trulsson et al 2012 cassar et al 2005 suggested η 1 0 43 and η 2 0 82 for glass beads co 0 55 is the random loose packing fraction lee et al 2015 adopted k 10 8 pa for numerical stability consideration in modeling collapse of a dry granular column σ c 1 is the same as that used by lee et al 2016 a e 760 and b e 1 5 are adopted for randomly packed uniform sphere particles engelund 1953 contractancy and dilatancy play important roles in the landslide process rondon et al 2011 in this study the two components of the solid pressure psr and pse contribute to contractancy and dilatancy psr reflects the rheological characteristic related to ds eq a 6 pse accounts for the elastic effect eq a 7 a lower higher c yields lower higher psr and pse when the force due to the solid pressure is not large enough to support the weight of solid phase the lower force will induce contractancy the present model has been successfully used to simulate the collapse of submerged granular column in which contractancy and dilatancy are important lee and huang 2018 however the dilatancy behavior produced by the present model is too rapid because the present model does not consider i the complex behavior of a granular flow near its static state due to the rearrangement of particles and ii the dilatancy angle the study of bouchut et al 2016 included the dilatancy in the depth averaged model by incorporating the relationship between the volume change the strain rate and the dilatancy angle and that model was successfully used to simulate the collapse of submerged granular column 2 2 partial slip boundary condition the navier slip boundary condition proposed by artoni and santomaso 2014 for granular flows is newly included in the numerical model of lee et al 2019 10 u s β u s n 0 where u s is the velocity parallel to the wall n the coordinate normal to the wall and β the slip length the physical meaning of the slip length is schematically shown in fig 1 it is an extrapolated distance from the wall where the tangential velocity component is zero the longer slip length leads to the faster slip velocity in the experimental results of artoni and santomaso 2014 β ranges from 0d to 25d for a roughness height from 0 1d to 0 7d and increasing the roughness height generally yields a smaller β as the roughness height approaches zero β d depends on relative friction coefficients and can be more than 35 according to the numerical study of artoni and santomaso 2014 in addition to the navier slip boundary condition the coulomb friction has been used in simulations of granular flows to consider the friction of the bed yielding good results of collapse of granular columns ionescu et al 2015 martin et al 2017 fernández nieto et al 2016 since the navier slip condition is directly observed in the experiments of artoni and santomaso 2014 for granular flows the navier slip condition is adopted in this study 2 3 numerical procedures an open source computational fluid dynamics cfd toolbox openfoam jasak 2009 is used to solve the equations that were presented in the previous section to increase the numerical stability a prediction correction scheme that was proposed by lee et al 2015 was incorporated into the pimple scheme jasak 2009 in this modified scheme the discrete mass balance equation for the solid phase is an advection diffusion equation rather than an advection equation the diffusion behavior can suppress the fluctuation of the concentration 3 numerical setup the model lee et al 2019 is applied to simulate the waves that are generated by underwater landslides as shown in fig 2 the numerical setup is identical to that in the experiment of grilli et al 2017 the water depth h is 0 322 cm the submerged landslide mass glass beads is 9 1 cm high and 13 cm long and it is stored in a triangular reservoir that is formed by the slope and the gate the density of the solid grains is ρ s 2500 kg m3 the initial loose packing granular mass are considered because it can produce more disintegrative slope failures hampton et al 1996 and can generate much larger waves than initial dense packing yu et al 2018 the initial concentration ci 0 55 is set the initial saturation is given by 1 at x 2 h including the inside of the granular mass and it is given by 0 at x 2 h in the experiment the landslide is initiated by vertically dropping the gate the gate has significant effect on the granular flows and then on the waves in the experiments of collapsing dry granular columns an upward moving gate reduces the flow front velocity and decreases the front advance ionescu et al 2015 in our numerical simulations the landslide is initiated by suddenly removing the force that keeps the granular material in place the navier slip boundary condition is imposed on the rigid bed which includes the slope and the flat bed for the sediment phase the wall function that relies on the existence of a logarithmic region in the velocity profile ferziger and peric 2002 is implemented on the rigid bed for the fluid phase four wave gauges are installed at 0 6 m 1 6 m 2 6 m and 3 6 m from the gate to record the time series of surface displacement at these locations this study concerns the effects of particle size and bed condition spherical particles with five diameters 0 1 0 4 0 8 2 and 4 mm are used these correspond to very fine sand medium sand coarse sand granules and pebbles on the wentworth scale two bed conditions are used they are β 0 d corresponding to a rough bed and β 40 d smooth bed other parameters are fixed 4 results and discussions this section presents the simulated results after validating the model lee et al 2019 this section examines how landslides and impulsive waves respond to changes in the particle size and the bed condition 4 1 validation the model lee et al 2019 is applied to reproduce the experiment of grilli et al 2017 with glass beads of d 4 mm in their experiment lowering the gate at a speed of around 1 m s can induce a downward current in the simulation the validation case the initial velocity u f 0 1 m s is set in the region of 0 28 m x 1 0 29 m and x 2 0 295 m to account for effects of the current on the landslide process the smooth bed is used in the experiment so β 40 d is adopted in the simulation fig 3 presents the computed sliding process the dependence of the results on the cell size is checked the two cell sizes of 2 mm and 4 mm in height give nearly identical sliding processes the difference in the location of the granular flow front at t 0 47 is within 3 of li the cell size of 2 mm is adopted in this study a total of 229 447 computational cells are used a 5 s of physical time takes 2 days using 30 threads on a workstation with two central processing units intel xeon gold 6130 cpu the observed sliding process grilli et al 2017 is also included in fig 3 for comparison the computed flow front travels slower than the measured ones at t 0 47 s the measured flow front reaches x 1 53 cm but the computed one 49 cm the computed flow front is sharper than the observed one the thickness t is underestimated by around 50 the results of the numerical experiments suggest that the downward current can significantly affect the landslide process and its shape the downward currents with velocities of 0 m s 0 5 m s and 1m s give i the maximum sliding speeds of 0 6 m s 0 66 m s and 0 69 m s and ii the amplitude of the first wave of 0 54 cm 0 5 cm and 0 49 cm at gauge 1 respectively to improve agreement the moving gate should be simulated but doing so involves extra numerical difficulties grilli et al 2017 used the model of ma et al 2015 to reproduce their experiment their numerical landslide moved faster than both their observed and our computed landslides additionally their numerical landslide was too flat to increase computational efficiency the model of ma et al 2015 solves the one layer depth averaged equations for a landslide however that model does not consider the particle particle and particle fluid interactions bouchut et al 2017 used an advanced depth averaged model with the dilatancy effect to simulate the collapses of submerged granular column and also had the overestimated spread velocity fig 4 displays computed time series of water surface displacements η superposed on the measured time series for comparison the wave gauges seemed not to be synchronized with the camera grilli et al 2017 in fig 4 the measured surface displacements are shifted to have the arrival time of the first measured wave crest at gauge 1 consistent with the computed one the computed time series agree with the measured ones at the four gauges except for a slight overestimation of amplitudes at gauge 1 the leading double n waves followed by a train of smaller waves can be recognized in both the experiment and our simulation when propagating to gauges 2 4 the leading waves become a series of larger waves on account of dispersion and their periods increase it is remarked that although the computed granular flow dynamics are different to the observed ones the generated waves are well reproduced the possible reason is that the waves run g h 1 8 m s faster than the granular flows 0 69 m s therefore only the early stage of landslide has effects on the waves it can be seen in fig 3 that the computed landslide shape is similar to the measured one at t 0 17 s but the difference becomes significant at t 0 47 s 4 2 sliding process and consequently generated waves in reality the slope down which a granular mass slides is typically rough and the gate does not exist the rough bed is adopted β 0 d and the initial downward current that is caused by that gate is not considered in the simulations herein the computed underwater landslide and the resultant waves with d 4 mm are shown in fig 5 the flow fields are presented in fig 6 where pd is the hydrodynamic pressure and is defined by p d p f ρ f g h x 2 where x 2 is the axis in the vertical direction it can be seen in fig 5 that the surface of the granular mass flattens out as the flow front moves forward from t 0 s to 0 4 s the granular mass then continuously slides down and its length increases during t 0 4 1 s the flow front touches the flat bed at t 1 s the granular mass gradually accumulates at the slope toe the motion of the granular mass generates water waves when t 0 2 s the water surface is depressed fronted by a positive wave with a mild crest then a hump forms on the water surface from x 1 20 cm to x 1 30 cm at t 0 4 s the surface disturbance due to this hump propagates as two secondary waves of which one propagates to left and the other to right the former one runs up on the slope from t 0 4 s to 0 6 s and runs down from t 0 6 s to 1 s when t 2 s the long waves have left the landslide however some small fluctuations in the water surface are present over the granular mass as depicted in fig 6 the landslide induces a huge vortex at t 0 2 s and 0 4 s which is responsible for the hump at t 0 4 s three small vortexes are observed behind the flow front at t 0 8 s possibly due to the shear induced instability these vortexes produce small ripples on the surface of the granular mass at t 2 s these vortexes lifted from the surface of the granular mass the pressure distribution pd is similar to the distribution of flow past a blunt body in which the pressure is positive on the weather side the negative pressure which accompanies the vortexes penetrates the granular mass 4 3 effects of particle size this section investigates the effects of particle size on landslides and the resultant impulsive waves both the rough bed β 0 d and the smooth bed β 40 d are considered the trajectories and velocities of landslides are presented the impulsive waves are discussed in terms of the amplitudes of their first crest their first trough and their second crest 4 3 1 rough bed this section begins with the landslide kinematics fig 7 depicts the trajectories of landslides on the rough bed for the five particle sizes regardless of particle size the granular masses slide down the slope when t 1 s the effect of particle size on the trajectories of landslide mass is insignificant at t 1 s but becomes significant at t 1 s for example when d 0 4 mm the masses gradually accumulate at the slope toe however the granular mass with d 0 1 mm rises and falls repeatedly the absolute mass averaged velocities of the landslides u called the landslide speed hereafter are shown in fig 8 for the five particle sizes three stages can be identified in fig 8 the acceleration stage e g t 0 4 s for d 4 mm the stage of nearly constant velocity 0 4 s t 1 s and the deceleration stage t 1 s table 2 lists the maximum sliding speed at the first peak u max and the mean acceleration in the acceleration stage t 0 4 s ao all u max are smaller than the speed g h i 1 ρ f ρ s 0 73 m s according to the potential energy probably as a result of the complex interstitial flow inside the granular mass u max differs significantly from the settling velocity of individual particles for example for the particle of d 0 1 mm u max 0 53 m s and the settling velocity is approximately 0 008 m s additionally u max is less than the wave speed g h 1 8 m s so the impulsive waves run away from the landslide and the build up of those waves is limited harbitz et al 2006 the particle size has strong and negative effects on u max and ao the very fine sand d 0 1 mm has 2 3 times u max and 2 5 times ao of the pebble d 4 mm fig 9 illustrates the flow fields for d 0 1 mm compared with d 4 mm fig 6 d 0 1 mm leads to stronger vortices due to the faster sliding velocity smaller particles have a slower settling velocity and are more easily to be entrained into water flows accordingly the flow front located at x 1 40 cm for d 0 1 mm is blunter at t 0 4 s and the mixing process for d 0 1 mm is intenser the mixing process contributes to the suspension of all particles with d 0 1 mm and causes the center of mass to rise and fall repeatedly the distribution of pd differs between d 0 1 mm and d 4 mm excess pore pressure positive pressure exists inside the landslide mass at t 0 2 s when d 0 1 mm but not when d 4 mm the excess pore pressure decreases friction between particles and favors the landslide the impulsive waves in the far field are investigated following ataie ashtiani 2008 the three amplitudes a of the first crest the first trough and the second crest are examined fig 10 depicts a recorded at gauges 3 and 4 for the five particle sizes generally a for gauge 4 is smaller than that for gauge 3 which is consistent with previously obtained analytical results viroulet et al 2013 the amplitudes of the first trough and the second crest are larger than that of the first crest the previous study of grilli and watts 2005 suggests that a is positively related to ao our results reveal a negative relationship between ao and d hence a is expected to decrease as d increases which relationship is revealed in fig 10 except for a small fluctuation in the second crest for d 0 8 mm within 0 2 mm for gauge 3 the effect of particle size on the wave amplitude is significant the wave amplitude of the second wave crest for d 0 1 mm is 1 72 times as larger as that for d 4 mm the experiment results of ataie ashtiani 2008 who used block slides suggest the ratio between a of the first trough and that of the second crest is 0 3 but the results herein for granular slides yields a ratio of 0 3 1 1 the particle size has a negligible effect on the wave period double the duration from the first trough to the second crest the wave periods are 1 08 0 04 s herein 4 3 2 smooth bed to understand the effect of bed condition simulations using a smooth bed are carried out in this section the results obtained here are compared with those obtained using the rough bed which were presented in section 4 3 1 fig 11 presents the trajectories of landslides on the smooth bed for the five particle sizes comparing figs 7 and 11 reveals that the trajectories on the smooth bed are similar to those on the rough bed with the minor difference that the landslide masses on the smooth bed can move farther away from the slope toe fig 12 plots the time series of landslide speeds on the smooth bed for the five particle sizes the corresponding values of u max and ao are provided in table 3 compared with the rough bed see fig 8 and table 3 i the smooth bed yields a much faster u max and a much higher ao ii the stages of nearly constant velocity are shorter and even disappear e g d 4 mm and iii u in the deceleration stage decreases more rapidly for d 0 4 mm furthermore changing the bed condition alters the u max d and a o d relationships these two relationships become concave and non monotonic for the smooth bed fig 13 depicts the amplitudes versus d for a smooth bed overall the amplitudes over the smooth bed can largely exceed those over the rough bed because ao is larger the second wave crest over the smooth bed is larger than that over the rough bed by 140 the a d relationships for the first trough and the second crest are strongly related to the a o d relationship the ratio of a for the second crest to that of the first trough ranges from 0 76 to 1 2 surprisingly a of the first crest decreases as d increases and this relationship is inconsistent with the a o d relationship to elucidate that inconsistence the flow fields near the flow fronts at t 0 4 s for the three different particle sizes are shown in fig 14 at that instant the first positive waves are just in front of the flow front the effects of particle size on the shape and the velocity fields are substantial finer particles create blunter flow fronts at x 1 40 cm leading to stronger water flow near the flow front but weaker flow above the granular mass the shape effect maybe responsible for the inconsistency between the a d and a o d relationships although that shape is believed to have only a minor effect on wave generation ataie ashtiani 2008 4 3 3 discussions on pore pressure it was mentioned in section 4 3 1 that the excess pore pressure existed inside the granular mass for the very fine sand d 0 1 mm this section discusses how the excess pore pressure forms and how it affects the landslide over the rough bed previous experimental studies rondon et al 2011 have demonstrated that the initial packing can affect the pore pressure owing to the contractancy dilatancy behavior of a granular material and the pore pressure plays an important role in the underwater landslide process the initial loose packing can yield contractancy behavior and then excess pore pressure favoring the landslide process the initial dense packing yields the opposite results this study uses the initial loose packing and the contractancy behavior is produced numerically for d 4 mm 0 1 mm c increases from 0 55 to 0 554 0 552 within t 0 2 s at the location of a in fig 2 the contractancy behavior generates the excess pore pressure p d 51 pa 338 pa for d 4 mm 0 1 mm at t 0 01 s which has the similar order of the magnitude as in the simulations of submerged granular collapse by bouchut et al 2017 then the high pore pressure dissipates since the permeability is higher for the larger particles das 2013 pd for d 4 mm dissipates more quickly than pd for d 0 1 mm at t 0 2 s p d 47 pa for d 4 mm but 114 pa for d 0 1 mm the faster dissipation of the excess pore pressure for the larger particles is the probable reason leading to the negative u max d and a o d relationships 4 3 4 discussions on bed condition changing the bed condition alters the u max d and a o d relationships these relationships are negative and monotonic for the rough bed they become concave and non monotonic when the bed is smooth for the smooth bed increasing the particle size not only decreases the permeability but also increases the slip length the lower permeability yields a slower u max and a lower ao but the longer slip increases them explaining the concave and non monotonic u max d and a o d relationships for the smooth bed 4 4 sensitivity analysis parametric analyses are performed with respect to cc b k and τp the numerical conditions used here are the same as those used in section 4 1 the former three parameters are related to the contraction or the dilation and to the formation of the excess pore pressure in these analyses cc varies from 0 585 to 0 615 and b from 0 75 to 1 according to previous studies boyer et al 2011 revilbauudard and chauchat 2013 k varies from 107 pa to 109 pa τp is related to the dissipation of the excess pore pressure the formulas of richardson and zaki 1954 and engelund 1953 to compute τp are used in addition to that of lee and huang 2018 in the previous studies of lee and huang 2018 the three parameters cc b and k have significant effects on collapse process over a flat bed in a high viscous fluid but changing the formula to compute τp dose not in this study these parameters cc b k and τp have insignificant effects on the slide process in water and on the waves changing cc b and k yield smaller than 2 differences in both u max and a of the first wave crest changing the formula for τp causes 2 difference in u max and 4 difference in a of the first wave crest since water used here is much less viscous than the fluid used in lee and huang 2018 the excess pore pressure has shorter duration to influence the landslide in this study than in lee and huang 2018 this maybe the reason why u max and a are relatively insensitive to cc b and k which are related to the formation of the excess pore pressure the effects of reynolds stress and turbulent dispersion on u max as well as a are also examined the reynolds stress has neglectable effect on u max and a 1 difference possibly because the viscoplastic component of stress dominates dense granular flows the effect of turbulent dispersion increases u max by 6 and a by 4 possibly because the turbulent dispersion distributes the particles over a wider area decreasing the concentration and reduces the friction 5 conclusions this paper presents the numerical study of underwater landslides on the inclined planes and their resultant waves with emphases on the two important factors the particle size and the bed condition the multi phase flow model developed by lee and huang 2018 is applied and the navier slip condition is newly incorporated into this model to account for the bed condition the following conclusions can be drawn from this numerical study the contraction of the granular mass plays an important role in the early stage of the landslide yielding the excess pore pressure and favoring the landslide the particle size affects the permeability and the dissipation of the excess pore pressure and it then influences the landslide kinematics as well as the waves additionally the particle size and the bed condition have effects on the slip length affecting the landslide kinematics and then the waves too the numerical results reveal the strong effects of the particle size and the bed condition on the landslide kinematics and the waves using different particle size can change the landslide speed and the wave amplitude by up to 130 and 150 respectively the changes can be up to 140 and 170 in the landslide speed and in the wave amplitude due to the bed condition the bed condition can significantly change i the relationship between the landslide speed and the particle diameter and ii the relationship between the wave amplitude and the particle diameter for the rough bed zero slip length these two relationships are negative because the particle size negatively affects the permeability for the smooth bed these two relationships become concave due to the positive effect of the particle size on the slip length and the negative effect of the particle size on the permeability the model of lee and huang 2018 does not consider the dilatancy angle which is important in submarine granular flows in the future work the dilatancy angle will be included in this model acknowledgment the material is based on work supported by the ministry of science and technology taiwan most 107 2221 e 032 018 my3 and most 108 2636 e 032 001

573,an underwater landslide is a complex multiphase flow phenomenon with potential to cause large waves and destruction particle size is an important parameter that affects flow behaviors of multiphase flows this numerical study examines underwater granular landslides on an inclined plane and their resultant waves with the purpose of exploring how the particle size affects landslide kinematics and wave amplitudes a rheology based multi phase flow model is employed newly incorporating the navier slip condition smooth and rough beds that reflect ideal and practical conditions respectively are simulated five types of particle are used they are very fine sand medium sand coarse sand granules and pebbles the granular masses are initially in the loose packing condition our numerical results demonstrate that a smooth bed results in the faster landslides and the larger impulsive waves than a rough bed the effects of particle size differ between the two bed conditions for the rough bed the relationship between the landslide speed and the particle size is negative and so is the relationship between the wave amplitude and the particle size for the smooth bed the two relationships become concave and non monotonic keywords underwater landslides impulsive waves tsunamis multiphase flow 1 introduction underwater landslides which occur in lakes sigurdsson et al 1987 and fjords hampton et al 1996 can cause large waves tsunamis which endanger human life and devastate artificial structures in affected areas bryant 2014 it is important to investigate underwater landslides and their resulting impulsive waves for risk assessments to explore the fundamental physics involved in underwater landslide previous studies used the collapse of a submerged granular

submerged granular material is initially confined by two vertical walls in a two dimensional geometry the collapse of the granular column starts when the front wall is suddenly removed compared with the dry granular column with the same dimension composition and properties the submerged granular column has a slower spreading velocity because of increased drag force meruane et al 2010 the initial aspect ratio thompson and huppert 2007 the initial packing rondon et al 2011 wang et al 2017 and the stokes number the ratio of particle inertia and fluid viscous effects bougouin and lacaze 2018 have significant effects on the collapse process and the finial deposit morphology the effect of initial packing is attributed to pore pressure feedback on the granular flow resulted from the dilatancy contractancy behavior lee and huang 2018 si et al 2018b some studies involved laboratory experiments to investigate the impulsive waves that were caused by underwater landslides these experiments simulated underwater landslides using either submerged rigid blocks heinrich 1992 watts 1998 grilli and watts 2005 liu et al 2005 enet and grilli 2007 ataie ashtiani 2008 or submerged granular materials assier rzadkiewicz et al 1997 ataie ashtiani 2008 grilli et al 2017 the submerged body slid down an inclined plane to generate waves the water surface was initially depressed and then rebounded to form a main wave crest enet and grilli 2007 ataie ashtiani 2008 as waves propagated into the far field their amplitudes and steepnesses gradually decreased but their periods wavelengths and nonlinearities increased ataie ashtiani 2008 ultimately these waves approached a shore and ran up on a beach liu et al 2005 some important parameters that can affect the characteristics of the initial impulsive waves are initial submergence grilli and watts 2005 liu et al 2005 ataie ashtiani 2008 bed slope angle ataie ashtiani 2008 slide volume of the landslide grilli and watts 2005 and initial acceleration of the slide grilli and watts 2005 the landslide length shape and deformation have minor effects on the initial impulsive waves ataie ashtiani 2008 parameters that affect waves during propagation include water depth bed conditions and distance of propagation ataie ashtiani 2008 the run up height is mainly dominated by the size initial submergence and initial motion time history of the submarine landslides liu et al 2005 many numerical models are available to simulate the waves that are generated by underwater landslides most of them treat the hydrodynamics separately from the landslide several models for simulating the hydrodynamics have been developed by solving i depth resolving equations such as the laplace equation grilli and watts 2005 and the navier stokes equations liu et al 2005 fernández nieto et al 2008 ma et al 2013 2015 or ii depth averaged equations e g the shallow water equations yavari ramshe and ataie ashtiani 2015 and the boussinesq equations lynett and liu 2002 solving equations of the former type yields the flow distribution in detail but it requires huge computational resources the simplest approach for simulating the landslide treats the landslide as a rigid block whose motion is specified by empirical equations that derived from laboratory measurements liu et al 2005 lynett and liu 2002 to couple the avalanche dynamics and the fluid dynamics fernández nieto et al 2008 and ma et al 2015 solved one layer depth averaged equations for granular flows and ma et al 2013 considered the released grains to be newtonian fluids the depth averaged shallow models can be applied to simulate real landslides on complex topographies brunet et al 2017 delannay et al 2017 for submarine landslides dilatancy of granular materials and its interaction with pore pressure play important roles recently the dilatancy effects have been considered in depth averaged approaches by using either a relationship between the dilatancy angle and the concentration pailha and pouliquen 2009 or a relationship between the dilatancy angle and the solid pressure bouchut et al 2016 the model of bouchut et al 2016 with the dilatancy effect has been applied to simulate some laboratory scale submarine granular flow with quantitative comparison with experiments bouchut et al 2017 recently several depth resolving multi phase flow models have been developed to simulate the collapse of submerged granular columns si et al 2018b lee and huang 2018 these models have been extended to capture air water interface lee et al 2019 si et al 2018a yu et al 2018 successfully used the multi phase dispersed flow model that was developed by lee et al 2019 to examine waves that are generated by the collapse of submerged granular columns this study investigates impulsive waves that are genearted by underwater landslides on slopes using the numerical model of lee et al 2019 at present it is not well understood how the particle size and the bed condition affect the underwater landslides as well as the resultant waves particle size can significantly affect the fluid particle interactions and the rheology of granular flows trulsson et al 2012 resulting in different slide processes and the generation of waves laboratory experiments have used smooth beds but real beds may be rough changing the sliding velocity and influencing the amplitudes of the generated waves consequently this study will focus on the effects of particle size and bed condition 2 numerical model 2 1 mathematical formulas this section briefly introduces the multi phase dispersed flow model for air water and sediment which was developed from multiphase continuum mechanics by lee et al 2019 this model regards air and water as a single incompressible fluid of variable density and viscosity used to track air water interface the water saturation s is defined as the volumetric ratio of water to the void pore space in a computational cell s 0 1 means that the void in a cell is filled with air water when 0 s 1 the void is filled with both air and water a similar approach is used in the volume of fluid method hirt 1981 given the no slip condition at the air water interface only one velocity vector u f is required to specify both the air and the water velocities the density ρf and the viscosity νf of the air water mixture are determined by 1 ρ f s ρ w 1 s ρ a and 2 ν f s ν w 1 s ν a where the subscript a w indicates air water with eqs 1 and 2 the computed ρf and νf vary continuously across the air water interface 0 s 1 this numerical treatment is widely used in the volume of fluid methods ferziger and peric 2002 rearranging the mass balance equations for the sediment water and air yields the following three equations 3 c t c u s 0 4 s t s u f s u f 0 and 5 1 c u f c u s 0 where c is the volumetric concentration of the sediment phase and u is the velocity an s f in the superscript refers to the solid fluid phase eq 3 is solved to determine c and eq 4 to s reflecting the incompressibility of both the fluid air and water and the solid phases eq 5 is used to correct the fluid pressure pf the momentum balance equations for the sediment and fluid phase are 6 ρ s c u s t ρ s c u s u s ρ s c g c p f c p s c t s c ρ s u f u s τ p ρ s τ p 1 c ν f t σ c c and 7 ρ f 1 c u f t ρ f 1 c u f u f ρ f 1 c g 1 c p f 1 c t f c ρ s u f u s τ p ρ s τ p 1 c ν f t σ c c respectively in eqs 6 and 7 g is the gravitational acceleration p the pressure t the stress tensor τp the particle response time νft the eddy viscosity of the fluid phase and σc the schmidt number the first term in in eqs 6 and 7 denotes the drag force and the second term represents turbulent dispersion these two terms refer to the momentum exchange between the sediment and fluid phases when solving eqs 1 7 closer models for t f νft t s ps and τp are required the k ϵ model is applied to determine t f and νft with a correction for low reynolds number lee et al 2016 the turbulent motion of the solid phase at low concentration hinze 1959 and the elastic effect at high concentration hsu et al 2004 are incorporated into the formulas for determining t s and ps furthermore the visco plastic rheological characteristics and the dilatancy behavior forterre and pouliquen 2008 are also considered in computing t s and ps respectively trulsson et al 2012 suggested that the effective friction coefficient η t s p s where ts is the second invariant of t s and the concentration in dense flows depend on a combined dimensionless parameter i i v a i i 2 where iv the viscous number ii the inertial number and a a constant trulsson et al 2012 the viscous number is the ratio of the viscous stress to the quasi static shear stress that is associated with the weight owing to the enduring contact and is defined as i v 2 ρ f ν f d s c p s where νf the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ds the second invariant of the strain rate and d the particle diameter the inertial number given by i i 2 d d s c p s ρ s is the ratio of the inertial stress to the quasi static stress previous studies have suggested some formulas for the c i and η i relationships the following two formulas trulsson et al 2012 are adopted in the model of lee et al 2019 8 η η 1 η 2 η 1 1 i o i 1 2 where η 2 and io are constants and η 1 tan θ s with θs the angle of repose and 9 c c c 1 b i 1 2 where cc the maximum packing fraction of an homogeneously sheared assembly of frictional spheres boyer et al 2011 and b a model parameter to compute the drag force the formula for the particle response time τp suggested by lee and huang 2018 is adopted that formula combines two formulas one applies at low concentration richardson and zaki 1954 and the other at high concentration engelund 1953 the closer models are briefly summarized in appendix a it is remarked that effects of s on the closer models are ignored because this study concerns underwater landslides where s inside the granular mass is always 1 the key parameters are presented in table 1 where k is related to young s modulus and ae as well as be is the model parameter used to compute the particle response time lee et al 2016 suggest a 0 1 for the sediment transport in the sheet flow condition b 1 and c c 0 585 are selected according to the experiments boyer et al 2011 for nearly uniform spherers i o 0 1 was obtained numerically by trulsson et al 2012 cassar et al 2005 suggested η 1 0 43 and η 2 0 82 for glass beads co 0 55 is the random loose packing fraction lee et al 2015 adopted k 10 8 pa for numerical stability consideration in modeling collapse of a dry granular column σ c 1 is the same as that used by lee et al 2016 a e 760 and b e 1 5 are adopted for randomly packed uniform sphere particles engelund 1953 contractancy and dilatancy play important roles in the landslide process rondon et al 2011 in this study the two components of the solid pressure psr and pse contribute to contractancy and dilatancy psr reflects the rheological characteristic related to ds eq a 6 pse accounts for the elastic effect eq a 7 a lower higher c yields lower higher psr and pse when the force due to the solid pressure is not large enough to support the weight of solid phase the lower force will induce contractancy the present model has been successfully used to simulate the collapse of submerged granular column in which contractancy and dilatancy are important lee and huang 2018 however the dilatancy behavior produced by the present model is too rapid because the present model does not consider i the complex behavior of a granular flow near its static state due to the rearrangement of particles and ii the dilatancy angle the study of bouchut et al 2016 included the dilatancy in the depth averaged model by incorporating the relationship between the volume change the strain rate and the dilatancy angle and that model was successfully used to simulate the collapse of submerged granular column 2 2 partial slip boundary condition the navier slip boundary condition proposed by artoni and santomaso 2014 for granular flows is newly included in the numerical model of lee et al 2019 10 u s β u s n 0 where u s is the velocity parallel to the wall n the coordinate normal to the wall and β the slip length the physical meaning of the slip length is schematically shown in fig 1 it is an extrapolated distance from the wall where the tangential velocity component is zero the longer slip length leads to the faster slip velocity in the experimental results of artoni and santomaso 2014 β ranges from 0d to 25d for a roughness height from 0 1d to 0 7d and increasing the roughness height generally yields a smaller β as the roughness height approaches zero β d depends on relative friction coefficients and can be more than 35 according to the numerical study of artoni and santomaso 2014 in addition to the navier slip boundary condition the coulomb friction has been used in simulations of granular flows to consider the friction of the bed yielding good results of collapse of granular columns ionescu et al 2015 martin et al 2017 fernández nieto et al 2016 since the navier slip condition is directly observed in the experiments of artoni and santomaso 2014 for granular flows the navier slip condition is adopted in this study 2 3 numerical procedures an open source computational fluid dynamics cfd toolbox openfoam jasak 2009 is used to solve the equations that were presented in the previous section to increase the numerical stability a prediction correction scheme that was proposed by lee et al 2015 was incorporated into the pimple scheme jasak 2009 in this modified scheme the discrete mass balance equation for the solid phase is an advection diffusion equation rather than an advection equation the diffusion behavior can suppress the fluctuation of the concentration 3 numerical setup the model lee et al 2019 is applied to simulate the waves that are generated by underwater landslides as shown in fig 2 the numerical setup is identical to that in the experiment of grilli et al 2017 the water depth h is 0 322 cm the submerged landslide mass glass beads is 9 1 cm high and 13 cm long and it is stored in a triangular reservoir that is formed by the slope and the gate the density of the solid grains is ρ s 2500 kg m3 the initial loose packing granular mass are considered because it can produce more disintegrative slope failures hampton et al 1996 and can generate much larger waves than initial dense packing yu et al 2018 the initial concentration ci 0 55 is set the initial saturation is given by 1 at x 2 h including the inside of the granular mass and it is given by 0 at x 2 h in the experiment the landslide is initiated by vertically dropping the gate the gate has significant effect on the granular flows and then on the waves in the experiments of collapsing dry granular columns an upward moving gate reduces the flow front velocity and decreases the front advance ionescu et al 2015 in our numerical simulations the landslide is initiated by suddenly removing the force that keeps the granular material in place the navier slip boundary condition is imposed on the rigid bed which includes the slope and the flat bed for the sediment phase the wall function that relies on the existence of a logarithmic region in the velocity profile ferziger and peric 2002 is implemented on the rigid bed for the fluid phase four wave gauges are installed at 0 6 m 1 6 m 2 6 m and 3 6 m from the gate to record the time series of surface displacement at these locations this study concerns the effects of particle size and bed condition spherical particles with five diameters 0 1 0 4 0 8 2 and 4 mm are used these correspond to very fine sand medium sand coarse sand granules and pebbles on the wentworth scale two bed conditions are used they are β 0 d corresponding to a rough bed and β 40 d smooth bed other parameters are fixed 4 results and discussions this section presents the simulated results after validating the model lee et al 2019 this section examines how landslides and impulsive waves respond to changes in the particle size and the bed condition 4 1 validation the model lee et al 2019 is applied to reproduce the experiment of grilli et al 2017 with glass beads of d 4 mm in their experiment lowering the gate at a speed of around 1 m s can induce a downward current in the simulation the validation case the initial velocity u f 0 1 m s is set in the region of 0 28 m x 1 0 29 m and x 2 0 295 m to account for effects of the current on the landslide process the smooth bed is used in the experiment so β 40 d is adopted in the simulation fig 3 presents the computed sliding process the dependence of the results on the cell size is checked the two cell sizes of 2 mm and 4 mm in height give nearly identical sliding processes the difference in the location of the granular flow front at t 0 47 is within 3 of li the cell size of 2 mm is adopted in this study a total of 229 447 computational cells are used a 5 s of physical time takes 2 days using 30 threads on a workstation with two central processing units intel xeon gold 6130 cpu the observed sliding process grilli et al 2017 is also included in fig 3 for comparison the computed flow front travels slower than the measured ones at t 0 47 s the measured flow front reaches x 1 53 cm but the computed one 49 cm the computed flow front is sharper than the observed one the thickness t is underestimated by around 50 the results of the numerical experiments suggest that the downward current can significantly affect the landslide process and its shape the downward currents with velocities of 0 m s 0 5 m s and 1m s give i the maximum sliding speeds of 0 6 m s 0 66 m s and 0 69 m s and ii the amplitude of the first wave of 0 54 cm 0 5 cm and 0 49 cm at gauge 1 respectively to improve agreement the moving gate should be simulated but doing so involves extra numerical difficulties grilli et al 2017 used the model of ma et al 2015 to reproduce their experiment their numerical landslide moved faster than both their observed and our computed landslides additionally their numerical landslide was too flat to increase computational efficiency the model of ma et al 2015 solves the one layer depth averaged equations for a landslide however that model does not consider the particle particle and particle fluid interactions bouchut et al 2017 used an advanced depth averaged model with the dilatancy effect to simulate the collapses of submerged granular column and also had the overestimated spread velocity fig 4 displays computed time series of water surface displacements η superposed on the measured time series for comparison the wave gauges seemed not to be synchronized with the camera grilli et al 2017 in fig 4 the measured surface displacements are shifted to have the arrival time of the first measured wave crest at gauge 1 consistent with the computed one the computed time series agree with the measured ones at the four gauges except for a slight overestimation of amplitudes at gauge 1 the leading double n waves followed by a train of smaller waves can be recognized in both the experiment and our simulation when propagating to gauges 2 4 the leading waves become a series of larger waves on account of dispersion and their periods increase it is remarked that although the computed granular flow dynamics are different to the observed ones the generated waves are well reproduced the possible reason is that the waves run g h 1 8 m s faster than the granular flows 0 69 m s therefore only the early stage of landslide has effects on the waves it can be seen in fig 3 that the computed landslide shape is similar to the measured one at t 0 17 s but the difference becomes significant at t 0 47 s 4 2 sliding process and consequently generated waves in reality the slope down which a granular mass slides is typically rough and the gate does not exist the rough bed is adopted β 0 d and the initial downward current that is caused by that gate is not considered in the simulations herein the computed underwater landslide and the resultant waves with d 4 mm are shown in fig 5 the flow fields are presented in fig 6 where pd is the hydrodynamic pressure and is defined by p d p f ρ f g h x 2 where x 2 is the axis in the vertical direction it can be seen in fig 5 that the surface of the granular mass flattens out as the flow front moves forward from t 0 s to 0 4 s the granular mass then continuously slides down and its length increases during t 0 4 1 s the flow front touches the flat bed at t 1 s the granular mass gradually accumulates at the slope toe the motion of the granular mass generates water waves when t 0 2 s the water surface is depressed fronted by a positive wave with a mild crest then a hump forms on the water surface from x 1 20 cm to x 1 30 cm at t 0 4 s the surface disturbance due to this hump propagates as two secondary waves of which one propagates to left and the other to right the former one runs up on the slope from t 0 4 s to 0 6 s and runs down from t 0 6 s to 1 s when t 2 s the long waves have left the landslide however some small fluctuations in the water surface are present over the granular mass as depicted in fig 6 the landslide induces a huge vortex at t 0 2 s and 0 4 s which is responsible for the hump at t 0 4 s three small vortexes are observed behind the flow front at t 0 8 s possibly due to the shear induced instability these vortexes produce small ripples on the surface of the granular mass at t 2 s these vortexes lifted from the surface of the granular mass the pressure distribution pd is similar to the distribution of flow past a blunt body in which the pressure is positive on the weather side the negative pressure which accompanies the vortexes penetrates the granular mass 4 3 effects of particle size this section investigates the effects of particle size on landslides and the resultant impulsive waves both the rough bed β 0 d and the smooth bed β 40 d are considered the trajectories and velocities of landslides are presented the impulsive waves are discussed in terms of the amplitudes of their first crest their first trough and their second crest 4 3 1 rough bed this section begins with the landslide kinematics fig 7 depicts the trajectories of landslides on the rough bed for the five particle sizes regardless of particle size the granular masses slide down the slope when t 1 s the effect of particle size on the trajectories of landslide mass is insignificant at t 1 s but becomes significant at t 1 s for example when d 0 4 mm the masses gradually accumulate at the slope toe however the granular mass with d 0 1 mm rises and falls repeatedly the absolute mass averaged velocities of the landslides u called the landslide speed hereafter are shown in fig 8 for the five particle sizes three stages can be identified in fig 8 the acceleration stage e g t 0 4 s for d 4 mm the stage of nearly constant velocity 0 4 s t 1 s and the deceleration stage t 1 s table 2 lists the maximum sliding speed at the first peak u max and the mean acceleration in the acceleration stage t 0 4 s ao all u max are smaller than the speed g h i 1 ρ f ρ s 0 73 m s according to the potential energy probably as a result of the complex interstitial flow inside the granular mass u max differs significantly from the settling velocity of individual particles for example for the particle of d 0 1 mm u max 0 53 m s and the settling velocity is approximately 0 008 m s additionally u max is less than the wave speed g h 1 8 m s so the impulsive waves run away from the landslide and the build up of those waves is limited harbitz et al 2006 the particle size has strong and negative effects on u max and ao the very fine sand d 0 1 mm has 2 3 times u max and 2 5 times ao of the pebble d 4 mm fig 9 illustrates the flow fields for d 0 1 mm compared with d 4 mm fig 6 d 0 1 mm leads to stronger vortices due to the faster sliding velocity smaller particles have a slower settling velocity and are more easily to be entrained into water flows accordingly the flow front located at x 1 40 cm for d 0 1 mm is blunter at t 0 4 s and the mixing process for d 0 1 mm is intenser the mixing process contributes to the suspension of all particles with d 0 1 mm and causes the center of mass to rise and fall repeatedly the distribution of pd differs between d 0 1 mm and d 4 mm excess pore pressure positive pressure exists inside the landslide mass at t 0 2 s when d 0 1 mm but not when d 4 mm the excess pore pressure decreases friction between particles and favors the landslide the impulsive waves in the far field are investigated following ataie ashtiani 2008 the three amplitudes a of the first crest the first trough and the second crest are examined fig 10 depicts a recorded at gauges 3 and 4 for the five particle sizes generally a for gauge 4 is smaller than that for gauge 3 which is consistent with previously obtained analytical results viroulet et al 2013 the amplitudes of the first trough and the second crest are larger than that of the first crest the previous study of grilli and watts 2005 suggests that a is positively related to ao our results reveal a negative relationship between ao and d hence a is expected to decrease as d increases which relationship is revealed in fig 10 except for a small fluctuation in the second crest for d 0 8 mm within 0 2 mm for gauge 3 the effect of particle size on the wave amplitude is significant the wave amplitude of the second wave crest for d 0 1 mm is 1 72 times as larger as that for d 4 mm the experiment results of ataie ashtiani 2008 who used block slides suggest the ratio between a of the first trough and that of the second crest is 0 3 but the results herein for granular slides yields a ratio of 0 3 1 1 the particle size has a negligible effect on the wave period double the duration from the first trough to the second crest the wave periods are 1 08 0 04 s herein 4 3 2 smooth bed to understand the effect of bed condition simulations using a smooth bed are carried out in this section the results obtained here are compared with those obtained using the rough bed which were presented in section 4 3 1 fig 11 presents the trajectories of landslides on the smooth bed for the five particle sizes comparing figs 7 and 11 reveals that the trajectories on the smooth bed are similar to those on the rough bed with the minor difference that the landslide masses on the smooth bed can move farther away from the slope toe fig 12 plots the time series of landslide speeds on the smooth bed for the five particle sizes the corresponding values of u max and ao are provided in table 3 compared with the rough bed see fig 8 and table 3 i the smooth bed yields a much faster u max and a much higher ao ii the stages of nearly constant velocity are shorter and even disappear e g d 4 mm and iii u in the deceleration stage decreases more rapidly for d 0 4 mm furthermore changing the bed condition alters the u max d and a o d relationships these two relationships become concave and non monotonic for the smooth bed fig 13 depicts the amplitudes versus d for a smooth bed overall the amplitudes over the smooth bed can largely exceed those over the rough bed because ao is larger the second wave crest over the smooth bed is larger than that over the rough bed by 140 the a d relationships for the first trough and the second crest are strongly related to the a o d relationship the ratio of a for the second crest to that of the first trough ranges from 0 76 to 1 2 surprisingly a of the first crest decreases as d increases and this relationship is inconsistent with the a o d relationship to elucidate that inconsistence the flow fields near the flow fronts at t 0 4 s for the three different particle sizes are shown in fig 14 at that instant the first positive waves are just in front of the flow front the effects of particle size on the shape and the velocity fields are substantial finer particles create blunter flow fronts at x 1 40 cm leading to stronger water flow near the flow front but weaker flow above the granular mass the shape effect maybe responsible for the inconsistency between the a d and a o d relationships although that shape is believed to have only a minor effect on wave generation ataie ashtiani 2008 4 3 3 discussions on pore pressure it was mentioned in section 4 3 1 that the excess pore pressure existed inside the granular mass for the very fine sand d 0 1 mm this section discusses how the excess pore pressure forms and how it affects the landslide over the rough bed previous experimental studies rondon et al 2011 have demonstrated that the initial packing can affect the pore pressure owing to the contractancy dilatancy behavior of a granular material and the pore pressure plays an important role in the underwater landslide process the initial loose packing can yield contractancy behavior and then excess pore pressure favoring the landslide process the initial dense packing yields the opposite results this study uses the initial loose packing and the contractancy behavior is produced numerically for d 4 mm 0 1 mm c increases from 0 55 to 0 554 0 552 within t 0 2 s at the location of a in fig 2 the contractancy behavior generates the excess pore pressure p d 51 pa 338 pa for d 4 mm 0 1 mm at t 0 01 s which has the similar order of the magnitude as in the simulations of submerged granular collapse by bouchut et al 2017 then the high pore pressure dissipates since the permeability is higher for the larger particles das 2013 pd for d 4 mm dissipates more quickly than pd for d 0 1 mm at t 0 2 s p d 47 pa for d 4 mm but 114 pa for d 0 1 mm the faster dissipation of the excess pore pressure for the larger particles is the probable reason leading to the negative u max d and a o d relationships 4 3 4 discussions on bed condition changing the bed condition alters the u max d and a o d relationships these relationships are negative and monotonic for the rough bed they become concave and non monotonic when the bed is smooth for the smooth bed increasing the particle size not only decreases the permeability but also increases the slip length the lower permeability yields a slower u max and a lower ao but the longer slip increases them explaining the concave and non monotonic u max d and a o d relationships for the smooth bed 4 4 sensitivity analysis parametric analyses are performed with respect to cc b k and τp the numerical conditions used here are the same as those used in section 4 1 the former three parameters are related to the contraction or the dilation and to the formation of the excess pore pressure in these analyses cc varies from 0 585 to 0 615 and b from 0 75 to 1 according to previous studies boyer et al 2011 revilbauudard and chauchat 2013 k varies from 107 pa to 109 pa τp is related to the dissipation of the excess pore pressure the formulas of richardson and zaki 1954 and engelund 1953 to compute τp are used in addition to that of lee and huang 2018 in the previous studies of lee and huang 2018 the three parameters cc b and k have significant effects on collapse process over a flat bed in a high viscous fluid but changing the formula to compute τp dose not in this study these parameters cc b k and τp have insignificant effects on the slide process in water and on the waves changing cc b and k yield smaller than 2 differences in both u max and a of the first wave crest changing the formula for τp causes 2 difference in u max and 4 difference in a of the first wave crest since water used here is much less viscous than the fluid used in lee and huang 2018 the excess pore pressure has shorter duration to influence the landslide in this study than in lee and huang 2018 this maybe the reason why u max and a are relatively insensitive to cc b and k which are related to the formation of the excess pore pressure the effects of reynolds stress and turbulent dispersion on u max as well as a are also examined the reynolds stress has neglectable effect on u max and a 1 difference possibly because the viscoplastic component of stress dominates dense granular flows the effect of turbulent dispersion increases u max by 6 and a by 4 possibly because the turbulent dispersion distributes the particles over a wider area decreasing the concentration and reduces the friction 5 conclusions this paper presents the numerical study of underwater landslides on the inclined planes and their resultant waves with emphases on the two important factors the particle size and the bed condition the multi phase flow model developed by lee and huang 2018 is applied and the navier slip condition is newly incorporated into this model to account for the bed condition the following conclusions can be drawn from this numerical study the contraction of the granular mass plays an important role in the early stage of the landslide yielding the excess pore pressure and favoring the landslide the particle size affects the permeability and the dissipation of the excess pore pressure and it then influences the landslide kinematics as well as the waves additionally the particle size and the bed condition have effects on the slip length affecting the landslide kinematics and then the waves too the numerical results reveal the strong effects of the particle size and the bed condition on the landslide kinematics and the waves using different particle size can change the landslide speed and the wave amplitude by up to 130 and 150 respectively the changes can be up to 140 and 170 in the landslide speed and in the wave amplitude due to the bed condition the bed condition can significantly change i the relationship between the landslide speed and the particle diameter and ii the relationship between the wave amplitude and the particle diameter for the rough bed zero slip length these two relationships are negative because the particle size negatively affects the permeability for the smooth bed these two relationships become concave due to the positive effect of the particle size on the slip length and the negative effect of the particle size on the permeability the model of lee and huang 2018 does not consider the dilatancy angle which is important in submarine granular flows in the future work the dilatancy

574,terrestrial water storage tws experienced a substantial change in the past few decades as detected by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace however the major causes of this change remain unclear and none of the current state of the art process based hydrological models are able to reproduce the significantly drying wetting trends in grace tws here we investigate 12 terrestrial regions that show a significantly drying wetting trend using partial least square regression plsr to relate tws anomalies to various climatic variables and leaf area index lai through plsr modeling we find changes in lai downward longwave radiation dlw and precipitation are most strongly associated with a wetting trend increases in precipitation appear to be responsible for the wetting trend in tropical subtropical monsoon regions while decreases in vegetation transpiration and atmospheric demand appear to be responsible for the wetting trend in extratropical regions enhanced atmospheric demand caused by increases in air temperature and the resulting enhanced dlw dominates the significant drying trend in the mid latitude subtropical drylands and in the cold and alpine regions the plsr modeling also suggests that over global continents the climatic forcing factors show a dominant impact on tws over all the wetting regions while only four out of the seven drying regions show climate dominated drying implying an additional impact of anthropogenic responses to the water stress on drying keywords climatic forcing drought drying terrestrial water storage change wetting 1 introduction in a warming world changes in global precipitation distribution increases in the annual range of precipitation chou et al 2013 and the loss of glaciers and ice caps jacob et al 2012 can strongly impact the terrestrial water storage tws dynamics however the factors responsible for the long term tws trends remain poorly understood and the current state of the art process based models significantly underestimate the tws trends derived from the gravity fields of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites scanlon et al 2018 while droughts are in principle related to feedbacks linking the land and atmosphere berg et al 2016 changes in plant water use efficiency ponce campos et al 2013 large scale vegetation browning zhou et al 2014 and biomass decrease zhang et al 2018 the actual mechanisms resulting in the observed drying trends continue to be debated sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 recently rodell et al 2018 quantified the tws trends over 34 regions using the grace derived tws and attribute the drivers to natural interannual variability unsustainable groundwater consumption climate change or combinations of these drivers however the dominant climatic forcing factors for the terrestrial drying and wetting trends are not quantified and still remain unclear the grace data provide a unique source of global continental scale information about tws changes including glacier and ice cap melting chen et al 2011 groundwater depletion rodell et al 2009 chen et al 2016 surface water variations ni et al 2017 and other components of the water cycle niu et al 2007 tws anomalies inferred from grace provide direct estimates of tws dynamics because the current process based models are not able to reproduce the grace tws trends scanlon et al 2018 we attempt to quantify the major contributions of climate forcing factors to the grace tws trends using a statistical model namely the partial least square regression plsr abdi 2010 in this study plsr built upon the strengths of relationships between tws anomaly and various forcing factors associated with water and energy cycles and ecosystem dynamics can be used to fit the tws changes and thus quantify the relative contributions of a factor to the tws change in this study we first identified the regions with the most significant drying wetting trends and quantified the contributions of dominant climatic forcing factors to the tws change to gain an insight into the underlying mechanisms for the tws change more specifically we aim to answer questions 1 what are the dominant climate forcing factors in each drying wetting region 2 can a single climate forcing factor explain the drying and wetting trends in a region and 3 what is the strongest climate forcing and its latitude zonality for the recent terrestrial drying wetting 2 methods 2 1 data the tws anomaly data product spanning april 2002 december 2016 hereafter referred to as the grace period is derived from the gravity fields of the grace twin satellites advances in grace processing from traditional spherical harmonics to more recent mass concentration mascon solutions have improved the signal to noise ratio and spatial localization while reducing uncertainties scanlon et al 2016 save et al 2016 in this study we averaged three grace tws anomaly data sets rl05 mascon released by geoforschungs zentrum potsdam center for space research university of texas austin and the jet propulsion laboratory to reduce the noise associated with different solutions sakumura et al 2014 to build the regression model plsr we used the global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas 2 beaudoing and rodell 2016 near surface atmospheric variables such as air temperature ta air pressure pres precipitation prec specific humidity sh wind speed ws downward shortwave radiation dsw and downward longwave radiation dlw as the dominant climatic factors these atmospheric variables are used to drive various land surface models including those routinely used in gldas such as noah mosaic variable infiltration capacity and the community land model we also computed vapor pressure deficit vpd and potential evaporation pe from the above variables and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis leaf area index lai for use in the statistical analysis and as independent variables in the regression model vpd computed from ta and sh reflects the atmospheric demand for water vapor to reach saturation at ta in addition to vpd pe accounts for the impacts of net energy inputs and ws on the atmospheric demand vegetation is an important facet of memory in the water cycle through plant roots uptake of root zone soil water dirmeyer et al 2009 we used lai as an indicator for subsurface water loss through plants transpiration accordingly these factors form the basis of a data set to study the climatic factors contributing to the observed variability of tws anomaly we compiled these data as global 1 monthly anomalies relative to their mean values over the period from 2004 to 2009 the same period used to compute the grace tws anomaly 2 2 statistical analysis methods we first identified terrestrial regions that show significant trends in tws at each 1 x 1 grid we resampled the original monthly tws anomaly time series from 2002 to 2016 into 12 time series by the 12 months of a year detected the monotonic trends using the mann kendall non parametric test and achieved unbiased estimators of trends by the theil sen estimator we then detected and recorded grids with all the 12 time series showing consistent trends with a significant level of 5 rather than using the entire tws anomaly time series to estimate trends using the multiple 12 time series in this study helps effectively exclude the disturbance of seasonality from the detection of regions with a most significant trend to achieve a robust result finally we identified the regions with a significant drying wetting trend by displaying the recorded grids with all the 12 time series showing consistently significant trends in addition we performed a moving average analysis to compare the trends in the normalized regional mean of the climate forcing factors and the tws anomaly for each region time lagged cross correlation is a measure of similarity between two time series the value of the lag with the highest correlation represents the best fit between the two series as such we performed the time lagged cross correlation analyses between the time series of each climate forcing factor and the time lagged grace tws anomaly time series to estimate the time delay then the globally optimal time lag for each climatic forcing factor was gained when the number of grid point with a significance cross correlation with a significant level of 1 reaches its maximum 2 3 plsr we used the partial least square regression plsr to estimate the monthly tws anomaly in response to the monthly climate forcing factors table 1 with a sample size of 153 months from april 2002 to december 2016 considering the globally optimal time lags plsr can analyze large data of numerous climate variables predictors with strong collinearity and noise and the regression coefficient of each climatic variables resulting from plsr reflects the correlation strength of a predictor with the response variable abdi 2010 vinzi et al 2010 or the relative importance of each climatic variable for the tws anomaly a larger value of the coefficient indicates a greater importance of a specific climatic variable while the sign of the coefficient suggests either positive or negative effect of the variable to avoid a multi collinearity problem induced by correlations between the climate forcing factors when conducting regression we used plsr with leave one out cross validation to develop a linear model for estimating the monthly tws anomaly response as a function of the climate forcing factors the plsr regression was accomplished using the pls package in r we also computed the coefficients of determination of the modeled tws anomaly resulting from plsr as an explanatory variable of the observed tws anomaly using r 3 results 3 1 time lagged cross correlations the cross correlations between the climate forcing anomalies and the time lagged grace tws anomaly with a significant level of 1 were shown for global continents except antarctica and greenland in fig 1 globally the time lag for the maximum cross correlation is two months for most of the factors except that the time lag for dsw and pres is three months fig 1 the distribution of the cross correlation coefficients exhibits an obvious latitudinal pattern overall the spatial patterns of the cross correlation coefficients are similar for dsw ta pe and vpd regions with latitudes greater than 30 n s or lower than 15 n s tend to be negative correlation zones while the other regions tend to be positive correlation zones this pattern is because dsw heats the land surface and enhances ta which subsequently increases vpd and pe the cross correlations of the tws anomaly with dlw and sh anomalies present similar spatial patterns showing positive correlations in low latitudes and negative correlations in mid and high latitudes an increase in sh or water vapor strengthens the infra red radiation emitted from the atmosphere to the ground surface or dlw the correlation between sh and dlw is regarded as a major cause of the positive water vapor feedback to global warming held and soden 2000 the similar spatial patterns are most likely a result of positive correlations between these climate forcing factors the positive correlation between the prec anomaly and the tws anomaly occurs at latitudes lower than 50 n at the same time there are two regions showing a negative correlation between the two in the northern high latitudes higher lai produces lower tws in the amazon tropical forests regions with latitudes greater than 30 n in north america and those greater than 45 n in eurasia however higher lai values are associated with higher tws in the middle and south africa australia compared to other forcing factors the ws and pres anomalies exhibit weak correlations with the tws anomaly globally inverse correlations exist in different latitudinal regions the latitudinal pattern of the cross correlation relationships may be attributed to the hadley cell and the positional variance of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the latitudes around 30 n s dominated by the downward limb of the hadley cell approximately serves as a line of division for most of the land where the cross correlations are either insignificant or opposite to other places fig 1 while the latitudinal division is closer to 45 n in eastern asia due to the northward shift of itcz the position of itcz impacts the tropical climate and the hadley cell through migration of low pressures lechleitner et al 2017 shifts in itcz respond primarily to variations in the mean northern hemisphere temperature deplazes et al 2013 and are drawn toward the heating sources outside the tropics hwang and frierson 2013 jo et al 2014 which can explain the itcz s propagates northward over 30 n in eastern asia on the other hand the delayed responses of the tws anomaly to the climate forcing factors caused by the seasonal shift of the sun s zenith point over land may result in the inverse correlations in latitudinal regions the position of itcz tends to follow the sun s zenith point over land with a time lag of about 1 to 2 months suggesting that the migration of seasonal tropical storms and monsoons would lag behind surface climate variables such as ta dsw dlw pres vpd and pe which are closely related with the sun s zenith point position the spatial and temporal distribution of global precipitation is influenced by the position of itcz moreover variations in precipitation may exert direct impacts on changes in tws this may explain the time lags of the strongest cross correlations between the climatic factors and the tws anomaly but further work is needed to better understand these processes and mechanisms 3 2 terrestrial drying wetting regions regions where the tws anomaly trends persist for all the months of a year indicate hot spots of change excluding antarctic and greenland most are in the northern hemisphere showing a decreasing trend in tws fig 2 during 2002 2016 the grace data period many arid and semiarid regions show drying trends including the sonoran and chihuahuan deserts r4 central argentina and patagonia plateau r5 middle east r8 northern sahara ganges and indus basins r9 and northern china r11 similarly portions of the cold regions and those with mountain glaciers and snow also show decreasing trends including the mountainous area of the alaska gulf r1 central canada r2 and himalayan mountains r9 meanwhile the extratropics and monsoonal regions show increasing trends including the labrador plateau and peninsula r3 western sahel r6 southwest african plateau r7 central south russia r10 and southern china r12 3 3 the plsr modeling results we use plsr to model the grace tws anomaly by selecting among ten explanatory variables table 1 that are intimately linked with regional tws through the water balance of a region prec represents the major water input while pe vpd ws and ta affect water loss through evapotranspiration et higher ta results in larger pe due to enhanced water vapor holding capacity while higher ws can enhance actual water loss through et changes in transpirative water loss can be approximately indicated by lai with increases being related to enhanced loss of soil moisture and shallow groundwater via roots dsw dlw and ta indicate available energy for et melting of snow and ice and plant physiological processes the plsr modeled monthly tws anomaly matches well the grace derived tws anomaly in terms of seasonal variations and trends from 2004 to 2016 fig 2 plsr captures well the decreasing trends and increasing spatial variances in seven drying regions in the mid latitudes fig 2 both the plsr modeled and grace derived tws anomaly show a drying trend with enhanced spatial variances more apparently since 2012 in these regions suggesting an increasing frequency of severe droughts within these regions therefore droughts may have become more frequent and severe in these mid latitude drying regions since 2012 in addition to the climatic impacts other factors such as human water use and crustal deformation rodell et al 2018 may contribute to the grace tws variations anthropogenic greenhouse gasses aerosols emissions and land use changes may jointly influence some of the climatic factors e g temperature mildrexler et al 2018 precipitation sarojini et al 2016 and et zhang et al 2017 for this reason without considering these anthropogenic factors plsr produces the major temporal and spatial variations as well as trends that are comparable with the grace tws fig 2 suggesting a dominant impact of climate change there are nine out of the 12 regions having sufficiently high goodness of fit with the coefficients of determination being larger than 0 5 the corresponding correlation coefficient is larger than 0 7 suggesting that climatic forcing factors are the dominant controls fig 3 the 10 forcing factors explain more than 50 of the grace tws change in all the five wetting regions but in only four of the seven drying regions suggesting additional impacts of socioeconomic responses to water shortage which exacerbate the drying trends in these drying regions the contribution of the climatic forcing factors is not as dominant as in the wetting regions due to additional anthropogenic impacts for example in the arid and semi arid northern china r11 the climate factors explains only 28 of the grace because a huge amount of fossil groundwater has been pumped to meet the irrigation and domestic demands under an increasing water stress in recent years feng et al 2013 the plsr modeling suggests that over global continents the climate forcing factors show a dominant impact over all the wetting regions but not all the drying regions implying additional impacts of anthropogenic responses to water stress 4 discussion while the plsr coefficients for the 10 climate factors can indicate which factors are predominantly associated with the tws change the largest weights for a specific factor explain on average only 27 4 of the variations and no single factor is able to provide an adequate explanation nonetheless two to four factors can explain more than 60 table 2 and based on this lai dlw and prec appear to be major factors associated with wetting trends while ta and dlw are associated with drying trends although dlw shows association with tws changes in eight regions distinctly different mechanisms can cause drying and wetting in a given region as explained below based on the major factors explaining more than 60 of tws variances and trends for a region climate forcing factors responsible for the recent terrestrial drying and wetting are thus identified in tropical and subtropical monsoon regions r6 r7 r12 terrestrial wetting is most strongly related positively with increasing prec fig 4 in the western sahel of africa r6 major factors appear to be dlw lai and prec with prec strongly controlled by land ocean thermal contrasts and unstable conditions in the lower troposphere yamada et al 2013 in the southwest african plateau r7 major factors appear to be lai pres prec and dlw decreasing pres is inversely related to tws change suggesting increases in probability of prec causing lai to increase in southern china r12 major factors include pe dlw and prec increasing dlw may be a result of increase in lower atmospheric water vapor and air pollutants while tws and pe are inversely correlated and intensification of the global summer monsoon directly promotes a wet gets wetter trend wang et al 2012 in extratropical regions of the northern hemisphere r3 r10 terrestrial wetting is mainly induced by reduced water loss through transpiration and atmospheric demand in the labrador plateau and peninsula r3 major factors appear to be lai vpd pe and dsw all inversely related to tws change with declining lai suggesting decreased vegetation consumption in central south russia r10 major factors appear to be dsw dlw and vpd with declines in dsw and vpd promoting increases in tws with warming the areal extents of mid latitude drylands r4 r5 r8 r11 have been expanding feng and fu 2013 with declining trends in tws following the pattern of dry gets drier through enhanced evaporation and anthropogenic groundwater depletion in southwestern america r4 including the sonoran and chihuahuan deserts severe droughts have occurred during the grace period fernando et al 2016 plsr indicates the major contributing factors to be pe ta ws and lai with declining tws accompanied by increasing pe and ws which can promote increases in actual et in central argentina and the patagonia plateau r5 dominant factors appear to be dsw ta dlw and vpd along with accelerated melting of the patagonia glacier willis et al 2012 and significant groundwater depletion due to droughts chen et al 2010 increased ta enhances atmospheric water vapor holding capacity and the resulting enhanced vpd and pe may be responsible for exacerbating the drying trend over the arabian desert and the karakum desert in the middle east r8 major explanatory factors appear to be ta dlw and pe decreasing tws can be explained mainly by increasing pe caused by increasing ta and dlw especially since 2011 this represents a typical dry gets drier paradigm exacerbated by anthropogenic groundwater pumping to survive droughts voss et al 2013 in north china r11 major climatic factors appear to be dsw dlw and pe with increasing dlw being strongly associated with declining tws due to increased energy available for et while inter annual variations in pe explain the inter annual variations of tws in this region groundwater pumping for irrigation strongly depletes tws feng et al 2013 and tws variations are relatively insensitive to precipitation changes yi et al 2016 in high latitude cold regions of the northern hemisphere decreasing tws is mainly caused by melting of snowpack permafrost and glaciers due to warming temperatures in the mountainous area of the alaska gulf r1 with peak elevations above 6000 m grace derived glacial melt is significant at a rate of 46 7 gt yr jacob et al 2012 here major factors for tws change appear to be ta ws and dlw with rapid increases in ta since 2013 likely accelerating mountain glacier melting and ws being positively correlated with tws in central canada r2 major factors appear to be dlw and ta dlw and ta being positively correlated with increases in both producing tws declines through reduced snow cover and drying of lakes bouchard et al 2013 in the himalayan mountains and ganges and indus basins r9 tws shows a downward trend with glacier melt contributing at a relatively low rate of 5 6 gt yr jacob et al 2012 and irrigation through groundwater extraction significantly depleting water storage along the indus chen et al 2014 contributing climatic factors appear to be sh vpd and prec with tws following variations in prec while the latter does not show an obvious decreasing trend declining tws is well explained by drying of the atmosphere as indicated by decreasing sh and increasing vpd suggesting that increased atmospheric water vapor demand may promote et and sublimation in this study we used only the climatic forcing factors to feed plsr to reproduce the grace tws variations for lack of reliable global data of pumping water diversion and water use neglecting these anthropogenic factors may be a major cause of the deviations of the modeled tws anomaly from the observed plsr can deal with multiple mechanisms of wetting or drying as indicated by the two to four independent factors identified through plsr as the dominant factors within a region however plsr neglects the feedback mechanisms between grace tws anomaly and those of the 10 climate factors the tws change is not only a response to climate variability but also directly exerts feedbacks to the energy water and carbon cycles recently the impact of variability in tws on ecosystem responses to temperature changes velicogna et al 2015 atmospheric co2 growth rate humphrey et al 2018 and polar motion śliwińska et al 2019 has been increasingly reported the feedback effects of terrestrial drying wetting on ecosystem functioning e g lai in this study and the climatic forcing factors should be addressed in future efforts using mechanistic physically based models 5 conclusions terrestrial water storage the fundamental source for fresh water supplies has experienced a substantial change over the past one or more decades 2003 2016 as detected by the grace twin satellites most notable has been the drying trend in global drylands however the major causes for this change remain unclear here we investigate 12 terrestrial regions that show a significant terrestrial drying or wetting trend we find that droughts have become more frequent and severe in the mid latitude drylands since 2012 through plsr modeling we also find distinct differences in the explanatory variables for the drying and wetting trends in different latitudinal bands increases in precipitation due to global intensification of the monsoons are responsible for the wetting in tropical subtropical monsoon regions while decreases in vegetation transpiration and atmospheric demand are responsible for the wetting in the extratropical regions meanwhile increases in air temperature and downward longwave radiation enhance atmospheric demand which should be primarily responsible for the significant drying in the mid latitude subtropical drylands and in the cold regions and alpine regions due to melting of snow ice increased potential evaporation is also an important factor for the drying in the middle east the northern china sonoran and chihuahuan deserts in southwestern america in addition the plsr modeling suggests that over global continents the climate forcing factors show a dominant impact over all wetting regions but not all the drying regions implying additional impacts of anthropogenic responses to water stress which exacerbated the drying trends contributing significantly to terrestrial drying in mid latitude drylands author

factors table 1 with a sample size of 153 months from april 2002 to december 2016 considering the globally optimal time lags plsr can analyze large data of numerous climate variables predictors with strong collinearity and noise and the regression coefficient of each climatic variables resulting from plsr reflects the correlation strength of a predictor with the response variable abdi 2010 vinzi et al 2010 or the relative importance of each climatic variable for the tws anomaly a larger value of the coefficient indicates a greater importance of a specific climatic variable while the sign of the coefficient suggests either positive or negative effect of the variable to avoid a multi collinearity problem induced by correlations between the climate forcing factors when conducting regression we used plsr with leave one out cross validation to develop a linear model for estimating the monthly tws anomaly response as a function of the climate forcing factors the plsr regression was accomplished using the pls package in r we also computed the coefficients of determination of the modeled tws anomaly resulting from plsr as an explanatory variable of the observed tws anomaly using r 3 results 3 1 time lagged cross correlations the cross correlations between the climate forcing anomalies and the time lagged grace tws anomaly with a significant level of 1 were shown for global continents except antarctica and greenland in fig 1 globally the time lag for the maximum cross correlation is two months for most of the factors except that the time lag for dsw and pres is three months fig 1 the distribution of the cross correlation coefficients exhibits an obvious latitudinal pattern overall the spatial patterns of the cross correlation coefficients are similar for dsw ta pe and vpd regions with latitudes greater than 30 n s or lower than 15 n s tend to be negative correlation zones while the other regions tend to be positive correlation zones this pattern is because dsw heats the land surface and enhances ta which subsequently increases vpd and pe the cross correlations of the tws anomaly with dlw and sh anomalies present similar spatial patterns showing positive correlations in low latitudes and negative correlations in mid and high latitudes an increase in sh or water vapor strengthens the infra red radiation emitted from the atmosphere to the ground surface or dlw the correlation between sh and dlw is regarded as a major cause of the positive water vapor feedback to global warming held and soden 2000 the similar spatial patterns are most likely a result of positive correlations between these climate forcing factors the positive correlation between the prec anomaly and the tws anomaly occurs at latitudes lower than 50 n at the same time there are two regions showing a negative correlation between the two in the northern high latitudes higher lai produces lower tws in the amazon tropical forests regions with latitudes greater than 30 n in north america and those greater than 45 n in eurasia however higher lai values are associated with higher tws in the middle and south africa australia compared to other forcing factors the ws and pres anomalies exhibit weak correlations with the tws anomaly globally inverse correlations exist in different latitudinal regions the latitudinal pattern of the cross correlation relationships may be attributed to the hadley cell and the positional variance of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the latitudes around 30 n s dominated by the downward limb of the hadley cell approximately serves as a line of division for most of the land where the cross correlations are either insignificant or opposite to other places fig 1 while the latitudinal division is closer to 45 n in eastern asia due to the northward shift of itcz the position of itcz impacts the tropical climate and the hadley cell through migration of low pressures lechleitner et al 2017 shifts in itcz respond primarily to variations in the mean northern hemisphere temperature deplazes et al 2013 and are drawn toward the heating sources outside the tropics hwang and frierson 2013 jo et al 2014 which can explain the itcz s propagates northward over 30 n in eastern asia on the other hand the delayed responses of the tws anomaly to the climate forcing factors caused by the seasonal shift of the sun s zenith point over land may result in the inverse correlations in latitudinal regions the position of itcz tends to follow the sun s zenith point over land with a time lag of about 1 to 2 months suggesting that the migration of seasonal tropical storms and monsoons would lag behind surface climate variables such as ta dsw dlw pres vpd and pe which are closely related with the sun s zenith point position the spatial and temporal distribution of global precipitation is influenced by the position of itcz moreover variations in precipitation may exert direct impacts on changes in tws this may explain the time lags of the strongest cross correlations between the climatic factors and the tws anomaly but further work is needed to better understand these processes and mechanisms 3 2 terrestrial drying wetting regions regions where the tws anomaly trends persist for all the months of a year indicate hot spots of change excluding antarctic and greenland most are in the northern hemisphere showing a decreasing trend in tws fig 2 during 2002 2016 the grace data period many arid and semiarid regions show drying trends including the sonoran and chihuahuan deserts r4 central argentina and patagonia plateau r5 middle east r8 northern sahara ganges and indus basins r9 and northern china r11 similarly portions of the cold regions and those with mountain glaciers and snow also show decreasing trends including the mountainous area of the alaska gulf r1 central canada r2 and himalayan mountains r9 meanwhile the extratropics and monsoonal regions show increasing trends including the labrador plateau and peninsula r3 western sahel r6 southwest african plateau r7 central south russia r10 and southern china r12 3 3 the plsr modeling results we use plsr to model the grace tws anomaly by selecting among ten explanatory variables table 1 that are intimately linked with regional tws through the water balance of a region prec represents the major water input while pe vpd ws and ta affect water loss through evapotranspiration et higher ta results in larger pe due to enhanced water vapor holding capacity while higher ws can enhance actual water loss through et changes in transpirative water loss can be approximately indicated by lai with increases being related to enhanced loss of soil moisture and shallow groundwater via roots dsw dlw and ta indicate available energy for et melting of snow and ice and plant physiological processes the plsr modeled monthly tws anomaly matches well the grace derived tws anomaly in terms of seasonal variations and trends from 2004 to 2016 fig 2 plsr captures well the decreasing trends and increasing spatial variances in seven drying regions in the mid latitudes fig 2 both the plsr modeled and grace derived tws anomaly show a drying trend with enhanced spatial variances more apparently since 2012 in these regions suggesting an increasing frequency of severe droughts within these regions therefore droughts may have become more frequent and severe in these mid latitude drying regions since 2012 in addition to the climatic impacts other factors such as human water use and crustal deformation rodell et al 2018 may contribute to the grace tws variations anthropogenic greenhouse gasses aerosols emissions and land use changes may jointly influence some of the climatic factors e g temperature mildrexler et al 2018 precipitation sarojini et al 2016 and et zhang et al 2017 for this reason without considering these anthropogenic factors plsr produces the major temporal and spatial variations as well as trends that are comparable with the grace tws fig 2 suggesting a dominant impact of climate change there are nine out of the 12 regions having sufficiently high goodness of fit with the coefficients of determination being larger than 0 5 the corresponding correlation coefficient is larger than 0 7 suggesting that climatic forcing factors are the dominant controls fig 3 the 10 forcing factors explain more than 50 of the grace tws change in all the five wetting regions but in only four of the seven drying regions suggesting additional impacts of socioeconomic responses to water shortage which exacerbate the drying trends in these drying regions the contribution of the climatic forcing factors is not as dominant as in the wetting regions due to additional anthropogenic impacts for example in the arid and semi arid northern china r11 the climate factors explains only 28 of the grace because a huge amount of fossil groundwater has been pumped to meet the irrigation and domestic demands under an increasing water stress in recent years feng et al 2013 the plsr modeling suggests that over global continents the climate forcing factors show a dominant impact over all the wetting regions but not all the drying regions implying additional impacts of anthropogenic responses to water stress 4 discussion while the plsr coefficients for the 10 climate factors can indicate which factors are predominantly associated with the tws change the largest weights for a specific factor explain on average only 27 4 of the variations and no single factor is able to provide an adequate explanation nonetheless two to four factors can explain more than 60 table 2 and based on this lai dlw and prec appear to be major factors associated with wetting trends while ta and dlw are associated with drying trends although dlw shows association with tws changes in eight regions distinctly different mechanisms can cause drying and wetting in a given region as explained below based on the major factors explaining more than 60 of tws variances and trends for a region climate forcing factors responsible for the recent terrestrial drying and wetting are thus identified in tropical and subtropical monsoon regions r6 r7 r12 terrestrial wetting is most strongly related positively with increasing prec fig 4 in the western sahel of africa r6 major factors appear to be dlw lai and prec with prec strongly controlled by land ocean thermal contrasts and unstable conditions in the lower troposphere yamada et al 2013 in the southwest african plateau r7 major factors appear to be lai pres prec and dlw decreasing pres is inversely related to tws change suggesting increases in probability of prec causing lai to increase in southern china r12 major factors include pe dlw and prec increasing dlw may be a result of increase in lower atmospheric water vapor and air pollutants while tws and pe are inversely correlated and intensification of the global summer monsoon directly promotes a wet gets wetter trend wang et al 2012 in extratropical regions of the northern hemisphere r3 r10 terrestrial wetting is mainly induced by reduced water loss through transpiration and atmospheric demand in the labrador plateau and peninsula r3 major factors appear to be lai vpd pe and dsw all inversely related to tws change with declining lai suggesting decreased vegetation consumption in central south russia r10 major factors appear to be dsw dlw and vpd with declines in dsw and vpd promoting increases in tws with warming the areal extents of mid latitude drylands r4 r5 r8 r11 have been expanding feng and fu 2013 with declining trends in tws following the pattern of dry gets drier through enhanced evaporation and anthropogenic groundwater depletion in southwestern america r4 including the sonoran and chihuahuan deserts severe droughts have occurred during the grace period fernando et al 2016 plsr indicates the major contributing factors to be pe ta ws and lai with declining tws accompanied by increasing pe and ws which can promote increases in actual et in central argentina and the patagonia plateau r5 dominant factors appear to be dsw ta dlw and vpd along with accelerated melting of the patagonia glacier willis et al 2012 and significant groundwater depletion due to droughts chen et al 2010 increased ta enhances atmospheric water vapor holding capacity and the resulting enhanced vpd and pe may be responsible for exacerbating the drying trend over the arabian desert and the karakum desert in the middle east r8 major explanatory factors appear to be ta dlw and pe decreasing tws can be explained mainly by increasing pe caused by increasing ta and dlw especially since 2011 this represents a typical dry gets drier paradigm exacerbated by anthropogenic groundwater pumping to survive droughts voss et al 2013 in north china r11 major climatic factors appear to be dsw dlw and pe with increasing dlw being strongly associated with declining tws due to increased energy available for et while inter annual variations in pe explain the inter annual variations of tws in this region groundwater pumping for irrigation strongly depletes tws feng et al 2013 and tws variations are relatively insensitive to precipitation changes yi et al 2016 in high latitude cold regions of the northern hemisphere decreasing tws is mainly caused by melting of snowpack permafrost and glaciers due to warming temperatures in the mountainous area of the alaska gulf r1 with peak elevations above 6000 m grace derived glacial melt is significant at a rate of 46 7 gt yr jacob et al 2012 here major factors for tws change appear to be ta ws and dlw with rapid increases in ta since 2013 likely accelerating mountain glacier melting and ws being positively correlated with tws in central canada r2 major factors appear to be dlw and ta dlw and ta being positively correlated with increases in both producing tws declines through reduced snow cover and drying of lakes bouchard et al 2013 in the himalayan mountains and ganges and indus basins r9 tws shows a downward trend with glacier melt contributing at a relatively low rate of 5 6 gt yr jacob et al 2012 and irrigation through groundwater extraction significantly depleting water storage along the indus chen et al 2014 contributing climatic factors appear to be sh vpd and prec with tws following variations in prec while the latter does not show an obvious decreasing trend declining tws is well explained by drying of the atmosphere as indicated by decreasing sh and increasing vpd suggesting that increased atmospheric water vapor demand may promote et and sublimation in this study we used only the climatic forcing factors to feed plsr to reproduce the grace tws variations for lack of reliable global data of pumping water diversion and water use neglecting these anthropogenic factors may be a major cause of the deviations of the modeled tws anomaly from the observed plsr can deal with multiple mechanisms of wetting or drying as indicated by the two to four independent factors identified through plsr as the dominant factors within a region however plsr neglects the feedback mechanisms between grace tws anomaly and those of the 10 climate factors the tws change is not only a response to climate variability but also directly exerts feedbacks to the energy water and carbon cycles recently the impact of variability in tws on ecosystem responses to temperature changes velicogna et al 2015 atmospheric co2 growth rate humphrey et al 2018 and polar motion śliwińska et al 2019 has been increasingly reported the feedback effects of terrestrial drying wetting on ecosystem functioning e g lai in this study and the climatic forcing factors should be addressed in future efforts using mechanistic physically based models 5 conclusions terrestrial water storage the fundamental source for fresh water supplies has experienced a substantial change over the past one or more decades 2003 2016 as detected by the grace twin satellites most notable has been the drying trend in global drylands however the major causes for this change remain unclear here we investigate 12 terrestrial regions that show a significant terrestrial drying or wetting trend we find that droughts have become more frequent and severe in the mid latitude drylands since 2012 through plsr modeling we also find distinct differences in the explanatory variables for the drying and wetting trends in different latitudinal bands increases in precipitation due to global intensification of the monsoons are responsible for the wetting in tropical subtropical monsoon regions while decreases in vegetation transpiration and atmospheric demand are responsible for the wetting in the extratropical regions meanwhile increases in air temperature and downward longwave radiation enhance atmospheric demand which should be primarily responsible for the significant drying in the mid latitude subtropical drylands and in the cold regions and alpine regions due to melting of snow ice increased potential evaporation is also an important factor for the drying in the middle east the northern china sonoran and chihuahuan deserts in southwestern america in addition the plsr modeling suggests that over global continents the climate forcing factors show a dominant impact over all wetting regions but not all the drying regions implying additional impacts of anthropogenic responses to water stress which exacerbated the drying trends contributing significantly to terrestrial drying in mid latitude drylands author
