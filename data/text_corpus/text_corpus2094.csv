10470,the application of technology and the development of data analysis such as remote sensing and regression algorithms are an easy and inexpensive way to estimate parameters related to water management such as actual evapotranspiration eta and soil water content swc therefore the objective of this study was to predict the water management parameters with vegetation indices vis and regression algorithms to enable irrigation management in a totally remote manner the study was carried out in commercial maize areas irrigated by central pivots in the western part of the state of bahia brazil the mod09gq product was used to generate input data for the training models and to understand the phenology variations in the crops the prediction of the dependent variables was tested using six regression algorithms and the best algorithm was selected based on five statistical metrics among the regression models tested the three that best fit the eta and swc data were rf random forest cubist cubist regression and gbm gradient boosting machine with slight superiority of cubist for the eta and rf for the swc the fitted models for eta and swc showed the potential of vis in providing information for irrigated agriculture and reinforcing the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the swc and eta variables the findings make it possible to monitor irrigation efficiently with only the red and near infrared wavelengths a fact that is considered the main contribution of this research to the practical and scientific communities keywords irrigation management decision making machine learning remote sensing vegetation indices 1 introduction the growing quest for more efficient production methods in the agricultural sector propels the use of technologies that increase the profitability of productive systems such as irrigation granata 2019 however to adequately manage the water applied to the plants it is necessary to search for estimates of biophysical variables to manage irrigation in a spatialized and precise manner vanino et al 2018 this necessity makes it important to estimate water management parameters such as actual evapotranspiration eta mm day 1 and soil water content swc in a reliable manner carlson and petropoulos 2019 filgueiras et al 2019 with this information the user will ensure adequate irrigation management with the right amount of water applied to the crops without wasting water and economic resources abdullah et al 2015 hassan esfahani et al 2015 mahmoud and gan 2019 patil and deka 2016 the variables related to water management are dependent on the soil atmosphere and plants among other factors allen et al 1998 which contributes to the complexity of modelling these variables this fact makes it difficult to understand the water management question with simple approaches patil and deka 2016 several studies have been carried out to estimate these water demand parameters ahmad et al 2010 ali et al 2015 chen et al 2019 granata et al 2020 kumar et al 2016 morellos et al 2016 petropoulos et al 2015 spiliotopoulos et al 2015 aiming in general to make the information less costly more precise and simpler for the irrigation manager kumar et al 2016 the applications of technologies and the development of new methods in data analysis have increased in the agricultural sector which has helped the development of solutions in the area the science of remote sensing which is already being used mainly with vis calera et al 2017 chlingaryan et al 2018 hassan esfahani et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2017 can be highlighted for these solutions these indices have a strong relation with the biophysical variables in addition to allowing the acquisition of spatial data on the surface alface et al 2019 holzman et al 2014 kamble et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2015 glenn et al 2010 conducted a study to survey methods that use vis from satellite data to estimate eta they found that in the vast majority of studies the authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor embedded in the terra platform to perform evapotranspiration projections over the seasons and years the advantage of using modis is the capability to obtain a high frequency of images with a spatial resolution of 250 m justice et al 2002 1998 in addition to remote sensing data analysis techniques based on machine learning ml are more frequently used in agricultural studies in recent years liakos et al 2018 especially in evapotranspiration althoff et al 2018 carter and liang 2019 dou and yang 2018 ferreira et al 2019 ke et al 2016 patil and deka 2016 therefore analyses performed with ml algorithms when coupled with remote sensing data have the potential to predict the biophysical variables mainly due to the adaptive capacity of the models to find patterns in nonlinear behaviour variables dou and yang 2018 filgueiras et al 2019 granata 2019 verrelst et al 2012 such as eta and swc ali et al 2015 conducted a review of ml techniques in the prediction of biomass and soil moisture from satellite data and pointed out that ml approaches in most cases outperformed parametric approaches among the models of machine learning with respect to the prediction of biophysical variables the research of abdullah et al 2015 can be cited which used an approach from extreme learning machines elm not applied before to estimate reference evapotranspiration eto the work of im et al 2016 can be highlighted since these authors used data from the modis sensor and ml techniques to disaggregate soil moisture images from the amsr e and they found a relationship with in situ soil moisture data superior to that of the product itself alipour et al 2014 used modis surface temperature images to estimate the eto using two regression models we emphasize this study because it is not necessary to insert data from meteorological stations a fact that would make a difference in many regions of the planet additionally in the field of agricultural water demand ke et al 2016 used ml algorithms to model evapotranspiration from the mod16 product with landsat 8 satellite data although ke et al 2016 downscaled the evapotranspiration from modis to landsat like resolution they did not explore the daily temporal frequency of modis to model evapotranspiration at the field level a daily approach was implemented by granata 2019 who compared three different models of machine learning with different inputs to model the eta in an experimental site this author addressed the prediction of daily eta with meteorological data which are not often available in the field the solutions already developed in the agricultural sector to achieve the estimation of water management parameters are very complex with a large amount of data to input as the models are based on energy balance approaches reyes gonzález 2018 in most cases these researchers develop models in small experimental plots and because of this they may not be applied directly in commercial agricultural fields campos et al 2018 reported that remote sensing approaches combined with methodological processes to assess the water conditions of crops without the need for ground based data are desirable thus it is still necessary to develop simple models that are executable in the practice of irrigated agriculture and at the same time are developed for large areas of agricultural crops therefore the objective of this study was to predict the water management parameters with vegetation indices and regression algorithms to enable irrigation management in a totally remote manner for this we selected six regression algorithms and compared them with the field data of one maize season this research is different from the others in that it is making the estimation of the daily water demand for plants easily possible using a simple approach based on predictive models and information that is readily available in any irrigated area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the municipality of são desidério located in the western portion of the state of bahia brazil specifically the analysis was performed in a study area located in the rectangle bounded by the following pairs of coordinates lower left 12 31 12 s 45 45 11 w and upper right 12 25 31 s 45 32 56 w datum wgs 84 with an average altitude of 750 m above sea level fig 1 according to the köppen climatic classification the climate of the region is aw tropical climate with a rainy season in summer and a dry winter alvares et al 2013 in the study area all 14 central pivots cultivated with maize zea mays l for grain production were analysed in the 2016 season the total area irrigated by these 14 central pivots is 1149 ha with 13 central pivots with 80 ha and one central pivot with 109 ha central pivot 5b the management of the central pivots in the study area is carried out by dividing them into two parts n north and s south thus if reference is made to the n side of central pivot 6a this information will be referred to as central pivot 6an pivot 6a side n according to fig 2 2 2 data sources and methods 2 2 1 target variable actual evapotranspiration eta to calculate the eta we used meteorological data from an automatic meteorological station davis vantage pro plus hayward ca installed in the study area the meteorological data collected were mean air temperature c maximum air temperature c minimum air temperature c relative air humidity and solar radiation w m ² the data corresponding to the sowing date harvesting date accumulated irrigation in the maize season and the average yield of each central pivot analysed in 2016 were acquired from the commercial farm and are presented in table 1 eta was estimated with the modified fao food and agriculture organization method mfao bernardo et al 2019 mantovani et al 2006 which has been widely used in scientific studies in brazil santos et al 2018 silva et al 2018 venancio et al 2019 vicente et al 2017 besides that it s is widely applied in several brazilians farms and also in other countries by the irriger company http www irriger com br en us irrigation management and engineering irriger 2019 this method is based on the single crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 which is a simple and widely used method for potential evapotranspiration and for practical irrigation water management at field level to increase the performance of the single crop coefficient method the water stress coefficient ks and localized water application coefficient kl were added to the mfao method according to the following equation 1 eta eto kc ks kl where eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm day 1 eto is the reference evapotranspiration according to the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 mm day 1 kc is the crop coefficient ks is the water stress coefficient bernardo et al 2019 and kl is the localized water application coefficient keller and bliesner 1990 the kl value is 1 when the whole cultivated area is wetted by an irrigation system e g areas irrigated by central pivots the kc values used in the mfao method for the maize eta were derived from the values recommended by the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 ks is used to incorporate the water stress effect on reduced crop transpiration with the daily ks estimation in the root zone computed according to bernardo et al 2019 2 2 2 target variable soil water content swc the soil water content swc was estimated based on the soil water balance using the equation derived from the calculation of the total available water as shown below 2 swc fc et accum 10 bd z where swc is the soil water content fc is the field capacity etaccum is the actual evapotranspiration eta accumulated during a certain period 1 or more days mm bd is the bulk density g cm 3 and z is the effective root length cm the calculation of the swc starts considering the soil at field capacity thus if etaccum is zero on the first day for example the estimate swc is equal to fc on the other hand if at the first day the etaccum is greater than zero the swc is reduced by the result of the second term of the equation this cycle can be performed day by day over the crop season the soil parameters to support the calculation of swc are shown on table 2 this information was acquired from the irriger company which is responsible for the irrigation management of the central pivots in the study area 2 3 features selected to model the target variables to model the swc and eta variables we looked for variables that were readily available to farmers without the need to collect them in the field as the intention was to fit simple and feasible models thus for the prediction of the eta and swc the following inputs were utilized remote sensing data vegetation indices jordan 1969 rouse et al 1973 daily irrigation irrigation mm of the previous day crop coefficient kc given by fao allen et al 1998 extraterrestrial solar radiation ro mj m 2 day 1 allen et al 1998 and reference evapotranspiration eto mm day 1 allen et al 1998 estimated with the data of the meteorological station present in the study area however the eto was used only for the prediction of the swc according to table 3 the ro was estimated using the latitude of the areas and the julian days of the year allen et al 1998 beyond that the simple ratio sr and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were used to predict the swc and eta as described in the following section 2 3 1 remote sensing data the rainfall of the crop season 04 04 2016 to 04 10 2016 was not inserted as a predictor variable because this region is characterized by dry winters according to alvares et al 2013 and the total amount of measured precipitation in the crop season was small 19 4 mm with a concentrated occurrence 18 mm precipitated on 23 09 2016 2 3 1 remote sensing data for analysis of the research we acquired 184 images of the tile h13 v10 of the mod09gq product this product is from the modis sensor onboard the terra platform the modis sensor captures electromagnetic radiation rem along wavelengths from 0 4 14 4 μm these rem values are stratified into 36 spectral bands with the first two bands present in mod09gq being the only ones with a spatial resolution of 250 metrers justice et al 2002 these two bands refer to the red band 1 and near infrared band 2 wavelengths which is the spectral information most commonly used in vegetation studies mainly for calculating the vegetation indices after the download of images a visual analysis was performed to remove the images that had clouds over the study area after this analysis there were 118 images the first image was taken on 06 04 2016 and the last image was taken on 04 10 2016 this temporal amplitude covered the entire crop cycle of the 14 central pivots the central pivot 12b was the only one that had already been sown in the first image as shown in table 1 the dates corresponding to the images acquired in the 2016 crop season in the study area are shown in table 4 2 3 1 1 vegetation indices after the selection of the cloud free images and the respective sections of the initial processing format conversion projection adequacy and image cropping the calculation of the vegetation indices was done as follows sr and ndvi according to eq 3 jordan 1969 and 4 rouse et al 1973 3 sr ρ nir ρ r 4 ndvi ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r where ρnir is the reflectance of the near infrared band and ρr is the reflectance of the red band the sr has a large range of values however ndvi has an amplitude ranging from 1 0 to 1 0 formaggio and sanches 2017 jordan 1969 ponzoni et al 2012 rouse et al 1973 the choice of these indices was based on their characteristics ndvi is sensitive in the initial phenological stages and the sr presents sensitivity when the crop is in its maximum vegetative development high biomass to obtain more information on the vegetation it is essential to make use of indices that provide complementary information kross et al 2015 nguy robertson et al 2012 which is why these two indices were used in the analyses in the present research 2 3 1 2 extraction of vegetation index values the extraction of the vegetation index values was performed for all 14 central pivots cultivated in the 2016 crop season table 1 proceeding with the extraction of the n side and s side values of these central pivots after the extraction of the values inside the central pivots the average of these indices was calculated for analyzing the phenological behaviour of the maize during the crop season in addition to serving as independent variables in the modelling of swc and eta 2 4 modelling actual evapotranspiration eta and soil water content swc to understand the methodology a step by step flowchart is shown in fig 3 which shows all the steps performed during the analysis all this intensive computational process was realized using the software qgis 2 14 qgis development team 2017 and r r team c 2017 2 5 selection and description of regression models 2 5 1 regression models to model swc and eta six regression algorithms were tested lm linear regression linear models rf random forest cubist pls partial least squares pcr principal component regression and gbm generalized boosted regression all algorithms were implemented using the statistical software r r team c 2017 with the caret package kuhn 2008 we choose these methods of regression because they encompass a variety of different origins of models linear regression and its derivatives i nonlinear regression models ii and regression tree and rule based models iii 2 5 2 regression model description to understand the operation of each of the models a description is given below the lm has an objective to find the plan that aims to minimize the sum of the squared errors sse between the observed and predicted data the advantage of this method is the easy interpretation of the coefficients that are generated in the model in addition the operational cost is relatively lower than that of the others kuhn and johnson 2013 rf is an ensemble based ml algorithm that creates multiple parallel trees using the bootstrapping method in sample selection which can also be called bagging the selection of the variables in this method is randomized by the bootstrap in the numerous decision trees with only part of the samples selected in each of the multiple trees rf is capable of performing both classification and regression this method can deal with the reduced dimensionality of data lost data and discrepant values generally it is a method applied in analyses to raise the precision of models when compared to that of linear regression as it is a method resistant to multicollinearity and is able to solve complex interactions between the predictive and explained variables brokamp et al 2017 cubist uses a methodology similar to boosting however it is called committees in which iterative decision trees are created in sequence this model implements regression trees using coupling techniques based on instances and models to give rise to multivariate regression from the training data this algorithm is an extension of quinlan s m5 model quinlan 1993 the cubist model has the characteristic of being based on multiple models of regression in the nodes of terminal leaves causing the final product to be the average of these the cubist model has been widely used in the most varied applications in remote sensing ke et al 2016 pls was compiled from herman wold s nonlinear iterative partial least squares nipals this algorithm aims to linearize models that have nonlinear parameters therefore it was performed as an adaptation in the regression methodology of the nipals algorithm so that it was able to perform regressions with correlated predictors this modification was denoted as pls james et al 2013 kuhn and johnson 2013 pcr is an adaptation of lm which tries to solve the high correlation of the predictors performing a principal component analysis pca of them that is the predictors are preprocessed via pca use this algorithm is recommended when there are variables that have a high correlation among them or for cases that have more variables than observations james et al 2013 kuhn and johnson 2013 gbm is known as one of the most robust prediction techniques which has come forward with the idea of modifying a weak predictor to become more efficient this boosting method uses the creation of a set of weak predictors in sequences most of the time these predictors are decision trees however decision tree algorithms are created in sequence as opposed to rf in which the trees are parallel in addition in the creation of a tree sequence there is always an attempt to minimize the adjustment errors of the previous steps the first realization of this technique which has brought enormous advances in modelling is adaboost adaptive boosting which already has decision trees weak predictors as predictors thus adaboost and the related algorithms have been restructured and become known as the gradient boosting machine friedman 2002 thus all these regression models were tested to determine by means of statistical metrics the model that best fit the target variables swc and eta 2 5 3 tuning parameters for the processing of these algorithms we use the caret package kunh 2008 together with the respective packages of each regression table 5 in table 5 we summarize the packages of each model and the respective adjustment parameters taken into account in the training of the algorithms to fit the parameters of each algorithm in the training of the models the caret package uses the grid search as standard which is an extremely efficient approach when the algorithms do not have many parameters to tune on average the algorithms used in the present work presented 1 666 parameters for adjustment which can be seen in table 5 2 6 training and validation set to train and validate the models we separated the dataset so it remained independent in statistics we randomly separated four central pivots 7a 14b 10a and 3b in the validation set 691 observations which was 25 5 of the points and the other 10 central pivots 74 5 2021 observations of the points for the training set taking into account the proportion discussed in ayoubi et al 2018 notably eta and swc modelling were applied to all 14 central pivots of the study area that were planted with maize crops including the separation of the information by sides north and south as the management was different between the sides the analysis of the phenological behaviour of the crop was also carried out for all the central pivots as well as in the modelling 2 7 assessing the performance of the methods to select the best regression algorithm a set of statistical metrics were used

4 and 5 show ndvi and sr values for six dates throughout the maize crop in 2016 fig 4a shows that all the central pivots had low ndvi values indicating that the crop seed had not been sown or had not yet emerged see table 1 according to table 1 only central pivot 12b had been sown with a sowing date two days prior to the date of the image the central pivot 13b was sown on the day the image was taken as seen in fig 4a and confirmed in table 1 the seeds that were sown in central pivot 12b did not emerge until the first image 06 04 2016 as the emergence time of maize is more than two days as weirich neto and lopes 2012 observed in their research these authors found an emergence time for maize varying from 5 5 days to 9 4 days depending on the sowing depth adjustments and the load on the press wheels fig 4b shows that only central pivots with higher ndvi values were 12b and 13b which were on this date 36 days and 34 days after sowing which meant that the maize in these central pivots was near phenological stage v7 kozlowski 2002 this stage is important in the formation of the number of rows of grains in the maize cob analysing the same figure we noticed that the sowing and germination of the maize in central pivots 14b and 15b had already occurred as ndvi values had increased substantially according to table 1 the sowing of these two central pivots took place on april 12 and 14 2016 this indicates that these two central pivots were 26 and 28 days after sowing respectively therefore the maize crop was in phenological stage v3 and v4 a time of great importance in the definition of the production potential according to magalhães et al 2002 it is between the v6 and v8 stages that nitrogen fertilization occurs in the coverage and it is also during this period mainly in the v8 stage that constant monitoring occurs due to the attack of spodoptera frugiperda this attack is more prone when this stage is associated with a dry season baudron et al 2019 similar facts could be satisfied or monitored with the help of remote sensing data with more refined spatial resolutions or even images from unmanned aerial vehicles vanegas et al 2018 in fig 4c and 4d we could see that all the central pivots already had high ndvi values which allows us to deduce that they were already in full vegetative development note that the ndvi values dropped in fig 4d for the central pivots that had early sowing in relation to those of the others central pivots 12b and 13b this fall indicated that the maize crop in these central pivots was already in the reproductive stage phenological stage r4 with the presence of pasty grains that is they were completing grain filling and effectively initiating plant senescence in fig 4e and f we could see from ndvi that the vegetative vigour of the crop was decreasing in all the central pivots indicating that the maize crop was near the end of its cycle we noted in fig 4f that only the central pivots 3b 4b and 5b have not yet been harvested behaviour similar to that in fig 4 was observed in fig 5 however it was seen that in the initial stages of cultivation fig 5a and b the sr index had a lower ability to stratify the growth of crops in the central pivots as we could see in the central pivots 12b and 13b when the crops were in full vegetative development fig 5c and d crop stratification was observed in different classes of values this fact allowed us to identify the non saturation of sr with the increase in biomass as report in gutierrez et al 2012 who found a better explanation for the variation in biomass in cotton for sr than that for ndvi fig 6 presents the descriptive statistics of the average values of vegetation indices extracted from each side of the central pivots although the axes of the ordinates in the graphs are different because the amplitudes of the indices do not cover the same interval it is possible to notice that ndvi presents a greater sensitivity to changes in crops as demonstrated by the greater distance between the first and third quartiles compared to that of the sr chart although sr has shown a lower sensitivity to vegetation variations along the central pivots we observed that it has not shown signs of saturation for high values of crop vigour as the maximum values are far from the median the opposite has been observed for the ndvi values as the median is closer to the maximum values than it is to the minimum values this is an important finding as it shows how these two indices are complementary in perceiving the nuances of vegetation especially in the maize crop corroborating the results on vegetation indices presented by kross et al 2015 the values of ndvi and sr indices during the phenological cycle of the maize crops are presented in figs 7 and 8 stratifying the behaviour of those indices by the central pivot and planting side the behaviour of vegetation indices is related to the phenological phases of the crops this finding is mainly because the values of the indices increase until a certain value which corresponds to the number of days to the maximum vegetative development of the crop that is shortly before the vt phase tasseling stage the vt phase occurs approximately in the eighth week after emergence this phase is verified when the last branch of the tassel is visible at this stage the plant is close to its maximum height zhang et al 2003 developed a methodology to monitor the phenological stages of vegetation using satellite imagery in this study the researchers characterized the cycle of annual crops through four transitional dates the start date of photosynthetic activity 1 maturity the date when the plant reaches the maximum leaf area 2 senescence the date on which photosynthetic activity begins to decay rapidly 3 and dormancy the date when physiological activity becomes almost null 4 these transitional dates can be identified in figs 7 and 8 which we noticed when the curves change the directions for example in fig 7f corresponding to central pivot 8a the first transition date has been detected visually around the date on the twentieth image 10 05 2016 which corresponds to approximately eight days after sowing the second transition date is close to the fortieth image 09 06 2016 and the third and fourth transition dates are approximately the hundredth 03 09 2016 and one hundred and tenth 17 09 2016 days after emergence respectively therefore we observe in a temporal analysis of the mod09gq modis product the evolution that the crop had in the field as it has images with high temporal frequency from the graphs of figs 7 and 8 we can make inferences about the dates of sowing and the phenological phases of the crop as we know the date when the crop began photosynthetic activity based on the first transition date this knowledge provides essential management information as well as a holistic understanding of vegetation dynamics zeng et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 used modis images of 250 m spatial resolution to detect the phenological stages of maize and soybeans these authors found an rmse with values within a 4 day interval that is the values of the estimated phenology differed from the phenology values observed in four days these findings also confirm the sensitivity of the vegetation indices to the agricultural crop responses along its phenological cycle as vegetation indices have been used as subsidies to elaborate this phenology predictive methodology we can observe in fig 9 the pearson s correlation corr of the variables eta and swc with the variables used in the prediction it is worth mentioning the high correlation that the eta has with the kc and the relations between the kc and ndvi and sr a fact that assists in the prediction of eta oliveira et al 2016 observed temporal behaviours of ndvi for the irrigated soybean crop and calculated the kc using the kamble et al 2013 equation these authors found a relationship with the calculated kc and kc fao of 0 72 r² the relation found in oliveira et al 2016 confirms the capacity of the vegetation indices to predict the biophysical variables of crops the relation of vegetation indices and variables related to the water demand of crops was also investigated by kamble et al 2013 who developed a simple linear regression model to estimate kc using ndvi for irrigated maize in the state of nebraska usa these authors used images from the modis sensor during the year 2006 and found in their research that the kc with ndvi as a predictor variable is a direct representation of the condition of the crops in the field this fact also helped in understanding the importance of kc and ndvi in the prediction of the variables related to the water demands of crops kamble et al 2013 validated the model proposed in their research for irrigated maize and found a determination coefficient r² equal to 0 90 and an rmse of 0 16 these findings showed the potential of ndvi for decision making in the field which also confirmed the importance of the vegetation index as a predictive variable for biophysical models these authors found a coefficient of determination r² between ndvi and kc in irrigated agriculture of 0 81 the relation of the vegetation index with the crop coefficient can also be noted in the present study by analysing fig 9 we noticed in fig 9 that irrigation does not correlate well with all the variables including the dependent variables this can be explained because the irrigation system does not work every day so there are many days when the irrigation depth is zero as noted in fig 9 this fact explains the difficulties in the establishment of the relation with the other variables however if the values of 0 mm of irrigation are excluded the correlation corr increases substantially with values of 0 59 for eta 0 67 for kc 0 57 for ndvi and 0 43 for sr in fig 9 the line corresponding to the sr graph indicates the relationship between ndvi and sr the relation between these indices can be observed by the dispersion of values this observation confirms the tendency of ndvi to be less sensitive to high biomass and the tendency of sr to be less sensitive to low biomass as also reported in the literature formaggio and sanches 2017 gu et al 2013 jensen and epiphanio 2011 liang 2004 zhu and liu 2015 the fact that the values of sr continue rising even as the ndvi values do not increase is also related to the saturation of ndvi to high biomass which is reported by several researchers in the literature such as the article of gu et al 2013 who developed adjustments in ndvi for pixels that are close to saturation the methodology developed by these authors mainly aims to improve the performance in crop estimation the adjustments of this methodology were performed by investigating the relationship between ndvi and rvi ratio vegetation index based on the relationship between these two indices these authors elaborated on an empirical equation to estimate ndvi saturation adjustments understanding the behaviour of ndvi and sr and the existing relationship with the irrigation management variables helped us to understand the regression modelling that was performed with these indices as independent variables therefore after the modelling of the eta and swc the validation of the models tested was given in a sequence figs 10 and 11 among the six models tested to predict the dependent variables the three models that best fit the eta data were rf cubist and gbm with slight superiority of the cubist model thus the cubist model was adopted in the study area as the best one to predict the eta with the independent variables kc irrigation ndvi sr and ro with the validation set the three models that presented the best predictive capabilities for the swc were also rf cubist and gbm however rf presented better results than the others did therefore rf was the best model to predict the swc using irrigation kc eto ro ndvi and sr as independent variables the findings of eta in the present study are in accordance with those described by glenn et al 2010 who conducted a study to survey methods that used vegetation indices from satellite data to estimate eta glenn et al 2010 found values of r² similar to those found in the present research the values of r² found in their research between the modelled and observed data for eta ranged from 0 45 to 0 95 and the value found in the present study for a large commercial agricultural farm for the cubist model was 0 928 fig 10 according to glenn et al 2010 these values were similar to the results of the methods that used the thermal infrared spectrum for estimation of the eta using remote sensing data which are much more complicated to execute fig 12 shows the results of the predicted versus observation values for the best model found for the eta and swc we noticed analysing the data presented in fig 12a that the values estimated by the cubist model for eta are very similar to those values observed in the field which shows that the model despite using few independent variables is able to predict the eta this fact demonstrates the robustness of the model and the potential of the information used especially the vegetation indices as that will be the only information that must be acquired by the agricultural manager it must be pointed out that residuals from the prediction model of the eta fig 12c are mostly 93 below 0 5 mm a result that is considered adequate due to the amount of covariates used fig 12b shows the swc values predicted by rf in relation to those observed in the field note that the adjustment of this variable was lower than that achieved for the eta data this occurrence is mainly related to the behaviour and complexity of the dependent variable itself as the dynamics of the swc occur in the soil however the indices actually capture the dynamics of the vegetation that is they acquire the answers from the consequence caused by the swc in the vegetation although the adjustment is not similar to that of the eta it is noted that the residuals of this estimate are not high as 91 of them are less than 1 of the absolute residue when compared to the field data fig 12d this residue value can be acceptable as adequate since if we consider the average swc that was measured swc 12 44 the relative residue 91 of the time was equal to or less than 8 0 which is not far from the range of accuracy of most available moisture sensors cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2010 analysed the accuracy of four brands of commercially available moisture sensors and found errors varying from 1 4 to 7 8 considering the average of the range of soil moisture sensors measured the findings of these authors highlight the importance of the values found in the present study the swc model generated with rf despite the use of the eto derived from meteorological data is an excellent alternative to determine or even to confirm the water demand situation in the field based on the findings found for the swc and eta we can conclude that the models generated here may be used to estimate the daily swc and eta for the region of interest 4 conclusion we analysed the phenological behaviour of maize using sr and ndvi and we also used these indices to test regression models to select the best model for the eta and swc with the aim predicting these variables with a simple approach we found that the data from vegetation indices were related to the phenological behaviour of the crops and could provide information of extreme relevance to agricultural managers when analysed in a spatial and temporal manner helping the relation with biophysical variables information derived from a time series of vegetation indices can help to infer the phenological stage of the crop in the field even knowing if the crop is already close to the end of the cycle in addition by comparing time series information from past harvests with the current crop conclusions can be drawn regarding the development and productive capacity of the crop in the field and thus the farmer can be guided based on past harvests in his decision making the different limitations saturations of sr and ndvi complement each other and if used together they can give greater robustness to the prediction models of biophysical variables the fitted models for eta and swc demonstrate the potential of vegetation indices to provide information for the management of irrigated agriculture and reinforce the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the swc and eta variables to predict eta the performance of the rf cubist and gbm techniques can be emphasized but among the three cubist was the model that presented the best statistical performances and was recommended for the estimation of the eta for the study area region to predict the swc rf was superior to all the other algorithms and was the most appropriate to estimate this parameter in the study area region with the results

10470,the application of technology and the development of data analysis such as remote sensing and regression algorithms are an easy and inexpensive way to estimate parameters related to water management such as actual evapotranspiration eta and soil water content swc therefore the objective of this study was to predict the water management parameters with vegetation indices vis and regression algorithms to enable irrigation management in a totally remote manner the study was carried out in commercial maize areas irrigated by central pivots in the western part of the state of bahia brazil the mod09gq product was used to generate input data for the training models and to understand the phenology variations in the crops the prediction of the dependent variables was tested using six regression algorithms and the best algorithm was selected based on five statistical metrics among the regression models tested the three that best fit the eta and swc data were rf random forest cubist cubist regression and gbm gradient boosting machine with slight superiority of cubist for the eta and rf for the swc the fitted models for eta and swc showed the potential of vis in providing information for irrigated agriculture and reinforcing the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the swc and eta variables the findings make it possible to monitor irrigation efficiently with only the red and near infrared wavelengths a fact that is considered the main contribution of this research to the practical and scientific communities keywords irrigation management decision making machine learning remote sensing vegetation indices 1 introduction the growing quest for more efficient production methods in the agricultural sector propels the use of technologies that increase the profitability of productive systems such as irrigation granata 2019 however to adequately manage the water applied to the plants it is necessary to search for estimates of biophysical variables to manage irrigation in a spatialized and precise manner vanino et al 2018 this necessity makes it important to estimate water management parameters such as actual evapotranspiration eta mm day 1 and soil water content swc in a reliable manner carlson and petropoulos 2019 filgueiras et al 2019 with this information the user will ensure adequate irrigation management with the right amount of water applied to the crops without wasting water and economic resources abdullah et al 2015 hassan esfahani et al 2015 mahmoud and gan 2019 patil and deka 2016 the variables related to water management are dependent on the soil atmosphere and plants among other factors allen et al 1998 which contributes to the complexity of modelling these variables this fact makes it difficult to understand the water management question with simple approaches patil and deka 2016 several studies have been carried out to estimate these water demand parameters ahmad et al 2010 ali et al 2015 chen et al 2019 granata et al 2020 kumar et al 2016 morellos et al 2016 petropoulos et al 2015 spiliotopoulos et al 2015 aiming in general to make the information less costly more precise and simpler for the irrigation manager kumar et al 2016 the applications of technologies and the development of new methods in data analysis have increased in the agricultural sector which has helped the development of solutions in the area the science of remote sensing which is already being used mainly with vis calera et al 2017 chlingaryan et al 2018 hassan esfahani et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2017 can be highlighted for these solutions these indices have a strong relation with the biophysical variables in addition to allowing the acquisition of spatial data on the surface alface et al 2019 holzman et al 2014 kamble et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2015 glenn et al 2010 conducted a study to survey methods that use vis from satellite data to estimate eta they found that in the vast majority of studies the authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor embedded in the terra platform to perform evapotranspiration projections over the seasons and years the advantage of using modis is the capability to obtain a high frequency of images with a spatial resolution of 250 m justice et al 2002 1998 in addition to remote sensing data analysis techniques based on machine learning ml are more frequently used in agricultural studies in recent years liakos et al 2018 especially in evapotranspiration althoff et al 2018 carter and liang 2019 dou and yang 2018 ferreira et al 2019 ke et al 2016 patil and deka 2016 therefore analyses performed with ml algorithms when coupled with remote sensing data have the potential to predict the biophysical variables mainly due to the adaptive capacity of the models to find patterns in nonlinear behaviour variables dou and yang 2018 filgueiras et al 2019 granata 2019 verrelst et al 2012 such as eta and swc ali et al 2015 conducted a review of ml techniques in the prediction of biomass and soil moisture from satellite data and pointed out that ml approaches in most cases outperformed parametric approaches among the models of machine learning with respect to the prediction of biophysical variables the research of abdullah et al 2015 can be cited which used an approach from extreme learning machines elm not applied before to estimate reference evapotranspiration eto the work of im et al 2016 can be highlighted since these authors used data from the modis sensor and ml techniques to disaggregate soil moisture images from the amsr e and they found a relationship with in situ soil moisture data superior to that of the product itself alipour et al 2014 used modis surface temperature images to estimate the eto using two regression models we emphasize this study because it is not necessary to insert data from meteorological stations a fact that would make a difference in many regions of the planet additionally in the field of agricultural water demand ke et al 2016 used ml algorithms to model evapotranspiration from the mod16 product with landsat 8 satellite data although ke et al 2016 downscaled the evapotranspiration from modis to landsat like resolution they did not explore the daily temporal frequency of modis to model evapotranspiration at the field level a daily approach was implemented by granata 2019 who compared three different models of machine learning with different inputs to model the eta in an experimental site this author addressed the prediction of daily eta with meteorological data which are not often available in the field the solutions already developed in the agricultural sector to achieve the estimation of water management parameters are very complex with a large amount of data to input as the models are based on energy balance approaches reyes gonzález 2018 in most cases these researchers develop models in small experimental plots and because of this they may not be applied directly in commercial agricultural fields campos et al 2018 reported that remote sensing approaches combined with methodological processes to assess the water conditions of crops without the need for ground based data are desirable thus it is still necessary to develop simple models that are executable in the practice of irrigated agriculture and at the same time are developed for large areas of agricultural crops therefore the objective of this study was to predict the water management parameters with vegetation indices and regression algorithms to enable irrigation management in a totally remote manner for this we selected six regression algorithms and compared them with the field data of one maize season this research is different from the others in that it is making the estimation of the daily water demand for plants easily possible using a simple approach based on predictive models and information that is readily available in any irrigated area 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in the municipality of são desidério located in the western portion of the state of bahia brazil specifically the analysis was performed in a study area located in the rectangle bounded by the following pairs of coordinates lower left 12 31 12 s 45 45 11 w and upper right 12 25 31 s 45 32 56 w datum wgs 84 with an average altitude of 750 m above sea level fig 1 according to the köppen climatic classification the climate of the region is aw tropical climate with a rainy season in summer and a dry winter alvares et al 2013 in the study area all 14 central pivots cultivated with maize zea mays l for grain production were analysed in the 2016 season the total area irrigated by these 14 central pivots is 1149 ha with 13 central pivots with 80 ha and one central pivot with 109 ha central pivot 5b the management of the central pivots in the study area is carried out by dividing them into two parts n north and s south thus if reference is made to the n side of central pivot 6a this information will be referred to as central pivot 6an pivot 6a side n according to fig 2 2 2 data sources and methods 2 2 1 target variable actual evapotranspiration eta to calculate the eta we used meteorological data from an automatic meteorological station davis vantage pro plus hayward ca installed in the study area the meteorological data collected were mean air temperature c maximum air temperature c minimum air temperature c relative air humidity and solar radiation w m ² the data corresponding to the sowing date harvesting date accumulated irrigation in the maize season and the average yield of each central pivot analysed in 2016 were acquired from the commercial farm and are presented in table 1 eta was estimated with the modified fao food and agriculture organization method mfao bernardo et al 2019 mantovani et al 2006 which has been widely used in scientific studies in brazil santos et al 2018 silva et al 2018 venancio et al 2019 vicente et al 2017 besides that it s is widely applied in several brazilians farms and also in other countries by the irriger company http www irriger com br en us irrigation management and engineering irriger 2019 this method is based on the single crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 which is a simple and widely used method for potential evapotranspiration and for practical irrigation water management at field level to increase the performance of the single crop coefficient method the water stress coefficient ks and localized water application coefficient kl were added to the mfao method according to the following equation 1 eta eto kc ks kl where eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm day 1 eto is the reference evapotranspiration according to the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 mm day 1 kc is the crop coefficient ks is the water stress coefficient bernardo et al 2019 and kl is the localized water application coefficient keller and bliesner 1990 the kl value is 1 when the whole cultivated area is wetted by an irrigation system e g areas irrigated by central pivots the kc values used in the mfao method for the maize eta were derived from the values recommended by the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 ks is used to incorporate the water stress effect on reduced crop transpiration with the daily ks estimation in the root zone computed according to bernardo et al 2019 2 2 2 target variable soil water content swc the soil water content swc was estimated based on the soil water balance using the equation derived from the calculation of the total available water as shown below 2 swc fc et accum 10 bd z where swc is the soil water content fc is the field capacity etaccum is the actual evapotranspiration eta accumulated during a certain period 1 or more days mm bd is the bulk density g cm 3 and z is the effective root length cm the calculation of the swc starts considering the soil at field capacity thus if etaccum is zero on the first day for example the estimate swc is equal to fc on the other hand if at the first day the etaccum is greater than zero the swc is reduced by the result of the second term of the equation this cycle can be performed day by day over the crop season the soil parameters to support the calculation of swc are shown on table 2 this information was acquired from the irriger company which is responsible for the irrigation management of the central pivots in the study area 2 3 features selected to model the target variables to model the swc and eta variables we looked for variables that were readily available to farmers without the need to collect them in the field as the intention was to fit simple and feasible models thus for the prediction of the eta and swc the following inputs were utilized remote sensing data vegetation indices jordan 1969 rouse et al 1973 daily irrigation irrigation mm of the previous day crop coefficient kc given by fao allen et al 1998 extraterrestrial solar radiation ro mj m 2 day 1 allen et al 1998 and reference evapotranspiration eto mm day 1 allen et al 1998 estimated with the data of the meteorological station present in the study area however the eto was used only for the prediction of the swc according to table 3 the ro was estimated using the latitude of the areas and the julian days of the year allen et al 1998 beyond that the simple ratio sr and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were used to predict the swc and eta as described in the following section 2 3 1 remote sensing data the rainfall of the crop season 04 04 2016 to 04 10 2016 was not inserted as a predictor variable because this region is characterized by dry winters according to alvares et al 2013 and the total amount of measured precipitation in the crop season was small 19 4 mm with a concentrated occurrence 18 mm precipitated on 23 09 2016 2 3 1 remote sensing data for analysis of the research we acquired 184 images of the tile h13 v10 of the mod09gq product this product is from the modis sensor onboard the terra platform the modis sensor captures electromagnetic radiation rem along wavelengths from 0 4 14 4 μm these rem values are stratified into 36 spectral bands with the first two bands present in mod09gq being the only ones with a spatial resolution of 250 metrers justice et al 2002 these two bands refer to the red band 1 and near infrared band 2 wavelengths which is the spectral information most commonly used in vegetation studies mainly for calculating the vegetation indices after the download of images a visual analysis was performed to remove the images that had clouds over the study area after this analysis there were 118 images the first image was taken on 06 04 2016 and the last image was taken on 04 10 2016 this temporal amplitude covered the entire crop cycle of the 14 central pivots the central pivot 12b was the only one that had already been sown in the first image as shown in table 1 the dates corresponding to the images acquired in the 2016 crop season in the study area are shown in table 4 2 3 1 1 vegetation indices after the selection of the cloud free images and the respective sections of the initial processing format conversion projection adequacy and image cropping the calculation of the vegetation indices was done as follows sr and ndvi according to eq 3 jordan 1969 and 4 rouse et al 1973 3 sr ρ nir ρ r 4 ndvi ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r where ρnir is the reflectance of the near infrared band and ρr is the reflectance of the red band the sr has a large range of values however ndvi has an amplitude ranging from 1 0 to 1 0 formaggio and sanches 2017 jordan 1969 ponzoni et al 2012 rouse et al 1973 the choice of these indices was based on their characteristics ndvi is sensitive in the initial phenological stages and the sr presents sensitivity when the crop is in its maximum vegetative development high biomass to obtain more information on the vegetation it is essential to make use of indices that provide complementary information kross et al 2015 nguy robertson et al 2012 which is why these two indices were used in the analyses in the present research 2 3 1 2 extraction of vegetation index values the extraction of the vegetation index values was performed for all 14 central pivots cultivated in the 2016 crop season table 1 proceeding with the extraction of the n side and s side values of these central pivots after the extraction of the values inside the central pivots the average of these indices was calculated for analyzing the phenological behaviour of the maize during the crop season in addition to serving as independent variables in the modelling of swc and eta 2 4 modelling actual evapotranspiration eta and soil water content swc to understand the methodology a step by step flowchart is shown in fig 3 which shows all the steps performed during the analysis all this intensive computational process was realized using the software qgis 2 14 qgis development team 2017 and r r team c 2017 2 5 selection and description of regression models 2 5 1 regression models to model swc and eta six regression algorithms were tested lm linear regression linear models rf random forest cubist pls partial least squares pcr principal component regression and gbm generalized boosted regression all algorithms were implemented using the statistical software r r team c 2017 with the caret package kuhn 2008 we choose these methods of regression because they encompass a variety of different origins of models linear regression and its derivatives i nonlinear regression models ii and regression tree and rule based models iii 2 5 2 regression model description to understand the operation of each of the models a description is given below the lm has an objective to find the plan that aims to minimize the sum of the squared errors sse between the observed and predicted data the advantage of this method is the easy interpretation of the coefficients that are generated in the model in addition the operational cost is relatively lower than that of the others kuhn and johnson 2013 rf is an ensemble based ml algorithm that creates multiple parallel trees using the bootstrapping method in sample selection which can also be called bagging the selection of the variables in this method is randomized by the bootstrap in the numerous decision trees with only part of the samples selected in each of the multiple trees rf is capable of performing both classification and regression this method can deal with the reduced dimensionality of data lost data and discrepant values generally it is a method applied in analyses to raise the precision of models when compared to that of linear regression as it is a method resistant to multicollinearity and is able to solve complex interactions between the predictive and explained variables brokamp et al 2017 cubist uses a methodology similar to boosting however it is called committees in which iterative decision trees are created in sequence this model implements regression trees using coupling techniques based on instances and models to give rise to multivariate regression from the training data this algorithm is an extension of quinlan s m5 model quinlan 1993 the cubist model has the characteristic of being based on multiple models of regression in the nodes of terminal leaves causing the final product to be the average of these the cubist model has been widely used in the most varied applications in remote sensing ke et al 2016 pls was compiled from herman wold s nonlinear iterative partial least squares nipals this algorithm aims to linearize models that have nonlinear parameters therefore it was performed as an adaptation in the regression methodology of the nipals algorithm so that it was able to perform regressions with correlated predictors this modification was denoted as pls james et al 2013 kuhn and johnson 2013 pcr is an adaptation of lm which tries to solve the high correlation of the predictors performing a principal component analysis pca of them that is the predictors are preprocessed via pca use this algorithm is recommended when there are variables that have a high correlation among them or for cases that have more variables than observations james et al 2013 kuhn and johnson 2013 gbm is known as one of the most robust prediction techniques which has come forward with the idea of modifying a weak predictor to become more efficient this boosting method uses the creation of a set of weak predictors in sequences most of the time these predictors are decision trees however decision tree algorithms are created in sequence as opposed to rf in which the trees are parallel in addition in the creation of a tree sequence there is always an attempt to minimize the adjustment errors of the previous steps the first realization of this technique which has brought enormous advances in modelling is adaboost adaptive boosting which already has decision trees weak predictors as predictors thus adaboost and the related algorithms have been restructured and become known as the gradient boosting machine friedman 2002 thus all these regression models were tested to determine by means of statistical metrics the model that best fit the target variables swc and eta 2 5 3 tuning parameters for the processing of these algorithms we use the caret package kunh 2008 together with the respective packages of each regression table 5 in table 5 we summarize the packages of each model and the respective adjustment parameters taken into account in the training of the algorithms to fit the parameters of each algorithm in the training of the models the caret package uses the grid search as standard which is an extremely efficient approach when the algorithms do not have many parameters to tune on average the algorithms used in the present work presented 1 666 parameters for adjustment which can be seen in table 5 2 6 training and validation set to train and validate the models we separated the dataset so it remained independent in statistics we randomly separated four central pivots 7a 14b 10a and 3b in the validation set 691 observations which was 25 5 of the points and the other 10 central pivots 74 5 2021 observations of the points for the training set taking into account the proportion discussed in ayoubi et al 2018 notably eta and swc modelling were applied to all 14 central pivots of the study area that were planted with maize crops including the separation of the information by sides north and south as the management was different between the sides the analysis of the phenological behaviour of the crop was also carried out for all the central pivots as well as in the modelling 2 7 assessing the performance of the methods to select the best regression algorithm a set of statistical metrics were used

4 and 5 show ndvi and sr values for six dates throughout the maize crop in 2016 fig 4a shows that all the central pivots had low ndvi values indicating that the crop seed had not been sown or had not yet emerged see table 1 according to table 1 only central pivot 12b had been sown with a sowing date two days prior to the date of the image the central pivot 13b was sown on the day the image was taken as seen in fig 4a and confirmed in table 1 the seeds that were sown in central pivot 12b did not emerge until the first image 06 04 2016 as the emergence time of maize is more than two days as weirich neto and lopes 2012 observed in their research these authors found an emergence time for maize varying from 5 5 days to 9 4 days depending on the sowing depth adjustments and the load on the press wheels fig 4b shows that only central pivots with higher ndvi values were 12b and 13b which were on this date 36 days and 34 days after sowing which meant that the maize in these central pivots was near phenological stage v7 kozlowski 2002 this stage is important in the formation of the number of rows of grains in the maize cob analysing the same figure we noticed that the sowing and germination of the maize in central pivots 14b and 15b had already occurred as ndvi values had increased substantially according to table 1 the sowing of these two central pivots took place on april 12 and 14 2016 this indicates that these two central pivots were 26 and 28 days after sowing respectively therefore the maize crop was in phenological stage v3 and v4 a time of great importance in the definition of the production potential according to magalhães et al 2002 it is between the v6 and v8 stages that nitrogen fertilization occurs in the coverage and it is also during this period mainly in the v8 stage that constant monitoring occurs due to the attack of spodoptera frugiperda this attack is more prone when this stage is associated with a dry season baudron et al 2019 similar facts could be satisfied or monitored with the help of remote sensing data with more refined spatial resolutions or even images from unmanned aerial vehicles vanegas et al 2018 in fig 4c and 4d we could see that all the central pivots already had high ndvi values which allows us to deduce that they were already in full vegetative development note that the ndvi values dropped in fig 4d for the central pivots that had early sowing in relation to those of the others central pivots 12b and 13b this fall indicated that the maize crop in these central pivots was already in the reproductive stage phenological stage r4 with the presence of pasty grains that is they were completing grain filling and effectively initiating plant senescence in fig 4e and f we could see from ndvi that the vegetative vigour of the crop was decreasing in all the central pivots indicating that the maize crop was near the end of its cycle we noted in fig 4f that only the central pivots 3b 4b and 5b have not yet been harvested behaviour similar to that in fig 4 was observed in fig 5 however it was seen that in the initial stages of cultivation fig 5a and b the sr index had a lower ability to stratify the growth of crops in the central pivots as we could see in the central pivots 12b and 13b when the crops were in full vegetative development fig 5c and d crop stratification was observed in different classes of values this fact allowed us to identify the non saturation of sr with the increase in biomass as report in gutierrez et al 2012 who found a better explanation for the variation in biomass in cotton for sr than that for ndvi fig 6 presents the descriptive statistics of the average values of vegetation indices extracted from each side of the central pivots although the axes of the ordinates in the graphs are different because the amplitudes of the indices do not cover the same interval it is possible to notice that ndvi presents a greater sensitivity to changes in crops as demonstrated by the greater distance between the first and third quartiles compared to that of the sr chart although sr has shown a lower sensitivity to vegetation variations along the central pivots we observed that it has not shown signs of saturation for high values of crop vigour as the maximum values are far from the median the opposite has been observed for the ndvi values as the median is closer to the maximum values than it is to the minimum values this is an important finding as it shows how these two indices are complementary in perceiving the nuances of vegetation especially in the maize crop corroborating the results on vegetation indices presented by kross et al 2015 the values of ndvi and sr indices during the phenological cycle of the maize crops are presented in figs 7 and 8 stratifying the behaviour of those indices by the central pivot and planting side the behaviour of vegetation indices is related to the phenological phases of the crops this finding is mainly because the values of the indices increase until a certain value which corresponds to the number of days to the maximum vegetative development of the crop that is shortly before the vt phase tasseling stage the vt phase occurs approximately in the eighth week after emergence this phase is verified when the last branch of the tassel is visible at this stage the plant is close to its maximum height zhang et al 2003 developed a methodology to monitor the phenological stages of vegetation using satellite imagery in this study the researchers characterized the cycle of annual crops through four transitional dates the start date of photosynthetic activity 1 maturity the date when the plant reaches the maximum leaf area 2 senescence the date on which photosynthetic activity begins to decay rapidly 3 and dormancy the date when physiological activity becomes almost null 4 these transitional dates can be identified in figs 7 and 8 which we noticed when the curves change the directions for example in fig 7f corresponding to central pivot 8a the first transition date has been detected visually around the date on the twentieth image 10 05 2016 which corresponds to approximately eight days after sowing the second transition date is close to the fortieth image 09 06 2016 and the third and fourth transition dates are approximately the hundredth 03 09 2016 and one hundred and tenth 17 09 2016 days after emergence respectively therefore we observe in a temporal analysis of the mod09gq modis product the evolution that the crop had in the field as it has images with high temporal frequency from the graphs of figs 7 and 8 we can make inferences about the dates of sowing and the phenological phases of the crop as we know the date when the crop began photosynthetic activity based on the first transition date this knowledge provides essential management information as well as a holistic understanding of vegetation dynamics zeng et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 used modis images of 250 m spatial resolution to detect the phenological stages of maize and soybeans these authors found an rmse with values within a 4 day interval that is the values of the estimated phenology differed from the phenology values observed in four days these findings also confirm the sensitivity of the vegetation indices to the agricultural crop responses along its phenological cycle as vegetation indices have been used as subsidies to elaborate this phenology predictive methodology we can observe in fig 9 the pearson s correlation corr of the variables eta and swc with the variables used in the prediction it is worth mentioning the high correlation that the eta has with the kc and the relations between the kc and ndvi and sr a fact that assists in the prediction of eta oliveira et al 2016 observed temporal behaviours of ndvi for the irrigated soybean crop and calculated the kc using the kamble et al 2013 equation these authors found a relationship with the calculated kc and kc fao of 0 72 r² the relation found in oliveira et al 2016 confirms the capacity of the vegetation indices to predict the biophysical variables of crops the relation of vegetation indices and variables related to the water demand of crops was also investigated by kamble et al 2013 who developed a simple linear regression model to estimate kc using ndvi for irrigated maize in the state of nebraska usa these authors used images from the modis sensor during the year 2006 and found in their research that the kc with ndvi as a predictor variable is a direct representation of the condition of the crops in the field this fact also helped in understanding the importance of kc and ndvi in the prediction of the variables related to the water demands of crops kamble et al 2013 validated the model proposed in their research for irrigated maize and found a determination coefficient r² equal to 0 90 and an rmse of 0 16 these findings showed the potential of ndvi for decision making in the field which also confirmed the importance of the vegetation index as a predictive variable for biophysical models these authors found a coefficient of determination r² between ndvi and kc in irrigated agriculture of 0 81 the relation of the vegetation index with the crop coefficient can also be noted in the present study by analysing fig 9 we noticed in fig 9 that irrigation does not correlate well with all the variables including the dependent variables this can be explained because the irrigation system does not work every day so there are many days when the irrigation depth is zero as noted in fig 9 this fact explains the difficulties in the establishment of the relation with the other variables however if the values of 0 mm of irrigation are excluded the correlation corr increases substantially with values of 0 59 for eta 0 67 for kc 0 57 for ndvi and 0 43 for sr in fig 9 the line corresponding to the sr graph indicates the relationship between ndvi and sr the relation between these indices can be observed by the dispersion of values this observation confirms the tendency of ndvi to be less sensitive to high biomass and the tendency of sr to be less sensitive to low biomass as also reported in the literature formaggio and sanches 2017 gu et al 2013 jensen and epiphanio 2011 liang 2004 zhu and liu 2015 the fact that the values of sr continue rising even as the ndvi values do not increase is also related to the saturation of ndvi to high biomass which is reported by several researchers in the literature such as the article of gu et al 2013 who developed adjustments in ndvi for pixels that are close to saturation the methodology developed by these authors mainly aims to improve the performance in crop estimation the adjustments of this methodology were performed by investigating the relationship between ndvi and rvi ratio vegetation index based on the relationship between these two indices these authors elaborated on an empirical equation to estimate ndvi saturation adjustments understanding the behaviour of ndvi and sr and the existing relationship with the irrigation management variables helped us to understand the regression modelling that was performed with these indices as independent variables therefore after the modelling of the eta and swc the validation of the models tested was given in a sequence figs 10 and 11 among the six models tested to predict the dependent variables the three models that best fit the eta data were rf cubist and gbm with slight superiority of the cubist model thus the cubist model was adopted in the study area as the best one to predict the eta with the independent variables kc irrigation ndvi sr and ro with the validation set the three models that presented the best predictive capabilities for the swc were also rf cubist and gbm however rf presented better results than the others did therefore rf was the best model to predict the swc using irrigation kc eto ro ndvi and sr as independent variables the findings of eta in the present study are in accordance with those described by glenn et al 2010 who conducted a study to survey methods that used vegetation indices from satellite data to estimate eta glenn et al 2010 found values of r² similar to those found in the present research the values of r² found in their research between the modelled and observed data for eta ranged from 0 45 to 0 95 and the value found in the present study for a large commercial agricultural farm for the cubist model was 0 928 fig 10 according to glenn et al 2010 these values were similar to the results of the methods that used the thermal infrared spectrum for estimation of the eta using remote sensing data which are much more complicated to execute fig 12 shows the results of the predicted versus observation values for the best model found for the eta and swc we noticed analysing the data presented in fig 12a that the values estimated by the cubist model for eta are very similar to those values observed in the field which shows that the model despite using few independent variables is able to predict the eta this fact demonstrates the robustness of the model and the potential of the information used especially the vegetation indices as that will be the only information that must be acquired by the agricultural manager it must be pointed out that residuals from the prediction model of the eta fig 12c are mostly 93 below 0 5 mm a result that is considered adequate due to the amount of covariates used fig 12b shows the swc values predicted by rf in relation to those observed in the field note that the adjustment of this variable was lower than that achieved for the eta data this occurrence is mainly related to the behaviour and complexity of the dependent variable itself as the dynamics of the swc occur in the soil however the indices actually capture the dynamics of the vegetation that is they acquire the answers from the consequence caused by the swc in the vegetation although the adjustment is not similar to that of the eta it is noted that the residuals of this estimate are not high as 91 of them are less than 1 of the absolute residue when compared to the field data fig 12d this residue value can be acceptable as adequate since if we consider the average swc that was measured swc 12 44 the relative residue 91 of the time was equal to or less than 8 0 which is not far from the range of accuracy of most available moisture sensors cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2010 analysed the accuracy of four brands of commercially available moisture sensors and found errors varying from 1 4 to 7 8 considering the average of the range of soil moisture sensors measured the findings of these authors highlight the importance of the values found in the present study the swc model generated with rf despite the use of the eto derived from meteorological data is an excellent alternative to determine or even to confirm the water demand situation in the field based on the findings found for the swc and eta we can conclude that the models generated here may be used to estimate the daily swc and eta for the region of interest 4 conclusion we analysed the phenological behaviour of maize using sr and ndvi and we also used these indices to test regression models to select the best model for the eta and swc with the aim predicting these variables with a simple approach we found that the data from vegetation indices were related to the phenological behaviour of the crops and could provide information of extreme relevance to agricultural managers when analysed in a spatial and temporal manner helping the relation with biophysical variables information derived from a time series of vegetation indices can help to infer the phenological stage of the crop in the field even knowing if the crop is already close to the end of the cycle in addition by comparing time series information from past harvests with the current crop conclusions can be drawn regarding the development and productive capacity of the crop in the field and thus the farmer can be guided based on past harvests in his decision making the different limitations saturations of sr and ndvi complement each other and if used together they can give greater robustness to the prediction models of biophysical variables the fitted models for eta and swc demonstrate the potential of vegetation indices to provide information for the management of irrigated agriculture and reinforce the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the swc and eta variables to predict eta the performance of the rf cubist and gbm techniques can be emphasized but among the three cubist was the model that presented the best statistical performances and was recommended for the estimation of the eta for the study area region to predict the swc rf was superior to all the other algorithms and was the most appropriate to estimate this parameter in the study area region with the results

10471,high resolution measurements of trunk diameter fluctuations tdf provide a means to study short term and long term stem radial variations and response to water stress of fruit trees there is a lack of information however on the performance of tdf measurements on fast growing poplar trees to both clarify the intra annual and inter annual growth patterns and to diagnose water status of young poplar trees we monitored tdf leaf area index soil matric potential midday stem water potential ψ stem and main meteorological variables in a plantation with 3 and 4 year old populus tomentosa trees over two growing seasons 2016 and 2017 we had two irrigation treatments well watered ww and water stressed ws for the first time for this species we identified accurately and quantitatively the seasonal growth pattern and associated parameters growth initiation and cessation time growing season duration maximum growth rate etc of young p tomentosa with four clear stages based on the growth rate for both treatments we identified that stage ii mid april to mid june when trees showed the most active growth rate and less rainfall was recorded is the most crucial stage for irrigation management especially as trees grow larger and have a greater water demand in the two experimental years irrigation did not affect the timing of growth initiation and cessation however maximum growth rate was significantly higher and occurred earlier in the ww trees than in the ws trees from the tested trunk diameter fluctuation indicators trunk growth rate tgr showed a greater potential for assessing tree water stress than both maximum daily shrinkage mds and daily growth dg being even more sensitive to the onset of water stress than midday ψ stem we conclude that high resolution trunk

dendrometer irrigation scheduling water stress trunk growth rate maximum daily shrinkage poplar 1 introduction poplar populus spp is a commonly used species for wood production and shelterbelts and has been widely planted in the north china plain zhang et al 2012 xi et al 2016 for those purposes since water is a crucial growth limiting factor highly influencing both yield and wood quality irrigation is often applied in north china to increase the growth of poplar plantations xi et al 2014 yan et al 2018 previous works have shown that poplar trees have different water demands at various seasons and stand ages xi et al 2017 yang et al 2019 however little attention has been paid to the growth pattern of young poplar trees and its response to water status in addition a better knowledge of how water availability affects growth will be useful to define rational irrigation regimes focusing on avoiding both water waste and undesired stress events to determine the intra annual and inter annual stem growth it is useful to record the trunk diameter fluctuations tdf also known as stem radial variations with high resolution dendrometers duchesne and houle 2011 cocozza et al 2012 vieira et al 2013 tian et al 2017a maaten van der et al 2018 these records allow us to better understand short and long term growth patterns and their relations with changing environmental conditions zweifel et al 2010 and 2016 vandegehuchte et al 2014 oberhuber et al 2015 tian et al 2017b dietrich et al 2018 maaten van der et al 2018 reviews by drew and downes 2009 and de swaef et al 2015 provided valuable insights into how radially varying wood properties depends on the past climatic conditions and discussed a systematic approach to plant phenology and dendroclimatology also the works by zweifel et al 2006 köcher et al 2012 vieira et al 2013 wang et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a and liu et al 2018 among others carried out with several woody species growing in natural mature forests illustrated the use of data on intra annual radial growth patterns derived from records with electronic high precision dendrometers to explore relationships with the seasonal climatic course and to forecast the response of tree growth to climate change in addition to characterize growth patterns dendrometers are useful to identify the impact of water stress in tdf as shown by several authors in a variety of tree species ortuño et al 2006a 2006b conejero et al 2007a fernández et al 2011 cuevas et al 2013 du et al 2017 this explains the potential of tdf records for scheduling precision irrigation of woody species conejero et al 2007b fernández and cuevas 2010 ortuño et al 2010 conesa et al 2016 corell et al 2017 martín palomo et al 2019 yet most of the studies on irrigation scheduling from tdf measurements have been conducted in fruit trees ortuño et al 2010 to our knowledge no tdf results on young fast growing poplar trees have been published despite their potential interest on managing poplar commercial plantations the closest work we have found is that by xiao et al 2014 who used dendrometers to derive the growth patterns of mature populus euphratica in relatively slow growth stage at the daily and seasonal levels however as to the fast growing young poplar trees the growth pattern and its variation with soil water conditions is still not precisely understood on the other hand there is not a consensus on which index among those that can be derived from tdf measurements fernández and cuevas 2010 is the best for assessing tree water status for example velez et al 2007 conejero et al 2007a 2007b puerto et al 2013 conesa et al 2016 and du et al 2017 reported that the maximum daily trunk shrinkage mds was more reliable than trunk growth rate tgr for the assessment of water status in citrus peach almond grape and apple plants on the contrary girón et al 2016 corell et al 2017 and martín palomo et al 2019 concluded that tgr was a better indicator for detecting water stress in olive and almond trees than mds thus our overall objective is to determine if tdf records are useful to both derive growth patterns and detect the onset and severity of water stress in young fast growing p tomentosa trees which is a native and important tree species in the north china plain the specific objectives of our study are 1 to compare differences of intra annual and inter annual growth patterns in fast growing poplar trees under different irrigation treatments and 2 to determine whether tdf derived indicators can be used for the reliable assessment of water status in those trees we monitored tdf with point dendrometers over a 2 year period in a young p tomentosa plantation in the north china plain our results can be useful to schedule irrigation in poplar plantations according to tree growth patterns and their response to water stress which could lead to significant water savings 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and treatments the study was conducted during 2016 and 2017 at a state owned forest farm in gaotang county shandong province latitude 36 81 n longitude 116 09 e elevation 30 m this area is a typical yellow river alluvial plain located in northern china the climate in the region is warm temperate monsoon with average air temperature of 13 41 and average rainfall of 563 mm 1981 2010 period the experimental site is flat and has relatively stable groundwater level at about 6 m depth the soil layer of 0 140 cm is sandy loam sand silt clay is 62 9 34 6 2 5 and of 140 300 cm is silt loam sand silt clay is 29 6 65 5 4 9 the soil in the 0 0 0 4 m layer has a ph of 8 1 41 5 mg kg 1 available n 7 11 mg kg 1 available p 76 8 mg kg 1 available k and 0 94 organic matter the experimental plantation was established in april 2015 with 1 year old trees of the clone b301 p tomentosa p bolleana p tomentosa of p tomentosa the trees were spaced 2 m apart within the tree row and 3 m between rows leading to a tree density of 1666 trees ha 1 we applied two drip irrigation treatments described in detail in li et al 2018a 2018b irrigation was initiated when the average soil matric potential ψ m at 0 2 m depth below drippers reached 20 kpa 79 of field capacity and 73 of soil water availability and 45 kpa 60 of field capacity and 48 of soil water availability for what we named the well watered ww and the water stress ws treatments respectively on average irrigation events in ww and ws lasted for 6 5 h and 9 h respectively the experiment was designed based on our previous studies which showed that the growth and transpiration of p tomentosa would be constrained when the soil water availability was lower than 70 and 60 respectively xi et al 2016 2017 consequently according to our previous experience it is reasonable to use these two irrigation thresholds to define a stress level each year in order to promote the leaf out one irrigation i e leaf spreading irrigation was applied for both treatments at the time of tree budding and then the experiment started the irrigation period lasted from april to october with the details given in fig 1 the drip irrigation system consisted of two laterals per tree row each on one side of the tree row and 0 3 m apart from the trunk the lateral had one 1 6 l h 1 dripper every 0 5 m for each treatment we had six 24 m 18 m plots i e six replicates with 72 trees each eight tree lines with nine trees per line distributed in a completely randomized block design within each plot we considered the 20 central trees for measurements and left the others as border trees each tree was fertilized with 80 g n per year and herbicide was regularly applied for weed control 2 2 measurements in the third replicated plot of each treatment ψ m was measured using tensiometers ts30 shunlong beijing china installed at 20 cm depth below the drippers near five selected sample trees for each treatment data were recorded manually at about 8 00 am every day all along the two growing seasons for each treatment four representative sample trees were selected in the third replicated plot for measuring the trunk diameter fluctuation and they kept the same in both growing seasons the trees had an average dbh of 4 16 0 11 cm ww and 4 12 0 12 cm ws on 01 04 2016 and 8 30 0 35 cm ww and 8 20 0 19 cm ws on 01 04 2017 we used one point dendrometer tdf10 sinton technology ltd beijing china per tree installed on the north face of the trunk at 1 m above ground this minimized any possible influence of wind and temperature differences among trees on the tdf records in both irrigation seasons measurements were performed from early april to late october data were recorded at 30 min intervals in 2016 and 10 min intervals in 2017 with 1 μm accuracy and stored in a data logger i logger sinton technology ltd beijing china due to the limitation of data logger and cable length the dendrometers were only installed in the third replicated plot for measurements of midday stem water potential ψ stem we used a scholander type pressure chamber skpm1400 skye instruments ltd uk two leaves were sampled from one central tree in each of four other plots n 4 which were different from the one chosen for the tdf measurements in order to avoid traffic around the dendrometers leaves were sampled from the east side of the canopy at about 1 7 m height and were kept as close to the trunk as possible during the measurement period april 18 to july 19 of ψ stem in 2017 the average tree height was more than 8 m and the canopies of adjacent trees were almost in contact so our sample leaves were growing in a shadow environment therefore they were suitable for ψ stem measurements in addition according to our field measurements in different canopy layers the variation of ψ stem within canopy was small two hours before sampling leaves were enclosed in a black plastic bag covered with aluminum foil measurements were made at about 12 00 every 3 5 days measurements of leaf area index lai m2 m 2 were made at dawn or after sunset every 10 30 days from april to october with a lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa two optical sensors were used simultaneously to measure optical parameters outside a and inside b the plantation we matched the a and b sensors before starting the measurement so that they read the same value in the same environment the a optical sensor was placed on the open space outside the plantation without being affected by canopy and collected data every 30 s automatically we used b optical sensor to collect canopy data manually at seven locations in each one of the six plots per treatment finally we applied the data of a and b to calculate the lai each plot through fv2200 li cor lincoln ne usa software air temperature t a rainfall r total solar global radiation r s and relative humidity rh were monitored in a weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk at 0 9 km away from the experimental site all weather variables were measured every 10 min from those records we derived air vapor pressure deficit d a and the fao56 penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 2 3 data analysis to reveal the possible differences in seasonal growth patterns i e growth onset duration of each stage and cessation between the two irrigation treatments during two growing seasons we derived estimates of trunk growth rate from the tdf records for that purpose we used the gompertz function which is one of the most commonly applied models to describe growth patterns due to its flexibility and asymmetrical shape rossi et al 2003 duchesne et al 2012 wang et al 2015a 2015b tian et al 2017a the model is described as 1 y y o aexp e β κt where y is the daily averaged raw measurement y o and a are the lower and upper asymptotes respectively β is the x axis placement parameter κ is the rate of change parameter and t is time in days the parameters were estimated by the ordinary least squares method with the model procedure sas institute 2002 as applied by duchesne et al 2012 the use of this model has the advantage of smoothing the collected tdf records after smoothing daily growth rate values were calculated by tdf first order derivation we modeled the seasonal growth patterns of each instrumented tree and then we calculated the average per treatment n 4 timing of growth initiation and cessation was determined as the day of year doy when the modeled daily growth rates reached 20 μm day which corresponded to the growth rate curve reaching around horizontal line from the tdf records we derived mds μm values as described by dietrich et al 2018 these authors proposed a way of calculating mds values for fast growing trees as poplar trunk shrinkage and refilling typically follows a diurnal pattern with a minimum trunk diameter in the afternoon and a maximum trunk diameter in the early morning reported in many species zweifel et al 2001 dietrich et al 2018 but for young p tomentosa due to fast growing characteristics during the main growth seasons the maximum daily trunk diameter usually appears at night therefore in order to explore the use of tdf derived indicators to indicate tree water status we chose the maximum value of the first half of the day as the daily maximum trunk diameter mxtd to eliminate the impact of tree growth as much as possible thus mds values were calculated with the difference between the mxtd recorded in the morning and the daily minimum trunk diameter mntd occurring in the afternoon daily growth dg μm was calculated as the difference between the mxtd in every two successive days fernández and cuevas 2010 tgr μm d 1 was calculated with the average dg of five consecutive days fernández and cuevas 2010 intrigliolo and castel 2007 a kolmogorov smirnov test and a levene test were used to verify the assumptions of normality and the homogeneity of variances for all data of ψ m characterization of the seasonal growth patterns and tdf derived indicators independent t tests were used to compare whether there were significant differences between the two treatments in the characteristic parameters of the seasonal growth pattern table 1 and in the daily values of both ψ m and the tdf derived indicators paired sample t tests were applied to detect the treatment differences on lai and ψ stem these statistical analyses were conducted with spss software v 20 0 spss inc chicago usa linear correlations were used to identify the effect of environmental factors on tgr these statistical analyses and all graphics were performed with the origin 2018 software originlab usa 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions and plant water status the rainfall during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 amounted to 585 and 449 mm respectively fig 1 in both years most of the rainfall occurred in summer 83 2 of the total seasonal rainfall in 2016 and 72 7 in 2017 in spring just 6 6 2016 and 13 3 2017 of the total seasonal rainfall was collected more details are given in section 3 2 after describing the growth stages during the whole 2016 growing season ww trees were irrigated 25 times with a total irrigation amount ia of 255 mm the ws trees were irrigated 4 times with ia of 62 mm fig 1 in 2017 ww and ws trees were irrigated 25 times and 4 times each with ia of 340 and 78 mm respectively the seasonal courses of ψ m are also shown in fig 1 for the ww treatment ψ m ranged from 9 0 to 23 0 kpa in 2016 and from 9 2 to 24 9 kpa in 2017 this means that the soil explored by the ww trees remained close to field capacity all throughout the growing seasons for the ws treatment greater variations in ψ m were recorded as expected thus ψ m ranged from 12 1 to 46 5 kpa in 2016 and from 8 0 to 59 5 kpa in 2017 in both years significant differences in ψ m p 0 05 between irrigation treatments were observed almost every day except around one week after irrigating the ws trees daily records of main meteorological variables are shown in fig 2 the average daily r s was higher in 2016 21 8 mj m 2 d 1 than in 2017 16 3 mj m 2 d 1 fig 2a d daily average t a values were 21 8 c in 2016 and 23 2 c in 2017 fig 2b e for the rh average daily values amounted to 81 7 in 2016 and 77 5 in 2017 fig 2b e the average daily value of d a was lower in 2016 0 56 kpa than in 2017 0 79 kpa the same applies to the eto 2 38 mm d 1 in 2016 and 2 81 mm d 1 in 2017 these data show that the atmospheric water demand was greater in 2017 than in 2016 the greatest seasonal values of r s 34 59 and 27 05 mj m 2 d 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively d a 2 17 and 1 95 kpa in 2016 and 2017 and eto 5 57 and 4 69 mm d 1 in 2016 and 2017 were recorded around doy 160 during the growing season in 2017 when the water potential of stem was measured values of ψ stem in the ww trees ranged from 0 33 0 06 to 1 50 0 15 mpa and from to 0 45 0 02 to 1 53 0 09 mpa in the ws trees fig 3 no differences between treatments were found for ψ stem despite significant differences in ψ m between treatments in most days along the season fig 1 3 2 growth patterns the results of the gompertz function i e the modeled tdf data exhibited remarkable agreement with the measured tdf values with r 2 values equal or greater than 0 99 data not shown the seasonal courses of the modeled tdf values for both treatments and years are shown in fig 4 a daily growth rate values calculated by tdf first order derivation are shown in fig 4b the seasonal courses of the tdf values recorded in trees of both treatments and years showed a s shape fig 4a differences on growth rates are better depicted in fig 4b and quantified in tables 1 and table 2 there were no significant differences between treatments in the timing of growth initiation for any of the two experimental years although differences between treatments were not significant table 2 the timing of growth cessation tended to be earlier in the ww trees than in the ws trees on both experimental years table 1 fig 4 shows that in 2017 the ww trees showed maximum growth significantly earlier than the ws trees p 0 05 differences in 2016 however were not significant in addition maximum growth rates were higher in 2016 than 2017 on both treatments we did not find differences on the duration of the growing season either between treatments or between years the cumulative seasonal growth however was higher in 2016 than in 2017 with no differences within the same year between treatments tables 1 and 2 on the contrary average lai was lower in 2016 than in 2017 with no differences within the same year between treatments fig 4c this was expected because of differences on tree age according to figs 4 a and b we can define the seasonal growth pattern of young poplar trees as follows stage i early spring budding stage a period prior to the growth initiation stage ii spring summer fast growth stage from growth initiation to the time of maximum growth stage iii summer autumn slow growth stage from the time of maximum growth to growth cessation and stage iv winter preparation stage after growth cessation the greatest values of growth rate were recorded in stage ii and part of stage iii fig 4a daily growth rate decreased markedly in the second half of stage iii this pattern agrees with the seasonal course of lai showing that trunk growth was closely related to shoot and leaf growth in stage ii of 2016 we observed no differences between treatments on growth rate and lai in stage ii of 2017 however the growth rate was significantly higher in ww than in ws from the beginning of stage ii and then achieved about the same value for both irrigation treatments from doy 181 fig 4b similar to lai in stage ii of 2017 lai in the 2016 stage ii had greater values in ww than ws but without significant differences p 0 05 3 3 tdf derived indicators to assess water status fig 5 shows examples of 24 h tdf records monitored at different growth stages both in 2016 and 2017 as expected daily tdf curves were flat on stages i and iv when there was no growth and the transpiration was low fig 5d c g at stages ii and iii however the trunk of all instrumented trees shrank during the day and expanded at night and differences on mxtd between two consecutive days showed trunk growth values of mxtd were recorded around 8 00 am then decreased until ca 16 00 pm when mntd values were recorded and increased afterwards all along the night fig 5a b e f values of mntd were usually lower in ws than in ww trees fig 5a b e f leading to greater mds values the derived tdf related indices are shown in fig 6 both at stages ii and iii of the two experimental years mds values were occasionally significantly higher in ws than in ww fig 6a d as already mentioned differences in dg between treatments occurred on discrete days and some consecutive days on stage ii of 2017 the ws trees showed significantly lower dg than the ww trees tgr was the water stress indicator with less noisy time courses fig 6 still significant differences between treatments were observed every day from doy 118 145 in 2017 fig 6 f this period was also the time when there were obvious differences in growth rate and lai between treatments indicating the robustness of tgr given that tgr was the indicator best showing the differences between the two irrigation treatments at stage ii in 2017 linear correlations were used to test the relationship between tgr values recorded in ww trees and ψ m ψ stem and main meteorological variables fig 7 our data show that tgr of ww trees was significantly correlated with r s t a d a and eto there was no relationship with ψ m and although there was a significant relationship between ψ stem and tgr this showed a low r 2 value fig 7f indicating that the correlation was too weak to take it into account no relationships were found between tgr of ws trees and the other variables data not shown 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal growth pattern information on intra and inter annual growth patterns for individual trees is important for the rational and accurate forests management to increase yields for poplar however most authors focused on the seasonal or annual trunk diameter increase wang et al 2015a 2015b yan et al 2018 rarely describing the seasonal growth patterns and its associated parameters such as the timing of growth initiation and cessation the growing season duration etc only xiao et al 2014 reported s shaped seasonal growth curve for mature p euphratica trees which was already in slow growth stage and identified the onset of tree growth in late may and the main period for the stem radial growth in may august but for fast growing young trees there are still no related reports about these specific growth pattern associated parameters this is the first study to accurately and quantitatively describe the growth nodes of fast growing young p tomentosa which will be helpful to explore the factors affecting growth initiation growing season duration etc in the present study irrigation did not affect the growth initiation timing and the growing season duration of p tomentosa on the contrary it was observed in a p euramericana cv eugenei plantation that irrigation could prolong the growth season by almost one month dickmann et al 1996 several variables have been reported to influence maximum growth rate these include maximum day length for conifers in cold environments rossi et al 2006 snow depth and snowmelt time in balsam fir tree duchesne et al 2012 rainfall during the driest season in mangrove forests xiong et al 2019 and available soil water in platycladus orientalis jiang et al 2015 our findings showed that maximum growth rate of young p tomentosa trees occurred in early june doy151 160 both in 2016 and 2017 i e at about the same time of maximum r s d a and eto values interestingly maximum growth rate occurred 8 days significantly p 0 05 earlier in ww than in ws trees this suggests an influence of soil water conditions such that shallow soil water deficit could delay the occurrence of maximum growth rate indeed it has been often reported that soil drought can reduce forest production and if severe induce tree mortality ciais et al 2005 hernández santana et al 2009 allen et al 2010 adams et al 2017 choat et al 2018 in our study the 2016 data shows that the soil water deficit in the most superficial soil layers of the ws treatment did not affect annual growth of three year old p tomentosa fig 4 as compared to the ww trees as shown in fig 5 the difference in mntd indicates that soil water deficit caused greater stem shrinkage but does not affect its growth potential in 2017 however when the trees were four year old it reduced tree growth at stage ii these results suggest that differences in the available soil water even if small enough for not causing differences in ψ stem of the lower canopy fig 3 were enough to induced differences in growth it is known that the root system of p tomentosa trees is deep enough to withdraw water from deep soil layers when the top soil layers are drying xi et al 2018 the roots reached 3 m depth with 91 of fine roots within the top 1 m soil during this study data not shown that does not mean however that the plant water status will not be affected when the plant has to take up water from deeper soil layers as reported by yang et al 2017 deep soil water is likely to make a significant contribution to drought avoidance over the dry period but the available of shallow soil water to the fine roots during dry season may determine how well trees grow in 2017 the trees were four year old and had bigger canopies than in 2016 with maximum average leaf area index of 3 60 in ww trees and 3 65 in ws trees measured in mid august fig 4c leading to higher transpiration this year therefore the tree water needs were greater than in 2016 and the soil water availability in the ws treatment was not enough for the trees to achieve maximum potential trunk growth fig 4 4 2 potential of tdf record to diagnose tree water stress our findings on tree growth rate vs soil water discussed above suggest that stage ii when there was less rainfall than stage iii is the most sensitive to soil water status this has to be considered when deriving any irrigation strategy for p tomentosa trees considering the water stress indicator that can be derived from the tdf records to schedule irrigation our results suggest that tgr is more reliable than mds and dg the mds is among the most widely used indicators since it had been reported to be a robust indicator of plant water status ortuño et al 2004 2006b and 2007 liu et al 2011 de la rosa et al 2015 in woody plants under increasing water deficit however it has been observed that mds increases with decreasing midday ψ stem until a certain level of water stress ranging from ca 1 0 mpa in grapevines to 1 8 mpa in lemon trees ortuño et al 2010 after those threshold values mds declines with decreasing midday ψ stem mds is also affected by several crop factors such as crop load many authors therefore consider that mds is not a reliable indicator of tree water stress intrigliolo and castel 2007 silber et al 2013 fernández 2014 for young trees similar to those in our plantation mds has been reported to be particularly unreliable goldhamer and fereres 2001 moriana and fereres 2002 the other tdf derived indicator assessed tgr has been proposed as a reliable water stress indicator because maximizing tree growth was normally the agronomic objective particularly in young woody trees nortes et al 2005 corell et al 2017 and 2019 martín palomo et al 2019 tgr values are usually calculated as the difference in the mxtd recorded on several consecutive days in order to reduce the noise caused by the day to day variability fernández and cuevas 2010 in our study tgr was the indicator most sensitively reflecting differences between the two irrigation treatments in accordance with the growth patterns observed our tgr values indicated that there were significant differences in tree water status between ww and ws at stage ii the key growth stage for p tomentosa when we found that growth rate was significantly lower in ws trees than in ww trees thus tgr was a more reliable indicator to assess tree water stress than mds for our experimental conditions this agrees with the findings reported by cuevas et al 2013 they worked in a hedgerow olive orchard planted with 4 year old olive trees in south spain and found that mxtd was a more reliable indicator of water stress than mds moreover tgr was significantly correlated with the main weather variables affecting growth especially with r s and eto two main driving variables of plant transpiration fig 7 the lack of correlation between tgr and ψ m agrees with the ψ m values measured at 0 2 m below ground being little representative of the soil water conditions in the whole rhizosphere of the experimental trees concerning the midday ψ stem values these are considered to be among the most sensitive indicators of tree water status goldhamer and fereres 2001 ortuño et al 2006a conejero et al 2007a b de la rosa et al 2013 conesa et al 2016 mirás avalos et al 2016 dietrich et al 2018 dietrich and kahmen 2019 our results however show increasing tgr values with decreasing ψ stem fig 7f i e with increasing water stress while it is known that it should be the other way round this was likely due to that around doy 120 the lower transpiration leaded to a lower tgr even though the ψ stem at that time was high around 0 5 mpa another possible reason for this may be due to the small range of midday ψ stem values occurring during our experiments fig 7 in fact shows midday ψ stem values greater than 1 5 mpa typical of moderate to low tree water stress for deriving a robust tgr vs midday ψ stem relationship measurements in more stressed trees are required the important feature that can be derived from our results is that tdf derived water stress indicators and in particular tgr were more sensitive than midday ψ stem in detecting the onset of tree water stress however these results must be interpreted with caution since midday ψ stem measurements were conducted in the lower canopy due to difficulty in obtain the leaves from the upper canopy for tall trees it is not clear whether the stem water potential of the upper canopy was sensitive to the water stress the correlation analyses displayed in fig 7 were also made for the tgr records from the ws trees contrary to what happens with the ww trees where tgr was influenced by weather variables in the case of ws trees tgr was not related to any of the variables considered in fig 7 this confirms that differences in soil water status between treatments were enough to influence tgr values 5 conclusions we have identified differentiated growth stages in young p tomentosa trees this is the first time that the growth pattern and its associated parameters are identified accurately and quantitatively for this species apart from stages i and iv which correspond to periods of almost no growth at the beginning and at the end of the season respectively stage ii is a period from mid april to mid june when the trees show maximum growth rates in stage iii which goes from mid june to early september growth is still active but at decreasing rates irrigation did not affect the growth initiation and cessation timing but significantly affected the maximum growth rate of 4 year old trees for our conditions 3 year old p tomentosa trees did not benefit from the applied irrigation suggesting that soil water was enough to meet the water demand of trees under the rain fed condition in the larger 4 year old trees however irrigation promoted growth this suggests that irrigation is required as trees grow older and larger and have greater water demand this applies specially to stage ii when the maximum growth rates were recorded our results show that high resolution trunk dendrometers are useful tool to both monitor trunk growth and assess tree water stress from the tested trunk diameter fluctuation indicators tgr was the most reliable for the assessment of tree water status tgr records were more sensitive in detecting the onset of water stress in p tomentosa than midday ψ stem this implies that high precision dendrometers can be a promising tool to accurately schedule irrigation in fast growing poplar plantations still the specific threshold value that indicates the onset of water stress need to be further explored because of the influence of trees age seasons and other factors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10471,high resolution measurements of trunk diameter fluctuations tdf provide a means to study short term and long term stem radial variations and response to water stress of fruit trees there is a lack of information however on the performance of tdf measurements on fast growing poplar trees to both clarify the intra annual and inter annual growth patterns and to diagnose water status of young poplar trees we monitored tdf leaf area index soil matric potential midday stem water potential ψ stem and main meteorological variables in a plantation with 3 and 4 year old populus tomentosa trees over two growing seasons 2016 and 2017 we had two irrigation treatments well watered ww and water stressed ws for the first time for this species we identified accurately and quantitatively the seasonal growth pattern and associated parameters growth initiation and cessation time growing season duration maximum growth rate etc of young p tomentosa with four clear stages based on the growth rate for both treatments we identified that stage ii mid april to mid june when trees showed the most active growth rate and less rainfall was recorded is the most crucial stage for irrigation management especially as trees grow larger and have a greater water demand in the two experimental years irrigation did not affect the timing of growth initiation and cessation however maximum growth rate was significantly higher and occurred earlier in the ww trees than in the ws trees from the tested trunk diameter fluctuation indicators trunk growth rate tgr showed a greater potential for assessing tree water stress than both maximum daily shrinkage mds and daily growth dg being even more sensitive to the onset of water stress than midday ψ stem we conclude that high resolution trunk

dendrometer irrigation scheduling water stress trunk growth rate maximum daily shrinkage poplar 1 introduction poplar populus spp is a commonly used species for wood production and shelterbelts and has been widely planted in the north china plain zhang et al 2012 xi et al 2016 for those purposes since water is a crucial growth limiting factor highly influencing both yield and wood quality irrigation is often applied in north china to increase the growth of poplar plantations xi et al 2014 yan et al 2018 previous works have shown that poplar trees have different water demands at various seasons and stand ages xi et al 2017 yang et al 2019 however little attention has been paid to the growth pattern of young poplar trees and its response to water status in addition a better knowledge of how water availability affects growth will be useful to define rational irrigation regimes focusing on avoiding both water waste and undesired stress events to determine the intra annual and inter annual stem growth it is useful to record the trunk diameter fluctuations tdf also known as stem radial variations with high resolution dendrometers duchesne and houle 2011 cocozza et al 2012 vieira et al 2013 tian et al 2017a maaten van der et al 2018 these records allow us to better understand short and long term growth patterns and their relations with changing environmental conditions zweifel et al 2010 and 2016 vandegehuchte et al 2014 oberhuber et al 2015 tian et al 2017b dietrich et al 2018 maaten van der et al 2018 reviews by drew and downes 2009 and de swaef et al 2015 provided valuable insights into how radially varying wood properties depends on the past climatic conditions and discussed a systematic approach to plant phenology and dendroclimatology also the works by zweifel et al 2006 köcher et al 2012 vieira et al 2013 wang et al 2015a 2015b zhang et al 2016 tian et al 2017a and liu et al 2018 among others carried out with several woody species growing in natural mature forests illustrated the use of data on intra annual radial growth patterns derived from records with electronic high precision dendrometers to explore relationships with the seasonal climatic course and to forecast the response of tree growth to climate change in addition to characterize growth patterns dendrometers are useful to identify the impact of water stress in tdf as shown by several authors in a variety of tree species ortuño et al 2006a 2006b conejero et al 2007a fernández et al 2011 cuevas et al 2013 du et al 2017 this explains the potential of tdf records for scheduling precision irrigation of woody species conejero et al 2007b fernández and cuevas 2010 ortuño et al 2010 conesa et al 2016 corell et al 2017 martín palomo et al 2019 yet most of the studies on irrigation scheduling from tdf measurements have been conducted in fruit trees ortuño et al 2010 to our knowledge no tdf results on young fast growing poplar trees have been published despite their potential interest on managing poplar commercial plantations the closest work we have found is that by xiao et al 2014 who used dendrometers to derive the growth patterns of mature populus euphratica in relatively slow growth stage at the daily and seasonal levels however as to the fast growing young poplar trees the growth pattern and its variation with soil water conditions is still not precisely understood on the other hand there is not a consensus on which index among those that can be derived from tdf measurements fernández and cuevas 2010 is the best for assessing tree water status for example velez et al 2007 conejero et al 2007a 2007b puerto et al 2013 conesa et al 2016 and du et al 2017 reported that the maximum daily trunk shrinkage mds was more reliable than trunk growth rate tgr for the assessment of water status in citrus peach almond grape and apple plants on the contrary girón et al 2016 corell et al 2017 and martín palomo et al 2019 concluded that tgr was a better indicator for detecting water stress in olive and almond trees than mds thus our overall objective is to determine if tdf records are useful to both derive growth patterns and detect the onset and severity of water stress in young fast growing p tomentosa trees which is a native and important tree species in the north china plain the specific objectives of our study are 1 to compare differences of intra annual and inter annual growth patterns in fast growing poplar trees under different irrigation treatments and 2 to determine whether tdf derived indicators can be used for the reliable assessment of water status in those trees we monitored tdf with point dendrometers over a 2 year period in a young p tomentosa plantation in the north china plain our results can be useful to schedule irrigation in poplar plantations according to tree growth patterns and their response to water stress which could lead to significant water savings 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and treatments the study was conducted during 2016 and 2017 at a state owned forest farm in gaotang county shandong province latitude 36 81 n longitude 116 09 e elevation 30 m this area is a typical yellow river alluvial plain located in northern china the climate in the region is warm temperate monsoon with average air temperature of 13 41 and average rainfall of 563 mm 1981 2010 period the experimental site is flat and has relatively stable groundwater level at about 6 m depth the soil layer of 0 140 cm is sandy loam sand silt clay is 62 9 34 6 2 5 and of 140 300 cm is silt loam sand silt clay is 29 6 65 5 4 9 the soil in the 0 0 0 4 m layer has a ph of 8 1 41 5 mg kg 1 available n 7 11 mg kg 1 available p 76 8 mg kg 1 available k and 0 94 organic matter the experimental plantation was established in april 2015 with 1 year old trees of the clone b301 p tomentosa p bolleana p tomentosa of p tomentosa the trees were spaced 2 m apart within the tree row and 3 m between rows leading to a tree density of 1666 trees ha 1 we applied two drip irrigation treatments described in detail in li et al 2018a 2018b irrigation was initiated when the average soil matric potential ψ m at 0 2 m depth below drippers reached 20 kpa 79 of field capacity and 73 of soil water availability and 45 kpa 60 of field capacity and 48 of soil water availability for what we named the well watered ww and the water stress ws treatments respectively on average irrigation events in ww and ws lasted for 6 5 h and 9 h respectively the experiment was designed based on our previous studies which showed that the growth and transpiration of p tomentosa would be constrained when the soil water availability was lower than 70 and 60 respectively xi et al 2016 2017 consequently according to our previous experience it is reasonable to use these two irrigation thresholds to define a stress level each year in order to promote the leaf out one irrigation i e leaf spreading irrigation was applied for both treatments at the time of tree budding and then the experiment started the irrigation period lasted from april to october with the details given in fig 1 the drip irrigation system consisted of two laterals per tree row each on one side of the tree row and 0 3 m apart from the trunk the lateral had one 1 6 l h 1 dripper every 0 5 m for each treatment we had six 24 m 18 m plots i e six replicates with 72 trees each eight tree lines with nine trees per line distributed in a completely randomized block design within each plot we considered the 20 central trees for measurements and left the others as border trees each tree was fertilized with 80 g n per year and herbicide was regularly applied for weed control 2 2 measurements in the third replicated plot of each treatment ψ m was measured using tensiometers ts30 shunlong beijing china installed at 20 cm depth below the drippers near five selected sample trees for each treatment data were recorded manually at about 8 00 am every day all along the two growing seasons for each treatment four representative sample trees were selected in the third replicated plot for measuring the trunk diameter fluctuation and they kept the same in both growing seasons the trees had an average dbh of 4 16 0 11 cm ww and 4 12 0 12 cm ws on 01 04 2016 and 8 30 0 35 cm ww and 8 20 0 19 cm ws on 01 04 2017 we used one point dendrometer tdf10 sinton technology ltd beijing china per tree installed on the north face of the trunk at 1 m above ground this minimized any possible influence of wind and temperature differences among trees on the tdf records in both irrigation seasons measurements were performed from early april to late october data were recorded at 30 min intervals in 2016 and 10 min intervals in 2017 with 1 μm accuracy and stored in a data logger i logger sinton technology ltd beijing china due to the limitation of data logger and cable length the dendrometers were only installed in the third replicated plot for measurements of midday stem water potential ψ stem we used a scholander type pressure chamber skpm1400 skye instruments ltd uk two leaves were sampled from one central tree in each of four other plots n 4 which were different from the one chosen for the tdf measurements in order to avoid traffic around the dendrometers leaves were sampled from the east side of the canopy at about 1 7 m height and were kept as close to the trunk as possible during the measurement period april 18 to july 19 of ψ stem in 2017 the average tree height was more than 8 m and the canopies of adjacent trees were almost in contact so our sample leaves were growing in a shadow environment therefore they were suitable for ψ stem measurements in addition according to our field measurements in different canopy layers the variation of ψ stem within canopy was small two hours before sampling leaves were enclosed in a black plastic bag covered with aluminum foil measurements were made at about 12 00 every 3 5 days measurements of leaf area index lai m2 m 2 were made at dawn or after sunset every 10 30 days from april to october with a lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer li cor lincoln ne usa two optical sensors were used simultaneously to measure optical parameters outside a and inside b the plantation we matched the a and b sensors before starting the measurement so that they read the same value in the same environment the a optical sensor was placed on the open space outside the plantation without being affected by canopy and collected data every 30 s automatically we used b optical sensor to collect canopy data manually at seven locations in each one of the six plots per treatment finally we applied the data of a and b to calculate the lai each plot through fv2200 li cor lincoln ne usa software air temperature t a rainfall r total solar global radiation r s and relative humidity rh were monitored in a weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk at 0 9 km away from the experimental site all weather variables were measured every 10 min from those records we derived air vapor pressure deficit d a and the fao56 penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 2 3 data analysis to reveal the possible differences in seasonal growth patterns i e growth onset duration of each stage and cessation between the two irrigation treatments during two growing seasons we derived estimates of trunk growth rate from the tdf records for that purpose we used the gompertz function which is one of the most commonly applied models to describe growth patterns due to its flexibility and asymmetrical shape rossi et al 2003 duchesne et al 2012 wang et al 2015a 2015b tian et al 2017a the model is described as 1 y y o aexp e β κt where y is the daily averaged raw measurement y o and a are the lower and upper asymptotes respectively β is the x axis placement parameter κ is the rate of change parameter and t is time in days the parameters were estimated by the ordinary least squares method with the model procedure sas institute 2002 as applied by duchesne et al 2012 the use of this model has the advantage of smoothing the collected tdf records after smoothing daily growth rate values were calculated by tdf first order derivation we modeled the seasonal growth patterns of each instrumented tree and then we calculated the average per treatment n 4 timing of growth initiation and cessation was determined as the day of year doy when the modeled daily growth rates reached 20 μm day which corresponded to the growth rate curve reaching around horizontal line from the tdf records we derived mds μm values as described by dietrich et al 2018 these authors proposed a way of calculating mds values for fast growing trees as poplar trunk shrinkage and refilling typically follows a diurnal pattern with a minimum trunk diameter in the afternoon and a maximum trunk diameter in the early morning reported in many species zweifel et al 2001 dietrich et al 2018 but for young p tomentosa due to fast growing characteristics during the main growth seasons the maximum daily trunk diameter usually appears at night therefore in order to explore the use of tdf derived indicators to indicate tree water status we chose the maximum value of the first half of the day as the daily maximum trunk diameter mxtd to eliminate the impact of tree growth as much as possible thus mds values were calculated with the difference between the mxtd recorded in the morning and the daily minimum trunk diameter mntd occurring in the afternoon daily growth dg μm was calculated as the difference between the mxtd in every two successive days fernández and cuevas 2010 tgr μm d 1 was calculated with the average dg of five consecutive days fernández and cuevas 2010 intrigliolo and castel 2007 a kolmogorov smirnov test and a levene test were used to verify the assumptions of normality and the homogeneity of variances for all data of ψ m characterization of the seasonal growth patterns and tdf derived indicators independent t tests were used to compare whether there were significant differences between the two treatments in the characteristic parameters of the seasonal growth pattern table 1 and in the daily values of both ψ m and the tdf derived indicators paired sample t tests were applied to detect the treatment differences on lai and ψ stem these statistical analyses were conducted with spss software v 20 0 spss inc chicago usa linear correlations were used to identify the effect of environmental factors on tgr these statistical analyses and all graphics were performed with the origin 2018 software originlab usa 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions and plant water status the rainfall during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 amounted to 585 and 449 mm respectively fig 1 in both years most of the rainfall occurred in summer 83 2 of the total seasonal rainfall in 2016 and 72 7 in 2017 in spring just 6 6 2016 and 13 3 2017 of the total seasonal rainfall was collected more details are given in section 3 2 after describing the growth stages during the whole 2016 growing season ww trees were irrigated 25 times with a total irrigation amount ia of 255 mm the ws trees were irrigated 4 times with ia of 62 mm fig 1 in 2017 ww and ws trees were irrigated 25 times and 4 times each with ia of 340 and 78 mm respectively the seasonal courses of ψ m are also shown in fig 1 for the ww treatment ψ m ranged from 9 0 to 23 0 kpa in 2016 and from 9 2 to 24 9 kpa in 2017 this means that the soil explored by the ww trees remained close to field capacity all throughout the growing seasons for the ws treatment greater variations in ψ m were recorded as expected thus ψ m ranged from 12 1 to 46 5 kpa in 2016 and from 8 0 to 59 5 kpa in 2017 in both years significant differences in ψ m p 0 05 between irrigation treatments were observed almost every day except around one week after irrigating the ws trees daily records of main meteorological variables are shown in fig 2 the average daily r s was higher in 2016 21 8 mj m 2 d 1 than in 2017 16 3 mj m 2 d 1 fig 2a d daily average t a values were 21 8 c in 2016 and 23 2 c in 2017 fig 2b e for the rh average daily values amounted to 81 7 in 2016 and 77 5 in 2017 fig 2b e the average daily value of d a was lower in 2016 0 56 kpa than in 2017 0 79 kpa the same applies to the eto 2 38 mm d 1 in 2016 and 2 81 mm d 1 in 2017 these data show that the atmospheric water demand was greater in 2017 than in 2016 the greatest seasonal values of r s 34 59 and 27 05 mj m 2 d 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively d a 2 17 and 1 95 kpa in 2016 and 2017 and eto 5 57 and 4 69 mm d 1 in 2016 and 2017 were recorded around doy 160 during the growing season in 2017 when the water potential of stem was measured values of ψ stem in the ww trees ranged from 0 33 0 06 to 1 50 0 15 mpa and from to 0 45 0 02 to 1 53 0 09 mpa in the ws trees fig 3 no differences between treatments were found for ψ stem despite significant differences in ψ m between treatments in most days along the season fig 1 3 2 growth patterns the results of the gompertz function i e the modeled tdf data exhibited remarkable agreement with the measured tdf values with r 2 values equal or greater than 0 99 data not shown the seasonal courses of the modeled tdf values for both treatments and years are shown in fig 4 a daily growth rate values calculated by tdf first order derivation are shown in fig 4b the seasonal courses of the tdf values recorded in trees of both treatments and years showed a s shape fig 4a differences on growth rates are better depicted in fig 4b and quantified in tables 1 and table 2 there were no significant differences between treatments in the timing of growth initiation for any of the two experimental years although differences between treatments were not significant table 2 the timing of growth cessation tended to be earlier in the ww trees than in the ws trees on both experimental years table 1 fig 4 shows that in 2017 the ww trees showed maximum growth significantly earlier than the ws trees p 0 05 differences in 2016 however were not significant in addition maximum growth rates were higher in 2016 than 2017 on both treatments we did not find differences on the duration of the growing season either between treatments or between years the cumulative seasonal growth however was higher in 2016 than in 2017 with no differences within the same year between treatments tables 1 and 2 on the contrary average lai was lower in 2016 than in 2017 with no differences within the same year between treatments fig 4c this was expected because of differences on tree age according to figs 4 a and b we can define the seasonal growth pattern of young poplar trees as follows stage i early spring budding stage a period prior to the growth initiation stage ii spring summer fast growth stage from growth initiation to the time of maximum growth stage iii summer autumn slow growth stage from the time of maximum growth to growth cessation and stage iv winter preparation stage after growth cessation the greatest values of growth rate were recorded in stage ii and part of stage iii fig 4a daily growth rate decreased markedly in the second half of stage iii this pattern agrees with the seasonal course of lai showing that trunk growth was closely related to shoot and leaf growth in stage ii of 2016 we observed no differences between treatments on growth rate and lai in stage ii of 2017 however the growth rate was significantly higher in ww than in ws from the beginning of stage ii and then achieved about the same value for both irrigation treatments from doy 181 fig 4b similar to lai in stage ii of 2017 lai in the 2016 stage ii had greater values in ww than ws but without significant differences p 0 05 3 3 tdf derived indicators to assess water status fig 5 shows examples of 24 h tdf records monitored at different growth stages both in 2016 and 2017 as expected daily tdf curves were flat on stages i and iv when there was no growth and the transpiration was low fig 5d c g at stages ii and iii however the trunk of all instrumented trees shrank during the day and expanded at night and differences on mxtd between two consecutive days showed trunk growth values of mxtd were recorded around 8 00 am then decreased until ca 16 00 pm when mntd values were recorded and increased afterwards all along the night fig 5a b e f values of mntd were usually lower in ws than in ww trees fig 5a b e f leading to greater mds values the derived tdf related indices are shown in fig 6 both at stages ii and iii of the two experimental years mds values were occasionally significantly higher in ws than in ww fig 6a d as already mentioned differences in dg between treatments occurred on discrete days and some consecutive days on stage ii of 2017 the ws trees showed significantly lower dg than the ww trees tgr was the water stress indicator with less noisy time courses fig 6 still significant differences between treatments were observed every day from doy 118 145 in 2017 fig 6 f this period was also the time when there were obvious differences in growth rate and lai between treatments indicating the robustness of tgr given that tgr was the indicator best showing the differences between the two irrigation treatments at stage ii in 2017 linear correlations were used to test the relationship between tgr values recorded in ww trees and ψ m ψ stem and main meteorological variables fig 7 our data show that tgr of ww trees was significantly correlated with r s t a d a and eto there was no relationship with ψ m and although there was a significant relationship between ψ stem and tgr this showed a low r 2 value fig 7f indicating that the correlation was too weak to take it into account no relationships were found between tgr of ws trees and the other variables data not shown 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal growth pattern information on intra and inter annual growth patterns for individual trees is important for the rational and accurate forests management to increase yields for poplar however most authors focused on the seasonal or annual trunk diameter increase wang et al 2015a 2015b yan et al 2018 rarely describing the seasonal growth patterns and its associated parameters such as the timing of growth initiation and cessation the growing season duration etc only xiao et al 2014 reported s shaped seasonal growth curve for mature p euphratica trees which was already in slow growth stage and identified the onset of tree growth in late may and the main period for the stem radial growth in may august but for fast growing young trees there are still no related reports about these specific growth pattern associated parameters this is the first study to accurately and quantitatively describe the growth nodes of fast growing young p tomentosa which will be helpful to explore the factors affecting growth initiation growing season duration etc in the present study irrigation did not affect the growth initiation timing and the growing season duration of p tomentosa on the contrary it was observed in a p euramericana cv eugenei plantation that irrigation could prolong the growth season by almost one month dickmann et al 1996 several variables have been reported to influence maximum growth rate these include maximum day length for conifers in cold environments rossi et al 2006 snow depth and snowmelt time in balsam fir tree duchesne et al 2012 rainfall during the driest season in mangrove forests xiong et al 2019 and available soil water in platycladus orientalis jiang et al 2015 our findings showed that maximum growth rate of young p tomentosa trees occurred in early june doy151 160 both in 2016 and 2017 i e at about the same time of maximum r s d a and eto values interestingly maximum growth rate occurred 8 days significantly p 0 05 earlier in ww than in ws trees this suggests an influence of soil water conditions such that shallow soil water deficit could delay the occurrence of maximum growth rate indeed it has been often reported that soil drought can reduce forest production and if severe induce tree mortality ciais et al 2005 hernández santana et al 2009 allen et al 2010 adams et al 2017 choat et al 2018 in our study the 2016 data shows that the soil water deficit in the most superficial soil layers of the ws treatment did not affect annual growth of three year old p tomentosa fig 4 as compared to the ww trees as shown in fig 5 the difference in mntd indicates that soil water deficit caused greater stem shrinkage but does not affect its growth potential in 2017 however when the trees were four year old it reduced tree growth at stage ii these results suggest that differences in the available soil water even if small enough for not causing differences in ψ stem of the lower canopy fig 3 were enough to induced differences in growth it is known that the root system of p tomentosa trees is deep enough to withdraw water from deep soil layers when the top soil layers are drying xi et al 2018 the roots reached 3 m depth with 91 of fine roots within the top 1 m soil during this study data not shown that does not mean however that the plant water status will not be affected when the plant has to take up water from deeper soil layers as reported by yang et al 2017 deep soil water is likely to make a significant contribution to drought avoidance over the dry period but the available of shallow soil water to the fine roots during dry season may determine how well trees grow in 2017 the trees were four year old and had bigger canopies than in 2016 with maximum average leaf area index of 3 60 in ww trees and 3 65 in ws trees measured in mid august fig 4c leading to higher transpiration this year therefore the tree water needs were greater than in 2016 and the soil water availability in the ws treatment was not enough for the trees to achieve maximum potential trunk growth fig 4 4 2 potential of tdf record to diagnose tree water stress our findings on tree growth rate vs soil water discussed above suggest that stage ii when there was less rainfall than stage iii is the most sensitive to soil water status this has to be considered when deriving any irrigation strategy for p tomentosa trees considering the water stress indicator that can be derived from the tdf records to schedule irrigation our results suggest that tgr is more reliable than mds and dg the mds is among the most widely used indicators since it had been reported to be a robust indicator of plant water status ortuño et al 2004 2006b and 2007 liu et al 2011 de la rosa et al 2015 in woody plants under increasing water deficit however it has been observed that mds increases with decreasing midday ψ stem until a certain level of water stress ranging from ca 1 0 mpa in grapevines to 1 8 mpa in lemon trees ortuño et al 2010 after those threshold values mds declines with decreasing midday ψ stem mds is also affected by several crop factors such as crop load many authors therefore consider that mds is not a reliable indicator of tree water stress intrigliolo and castel 2007 silber et al 2013 fernández 2014 for young trees similar to those in our plantation mds has been reported to be particularly unreliable goldhamer and fereres 2001 moriana and fereres 2002 the other tdf derived indicator assessed tgr has been proposed as a reliable water stress indicator because maximizing tree growth was normally the agronomic objective particularly in young woody trees nortes et al 2005 corell et al 2017 and 2019 martín palomo et al 2019 tgr values are usually calculated as the difference in the mxtd recorded on several consecutive days in order to reduce the noise caused by the day to day variability fernández and cuevas 2010 in our study tgr was the indicator most sensitively reflecting differences between the two irrigation treatments in accordance with the growth patterns observed our tgr values indicated that there were significant differences in tree water status between ww and ws at stage ii the key growth stage for p tomentosa when we found that growth rate was significantly lower in ws trees than in ww trees thus tgr was a more reliable indicator to assess tree water stress than mds for our experimental conditions this agrees with the findings reported by cuevas et al 2013 they worked in a hedgerow olive orchard planted with 4 year old olive trees in south spain and found that mxtd was a more reliable indicator of water stress than mds moreover tgr was significantly correlated with the main weather variables affecting growth especially with r s and eto two main driving variables of plant transpiration fig 7 the lack of correlation between tgr and ψ m agrees with the ψ m values measured at 0 2 m below ground being little representative of the soil water conditions in the whole rhizosphere of the experimental trees concerning the midday ψ stem values these are considered to be among the most sensitive indicators of tree water status goldhamer and fereres 2001 ortuño et al 2006a conejero et al 2007a b de la rosa et al 2013 conesa et al 2016 mirás avalos et al 2016 dietrich et al 2018 dietrich and kahmen 2019 our results however show increasing tgr values with decreasing ψ stem fig 7f i e with increasing water stress while it is known that it should be the other way round this was likely due to that around doy 120 the lower transpiration leaded to a lower tgr even though the ψ stem at that time was high around 0 5 mpa another possible reason for this may be due to the small range of midday ψ stem values occurring during our experiments fig 7 in fact shows midday ψ stem values greater than 1 5 mpa typical of moderate to low tree water stress for deriving a robust tgr vs midday ψ stem relationship measurements in more stressed trees are required the important feature that can be derived from our results is that tdf derived water stress indicators and in particular tgr were more sensitive than midday ψ stem in detecting the onset of tree water stress however these results must be interpreted with caution since midday ψ stem measurements were conducted in the lower canopy due to difficulty in obtain the leaves from the upper canopy for tall trees it is not clear whether the stem water potential of the upper canopy was sensitive to the water stress the correlation analyses displayed in fig 7 were also made for the tgr records from the ws trees contrary to what happens with the ww trees where tgr was influenced by weather variables in the case of ws trees tgr was not related to any of the variables considered in fig 7 this confirms that differences in soil water status between treatments were enough to influence tgr values 5 conclusions we have identified differentiated growth stages in young p tomentosa trees this is the first time that the growth pattern and its associated parameters are identified accurately and quantitatively for this species apart from stages i and iv which correspond to periods of almost no growth at the beginning and at the end of the season respectively stage ii is a period from mid april to mid june when the trees show maximum growth rates in stage iii which goes from mid june to early september growth is still active but at decreasing rates irrigation did not affect the growth initiation and cessation timing but significantly affected the maximum growth rate of 4 year old trees for our conditions 3 year old p tomentosa trees did not benefit from the applied irrigation suggesting that soil water was enough to meet the water demand of trees under the rain fed condition in the larger 4 year old trees however irrigation promoted growth this suggests that irrigation is required as trees grow older and larger and have greater water demand this applies specially to stage ii when the maximum growth rates were recorded our results show that high resolution trunk dendrometers are useful tool to both monitor trunk growth and assess tree water stress from the tested trunk diameter fluctuation indicators tgr was the most reliable for the assessment of tree water status tgr records were more sensitive in detecting the onset of water stress in p tomentosa than midday ψ stem this implies that high precision dendrometers can be a promising tool to accurately schedule irrigation in fast growing poplar plantations still the specific threshold value that indicates the onset of water stress need to be further explored because of the influence of trees age seasons and other factors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10472,rice is one of the largest water consuming crops alternate wetting and drying awd is now an effective water saving practice for rice cultivation that has been widely applied across the world awd may increase denitrification loss however the underlying mechanism remains unclear this study investigated denitrifier activity abundance and community structure in the rice rhizosphere and bulk soil in response to water management at the internode elongation ie and flowering f stages the results revealed that at the ie stage awd significantly increased denitrification capacity dc in the rhizosphere compared with continuously flooded practice cf dc was significantly and positively related to electrical conductivity ec and the abundance of nirs harboring denitrifiers awd led to higher ec in the 0 20 cm soil layer than cf although awd lowered nirs abundance by 15 compared with cf the activity of nirs harboring denitrifiers was enhanced by 1 89 folds of cf at the f stage awd significantly decreased dc relative to cf awd had lower dissolved organic carbon doc than cf and doc was significantly correlated with dc compared with cf awd also markedly changed the structure and network stability of nirs and nirk communities resulting in sharp decreases in the total number of links in nirk and nirs networks of rhizosphere the soil ph and ec were the key factors shaping the structure of nirs and nirk communities overall the increase in denitrification losses due to awd occurred primarily at the ie rather than f stage and this increase was attributed to a rise in ec and changes in the activity and structure of nirs community these findings provide a new insight into the mechanism of impact of the water saving practice on denitrification loss for rice cultivation keywords denitrification water management rice paddy growth stage soil layer pyrosequencing technique 1 introduction denitrification is a microbial reduction process from nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 to gaseous compounds as an integral part of the n cycle it is the only step returning fixed n to the atmosphere as n2 closing the cycle torregrosa crespo et al 2017 denitrification is also of particular concern as the main source of nitrous oxide n2o an important greenhouse gas and destroyer of the ozone layer ravishankara et al 2009 in the denitrification pathway the second step reducing no2 to no is of great importance because besides distinguishing denitrifying microbes from other nitrate respirers it produces the first gaseous product zumft 1997 this step is thereby prone to cause substantial loss of fertilizer n from agricultural fields and large economic costs it is performed either by a copper containing reductase encoded by the nirk gene or by a cytochrome cd1 reductase encoded by the nirs gene philippot 2002 compared with other agricultural soils rice paddy soil may have stronger denitrifying activity due to anaerobic conditions and massive inputs of n fertilizers worldwide the total area of rice fields is around 155 5 million hectares van nguyen and ferrero 2006 and obtains a total of 12 8 mt n from synthetic fertilizers per year mueller et al 2014 denitrification in rice paddy fields occupies a loss of up to 36 4 of the applied n ju et al 2009 the rhizosphere is the zone of hotspots of denitrification in paddy soil mainly due to the coupled nitrification denitrification process arth et al 1998 nh4 and urea based fertilizers are commonly used in rice fields resulting in generally low no3 concentration in flooded paddy soil therefore the activity of denitrification in paddy soil strongly depends on no3 production from nitrification denitrification in the rhizosphere mainly takes place at a distance of 1 5 5 0 mm from the root surface tightly surrounding the zone where intensive nitrification occurs 2 mm from root surface arth and frenzel 2000 apart from nitrification denitrification process the rhizosphere can provide a substantial amount of bioavailable organic carbon c compounds facilitating denitrification approximately 8 0 19 3 of total c derived from photosynthesis products of rice plants is transferred to the rhizosphere as root exudates ge et al 2015 the denitrification rate in the rhizosphere soil shows a dynamic variation during rice growth periods chen et al 2014 reported that denitrification rates in the rhizosphere at the booting and maturity stages of rice were much lower than that in the tillering stage the decline of no3 contents due to uptake by rice plants and n immobilization in soil is considered the main cause of the reduction in denitrification rate of rhizosphere kakuda et al 2000 the activity of denitrifier communities in the rhizosphere is also likely an important factor controlling the denitrification rate and requires further investigation as plants can suppress denitrification activity during the period when plants require more n kakuda et al 1999 in the growth stages of rice the internode elongation ie and flowering f stages need more attention when studying denitrification in rice rhizosphere soil this is because during the ie stage rice plant absorbs most of n from soil while during the f stage rice root releases the most organic c into soil aulakh et al 2001 lin et al 2006 denitrification in the rhizosphere may thus be strongly affected due to the changes in contents of n and c but the information about rhizosphere denitrification in the two stages is still lacking it is therefore necessary to identify the denitrification characteristics in the rhizosphere at the two stages rice is one of the largest consumers of freshwater obtaining 34 43 of the global irrigation water watanabe et al 2013 nowadays freshwater is becoming scarce due to climate change growing human population competition of urbanization etc chakkaravarthy and balakrishnan 2019 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 therefore new water saving technologies for rice production are developed to replace the traditional flood irrigation alternate wetting and drying awd is considered an effective water saving practice for rice cultivation with awd soil water holding capacity is allowed to reach 70 75 prior to the next irrigation wu et al 2017 compare with continuously flooded practice cf awd can save 23 4 of water use without adverse impacts on rice yield carrijo et al 2017 furthermore awd has been reported to reduce global warming potential by 45 90 relative to cf linquist et al 2015 currently efforts are underway in the world to promote awd for rice cultivation however recent studies have found that compared to cf awd increases 4 1 19 8 n loss of denitrification which can result in reduced plant n uptake tan et al 2015 the enhanced production of no3 from nitrification due to partially anaerobic conditions contributes to the increase in denitrification loss under awd condition lagomarsino et al 2016 indeed it is undeniable that no3 as a substrate of denitrifiers is a key factor affecting denitrification process but the underlying influence imposed by the activity of denitrifier communities in bulk and especially in the rhizosphere soil cannot be ruled out what s more awd has been shown to increase c allocation by 46 to the rhizosphere soil relative to cf atere et al 2017 awd can also cause lower soil ph and higher redox potential eh in the rhizosphere than cf das et al 2016 the chemical characteristics are considered the important factors shaping the composition and function of denitrifiers wang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 ligi et al 2014 however to our knowledge no studies have been conducted to identify the impact of water management on denitrifying activities and denitrifier communities in the rice rhizosphere the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the impact of the water management on denitrifier activity abundance and community structure in the rice rhizosphere vs the surrounding bulk soil at the ie and f stages and 2 to identify the vital factors shaping the structure and abundance of denitrifiers we hypothesized that denitrifier activity abundance and community structure responded differently to the water managements at the two key growth stages in this study a rhizobox experiment under the awd and cf conditions was performed using a paddy soil in the subtropical region to separate rice rhizosphere soil from bulk soil denitrification capacity in the rhizosphere and bulk soil was determined by the acetylene inhibition technique real time pcr and high throughput sequencing techniques were adopted to analyze the abundance and community structure of nirs and nirk harboring denitrifiers respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil preparation surface soils in layers of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30

an average annual rainfall of 1188 mm and a mean air temperature of 15 8 the paddy soil sandy loam is classified as gleysol fao classification soil samples from 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers were sieved 5 mm and then were packed in rhizoboxes similar to those described by li et al 2008 supplementary fig s1 according to their original location of soil profile in the field before these soil samples were placed in the rhizoboxes the soil bulk density of each layer in the field was determined based on the bulk densities and the rhizobox volume the weight of soil for each layer of the rhizoboxes is calculated the weighed soil samples were compacted in each layer to ensure that the soil bulk density of each layer in the rhizoboxes is consistent with that in the field soil physico chemical characteristics for each layer are shown in table 1 2 2 rice microcosms each of the rhizoboxes was internally divided into three compartments with two nylon meshes 20 μm impenetrable to roots the dimension of each compartment was 7 7 35 length width depth in cm supplementary fig s1 four rice seedlings oryza sativa l zhendao 18 were transplanted into the middle compartment therefore the middle and two outer compartments consisted of rhizosphere and bulk soil respectively urea 84 mg n kg 1 soil kcl 53 mg k kg 1 soil and kh2po4 13 mg k and 21 mg p kg 1 soil were amended to each rhizobox the total amounts of n p and k applied to the soil were approximately equivalent to 318 80 and 250 kg n p and k ha 1 respectively p and k were applied as base fertilizer the n fertilizer was used in three equal splits 1 3 at basal 1 3 at tillering and 1 3 at booting the experiments had two water regimes including cf and awd in the cf regime the rhizoboxes were always flooded with 3 cm distilled water above the soil surface in the awd at the beginning of the trial soil in the rhizoboxes was covered with 3 cm of water as well but subsequently air dried until the soil moisture level was 70 75 of water holding capacity and then re flooded again the plants were grown in 51 rhizoboxes outdoors from august 9th to november 18th 2017 in hefei throughout the experimental period average air temperature was 24 0 ranging from 15 4 to 38 1 shade cloth was used to avoid a sharp rise in soil temperature and protect the plants from overheating prior to rain plastic sheeting was also applied to prevent water from reaching the plants 2 3 soil sampling at the ie and f stages triplicate rhizoboxes with each water regime were destructively sampled soil was separated into three layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm across the soil profile with a sharp knife rhizosphere soil in the different layers was withdrawn by applying a sterilized spatula to gently remove the soil adhering to the roots bulk soil of each layer was collected from the two outer compartments of the rhizobox the rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from each replicate were thoroughly mixed and sieved 2 mm each sample was divided into two parts one part was stored at 80 c until dna extraction while the other part stored at 4 c for the determination of soil characteristics and denitrification capacity within 20 d 2 4 dna extraction and real time pcr assay genomic dna from 500 mg of fresh soil was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedical usa according to the

properties of soil table 2 at the ie stage awd significantly increased the soil doc contents at the layer of 0 10 cm and the ec values and don contents at the layer of 0 20 cm in both the rhizosphere and bulk soils compared with cf soil ph in the layer of 0 20 cm under awd was lower than that under cf for the f stage awd caused a drop in the doc content in the 20 30 cm soil layer relative to cf under cf the doc content in the layer of 20 30 cm at the f stage was much higher than that at the ie stage compared with cf awd also significantly increased the contents of don and nh4 in the bulk soil and the ec values in the rhizosphere soil but decreased overall ph levels at the layer of 0 20 cm the interactive effect between water management and soil layer was significant for all soil chemical characteristics except the don content at the f stage throughout the experimental period dynamic changes of soil eh were also monitored supplementary fig s3 compared with cf awd markedly increased soil eh and caused larger eh fluctuations 3 2 denitrifier abundance denitrification capacity and its influencing factors the nirk and nirs gene copy numbers are presented in fig 1 at the ie stage awd pronouncedly reduced the nirk gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soil at depths of 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm and in the bulk soil at 20 30 cm depths compared with cf fig 1a at the f stage the nirk gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soil at depths of 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm and in the bulk soil at 0 10 cm depth under awd were markedly lower than those under cf for nirs awd significantly lowered the copy numbers in both the rhizosphere and bulk soils at the layer of 0 10 cm compared with cf at the ie stage fig 1b at the f stage the nirs gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soil at depth of 0 20 cm under awd were significantly higher than those under cf the nirk and nirs gene copy number displayed markedly increasing and decreasing trends with increasing soil depth respectively the ratio of nirs nirk sharply declined from 144 1 5 5 with increasing soil depth supplementary fig s4 soil ph and doc were the key factors affecting the nirk and nirs gene copy number respectively supplementary table s1 awd significantly increased dc in the rhizosphere soil at depth of 0 20 cm relative to cf at the ie stage fig 2 for bulk soil awd reduced dc in the 0 10 cm soil layer but increased dc in the 10 20 cm layer there was no significant difference in the average dc value of the two layers between awd and cf at the f stage awd pronouncedly decreased dc in the rhizosphere soil at depths of 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm compared with cf the water regime had no marked effect on dc in the rhizosphere soil at depth of 10 20 cm and in the bulk soil fig 2 at both the stages dc in the 0 20 cm layer was much higher than that in the 20 30 cm soil layer stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the key factors affecting dc table 3 at the ie stage ec and nirs gene copy number were positively correlated with dc the regression coefficients of ec and nirs gene copy number were 0 683 and 1 328 for awd and 0 953 and 0 701 for cf respectively at the f stage doc content was the only key factor controlling dc in awd for cf soil ph and nirs gene copy number were positively related with dc table 3 3 3 structure of denitrifying community and its influencing factors marked variations in the community structure of nirk r 0 560 p 0 001 anosim and nirs type r 0 739 p 0 001 anosim denitrifiers between awd and cf were identified in supplementary figs s5 and s6 respectively for example in the rhizosphere soil at depth of 0 10 cm awd pronouncedly increased the relative abundances of the otu 5 otu 9 otu 15 otu 47 and otu 49 but decreased those of otu 1 and otu 58 in the nirk type denitrifiers compared with cf at the ie stage supplementary fig s5 for nirs type denitrifiers awd significantly enhanced the relative abundances of the otu 12 otu 18 and otu 23 but lowered those of otu 1 otu 8 otu 26 otu 38 and otu 71 relative to cf at the f stage supplementary fig s6 in addition there were clear differences in the community composition of nirk and nirs type denitrifiers among the three soil layers awd was also able to significantly influence the diversity of denitrifiers e g nirk type denitrifiers in the 10 20 cm soil layer and nirs type in the 0 10 cm soil layer supplementary tables s2 and s3 otu based network analysis revealed different patterns of co occurrence in response to the water regimes fig 3 and 4 at the ie stage awd resulted in sharp decreases in the total number of nodes and links and average clustering coefficient in nirk network for rhizosphere rather than bulk soil compared with cf similar to nirk awd markedly reduced the number of links in nirs network in the rhizosphere at the f stage awd also caused the drops in the total number of nodes and links in nirs but not nirk network for rhizosphere soil figs 3 and 4 cca was used to identify the correlation between soil characteristics and denitrifier community fig 5 for nirk the first two cca dimensions explained 53 9 and 56 7 of cumulative variance of genotype environment

otu 3 otu 25 otu 31 etc were prevailing in awd while other otus including otu 5 otu 7 otu 8 and so on had more abundances in cf similar to nirk some nirs otus including otu 35 otu 71 otu 85 and so on dominated in awd whereas other otus including otu 4 otu 10 otu 13 etc were particularly abundant in cf fig 7 the nirk and nirs sequences could group into some clusters according to different layers of the soil for instance nirk cluster ⅰ and ⅱ including otu 3 otu 10 otu 45 etc only existed in the 20 30 cm soil layer while cluster ⅲ was prevailing in the 0 20 cm soil layer fig 6 for nirs cluster ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ were far more abundant in the soil layers of 20 30 cm 0 20 cm and 10 30 cm respectively fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 water management affecting denitrification capacity we found that compared with cf awd significantly enhanced dc in the rhizosphere at the ie stage fig 2 a previous study also observed that awd could cause more denitrification loss than cf lagomarsino et al 2016 although our result is similar to that of these authors the cause of the increase in denitrification losses due to awd is quite different their study demonstrated that elevated no3 production by nitrification under the awd condition contributed to this increase in our case no3 supplementation was sufficient and not a limiting factor therefore it is speculated that besides no3 there are other important factors influencing the denitrification rate through the stepwise regression analysis we observed that soil ec and the abundance of nirs type denitrifiers were significantly and positively correlated with dc table 3 awd significantly enhanced the soil ec values in the rhizosphere at the layer of 0 20 cm compared with cf table 2 this could be ascribed to greater nutrient release under awd due to stronger disturbance of soil aggregates and microbial cells relative to cf dodd et al 2015 for nirs type denitrifiers although awd lowered their abundance by 15 compared with cf fig 1b their contribution rate to dc was enhanced by 1 89 folds of cf table 3 the increased activity of the nirs type denitrifiers may be related to the significant change in their community structure supplementary fig s6 as denitrifier community composition is considered to be a crucial factor controlling denitrification activity yin et al 2015 therefore awd enhances denitrification losses not only by promoting no3 production but also by increasing ec and activity of the nirs type denitrifiers in contrast to the ie stage awd pronouncedly reduced dc in the rhizosphere compared with cf at the f stage fig 2 regression analysis revealed that soil ph and the abundance of nirs type denitrifiers were positively correlated with dc under cf while doc was the only significant factor influencing dc under awd table 3 unlike the other growth stages of rice the f stage is considered to be the period during which root releases the most organic c into soil aulakh et al 2001 however in this study doc contents at the f stage were not higher than those at the ie stage except in the 20 30 cm soil layer table 2 the reason may be that the root caps of young roots by which most of released organic c is delivered curlango rivera and hawes 2011 are concentrated in the deeper soil layers for catching fresh nutrients at the f stage kant et al 2018 at the f stage doc contents in the 20 30 cm soil layer under awd decreased around 2 3 fold compared with those under cf table 2 furthermore doc contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer under awd were also lower than those under cf although not statistically significant table 2 awd has been reported to stimulate mineralization of doc causing a decline in doc content jarvis et al 2007 thus the decline in dc under awd at the f stage was mainly attributed to the decrease in doc content especially in the 20 30 cm soil layer in rice ecosystems denitrification a vital component of the n cycle is a major contributor to loss of fertilizer n from soils ju et al 2009 as a particularly effective water saving practice for rice cultivation awd has been found to further increase denitrification losses which hinders its wider applications tan et al 2015 at present there was not a clear understanding of the impact of awd on denitrification this study showed that in fact awd increased denitrification losses mainly at the ie stage but decreased them at the f stage fig 2 therefore in developing some measures to reduce denitrification losses due to awd it is important to focus on the critical periods when denitrification losses increase with the above analysis it is possible to reduce denitrification losses under awd at the ie stage by lowering no3 production ec and the activity of the nirs type denitrifiers here it is necessary to note that our results were obtained from a rhizobox experiment rather than a field study under the same air temperature soil temperatures within the rhizobox are usually higher than ones in the field due to direct exposure to solar radiation saint pierre 2012 the increase in temperature may shorten the time per cycle of awd and increase the frequency of awd irrigation these may have some different impacts on soil physicochemical properties and crop growth than under field conditions and require further investigation 4 2 response of community composition of denitrifiers to water management we found that the community structure of nirk and nirs type denitrifiers responded differently to the water managements at the ie and f stages supplementary figs s5 and s6 compared to cf awd did not only cause the disappearance of certain dominant species in nirk and nirs community but also resulted in the formation of new dominant ones figs 6 and 7 in addition awd markedly lowered the stability of both nirk and nirs networks in the rhizosphere at the ie stage as well as the stability of nirs networks at the f stage figs 3 and 4 at the ie and f stages soil ph and ec were the crucial factors affecting the community composition of nirk and nirs type denitrifiers fig 5 our earlier studies also found that ph significantly shaped the structure of nirk and nirs communities and even formed certain ecotypes in nirk communities occupying a specific ph related niche song et al 2019 in this study we found that awd lowered overall ph levels in the 0 20 cm soil layer table 2 which is in agreement with the earlier finding of das et al 2016 lower soil ph under awd might be ascribed to its stronger nitrification during which h was produced haynes and swift 1989 for ec a previous study also indicated that ec had a powerful impact in shaping community structure of denitrifying bacteria zhang et al 2016 in our case the overall ec under awd was higher than that of cf table 2 ec depends on the number of available ions which are affected by soil environment and root exudates awd facilitates mineralization of soil organic matter and nutrients release and can stimulate the secretion of organic and inorganic compounds from roots jarvis et al 2007 therefore increasing soil ec in addition we noted that at the ie stage the nh4 content was also a key factor affecting the structure of nirk and nirs communities fig 5 although nh4 is not the substrate of denitrifying bacteria it can be oxidized into no3 to influence denitrification a previous study found that nirk communities were more sensitive to n fertilizer application than nirs communities in rice paddy soil chen et al 2010 but in the current study soil inorganic n contents significantly affected the structure of both nirk and nirs communities the main reason for this discrepancy may be related to the fact that the inorganic n contents in their study were much higher than ours our sampling period was at the ie stage when rice plants took up more n thus resulting in lower soil n contents the community structure of nirs type denitrifiers is unaffected when the soil inorganic n content is sufficient but their community structure is significantly changed when the inorganic n content is limited yuan et al 2012 4 3 roles of nirk and nirs harboring denitrifiers in paddy soil with different layers we found that with increasing soil depth the abundance of nirs type denitrifiers sharply decreased while the abundance of nirk type denitrifiers significantly increased fig 1 the ratio of nirs to nirk abundance exhibited a dramatically decreasing trend with soil depth supplementary fig s4 which is in correspondence with the study by wang et al 2017 further analysis showed that nirk gene abundance was significantly and positively related to soil ph supplementary table s1 in this study soil ph showed a significant increasing trend with soil depth table 2 which may have caused an increase in nirk gene abundance for nirs doc was a key factor modulating the abundance of nirs gene supplementary table s1 previous studies have found that nirs type denitrifiers prefer organic rich soils enwall et al 2010 hou et al 2018 with increasing soil depth the decrease in organic c might be the main reason for the decline in the nirs abundance in the surface soil the number of nirs gene was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of nirk gene fig 1 in addition dc occurred primarily in the surface soil given that abundance of nirs rather than nirk was significantly and positively correlated with dc table 3 we speculate that nirs type denitrifiers may play a more dominant role than nirk type denitrifiers in denitrification in rice paddy soils subjected to different water managements this finding aligns with the study by wang et al 2017 but does not support previous observations that nirk type denitrifiers were more important in paddy soils chen et al 2010 yoshida et al 2009 the main reason for the discrepancy might be related to the native soil having a different ratio of nirs to nirk abundance which strongly depends on soil properties and climatic conditions wang et al 2017 in the current study as soil properties differed between soil layers the ratio of nirs nirk in the 0 10 cm soil layer was nearly 26 times higher than that in the 20 30 cm layer supplementary fig s4 based on distinct soil properties each layer of soil had also developed a unique and stable community composition of denitrifiers figs 6 and 7 therefore the sizes of stable denitrifying communities in the native soil should be taken into account when identifying the role of nirs and nirk in a soil ecosystem 5 conclusions compared with cf awd significantly increased dc at the ie stage but decreased dc at the f stage the increase in dc at the ie stage was closely related to soil ec and the structure of nirs communities at the f stage the decline of soil doc under awd was the main reason for the decreased dc compared with cf awd markedly changed the structure of nirs and nirk communities and the stability of community network the stability of nirs and nirk networks in awd at the ie stage was lower than that of cf soil ph and ec were the key drivers for the changes in the structure of nirs and nirk communities the ratio of nirs to nirk decreases sharply with increasing soil depth dc occurred primarily in the surface soil where the number of nirs gene was far higher than of nirk gene the nirs rather than nirk type denitrifier may play a more important role in this soil ecosystem

10472,rice is one of the largest water consuming crops alternate wetting and drying awd is now an effective water saving practice for rice cultivation that has been widely applied across the world awd may increase denitrification loss however the underlying mechanism remains unclear this study investigated denitrifier activity abundance and community structure in the rice rhizosphere and bulk soil in response to water management at the internode elongation ie and flowering f stages the results revealed that at the ie stage awd significantly increased denitrification capacity dc in the rhizosphere compared with continuously flooded practice cf dc was significantly and positively related to electrical conductivity ec and the abundance of nirs harboring denitrifiers awd led to higher ec in the 0 20 cm soil layer than cf although awd lowered nirs abundance by 15 compared with cf the activity of nirs harboring denitrifiers was enhanced by 1 89 folds of cf at the f stage awd significantly decreased dc relative to cf awd had lower dissolved organic carbon doc than cf and doc was significantly correlated with dc compared with cf awd also markedly changed the structure and network stability of nirs and nirk communities resulting in sharp decreases in the total number of links in nirk and nirs networks of rhizosphere the soil ph and ec were the key factors shaping the structure of nirs and nirk communities overall the increase in denitrification losses due to awd occurred primarily at the ie rather than f stage and this increase was attributed to a rise in ec and changes in the activity and structure of nirs community these findings provide a new insight into the mechanism of impact of the water saving practice on denitrification loss for rice cultivation keywords denitrification water management rice paddy growth stage soil layer pyrosequencing technique 1 introduction denitrification is a microbial reduction process from nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 to gaseous compounds as an integral part of the n cycle it is the only step returning fixed n to the atmosphere as n2 closing the cycle torregrosa crespo et al 2017 denitrification is also of particular concern as the main source of nitrous oxide n2o an important greenhouse gas and destroyer of the ozone layer ravishankara et al 2009 in the denitrification pathway the second step reducing no2 to no is of great importance because besides distinguishing denitrifying microbes from other nitrate respirers it produces the first gaseous product zumft 1997 this step is thereby prone to cause substantial loss of fertilizer n from agricultural fields and large economic costs it is performed either by a copper containing reductase encoded by the nirk gene or by a cytochrome cd1 reductase encoded by the nirs gene philippot 2002 compared with other agricultural soils rice paddy soil may have stronger denitrifying activity due to anaerobic conditions and massive inputs of n fertilizers worldwide the total area of rice fields is around 155 5 million hectares van nguyen and ferrero 2006 and obtains a total of 12 8 mt n from synthetic fertilizers per year mueller et al 2014 denitrification in rice paddy fields occupies a loss of up to 36 4 of the applied n ju et al 2009 the rhizosphere is the zone of hotspots of denitrification in paddy soil mainly due to the coupled nitrification denitrification process arth et al 1998 nh4 and urea based fertilizers are commonly used in rice fields resulting in generally low no3 concentration in flooded paddy soil therefore the activity of denitrification in paddy soil strongly depends on no3 production from nitrification denitrification in the rhizosphere mainly takes place at a distance of 1 5 5 0 mm from the root surface tightly surrounding the zone where intensive nitrification occurs 2 mm from root surface arth and frenzel 2000 apart from nitrification denitrification process the rhizosphere can provide a substantial amount of bioavailable organic carbon c compounds facilitating denitrification approximately 8 0 19 3 of total c derived from photosynthesis products of rice plants is transferred to the rhizosphere as root exudates ge et al 2015 the denitrification rate in the rhizosphere soil shows a dynamic variation during rice growth periods chen et al 2014 reported that denitrification rates in the rhizosphere at the booting and maturity stages of rice were much lower than that in the tillering stage the decline of no3 contents due to uptake by rice plants and n immobilization in soil is considered the main cause of the reduction in denitrification rate of rhizosphere kakuda et al 2000 the activity of denitrifier communities in the rhizosphere is also likely an important factor controlling the denitrification rate and requires further investigation as plants can suppress denitrification activity during the period when plants require more n kakuda et al 1999 in the growth stages of rice the internode elongation ie and flowering f stages need more attention when studying denitrification in rice rhizosphere soil this is because during the ie stage rice plant absorbs most of n from soil while during the f stage rice root releases the most organic c into soil aulakh et al 2001 lin et al 2006 denitrification in the rhizosphere may thus be strongly affected due to the changes in contents of n and c but the information about rhizosphere denitrification in the two stages is still lacking it is therefore necessary to identify the denitrification characteristics in the rhizosphere at the two stages rice is one of the largest consumers of freshwater obtaining 34 43 of the global irrigation water watanabe et al 2013 nowadays freshwater is becoming scarce due to climate change growing human population competition of urbanization etc chakkaravarthy and balakrishnan 2019 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 therefore new water saving technologies for rice production are developed to replace the traditional flood irrigation alternate wetting and drying awd is considered an effective water saving practice for rice cultivation with awd soil water holding capacity is allowed to reach 70 75 prior to the next irrigation wu et al 2017 compare with continuously flooded practice cf awd can save 23 4 of water use without adverse impacts on rice yield carrijo et al 2017 furthermore awd has been reported to reduce global warming potential by 45 90 relative to cf linquist et al 2015 currently efforts are underway in the world to promote awd for rice cultivation however recent studies have found that compared to cf awd increases 4 1 19 8 n loss of denitrification which can result in reduced plant n uptake tan et al 2015 the enhanced production of no3 from nitrification due to partially anaerobic conditions contributes to the increase in denitrification loss under awd condition lagomarsino et al 2016 indeed it is undeniable that no3 as a substrate of denitrifiers is a key factor affecting denitrification process but the underlying influence imposed by the activity of denitrifier communities in bulk and especially in the rhizosphere soil cannot be ruled out what s more awd has been shown to increase c allocation by 46 to the rhizosphere soil relative to cf atere et al 2017 awd can also cause lower soil ph and higher redox potential eh in the rhizosphere than cf das et al 2016 the chemical characteristics are considered the important factors shaping the composition and function of denitrifiers wang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 ligi et al 2014 however to our knowledge no studies have been conducted to identify the impact of water management on denitrifying activities and denitrifier communities in the rice rhizosphere the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the impact of the water management on denitrifier activity abundance and community structure in the rice rhizosphere vs the surrounding bulk soil at the ie and f stages and 2 to identify the vital factors shaping the structure and abundance of denitrifiers we hypothesized that denitrifier activity abundance and community structure responded differently to the water managements at the two key growth stages in this study a rhizobox experiment under the awd and cf conditions was performed using a paddy soil in the subtropical region to separate rice rhizosphere soil from bulk soil denitrification capacity in the rhizosphere and bulk soil was determined by the acetylene inhibition technique real time pcr and high throughput sequencing techniques were adopted to analyze the abundance and community structure of nirs and nirk harboring denitrifiers respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil preparation surface soils in layers of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm were collected from a paddy field at the guohe experimental station ges of anhui agricultural university 31 49 n 117 23 e in hefei anhui province china the region lies in the subtropical zone with an average annual rainfall of 1188 mm and a mean air temperature of 15 8 the paddy soil sandy loam is classified as gleysol fao classification soil samples from 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm soil layers were sieved 5 mm and then were packed in rhizoboxes similar to those described by li et al 2008 supplementary fig s1 according to their original location of soil profile in the field before these soil samples were placed in the rhizoboxes the soil bulk density of each layer in the field was determined based on the bulk densities and the rhizobox volume the weight of soil for each layer of the rhizoboxes is calculated the weighed soil samples were compacted in each layer to ensure that the soil bulk density of each layer in the rhizoboxes is consistent with that in the field soil physico chemical characteristics for each layer are shown in table 1 2 2 rice microcosms each of the rhizoboxes was internally divided into three compartments with two nylon meshes 20 μm impenetrable to roots the dimension of each compartment was 7 7 35 length width depth in cm supplementary fig s1 four rice seedlings oryza sativa l zhendao 18 were transplanted into the middle compartment therefore the middle and two outer compartments consisted of rhizosphere and bulk soil respectively urea 84 mg n kg 1 soil kcl 53 mg k kg 1 soil and kh2po4 13 mg k and 21 mg p kg 1 soil were amended to each rhizobox the total amounts of n p and k applied to the soil were approximately equivalent to 318 80 and 250 kg n p and k ha 1 respectively p and k were applied as base fertilizer the n fertilizer was used in three equal splits 1 3 at basal 1 3 at tillering and 1 3 at booting the experiments had two water regimes including cf and awd in the cf regime the rhizoboxes were always flooded with 3 cm distilled water above the soil surface in the awd at the beginning of the trial soil in the rhizoboxes was covered with 3 cm of water as well but subsequently air dried until the soil moisture level was 70 75 of water holding capacity and then re flooded again the plants were grown in 51 rhizoboxes outdoors from august 9th to november 18th 2017 in hefei throughout the experimental period average air temperature was 24 0 ranging from 15 4 to 38 1 shade cloth was used to avoid a sharp rise in soil temperature and protect the plants from overheating prior to rain plastic sheeting was also applied to prevent water from reaching the plants 2 3 soil sampling at the ie and f stages triplicate rhizoboxes with each water regime were destructively sampled soil was separated into three layers 0 10 cm 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm across the soil profile with a sharp knife rhizosphere soil in the different layers was withdrawn by applying a sterilized spatula to gently remove the soil adhering to the roots bulk soil of each layer was collected from the two outer compartments of the rhizobox the rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from each replicate were thoroughly mixed and sieved 2 mm each sample was divided into two parts one part was stored at 80 c until dna extraction while the other part stored at 4 c for the determination of soil characteristics and denitrification capacity within 20 d 2 4 dna extraction and real time pcr assay genomic dna from 500 mg of fresh soil was extracted using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedical usa according to the

linearized plasmids harboring cloned nirs and nirk pcr amplicons the pcr efficiencies for nirk and nirs genes were 93 and 97 with r2 value of 0 995 and 0 992 respectively 2 5 high throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis the same primers and pcr conditions as described in the real time pcr assay above were used to amplify the nirk and nirs genes for subsequent high throughput sequencing a unique barcode was designed to link to the dna molecules of each sample in order to distinguish them the pcr products of nirk and nirs fragments were purified with qiaquick gel extraction

properties of soil table 2 at the ie stage awd significantly increased the soil doc contents at the layer of 0 10 cm and the ec values and don contents at the layer of 0 20 cm in both the rhizosphere and bulk soils compared with cf soil ph in the layer of 0 20 cm under awd was lower than that under cf for the f stage awd caused a drop in the doc content in the 20 30 cm soil layer relative to cf under cf the doc content in the layer of 20 30 cm at the f stage was much higher than that at the ie stage compared with cf awd also significantly increased the contents of don and nh4 in the bulk soil and the ec values in the rhizosphere soil but decreased overall ph levels at the layer of 0 20 cm the interactive effect between water management and soil layer was significant for all soil chemical characteristics except the don content at the f stage throughout the experimental period dynamic changes of soil eh were also monitored supplementary fig s3 compared with cf awd markedly increased soil eh and caused larger eh fluctuations 3 2 denitrifier abundance denitrification capacity and its influencing factors the nirk and nirs gene copy numbers are presented in fig 1 at the ie stage awd pronouncedly reduced the nirk gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soil at depths of 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm and in the bulk soil at 20 30 cm depths compared with cf fig 1a at the f stage the nirk gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soil at depths of 10 20 cm and 20 30 cm and in the bulk soil at 0 10 cm depth under awd were markedly lower than those under cf for nirs awd significantly lowered the copy numbers in both the rhizosphere and bulk soils at the layer of 0 10 cm compared with cf at the ie stage fig 1b at the f stage the nirs gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soil at depth of 0 20 cm under awd were significantly higher than those under cf the nirk and nirs gene copy number displayed markedly increasing and decreasing trends with increasing soil depth respectively the ratio of nirs nirk sharply declined from 144 1 5 5 with increasing soil depth supplementary fig s4 soil ph and doc were the key factors affecting the nirk and nirs gene copy number respectively supplementary table s1 awd significantly increased dc in the rhizosphere soil at depth of 0 20 cm relative to cf at the ie stage fig 2 for bulk soil awd reduced dc in the 0 10 cm soil layer but increased dc in the 10 20 cm layer there was no significant difference in the average dc value of the two layers between awd and cf at the f stage awd pronouncedly decreased dc in the rhizosphere soil at depths of 0 10 cm and 20 30 cm compared with cf the water regime had no marked effect on dc in the rhizosphere soil at depth of 10 20 cm and in the bulk soil fig 2 at both the stages dc in the 0 20 cm layer was much higher than that in the 20 30 cm soil layer stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the key factors affecting dc table 3 at the ie stage ec and nirs gene copy number were positively correlated with dc the regression coefficients of ec and nirs gene copy number were 0 683 and 1 328 for awd and 0 953 and 0 701 for cf respectively at the f stage doc content was the only key factor controlling dc in awd for cf soil ph and nirs gene copy number were positively related with dc table 3 3 3 structure of denitrifying community and its influencing factors marked variations in the community structure of nirk r 0 560 p 0 001 anosim and nirs type r 0 739 p 0 001 anosim denitrifiers between awd and cf were identified in supplementary figs s5 and s6 respectively for example in the rhizosphere soil at depth of 0 10 cm awd pronouncedly increased the relative abundances of the otu 5 otu 9 otu 15 otu 47 and otu 49 but decreased those of otu 1 and otu 58 in the nirk type denitrifiers compared with cf at the ie stage supplementary fig s5 for nirs type denitrifiers awd significantly enhanced the relative abundances of the otu 12 otu 18 and otu 23 but lowered those of otu 1 otu 8 otu 26 otu 38 and otu 71 relative to cf at the f stage supplementary fig s6 in addition there were clear differences in the community composition of nirk and nirs type denitrifiers among the three soil layers awd was also able to significantly influence the diversity of denitrifiers e g nirk type denitrifiers in the 10 20 cm soil layer and nirs type in the 0 10 cm soil layer supplementary tables s2 and s3 otu based network analysis revealed different patterns of co occurrence in response to the water regimes fig 3 and 4 at the ie stage awd resulted in sharp decreases in the total number of nodes and links and average clustering coefficient in nirk network for rhizosphere rather than bulk soil compared with cf similar to nirk awd markedly reduced the number of links in nirs network in the rhizosphere at the f stage awd also caused the drops in the total number of nodes and links in nirs but not nirk network for rhizosphere soil figs 3 and 4 cca was used to identify the correlation between soil characteristics and denitrifier community fig 5 for nirk the first two cca dimensions explained 53 9 and 56 7 of cumulative variance of genotype environment relationship for the ie and f stage respectively the nirk gene containing community structure had significant relationships with soil characteristics including soil ph p 0 01 f 18 66 monte carlo

b for nirs the first two axes explained 61 9 and 56 5 of cumulative variance of the community environment correlation for the ie and f stage respectably the nirs community structure significantly

otu 3 otu 25 otu 31 etc were prevailing in awd while other otus including otu 5 otu 7 otu 8 and so on had more abundances in cf similar to nirk some nirs otus including otu 35 otu 71 otu 85 and so on dominated in awd whereas other otus including otu 4 otu 10 otu 13 etc were particularly abundant in cf fig 7 the nirk and nirs sequences could group into some clusters according to different layers of the soil for instance nirk cluster ⅰ and ⅱ including otu 3 otu 10 otu 45 etc only existed in the 20 30 cm soil layer while cluster ⅲ was prevailing in the 0 20 cm soil layer fig 6 for nirs cluster ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ were far more abundant in the soil layers of 20 30 cm 0 20 cm and 10 30 cm respectively fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 water management affecting denitrification capacity we found that compared with cf awd significantly enhanced dc in the rhizosphere at the ie stage fig 2 a previous study also observed that awd could cause more denitrification loss than cf lagomarsino et al 2016 although our result is similar to that of these authors the cause of the increase in denitrification losses due to awd is quite different their study demonstrated that elevated no3 production by nitrification under the awd condition contributed to this increase in our case no3 supplementation was sufficient and not a limiting factor therefore it is speculated that besides no3 there are other important factors influencing the denitrification rate through the stepwise regression analysis we observed that soil ec and the abundance of nirs type denitrifiers were significantly and positively correlated with dc table 3 awd significantly enhanced the soil ec values in the rhizosphere at the layer of 0 20 cm compared with cf table 2 this could be ascribed to greater nutrient release under awd due to stronger disturbance of soil aggregates and microbial cells relative to cf dodd et al 2015 for nirs type denitrifiers although awd lowered their abundance by 15 compared with cf fig 1b their contribution rate to dc was enhanced by 1 89 folds of cf table 3 the increased activity of the nirs type denitrifiers may be related to the significant change in their community structure supplementary fig s6 as denitrifier community composition is considered to be a crucial factor controlling denitrification activity yin et al 2015 therefore awd enhances denitrification losses not only by promoting no3 production but also by increasing ec and activity of the nirs type denitrifiers in contrast to the ie stage awd pronouncedly reduced dc in the rhizosphere compared with cf at the f stage fig 2 regression analysis revealed that soil ph and the abundance of nirs type denitrifiers were positively correlated with dc under cf while doc was the only significant factor influencing dc under awd table 3 unlike the other growth stages of rice the f stage is considered to be the period during which root releases the most organic c into soil aulakh et al 2001 however in this study doc contents at the f stage were not higher than those at the ie stage except in the 20 30 cm soil layer table 2 the reason may be that the root caps of young roots by which most of released organic c is delivered curlango rivera and hawes 2011 are concentrated in the deeper soil layers for catching fresh nutrients at the f stage kant et al 2018 at the f stage doc contents in the 20 30 cm soil layer under awd decreased around 2 3 fold compared with those under cf table 2 furthermore doc contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer under awd were also lower than those under cf although not statistically significant table 2 awd has been reported to stimulate mineralization of doc causing a decline in doc content jarvis et al 2007 thus the decline in dc under awd at the f stage was mainly attributed to the decrease in doc content especially in the 20 30 cm soil layer in rice ecosystems denitrification a vital component of the n cycle is a major contributor to loss of fertilizer n from soils ju et al 2009 as a particularly effective water saving practice for rice cultivation awd has been found to further increase denitrification losses which hinders its wider applications tan et al 2015 at present there was not a clear understanding of the impact of awd on denitrification this study showed that in fact awd increased denitrification losses mainly at the ie stage but decreased them at the f stage fig 2 therefore in developing some measures to reduce denitrification losses due to awd it is important to focus on the critical periods when denitrification losses increase with the above analysis it is possible to reduce denitrification losses under awd at the ie stage by lowering no3 production ec and the activity of the nirs type denitrifiers here it is necessary to note that our results were obtained from a rhizobox experiment rather than a field study under the same air temperature soil temperatures within the rhizobox are usually higher than ones in the field due to direct exposure to solar radiation saint pierre 2012 the increase in temperature may shorten the time per cycle of awd and increase the frequency of awd irrigation these may have some different impacts on soil physicochemical properties and crop growth than under field conditions and require further investigation 4 2 response of community composition of denitrifiers to water management we found that the community structure of nirk and nirs type denitrifiers responded differently to the water managements at the ie and f stages supplementary figs s5 and s6 compared to cf awd did not only cause the disappearance of certain dominant species in nirk and nirs community but also resulted in the formation of new dominant ones figs 6 and 7 in addition awd markedly lowered the stability of both nirk and nirs networks in the rhizosphere at the ie stage as well as the stability of nirs networks at the f stage figs 3 and 4 at the ie and f stages soil ph and ec were the crucial factors affecting the community composition of nirk and nirs type denitrifiers fig 5 our earlier studies also found that ph significantly shaped the structure of nirk and nirs communities and even formed certain ecotypes in nirk communities occupying a specific ph related niche song et al 2019 in this study we found that awd lowered overall ph levels in the 0 20 cm soil layer table 2 which is in agreement with the earlier finding of das et al 2016 lower soil ph under awd might be ascribed to its stronger nitrification during which h was produced haynes and swift 1989 for ec a previous study also indicated that ec had a powerful impact in shaping community structure of denitrifying bacteria zhang et al 2016 in our case the overall ec under awd was higher than that of cf table 2 ec depends on the number of available ions which are affected by soil environment and root exudates awd facilitates mineralization of soil organic matter and nutrients release and can stimulate the secretion of organic and inorganic compounds from roots jarvis et al 2007 therefore increasing soil ec in addition we noted that at the ie stage the nh4 content was also a key factor affecting the structure of nirk and nirs communities fig 5 although nh4 is not the substrate of denitrifying bacteria it can be oxidized into no3 to influence denitrification a previous study found that nirk communities were more sensitive to n fertilizer application than nirs communities in rice paddy soil chen et al 2010 but in the current study soil inorganic n contents significantly affected the structure of both nirk and nirs communities the main reason for this discrepancy may be related to the fact that the inorganic n contents in their study were much higher than ours our sampling period was at the ie stage when rice plants took up more n thus resulting in lower soil n contents the community structure of nirs type denitrifiers is unaffected when the soil inorganic n content is sufficient but their community structure is significantly changed when the inorganic n content is limited yuan et al 2012 4 3 roles of nirk and nirs harboring denitrifiers in paddy soil with different layers we found that with increasing soil depth the abundance of nirs type denitrifiers sharply decreased while the abundance of nirk type denitrifiers significantly increased fig 1 the ratio of nirs to nirk abundance exhibited a dramatically decreasing trend with soil depth supplementary fig s4 which is in correspondence with the study by wang et al 2017 further analysis showed that nirk gene abundance was significantly and positively related to soil ph supplementary table s1 in this study soil ph showed a significant increasing trend with soil depth table 2 which may have caused an increase in nirk gene abundance for nirs doc was a key factor modulating the abundance of nirs gene supplementary table s1 previous studies have found that nirs type denitrifiers prefer organic rich soils enwall et al 2010 hou et al 2018 with increasing soil depth the decrease in organic c might be the main reason for the decline in the nirs abundance in the surface soil the number of nirs gene was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of nirk gene fig 1 in addition dc occurred primarily in the surface soil given that abundance of nirs rather than nirk was significantly and positively correlated with dc table 3 we speculate that nirs type denitrifiers may play a more dominant role than nirk type denitrifiers in denitrification in rice paddy soils subjected to different water managements this finding aligns with the study by wang et al 2017 but does not support previous observations that nirk type denitrifiers were more important in paddy soils chen et al 2010 yoshida et al 2009 the main reason for the discrepancy might be related to the native soil having a different ratio of nirs to nirk abundance which strongly depends on soil properties and climatic conditions wang et al 2017 in the current study as soil properties differed between soil layers the ratio of nirs nirk in the 0 10 cm soil layer was nearly 26 times higher than that in the 20 30 cm layer supplementary fig s4 based on distinct soil properties each layer of soil had also developed a unique and stable community composition of denitrifiers figs 6 and 7 therefore the sizes of stable denitrifying communities in the native soil should be taken into account when identifying the role of nirs and nirk in a soil ecosystem 5 conclusions compared with cf awd significantly increased dc at the ie stage but decreased dc at the f stage the increase in dc at the ie stage was closely related to soil ec and the structure of nirs communities at the f stage the decline of soil doc under awd was the main reason for the decreased dc compared with cf awd markedly changed the structure of nirs and nirk communities and the stability of community network the stability of nirs and nirk networks in awd at the ie stage was lower than that of cf soil ph and ec were the key drivers for the changes in the structure of nirs and nirk communities the ratio of nirs to nirk decreases sharply with increasing soil depth dc occurred primarily in the surface soil where the number of nirs gene was far higher than of nirk gene the nirs rather than nirk type denitrifier may play a more important role in this soil ecosystem

economic model investigates the influence of site conditions such as natural recharge proximity to surface water sources and the agronomic conditions of crops on four model outcomes optimal mar final groundwater level present value of farm net returns and the cost effectiveness of a mar subsidy we find that less irrigation intensive crops are a substitute for mar while rice and dryland crops are a complement for mar optimal mar is larger at a site with greater net returns to rice and dryland soybeans lower net returns to irrigated corn and soybeans and lower natural recharge mar increases groundwater conservation most at the sites with higher net returns to dryland and irrigated soybeans and lower net returns to corn and cotton mar raises the present value of economic returns from agriculture more where the net returns from rice are large but the cost effective locations for a mar subsidy are sites with large net returns to crops like cotton and soybeans higher natural recharge

agriculture the economic feasibility of mar is not well studied especially when and where to initiate mar to maximize economic and groundwater conservation benefits across an agricultural landscape spatial variability in the hydrologic and agronomic conditions of a landscape contributes to site level differences in the economic feasibility of mar tailored implementation of mar by site then has the potential to maximize socio environmental returns over time maliva 2014 2015 dillon and arshad 2016 our objective is to provide a tool for rapid first order assessment to aid in the spatial targeting of mar policies and education if decision makers decide to support the practice we accomplish this in three ways we first identify which hydrologic and agronomic factors influence the use of mar groundwater conservation economic returns and the social cost of a mar subsidy second using semi elasticity estimates from a regression analysis we determine the factors that have the largest impact on the conservation or economic objectives third we investigate the cost effectiveness of a mar subsidy to identify where to develop mar infrastructure at a low cost to society the main advantage of mar over surface reservoirs is that mar does not require the use of productive farmland and storing water in the aquifer prevents evaporation losses and can improve groundwater quality scanlon et al 2016 a disadvantage of mar is the cost to pump the recharged water back to the surface for irrigation and the inability to recover all of the recharged water due to losses to streams or underlying aquifers some early studies conducted economic assessments of groundwater recharge for irrigation use based on its benefits of reduced pumping lift and extended aquifer life supalla and comer 1982 al sabbry et al 2002 however these early studies did not incorporate spatial and temporal irrigated cropland change resulting from reduced pumping costs and the amount of mar is not chosen through the optimization of economic net returns balali et al 2011 use a non linear optimization approach to evaluate the outcomes of irrigation water price and groundwater conservation policies however artificial recharge was treated as constant in the model most mar studies focus on using soil and hydrogeological data to identify the suitability of mar with logic scores and or geographic information systems russo et al 2015 fernández escalante et al 2014 o geen et al 2015 brown et al 2016 ahani amineh et al 2017 smith et al 2017 gibson et al 2018 or hydrologic models i e modflow

designation of critical groundwater areas anrc 2005 2018 only about 44 of current groundwater withdrawals in the region are sustainable anrc 2013 2018 we make several noteworthy contributions to economics of mar the first contribution is the use of a model to maximize economic returns by changing the crops and irrigation sources by site to find for a nearly two thousand site landscape the optimal mar use groundwater conservation and economic returns with versus without mar and the cost effectiveness of a mar subsidy to conserve groundwater for the mrva aquifer in arkansas usa our hydro economic model accounts for the possibility of land use change to more irrigation intensive crops when mar stabilizes or raises groundwater levels and the potential increase in groundwater pumping undermines conservation efforts grafton et al 2018 the second contribution is the use of regression analysis to evaluate how the initial agronomic and hydrologic conditions at each site correlate with optimal site level outcomes from the model targeted conservation policies can be challenging to implement in practice due to a lack of site specific information about farms farmers landscape characteristics and input decisions khanna and zilberman 2017 khanna et al 2018 the regression analysis allows us to understand why some sites according to the initial site conditions have more optimal mar and have more groundwater conservation and economics returns with mar a third contribution is an analysis of where a mar subsidy is cost effective for groundwater conservation and why based on initial site conditions to help decision makers evaluate where to develop mar infrastructure and implement water conservation programs 2 methods we consider the spatial determinants of mar use and the spatial determinants of groundwater conservation and economic returns from mar use with two modeling procedures fig 1 first we maximize the present value of net returns over twelve decades assuming low fixed costs for mar of 0 008 m3 10 acre foot the low fixed costs allow many sites to use mar and this allows for a more detailed evaluation of how spatial variation in socio environmental conditions influence mar use there are also variable costs of mar that depend on the distance from recharge sites to surface water sources the second modeling procedure is to use the site level results from the first step to estimate through ordinary least square ols regressions how the initial site characteristics explain the spatial variation of optimal mar use final depth to groundwater economic returns and the cost effectiveness of a policy to subsidize mar 2 1 the optimization model of landscape irrigation and land use choices 2 1 1 land use choices there are m land uses that

analysis of the spatial variation in the optimization model outcomes for the regression analysis to analyze the spatial variation in the optimation model results the model without and with mar is run

subsidizes the fixed costs as an approach to support groundwater conservation the usda natural resources conservation service typically provides a cost share for conservation practices in the range of 40 60 usda nrcs 2018 mar is not currently one of those practices but we suppose a 50 cost share that reduces the already low fixed costs of mar from 0 008 m3 to 0 004 m3 10 acre foot to 5 acre foot the cost effectiveness of the policy is the social cost per unit of groundwater conserved where the social cost of a policy is the difference in economic returns minus the loss of government revenue

below average we use a function f that is linear in the natural log of the explanatory variables by using the natural log of the explanatory variables the regression analysis coefficient estimates for eq 8 to 11 are semi elasticity estimates semi elasticity estimates indicate how much a one percent increase in an initial site condition changes the dependent variable in particular suppose a linear regression model with a log transformed independent variable can be expressed as y β 0 β 1 ln x 1 suppose y 1 β 0 β 1 ln x 1 and y 2 β 0 β 1 ln x 1 1 1 then y 2 y 1 β 1 ln 1 1 β 1 ln 101 100 β 1 100 the interpretation is that a one percent change in the independent variable is associated with a β 1 100 change in the dependent variable where there is a log transformation of both the dependent and independent variables the regression analysis coefficient estimates are elasticities an elasticity indicates how large of a percentage change in the dependent variable occurs with a one percent increase in an initial site condition the estimates in terms of semi elasticities and elasticities allows us to compare which initial site condition most influences the dependent variable even though the explanatory variables are in different units 2 2 data the study area shown in fig 2 comes from the eight digit hydrologic unit code huc watersheds that overlay critical groundwater areas defined by the arkansas natural resources commission anrc 2018 eleven arkansas counties overlap with the study region that encompasses an area of 438 842 ha 1 084 402 acres agricultural land in the study area currently does not have the infrastructure to support mar we assume that farmers use bank infiltration to extract water through extraction wells near rivers and transport convey that water to recharge wells the concept is to induce flow through the streambed into the aquifer and capture that water rather than groundwater from storage and use a pipeline to transfer water to where recharge is needed and inject it into the aquifer using a recharge well the time horizon for the analysis is 120 years between 2017 and 2136 because the focus is on long term aquifer management and the infrastructure to the support the use of mar would likely be paid for over a long horizon there are 1991 sites over the study area to incorporate spatial details in the optimization problem and a dual purpose well is in the center of each site for mar in the winter and spring and extraction for irrigation later in the year the maximum annual rate of injection across the wells is between of 191 189 863 436 m3 155 700 acre feet over non irrigation periods based on the calculations described in eq 4 and from a usgs pilot study of mar sniegocki et al 1965 fitzpatrick 1990 the supporting information in section 2 notes that there is enough excess surface water from the white and arkansas rivers in the region to allow the injection wells at all sites to operate at full capacity the primary expense of mar is the infrastructure to deliver water from the rivers to the recharge sites but the project costs from the u s army corps of engineers in arkansas are highly speculative anrc 2013 the supporting information has a third section with a table a1 that has the average initial acreage of each crop based on the 2017 cropland data layer usda nass 2018b the proportion of harvested soybean acreage that is irrigated vs non irrigated is from the usda nass 2018b and the yield for each crop comes from the five year average at the county level division of agriculture uark 2018 table a2 has the operating and capital costs constant over time in real terms for mar and the wells and all other costs of production for each crop from a nominal discount rate of 5 less inflation of 3 over the last fifty years we use a 2 real discount rate u s department of the treasury 2018 the summary statistics for the explanatory variables in eqs 9 12 are shown in table 1 the transmissivity variable t r f is hydraulic conductivity h k f times the initial saturated thickness b f transmissivity is an essential factor that decides the cost of mar and suitability of a site for mar brown et al 2016 ahani amineh et al 2017 gibson et al 2018 the depth variable is the initial distance from the soil surface to the groundwater level depth is the main parameter in the pumping cost which partly decides the mar use the natural recharge n r f refers to the annual amount of water that is replenished into the aquifer naturally the natural recharge is based on the estimated annual natural recharged for the period of 2000 2013 clark and hart 2009 reitz et al 2017 the distance variable refers to how far it is from the recharge site i e a center of each site to the nearest surface water source i e main rivers the variable cost of mar is mainly based on distance we also introduce the pumpage variable which is the initial well pumping rate to represent the unobservable agronomic conditions for irrigation intensity at each site crop net returns represent the suitability of the site for each crop fig 3 shows the spatial variation of five initial site characteristics depth to groundwater transmissivity well pumping distance and natural recharge in 2017 lighter shades indicate lower values the depth to the aquifer shown in fig 3a indicates that the northern and southwestern parts of the study area have the deepest aquifer whereas the groundwater resources are more abundant in the southern and southeastern parts fig 3b represents the transmissivity and most of the southwestern and central parts have higher transmissivity values whereas the northern part of has considerably lower transmissivity fig 3c shows the distance from the closest river to the center of the cell the distance follows closely the shape of rivers that run through the study area the well pumping rate highly depends on which crops are grown fig 3d annual irrigation water use for arkansas rice is approximately two times higher compared with the amount of irrigation water applied on corn and soybeans in the region since more rice is grown in the northern and western parts of the study area the well pumping rates in these parts are much higher than elsewhere the natural recharge rate is at the highest in the northern part whereas the southwestern part has the lowest natural recharge rate fig 4 e 3 results and discussion the results section begins with an examination of the site level optimization model outcomes through summary statistics across sites and landscape level maps of the study area next is a spatial analysis of the optimal amount of mar per acre followed by how the use of mar affects the final groundwater level the present value of net returns per acre per year and the cost effectiveness of a mar subsidy policy 3 1 summary statistics and maps of the spatial variation in the model outcomes the summary statistics for the dependent variables of the regression analysis the left hand side variables of eqs 9 12 constructed from the optimization model results appear in table 2 the average optimal mar for all sites is about 3082 m3 ha year about one acre foot acre year and this is higher at deep aquifer sites and lower at shallow aquifer sites the mar use is not much greater in the deep aquifer sites than the shallow aquifer sites because for artificial recharge to be useful the water stored in the aquifer has to be pumped back out again the depth to the aquifer in the final period is about 18 60 m 60 feet greater with mar than without mar at all sites and in the deep and shallow aquifer sites an 18 6 m difference appears large but remember that we assume a low cost of 0 008 m3 10 acre foot for mar because the focus is on how the site characteristics influence mar and a low cost of mar allows more sites to use mar there is more variation in the depth difference for the deep aquifer sites and less for the shallow aquifer sites the average increase in economics returns with mar across all sites is 10 99 ha year 4 44 acre year and this is more than a 3 higher at the deep aquifer sites and more than a 3 lower at the shallow aquifer sites the average cost effectiveness of the subsidy for mar is about 0 036 m3 44 34 acre foot across all sites and this is more than 0 01 m3 higher and lower at the deep and shallow aquifer sites respectively on the landscape map the optimal mar use shown in fig 4a is greater in the southwest west central and northern portions of the study area in comparison with fig 3 the sites with greater initial depth to the aquifer higher initial well pumping and lower natural recharge appear to use more mar however the weight that these site characteristics and the other site characteristics have in determining optimal mar use is left to the regression analysis that follows the larger differences in the final depth to groundwater with and without mar fig 4b are prevalent across much of the center of the landscape as well as the southwest and north the initial depth to the aquifer and initial well pumping appear to have less weight in how much the use of mar conserves groundwater at a site the rise in the present value of net returns with mar versus without mar at each site fig 4c is greater in the southwest and low everywhere else low natural recharge and high net returns to rice appear to factor heavily on the increase in the present value of net returns due to mar the social cost of groundwater conservation with a mar subsidy fig 4d is higher in the north and the west central sections of the landscape where natural recharge is the largest sites with a lower social cost of mar subsidy is where policymakers would conserve groundwater at the lowest cost to society this is not always where the use of mar is the greatest or where the rise in the present value of net returns due to the use of mar is the largest the slippage or rebound effect refers to the increase in groundwater pumping that occurs because more irrigation intensive crops are grown if the variable costs of irrigation decline through greater irrigation efficiency or the use of mar ward and pulido velazquez 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 wang et al 2015 the initial depth to the aquifer and initial well pumping have a greater weight on how much slippage occurs at each site fig 4e 3 2 site characteristics and optimal mar use the semi elasticity estimates for the influence of the spatially variable initial site conditions on mar use per acre are in table 3 for all sites and the deep and shallow aquifer sub regions the initial depth transmissivity well pumping net returns to rice and dryland soybean all have significant and positive semi elasticities at all sites analysis the estimates for the all sites analysis indicates that a one percent increase in initial depth would make the optimal mar per ha increase by 500 8 100 5 01 cubic feet per ha 3 3 a linear regression model with a log transformed independent variable can be expressed as y β 0 β 1 ln x 1 suppose y 1 β 0 β 1 ln x 1 and y 2 β 0 β 1 ln x 1 1 1 then y 2 y 1 β 1 ln 1 1 β 1 ln 101 100 β 1 100 the interpretation is that a one percent change in the independent variable is associated with a β 1 100 change in the dependent variable with other variables held constant the natural recharge and transport distance explanatory variables have significant and negative semi elasticities initial depth to groundwater is significant and positive in the shallow aquifer region because higher well pumping costs increase the incentive to use artificial recharge to stabilize groundwater levels when the water can be pumped back out at a reasonable cost greater natural recharge at site reduces the use of mar because groundwater levels stabilize more easily without mar also as water conveyance costs from surface water sources to recharge sites increases there is less mar use initial well pumping is significant and positive implying that there is greater use of mar to stabilize groundwater level when the agronomic conditions associated with the sites increase the demand for irrigation transmissivity is an indication of the maximum amount of water that can be injected into the aquifer artificially theis 1935 fitzpatrick 1990 when the maximum amount of water possible for injection increases while the capital cost of mar remains constant the unit cost of mar is lower the positive semi elasticity estimate for transmissivity thus matches our expectations higher net returns to rice encourage rice production and more mar is necessary to stabilize groundwater levels if more land is in the irrigation intensive crop this relationship is significant only in the shallow aquifer region where the well pumping costs are not too high to discourage more rice production higher net returns to dryland soybean result in more mar because the dryland crop complements the use of mar to stabilize groundwater levels the less irrigation intensive crops that include cotton soybean and corn are substitutes for mar because the higher net returns to these crops reduce the mar use sites with higher net returns to less irrigation intensive crops choose more land in those crops rather than use mar the magnitude of the semi elasticities is greater for the net returns from the crops than the other explanatory variables in the deep aquifer region the natural recharge and net returns to dryland soybeans are the most influential site variables because the mix of the irrigated crops is less responsive to groundwater level changes when the aquifer is deep underground however mar use shows great sensitivity to irrigated crop net returns when the aquifer is shallow 3 3 site characteristics and groundwater depletion with mar table 4 shows the results of estimating eq 10 the difference in the final groundwater level with and without mar as a function of initial site conditions positive coefficient estimates indicate that a one percent increase in a site characteristic will increase the difference in the depth to groundwater with and without mar h f n o m a r t h f m a r t meaning that mar is having a larger impact of groundwater conservation a negative coefficient estimate indicates a decrease in the difference between depth to groundwater with and without mar meaning that mar has less impact on groundwater conservation the estimates for all site analysis indicate a one percent increase in depth to groundwater and transmissivity result in 0 05 4 4 the coefficient for initial depth for all sites in table 3 is 5 32 and this means that a one percent increase in initial depth results in a 5 32 100 0 05 meter higher groundwater level with mar and 0 06 m 0 18 feet and 0 19 feet higher final groundwater levels with mar respectively however for deep aquifer sites a one percent increase in the depth to the groundwater decreases the final groundwater level with mar because there is a greater cost to pump mar water from the ground a one percent increase in natural recharge lowers the groundwater level with mar by 0 05 m 0 16 feet on average for the all site analysis since mar will be less especially for the shallow aquifer sites if more recharge occurs naturally higher net returns to irrigated corn and cotton decrease the gap in groundwater conservation with mar because these crops are substitutes for the use of mar a one percent increase in the net returns to corn and cotton decreases the final groundwater level with mar by 0 05 and 0 02 meters 1 63 feet and 0 74 feet respectively the unusually large magnitude of the semi elasticities for the net returns is due to the minimal spatial variation in the net returns because only county level crop yields are available higher net returns to irrigated and dryland soybeans and the double crop soybean and wheat all increase the final groundwater level with mar irrigated soybeans are a much weaker substitute for mar compared to corn and cotton and there is enough mar use with irrigated soybeans that the final groundwater level rises especially at the deep aquifer sites 3 4 site characteristics and present value of farm net returns with mar negative coefficient estimates in table 5 indicate that a one percent increase in the value of an explanatory variable results in a decrease in the net returns per acre per year with mar relative to no mar the semi elasticity estimates for the initial depth natural recharge distance from a conveyance canal to a recharge site and transmissivity are all significant and negative the present value of net returns are higher with mar but the difference in net returns without mar is smaller when one of those site characteristics increase greater initial depth raises the costs of pumping mar water back out of the aquifer and the net returns from the use of mar versus no mar shrink a one percent increase in natural recharge lowers the net returns with mar versus without mar by 0 08 ha year 0 03 acre year on average across all sites because mar is less valuable for stabilizing groundwater levels for sites with ample natural recharge for the deep aquifer sites a rise in the transmissivity does not lead to more mar use or a higher final groundwater level and the gap in the net returns with mar versus without mar is less an increase in the distance from a conveyance canal to a recharge site increases the cost of mar and a site with a higher cost of mar has a smaller difference compared to the net returns without mar other than rice the explanatory variables for crop net returns excluding irrigation costs have negative semi elasticities for all site analysis for irrigated corn cotton and soybean dryland soybean and doubled crop soybean and winter wheat the higher net returns to those crops increase the agricultural land in less irrigation intensive crops and the cultivation of those crops reduce mar use except for dryland soybeans and makes the difference in net returns with mar versus without mar smaller the negative semi elasticity for the dryland soybean net returns only occurs for all site analysis and this may be because land shifts to the low net return from dryland soybeans with the use of mar the positive semi elasticity for rice net returns indicates that mar facilitates the increase in the land to rice to capture the higher net returns from rice 3 5 sites characteristics and the cost effectiveness of mar use positive elasticity estimates in table 6 indicate that an increase in the value of a site characteristic will increase the social cost whereas a negative estimate indicates the site characteristic decreases the social cost of mar water use the elasticity for initial depth is significant and positive for the whole landscape indicating that the replenishment of the aquifer through mar for deep aquifers would not be a cost effective way to conserve groundwater one possible explanation is that slippage is higher in deep aquifer sites where rice is usually grown compared to sites where groundwater is still abundant we find that slippage has a significant and positive correlation with depth to groundwater slope 0 17 r2 0 19 and p value 2e 16 implying that a significant portion of recharged water is offset through increased groundwater use through shifts to more irrigation intensive crops when more water is available through mar farmers increase irrigation water demand through the expansion of irrigated acreage as banking water in the aquifer becomes cheaper due to the subsidy farmers increase not only mar use but also groundwater extraction because more acres of irrigation intensive crops are grown the subsidy on mar benefits rice farmers at deep aquifer sites more than society because mar raises the total net returns but the social cost is high in these areas the elasticity estimates for natural recharge are positive and significant since a subsidy for mar is mostly just cost to society if the aquifer recharge would happen naturally higher transmissivity results in a statistically significant increase in the social cost for the shallow aquifer sites high transmissivities tend to coincide with greater saturated thickness at the sites and the groundwater abundance reduces the cost effectiveness of mar water use based on the crop net return explanatory variables a government subsidy for mar should prioritize sites where the net returns are high for the less irrigation intensive crops i e irrigated soybean and cotton elasticities for the net returns to irrigated soybean and cotton are significant and negative while the elasticity for the net return to dryland soybean is significant and positive sites with a higher net return to dryland soybean have less irrigation water demand and a subsidy on mar in these areas is less justified a subsidy on mar to increase groundwater availability is more cost effective where less irrigation intensive crops are grown because less banked water is pumped back up for irrigation 4 conclusion we account for the dynamics of crop choice and groundwater flows to examine the spatial variation in the use of mar groundwater conservation economic returns and the social cost of a mar subsidy our results fill a gap in the literature analyzing the suitability of mar for an agricultural setting by accounting for not only the hydrologic but also the agronomic and economic conditions at the landscape level we investigate not only which hydrologic and economic factors influence conservation and economic objectives but how much those factors contribute to an objective our modeling approach is also the first to examine where a mar subsidy would be cost effective for society through the examination of the social cost of a mar subsidy we find that the highest amount of optimal mar occurs at sites with low natural recharge large net returns to rice and dryland soybeans and low net returns to less irrigation intensive corn and soybeans the use of mar as a complement with a dryland crop but as a substitute with corn and soybeans to maximize profits is a useful finding about how agricultural producers might combine crop mix choices with water management the same site characteristics have the largest influence on where mar increases groundwater conservation except that higher net returns to irrigated soybeans make mar more effective at groundwater conservation this suggests that although mar declines with more irrigated soybeans the net effect of additional irrigated soybeans is higher groundwater levels with mar than without mar the highest present value of net returns with mar versus without mar occurs at the sites with low natural recharge and large net returns to rice we also find that subsidizing mar in farms with deep aquifers would not be a cost effective approach because the social cost of groundwater conservation is higher at those sites a subsidy is more cost effective at sites with low natural recharge and where irrigated soybean and cotton have high net returns because slippage is less the findings have implications for understanding where to develop mar infrastructure not only to conserve groundwater but where to do so at a low cost to society our approach is not a replacement for the use of numerical groundwater flow models and groundwater banking indices developed in previous studies to evaluate the suitability of mar rather our approach offers a complementary tool that provides information about the economic returns of mar investment and the social costs of a mar subsidy further research can account for the effect of spatial and temporal variation of surplus water for recharge on the economics of mar the hydrological component of our economic model is simple particularly in the assumption that there are no lateral flows between sites to allow for computationally tractable optimization the natural recharge remains constant for the full horizon of the optimization but the effects of climate dynamics would affect natural recharge significantly meixner et al 2016 gemitzi et al 2017 smerdon 2017 an extension would be to incorporate this model into climatic and hydrologic process based models e g vertical flux model modflow to investigate the potential costs and gains of mar with a variable climate and also to account for the complexity of groundwater flows rather than assume producers will switch to new irrigation practices or less water intensive crops over a long time horizon we could examine how deficit irrigation influences spatial variation in mar research suggests that farmers do not respond linearly to changes in groundwater availability and climate foster et al 2014 foster and brozović 2018 the integration of the economic model with a process based model for the intra seasonal structure of irrigation e g aquacrop would also improve the spatial planning for mar declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

economic model investigates the influence of site conditions such as natural recharge proximity to surface water sources and the agronomic conditions of crops on four model outcomes optimal mar final groundwater level present value of farm net returns and the cost effectiveness of a mar subsidy we find that less irrigation intensive crops are a substitute for mar while rice and dryland crops are a complement for mar optimal mar is larger at a site with greater net returns to rice and dryland soybeans lower net returns to irrigated corn and soybeans and lower natural recharge mar increases groundwater conservation most at the sites with higher net returns to dryland and irrigated soybeans and lower net returns to corn and cotton mar raises the present value of economic returns from agriculture more where the net returns from rice are large but the cost effective locations for a mar subsidy are sites with large net returns to crops like cotton and soybeans higher natural recharge

agriculture the economic feasibility of mar is not well studied especially when and where to initiate mar to maximize economic and groundwater conservation benefits across an agricultural landscape spatial variability in the hydrologic and agronomic conditions of a landscape contributes to site level differences in the economic feasibility of mar tailored implementation of mar by site then has the potential to maximize socio environmental returns over time maliva 2014 2015 dillon and arshad 2016 our objective is to provide a tool for rapid first order assessment to aid in the spatial targeting of mar policies and education if decision makers decide to support the practice we accomplish this in three ways we first identify which hydrologic and agronomic factors influence the use of mar groundwater conservation economic returns and the social cost of a mar subsidy second using semi elasticity estimates from a regression analysis we determine the factors that have the largest impact on the conservation or economic objectives third we investigate the cost effectiveness of a mar subsidy to identify where to develop mar infrastructure at a low cost to society the main advantage of mar over surface reservoirs is that mar does not require the use of productive farmland and storing water in the aquifer prevents evaporation losses and can improve groundwater quality scanlon et al 2016 a disadvantage of mar is the cost to pump the recharged water back to the surface for irrigation and the inability to recover all of the recharged water due to losses to streams or underlying aquifers some early studies conducted economic assessments of groundwater recharge for irrigation use based on its benefits of reduced pumping lift and extended aquifer life supalla and comer 1982 al sabbry et al 2002 however these early studies did not incorporate spatial and temporal irrigated cropland change resulting from reduced pumping costs and the amount of mar is not chosen through the optimization of economic net returns balali et al 2011 use a non linear optimization approach to evaluate the outcomes of irrigation water price and groundwater conservation policies however artificial recharge was treated as constant in the model most mar studies focus on using soil and hydrogeological data to identify the suitability of mar with logic scores and or geographic information systems russo et al 2015 fernández escalante et al 2014 o geen et al 2015 brown et al 2016 ahani amineh et al 2017 smith et al 2017 gibson et al 2018 or hydrologic models i e modflow

designation of critical groundwater areas anrc 2005 2018 only about 44 of current groundwater withdrawals in the region are sustainable anrc 2013 2018 we make several noteworthy contributions to economics of mar the first contribution is the use of a model to maximize economic returns by changing the crops and irrigation sources by site to find for a nearly two thousand site landscape the optimal mar use groundwater conservation and economic returns with versus without mar and the cost effectiveness of a mar subsidy to conserve groundwater for the mrva aquifer in arkansas usa our hydro economic model accounts for the possibility of land use change to more irrigation intensive crops when mar stabilizes or raises groundwater levels and the potential increase in groundwater pumping undermines conservation efforts grafton et al 2018 the second contribution is the use of regression analysis to evaluate how the initial agronomic and hydrologic conditions at each site correlate with optimal site level outcomes from the model targeted conservation policies can be challenging to implement in practice due to a lack of site specific information about farms farmers landscape characteristics and input decisions khanna and zilberman 2017 khanna et al 2018 the regression analysis allows us to understand why some sites according to the initial site conditions have more optimal mar and have more groundwater conservation and economics returns with mar a third contribution is an analysis of where a mar subsidy is cost effective for groundwater conservation and why based on initial site conditions to help decision makers evaluate where to develop mar infrastructure and implement water conservation programs 2 methods we consider the spatial determinants of mar use and the spatial determinants of groundwater conservation and economic returns from mar use with two modeling procedures fig 1 first we maximize the present value of net returns over twelve decades assuming low fixed costs for mar of 0 008 m3 10 acre foot the low fixed costs allow many sites to use mar and this allows for a more detailed evaluation of how spatial variation in socio environmental conditions influence mar use there are also variable costs of mar that depend on the distance from recharge sites to surface water sources the second modeling procedure is to use the site level results from the first step to estimate through ordinary least square ols regressions how the initial site characteristics explain the spatial variation of optimal mar use final depth to groundwater economic returns and the cost effectiveness of a policy to subsidize mar 2 1 the optimization model of landscape irrigation and land use choices 2 1 1 land use choices there are m land uses that include the following crops rice irrigated soybean corn and cotton non irrigated soybean and double cropped irrigated soybean with winter wheat one other land use includes fallowing the land each year

patterns there is a mix of crops at each site and year that reflects the crops grown in rotation according to historical land use but there is no constraint that crop types switch every year 2 1 2

subsidizes the fixed costs as an approach to support groundwater conservation the usda natural resources conservation service typically provides a cost share for conservation practices in the range of 40 60 usda nrcs 2018 mar is not currently one of those practices but we suppose a 50 cost share that reduces the already low fixed costs of mar from 0 008 m3 to 0 004 m3 10 acre foot to 5 acre foot the cost effectiveness of the policy is the social cost per unit of groundwater conserved where the social cost of a policy is the difference in economic returns minus the loss of government revenue

below average we use a function f that is linear in the natural log of the explanatory variables by using the natural log of the explanatory variables the regression analysis coefficient estimates for eq 8 to 11 are semi elasticity estimates semi elasticity estimates indicate how much a one percent increase in an initial site condition changes the dependent variable in particular suppose a linear regression model with a log transformed independent variable can be expressed as y β 0 β 1 ln x 1 suppose y 1 β 0 β 1 ln x 1 and y 2 β 0 β 1 ln x 1 1 1 then y 2 y 1 β 1 ln 1 1 β 1 ln 101 100 β 1 100 the interpretation is that a one percent change in the independent variable is associated with a β 1 100 change in the dependent variable where there is a log transformation of both the dependent and independent variables the regression analysis coefficient estimates are elasticities an elasticity indicates how large of a percentage change in the dependent variable occurs with a one percent increase in an initial site condition the estimates in terms of semi elasticities and elasticities allows us to compare which initial site condition most influences the dependent variable even though the explanatory variables are in different units 2 2 data the study area shown in fig 2 comes from the eight digit hydrologic unit code huc watersheds that overlay critical groundwater areas defined by the arkansas natural resources commission anrc 2018 eleven arkansas counties overlap with the study region that encompasses an area of 438 842 ha 1 084 402 acres agricultural land in the study area currently does not have the infrastructure to support mar we assume that farmers use bank infiltration to extract water through extraction wells near rivers and transport convey that water to recharge wells the concept is to induce flow through the streambed into the aquifer and capture that water rather than groundwater from storage and use a pipeline to transfer water to where recharge is needed and inject it into the aquifer using a recharge well the time horizon for the analysis is 120 years between 2017 and 2136 because the focus is on long term aquifer management and the infrastructure to the support the use of mar would likely be paid for over a long horizon there are 1991 sites over the study area to incorporate spatial details in the optimization problem and a dual purpose well is in the center of each site for mar in the winter and spring and extraction for irrigation later in the year the maximum annual rate of injection across the wells is between of 191 189 863 436 m3 155 700 acre feet over non irrigation periods based on the calculations described in eq 4 and from a usgs pilot study of mar sniegocki et al 1965 fitzpatrick 1990 the supporting information in section 2 notes that there is enough excess surface water from the white and arkansas rivers in the region to allow the injection wells at all sites to operate at full capacity the primary expense of mar is the infrastructure to deliver water from the rivers to the recharge sites but the project costs from the u s army corps of engineers in arkansas are highly speculative anrc 2013 the supporting information has a third section with a table a1 that has the average initial acreage of each crop based on the 2017 cropland data layer usda nass 2018b the proportion of harvested soybean acreage that is irrigated vs non irrigated is from the usda nass 2018b and the yield for each crop comes from the five year average at the county level division of agriculture uark 2018 table a2 has the operating and capital costs constant over time in real terms for mar and the wells and all other costs of production for each crop from a nominal discount rate of 5 less inflation of 3 over the last fifty years we use a 2 real discount rate u s department of the treasury 2018 the summary statistics for the explanatory variables in eqs 9 12 are shown in table 1 the transmissivity variable t r f is hydraulic conductivity h k f times the initial saturated thickness b f transmissivity is an essential factor that decides the cost of mar and suitability of a site for mar brown et al 2016 ahani amineh et al 2017 gibson et al 2018 the depth variable is the initial distance from the soil surface to the groundwater level depth is the main parameter in the pumping cost which partly decides the mar use the natural recharge n r f refers to the annual amount of water that is replenished into the aquifer naturally the natural recharge is based on the estimated annual natural recharged for the period of 2000 2013 clark and hart 2009 reitz et al 2017 the distance variable refers to how far it is from the recharge site i e a center of each site to the nearest surface water source i e main rivers the variable cost of mar is mainly based on distance we also introduce the pumpage variable which is the initial well pumping rate to represent the unobservable agronomic conditions for irrigation intensity at each site crop net returns represent the suitability of the site for each crop fig 3 shows the spatial variation of five initial site characteristics depth to groundwater transmissivity well pumping distance and natural recharge in 2017 lighter shades indicate lower values the depth to the aquifer shown in fig 3a indicates that the northern and southwestern parts of the study area have the deepest aquifer whereas the groundwater resources are more abundant in the southern and southeastern parts fig 3b represents the transmissivity and most of the southwestern and central parts have higher transmissivity values whereas the northern part of has considerably lower transmissivity fig 3c shows the distance from the closest river to the center of the cell the distance follows closely the shape of rivers that run through the study area the well pumping rate highly depends on which crops are grown fig 3d annual irrigation water use for arkansas rice is approximately two times higher compared with the amount of irrigation water applied on corn and soybeans in the region since more rice is grown in the northern and western parts of the study area the well pumping rates in these parts are much higher than elsewhere the natural recharge rate is at the highest in the northern part whereas the southwestern part has the lowest natural recharge rate fig 4 e 3 results and discussion the results section begins with an examination of the site level optimization model outcomes through summary statistics across sites and landscape level maps of the study area next is a spatial analysis of the optimal amount of mar per acre followed by how the use of mar affects the final groundwater level the present value of net returns per acre per year and the cost effectiveness of a mar subsidy policy 3 1 summary statistics and maps of the spatial variation in the model outcomes the summary statistics for the dependent variables of the regression analysis the left hand side variables of eqs 9 12 constructed from the optimization model results appear in table 2 the average optimal mar for all sites is about 3082 m3 ha year about one acre foot acre year and this is higher at deep aquifer sites and lower at shallow aquifer sites the mar use is not much greater in the deep aquifer sites than the shallow aquifer sites because for artificial recharge to be useful the water stored in the aquifer has to be pumped back out again the depth to the aquifer in the final period is about 18 60 m 60 feet greater with mar than without mar at all sites and in the deep and shallow aquifer sites an 18 6 m difference appears large but remember that we assume a low cost of 0 008 m3 10 acre foot for mar because the focus is on how the site characteristics influence mar and a low cost of mar allows more sites to use mar there is more variation in the depth difference for the deep aquifer sites and less for the shallow aquifer sites the average increase in economics returns with mar across all sites is 10 99 ha year 4 44 acre year and this is more than a 3 higher at the deep aquifer sites and more than a 3 lower at the shallow aquifer sites the average cost effectiveness of the subsidy for mar is about 0 036 m3 44 34 acre foot across all sites and this is more than 0 01 m3 higher and lower at the deep and shallow aquifer sites respectively on the landscape map the optimal mar use shown in fig 4a is greater in the southwest west central and northern portions of the study area in comparison with fig 3 the sites with greater initial depth to the aquifer higher initial well pumping and lower natural recharge appear to use more mar however the weight that these site characteristics and the other site characteristics have in determining optimal mar use is left to the regression analysis that follows the larger differences in the final depth to groundwater with and without mar fig 4b are prevalent across much of the center of the landscape as well as the southwest and north the initial depth to the aquifer and initial well pumping appear to have less weight in how much the use of mar conserves groundwater at a site the rise in the present value of net returns with mar versus without mar at each site fig 4c is greater in the southwest and low everywhere else low natural recharge and high net returns to rice appear to factor heavily on the increase in the present value of net returns due to mar the social cost of groundwater conservation with a mar subsidy fig 4d is higher in the north and the west central sections of the landscape where natural recharge is the largest sites with a lower social cost of mar subsidy is where policymakers would conserve groundwater at the lowest cost to society this is not always where the use of mar is the greatest or where the rise in the present value of net returns due to the use of mar is the largest the slippage or rebound effect refers to the increase in groundwater pumping that occurs because more irrigation intensive crops are grown if the variable costs of irrigation decline through greater irrigation efficiency or the use of mar ward and pulido velazquez 2008 pfeiffer and lin 2014 wang et al 2015 the initial depth to the aquifer and initial well pumping have a greater weight on how much slippage occurs at each site fig 4e 3 2 site characteristics and optimal mar use the semi elasticity estimates for the influence of the spatially variable initial site conditions on mar use per acre are in table 3 for all sites and the deep and shallow aquifer sub regions the initial depth transmissivity well pumping net returns to rice and dryland soybean all have significant and positive semi elasticities at all sites analysis the estimates for the all sites analysis indicates that a one percent increase in initial depth would make the optimal mar per ha increase by 500 8 100 5 01 cubic feet per ha 3 3 a linear regression model with a log transformed independent variable can be expressed as y β 0 β 1 ln x 1 suppose y 1 β 0 β 1 ln x 1 and y 2 β 0 β 1 ln x 1 1 1 then y 2 y 1 β 1 ln 1 1 β 1 ln 101 100 β 1 100 the interpretation is that a one percent change in the independent variable is associated with a β 1 100 change in the dependent variable with other variables held constant the natural recharge and transport distance explanatory variables have significant and negative semi elasticities initial depth to groundwater is significant and positive in the shallow aquifer region because higher well pumping costs increase the incentive to use artificial recharge to stabilize groundwater levels when the water can be pumped back out at a reasonable cost greater natural recharge at site reduces the use of mar because groundwater levels stabilize more easily without mar also as water conveyance costs from surface water sources to recharge sites increases there is less mar use initial well pumping is significant and positive implying that there is greater use of mar to stabilize groundwater level when the agronomic conditions associated with the sites increase the demand for irrigation transmissivity is an indication of the maximum amount of water that can be injected into the aquifer artificially theis 1935 fitzpatrick 1990 when the maximum amount of water possible for injection increases while the capital cost of mar remains constant the unit cost of mar is lower the positive semi elasticity estimate for transmissivity thus matches our expectations higher net returns to rice encourage rice production and more mar is necessary to stabilize groundwater levels if more land is in the irrigation intensive crop this relationship is significant only in the shallow aquifer region where the well pumping costs are not too high to discourage more rice production higher net returns to dryland soybean result in more mar because the dryland crop complements the use of mar to stabilize groundwater levels the less irrigation intensive crops that include cotton soybean and corn are substitutes for mar because the higher net returns to these crops reduce the mar use sites with higher net returns to less irrigation intensive crops choose more land in those crops rather than use mar the magnitude of the semi elasticities is greater for the net returns from the crops than the other explanatory variables in the deep aquifer region the natural recharge and net returns to dryland soybeans are the most influential site variables because the mix of the irrigated crops is less responsive to groundwater level changes when the aquifer is deep underground however mar use shows great sensitivity to irrigated crop net returns when the aquifer is shallow 3 3 site characteristics and groundwater depletion with mar table 4 shows the results of estimating eq 10 the difference in the final groundwater level with and without mar as a function of initial site conditions positive coefficient estimates indicate that a one percent increase in a site characteristic will increase the difference in the depth to groundwater with and without mar h f n o m a r t h f m a r t meaning that mar is having a larger impact of groundwater conservation a negative coefficient estimate indicates a decrease in the difference between depth to groundwater with and without mar meaning that mar has less impact on groundwater conservation the estimates for all site analysis indicate a one percent increase in depth to groundwater and transmissivity result in 0 05 4 4 the coefficient for initial depth for all sites in table 3 is 5 32 and this means that a one percent increase in initial depth results in a 5 32 100 0 05 meter higher groundwater level with mar and 0 06 m 0 18 feet and 0 19 feet higher final groundwater levels with mar respectively however for deep aquifer sites a one percent increase in the depth to the groundwater decreases the final groundwater level with mar because there is a greater cost to pump mar water from the ground a one percent increase in natural recharge lowers the groundwater level with mar by 0 05 m 0 16 feet on average for the all site analysis since mar will be less especially for the shallow aquifer sites if more recharge occurs naturally higher net returns to irrigated corn and cotton decrease the gap in groundwater conservation with mar because these crops are substitutes for the use of mar a one percent increase in the net returns to corn and cotton decreases the final groundwater level with mar by 0 05 and 0 02 meters 1 63 feet and 0 74 feet respectively the unusually large magnitude of the semi elasticities for the net returns is due to the minimal spatial variation in the net returns because only county level crop yields are available higher net returns to irrigated and dryland soybeans and the double crop soybean and wheat all increase the final groundwater level with mar irrigated soybeans are a much weaker substitute for mar compared to corn and cotton and there is enough mar use with irrigated soybeans that the final groundwater level rises especially at the deep aquifer sites 3 4 site characteristics and present value of farm net returns with mar negative coefficient estimates in table 5 indicate that a one percent increase in the value of an explanatory variable results in a decrease in the net returns per acre per year with mar relative to no mar the semi elasticity estimates for the initial depth natural recharge distance from a conveyance canal to a recharge site and transmissivity are all significant and negative the present value of net returns are higher with mar but the difference in net returns without mar is smaller when one of those site characteristics increase greater initial depth raises the costs of pumping mar water back out of the aquifer and the net returns from the use of mar versus no mar shrink a one percent increase in natural recharge lowers the net returns with mar versus without mar by 0 08 ha year 0 03 acre year on average across all sites because mar is less valuable for stabilizing groundwater levels for sites with ample natural recharge for the deep aquifer sites a rise in the transmissivity does not lead to more mar use or a higher final groundwater level and the gap in the net returns with mar versus without mar is less an increase in the distance from a conveyance canal to a recharge site increases the cost of mar and a site with a higher cost of mar has a smaller difference compared to the net returns without mar other than rice the explanatory variables for crop net returns excluding irrigation costs have negative semi elasticities for all site analysis for irrigated corn cotton and soybean dryland soybean and doubled crop soybean and winter wheat the higher net returns to those crops increase the agricultural land in less irrigation intensive crops and the cultivation of those crops reduce mar use except for dryland soybeans and makes the difference in net returns with mar versus without mar smaller the negative semi elasticity for the dryland soybean net returns only occurs for all site analysis and this may be because land shifts to the low net return from dryland soybeans with the use of mar the positive semi elasticity for rice net returns indicates that mar facilitates the increase in the land to rice to capture the higher net returns from rice 3 5 sites characteristics and the cost effectiveness of mar use positive elasticity estimates in table 6 indicate that an increase in the value of a site characteristic will increase the social cost whereas a negative estimate indicates the site characteristic decreases the social cost of mar water use the elasticity for initial depth is significant and positive for the whole landscape indicating that the replenishment of the aquifer through mar for deep aquifers would not be a cost effective way to conserve groundwater one possible explanation is that slippage is higher in deep aquifer sites where rice is usually grown compared to sites where groundwater is still abundant we find that slippage has a significant and positive correlation with depth to groundwater slope 0 17 r2 0 19 and p value 2e 16 implying that a significant portion of recharged water is offset through increased groundwater use through shifts to more irrigation intensive crops when more water is available through mar farmers increase irrigation water demand through the expansion of irrigated acreage as banking water in the aquifer becomes cheaper due to the subsidy farmers increase not only mar use but also groundwater extraction because more acres of irrigation intensive crops are grown the subsidy on mar benefits rice farmers at deep aquifer sites more than society because mar raises the total net returns but the social cost is high in these areas the elasticity estimates for natural recharge are positive and significant since a subsidy for mar is mostly just cost to society if the aquifer recharge would happen naturally higher transmissivity results in a statistically significant increase in the social cost for the shallow aquifer sites high transmissivities tend to coincide with greater saturated thickness at the sites and the groundwater abundance reduces the cost effectiveness of mar water use based on the crop net return explanatory variables a government subsidy for mar should prioritize sites where the net returns are high for the less irrigation intensive crops i e irrigated soybean and cotton elasticities for the net returns to irrigated soybean and cotton are significant and negative while the elasticity for the net return to dryland soybean is significant and positive sites with a higher net return to dryland soybean have less irrigation water demand and a subsidy on mar in these areas is less justified a subsidy on mar to increase groundwater availability is more cost effective where less irrigation intensive crops are grown because less banked water is pumped back up for irrigation 4 conclusion we account for the dynamics of crop choice and groundwater flows to examine the spatial variation in the use of mar groundwater conservation economic returns and the social cost of a mar subsidy our results fill a gap in the literature analyzing the suitability of mar for an agricultural setting by accounting for not only the hydrologic but also the agronomic and economic conditions at the landscape level we investigate not only which hydrologic and economic factors influence conservation and economic objectives but how much those factors contribute to an objective our modeling approach is also the first to examine where a mar subsidy would be cost effective for society through the examination of the social cost of a mar subsidy we find that the highest amount of optimal mar occurs at sites with low natural recharge large net returns to rice and dryland soybeans and low net returns to less irrigation intensive corn and soybeans the use of mar as a complement with a dryland crop but as a substitute with corn and soybeans to maximize profits is a useful finding about how agricultural producers might combine crop mix choices with water management the same site characteristics have the largest influence on where mar increases groundwater conservation except that higher net returns to irrigated soybeans make mar more effective at groundwater conservation this suggests that although mar declines with more irrigated soybeans the net effect of additional irrigated soybeans is higher groundwater levels with mar than without mar the highest present value of net returns with mar versus without mar occurs at the sites with low natural recharge and large net returns to rice we also find that subsidizing mar in farms with deep aquifers would not be a cost effective approach because the social cost of groundwater conservation is higher at those sites a subsidy is more cost effective at sites with low natural recharge and where irrigated soybean and cotton have high net returns because slippage is less the findings have implications for understanding where to develop mar infrastructure not only to conserve groundwater but where to do so at a low cost to society our approach is not a replacement for the use of numerical groundwater flow models and groundwater banking indices developed in previous studies to evaluate the suitability of mar rather our approach offers a complementary tool that provides information about the economic returns of mar investment and the social costs of a mar subsidy further research can account for the effect of spatial and temporal variation of surplus water for recharge on the economics of mar the hydrological component of our economic model is simple particularly in the assumption that there are no lateral flows between sites to allow for computationally tractable optimization the natural recharge remains constant for the full horizon of the optimization but the effects of climate dynamics would affect natural recharge significantly meixner et al 2016 gemitzi et al 2017 smerdon 2017 an extension would be to incorporate this model into climatic and hydrologic process based models e g vertical flux model modflow to investigate the potential costs and gains of mar with a variable climate and also to account for the complexity of groundwater flows rather than assume producers will switch to new irrigation practices or less water intensive crops over a long time horizon we could examine how deficit irrigation influences spatial variation in mar research suggests that farmers do not respond linearly to changes in groundwater availability and climate foster et al 2014 foster and brozović 2018 the integration of the economic model with a process based model for the intra seasonal structure of irrigation e g aquacrop would also improve the spatial planning for mar declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10474,drought tolerant forage crops have huge development potential in drylands taking into account the current global challenges climate change natural resources overexploitation and increasing food demand however little is known about the trade off among yield nutritional quality and soil water consumption for dryland forage farming production in semi arid regions this research compared the two year yield and soil water consumption characteristics of sweet sorghum sorghum dochna sudangrass sorghum sudanense and forage maize zea mays under natural rainfall condition the soil water content up to 200 cm soil depth at 10 cm intervals and dry matter yield of the different forage crops were evaluated in a set of plots in 2017 and 2018 and the nutritional quality of these crops were measured in 2018 three replicate plots were established for each forage crop results showed that the neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf contents of sudangrass were significantly lower than those of sweet sorghum and forage maize p 0 05 sudangrass presented the higher in vitro dry matter digestibility coefficient ivdmd the yield of sweet sorghum was significantly higher than that of sudangrass and forage maize different soil water consumption patterns were observed among the forage crops happening mostly in the 0 150 cm soil layer in the forage maize plots and in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the sweet sorghum and sudangrass plots the average daily evapotranspiration etd of forage maize was about 10 and 15 higher than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass respectively forage sorghum presented the highest yield less soil water consumption and similar nutritional quality to forage maize and thus it is an advisable option for forage production in the soil water limited semi arid regions keywords dryland farming forage precipitation utilization efficiency soil water consumption yield nutritional quality 1 introduction rising living standards are resulting in an increasing demand for meat the human food demand is estimated to double by 2050 owing to the population growth and an increasing meat intensive diet mueller et al 2012 therefore the need for dryland forage farming production has been further accentuated the combination of increasing crop yield demand and pronounced land degradation is placing unprecedented pressure on the current agricultural and natural resources worldwide wu and ma 2015 d amour et al 2007 vargas pineda et al 2020 the effects of climate change higher frequency of extreme events changes in rainfall patterns global warming on crop productivity are a further and serious threat bishopp and lynch 2015 godfray et al 2010 therefore there is a primary challenge to meet the current and expected growing forage demand with minimal negative environmental impacts by means of maximizing productivity under variable climatic conditions grassini and cassman 2012 tilman et al 2011 this challenge is greater in arid and semi arid regions where water scarcity is common these regions account for about 40 of the world s land surface and global warming may cause a further expansion of these areas huang et al 2017 on the other hand ferner et al 2018 have indicated that livestock husbandry is the most important agricultural activity in global drylands thus forage crops in these regions play an important role in the global forage production however water shortage is the most important limiting factor for plant productivity and these conditions may become more severe owing to global warming zhang et al 2006 sun et al 2017 due to the lack of water resources in these agro ecosystems most forage fields are not irrigated and thus are managed under rainfed conditions elliott et al 2014 hadebe et al 2016 forage crops including nonfood biomass from maize and sorghum crops are an important part of forage for livestock herrero et al 2010 forage maize is a main source of feed and it occupies an important position in the world s agricultural production owing to their high productivity and drought tolerance sorghum and sudangrass are also used for forage in semi arid regions moreover dercas and liakatas 2007 observed that sweet sorghum has a high above ground dry biomass among the c4 hatch slack carbon fixation pathway crops under unlimited water conditions therefore forage sorghum sudangrass and forage maize have broad development and utilization prospects in livestock husbandry in arid and semi arid regions crop yield and nutritional quality are important plant traits to evaluate the value and suitability of forages miron et al 2007 yield reflects the potential ability of plants to accumulate dry matter the utilization ratio of energy transformed from forage constituents by animals is usually denoted as the forage feeding value wang et al 2016 the in vitro dry matter digestibility ivdmd coefficient is one of the most critical characters of forages high ivdmd values and reduced lignin contents are the main selection criteria to identify forage crops of high nutritional quality casler 2001 a higher neutral detergent fiber ndf digestibility of forages is beneficial to increase feed intake and thus the yields of milk and protein of dairy cows ferraretto and shaver 2015 the ndf contains celluloses hemicelluloses and lignins while acid detergent fiber adf is the residual of ndf obtained through acid detergent treatment the residue includes cellulose and lignins cardinal et al 2003 the contents of ndf and adf have a crucial influence on forage digestibility therefore the forage nutritional quality and digestibility levels are the most important factors to select forage crops many studies have investigated the yield and nutritive value of forage crops dercas and liakatas 2007 zhang et al 2006 elliott et al 2014 however these studies mainly evaluated single issues such as drought tolerance schittenhelm and schroetter 2014 hadebe et al 2016 water use efficiency zegada lizarazu et al 2012 and forage value miron et al 2007 a number of studies have been focused on the nutritive value of the plants but the effects of soil water on forage yields were based on irrigated conditions and thus results cannot be extrapolated to rainfed agriculture dercas and liakatas 2007 li et al 2015 varzi and oad 2018 nevertheless rainfall is the only source for soil water in many arid and semi arid regions such as the study area in this study which is located in the loess plateau china therefore a good understanding of yield nutritional quality and soil water consumption characteristics of different forage crops would be conductive to improve the dryland forage farming production in water limited regions maize is the traditional primary crop in the study area while as forage there is still the necessity of evaluating whether it has the advantage in yield and water saving thus it is important to seek the optimum balance between nutritional value biomass and water consumption of the different forage crops that are cultivated in the loess plateau where water is a limited resource the hypothesis of this work is that sweet sorghum may have a higher yield and nutritional quality and higher water use efficiency compared with the other main forage species to test this hypothesis we measured the dry matter yield nutritional quality and soil water content up to 200 cm soil depth of sweet sorghum sorghum dochna sudangrass sorghum sudanense and forage maize zea mays plots in a comparative way under natural rainfall conditions and during two years 2017 and 2018 this study aims to determine whether sweet sorghum has yield nutritional quality and water use advantages over other common dryland forage farming crops in a semi arid rainfed cropland 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

maize plots in 2018 the decrease of stored swc during the harvest time mainly occurred in the 50 150 cm soil layer compared to the sweet sorghum and sudangrass plots the forage maize plots exhibited the largest decline in swc furthermore the soil water content in the upper 40 cm layer appeared to increase during the harvest time the soil water storage sws variation of forage maize at the 50 100

sorghum and forage maize p 0 05 despite these patterns the differences between the three forage crops in the 100 200 cm soil layer were not significant during the growing season in 2017 p 0 05 in 2018 the sws variation of the three forage crops in the 50 100 cm soil layer was higher than in the other soil layers and the highest sws values appeared in the forage maize and sweet sorghum plots being approximately 65 higher than the variation obtained in the sudangrass fig 5b 3 5 the average daily evapotranspiration of the forage crops the average daily evapotranspiration etd was higher in 2017 than in 2018 fig 6 the etd of the forage maize plots was the highest and reached 3 3 0 2 mm d 1 and 2 9 0 4 mm d 1 in 2017 and 2018 respectively the highest average etd of the two years was obtained in the forage maize 3 1 0 4 mm d 1 and it was approximately 10 and 14 higher than that of the sweet sorghum and sudangrass respectively 4 discussion due to the climatic conditions during the experiment with sparse rainfall and intense evaporation soil water shortage generally existed during the growing season taking into account that soil water availability is the major factor limiting sustainable forage growth especially in dryland farming it is essential to evaluate the production capacity of forage crops under limited water resources which may contribute to the optimal choice of the forage species 4 1 dry matter yield and water use efficiency of the forage crops in this study and among the forage crops sweet sorghum stood out for its performance in terms of yield under natural rainfall condition this result was consistent with the previous research made by varzi and oad 2018 and miron et al 2007 regarding the soil water consumption forage maize was the highest followed by sweet sorghum being sudangrass the lowest these results indicated that compared with other forages crops sweet sorghum could acquire more yield with similar values of soil water consumption miron et al 2007 reported that to acquire more biomass maize requires over two times as much water as sweet sorghum does furthermore many studies have found that the yields of sorghum and maize were not significantly different under water sufficient condition while the yield of sorghum was higher than that of maize under drought stress e g schittenhelm and schroetter 2014 these studies showed that compared with sorghum maize requires more soil water and sweet sorghum has higher capacity to sustain the optimum yield under drought conditions zegada lizarazu et al 2012 prażak 2016 that fact may be explained by the higher and more stable water use efficiency wue of sorghum crop compared to the wue of maize hadebe et al 2016 this study indicated that water use efficiency wue of sweet sorghum was the highest compared with 2017 the precipitation decreased approximately 30 in 2018 while the yield of sweet sorghum increased by 30 and as expected the yield of maize decreased by 52 zegada lizarazu et al 2012 indicated that under drought stress the yield of sweet sorghum and maize was reduced by approximately 38 and 47 respectively while the water use efficiency of sweet sorghum was increased by 20 and reduced by 5 in maize the higher water use efficiency of crops could improve their drought tolerance hund et al 2009 moreover sweet sorghum can accumulate large amounts of sugars in their stems during the inflorescence offering greater drought resistance ability than maize zegada lizarazu et al 2012 the higher productivity of sweet sorghum under natural rainfall conditions could account for the higher water uptake capacity schittenhelm and schroetter 2014 4 2 soil water use of the forage crops the amount of soil water consumption within the different soil depths was different in the various forage crops this study suggested that the decreasing of soil water content of forage maize was mainly concentrated in the 0 150 cm soil layers while for the sweet sorghum and sudangrass it was mainly observed in the 0 100 cm soil layers in 2018 moreover forage crops used water from the whole soil profile up to 200 cm depth in 2017 that may be due to the higher rainfall and lower average monthly temperature in 2017 than in 2018 fig 1 furthermore there was no fertilizer in either year and thus forage crops that were grown in 2017 might have a higher level of nutrition to use being residual from previous land management activities the nutrient limited conditions were more severe in 2018 which restricted the soil water use of the forage crops results from the two years showed that the soil water consumption of forage maize was higher than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass furthermore this study showed that the average daily evapotranspiration etd of forage maize was 10 and 14 higher than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass respectively this finding also indicated that the stored soil water usage was higher in the forage maize these results are of interest if we consider that potential evapotranspiration is generally higher than rainfall in semi arid regions huang et al 2018 and soil water loss through evaporation is higher than transpiration in the 0 60 cm soil layers liu et al 2015 the canopy radiation interception is highly related to the leaf area dercas and liakatas 2007 few studies have indicated that the leaf area index of sorghum is higher than that of maize skerikova et al 2018 in this study the plant density of forage maize was lower than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass and the evaporation in the forage maize could be higher than that in the sweet sorghum and sudangrass other factors that affect soil water content and should be included in further studies in the loess plateau are the slope orientation sunlight and shade and local changes in the predominant type of soil lópez vicente et al 2009 4 3 nutritional quality and in vitro dry matter digestibility of the forage crops the nutritional quality are vital standards to evaluate the crop s feeding value and water shortage has negative effects on crops nutritional content hadebe et al 2016 in this study the samples for analyzing nutritional quality were collected during the second year of successive cropping the second growing year was drier and without fertilizer and thus compared with the first year the soil fertility decreased therefore our results reflected the forage quality under relatively poor agronomic conditions this study indicated that except for higher ivdmd and lower ndf and adf content of sudangrass the nutrient compositions were similar among the different evaluated forage crops indicating that the nutritive values of sweet sorghum and maize were not different moreover and compared with sweet sorghum sudangrass had the lowest cp content it is known that the voluntary intake is positively related to cp and in vivo digestibility and negatively connected to ndf jensen et al 2017 hence the feed intake and palatability are lower for sweet sorghum and maize compared to sudangrass but it has higher cp content the comprehensive analysis of the results showed that the yield ndf and adf content of sweet sorghum was the highest fig 7 sudangrass had the highest ivdmd and the lowest soil water consumption and forage maize presented the highest soil water consumption these results indicated that forage maize consumed more water than the other forage species and it had the less productivity hence the planting of sweet sorghum might be a better choice in drylands in order to obtain the higher biomass at a lower soil water consumption level however prussic acid poisoning is an important issue for the rational utilization of forage crops how will livestock utilize the forage reasonably and securely is an important topic that should be included in further studies 5 conclusions global drylands are extensive and widely used for animal husbandry improving the quality productivity and drought tolerance of forage crops is a means of improving forage production and favoring long term sustainability of resources the cp content among the three crops were not significantly different and the content of ndf and adf of sudangrass were lower than that of sweet sorghum and forage maize the results indicated that the soil water consumption of sudangrass was the lowest and followed by that of sweet sorghum while forage maize presented the highest consumption moreover the yield of sweet sorghum was obviously higher than that of forage maize and sudangrass overall sweet sorghum had a higher yield less soil water consumption and similar nutritional quality compared to forage maize and therefore it appears as an advisable option for improving forage yield in the soil water limited semi arid regions sweet sorghum can help improve forage productivity and ensure food security in drylands over cultivation of forage maize this study was limited to one site in the loess plateau and more study areas in china and abroad should be included to generate and analyze larger databases in order to refine and obtain sound conclusions declaration of competing

10474,drought tolerant forage crops have huge development potential in drylands taking into account the current global challenges climate change natural resources overexploitation and increasing food demand however little is known about the trade off among yield nutritional quality and soil water consumption for dryland forage farming production in semi arid regions this research compared the two year yield and soil water consumption characteristics of sweet sorghum sorghum dochna sudangrass sorghum sudanense and forage maize zea mays under natural rainfall condition the soil water content up to 200 cm soil depth at 10 cm intervals and dry matter yield of the different forage crops were evaluated in a set of plots in 2017 and 2018 and the nutritional quality of these crops were measured in 2018 three replicate plots were established for each forage crop results showed that the neutral detergent fiber ndf and acid detergent fiber adf contents of sudangrass were significantly lower than those of sweet sorghum and forage maize p 0 05 sudangrass presented the higher in vitro dry matter digestibility coefficient ivdmd the yield of sweet sorghum was significantly higher than that of sudangrass and forage maize different soil water consumption patterns were observed among the forage crops happening mostly in the 0 150 cm soil layer in the forage maize plots and in the 0 100 cm soil layer in the sweet sorghum and sudangrass plots the average daily evapotranspiration etd of forage maize was about 10 and 15 higher than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass respectively forage sorghum presented the highest yield less soil water consumption and similar nutritional quality to forage maize and thus it is an advisable option for forage production in the soil water limited semi arid regions keywords dryland farming forage precipitation utilization efficiency soil water consumption yield nutritional quality 1 introduction rising living standards are resulting in an increasing demand for meat the human food demand is estimated to double by 2050 owing to the population growth and an increasing meat intensive diet mueller et al 2012 therefore the need for dryland forage farming production has been further accentuated the combination of increasing crop yield demand and pronounced land degradation is placing unprecedented pressure on the current agricultural and natural resources worldwide wu and ma 2015 d amour et al 2007 vargas pineda et al 2020 the effects of climate change higher frequency of extreme events changes in rainfall patterns global warming on crop productivity are a further and serious threat bishopp and lynch 2015 godfray et al 2010 therefore there is a primary challenge to meet the current and expected growing forage demand with minimal negative environmental impacts by means of maximizing productivity under variable climatic conditions grassini and cassman 2012 tilman et al 2011 this challenge is greater in arid and semi arid regions where water scarcity is common these regions account for about 40 of the world s land surface and global warming may cause a further expansion of these areas huang et al 2017 on the other hand ferner et al 2018 have indicated that livestock husbandry is the most important agricultural activity in global drylands thus forage crops in these regions play an important role in the global forage production however water shortage is the most important limiting factor for plant productivity and these conditions may become more severe owing to global warming zhang et al 2006 sun et al 2017 due to the lack of water resources in these agro ecosystems most forage fields are not irrigated and thus are managed under rainfed conditions elliott et al 2014 hadebe et al 2016 forage crops including nonfood biomass from maize and sorghum crops are an important part of forage for livestock herrero et al 2010 forage maize is a main source of feed and it occupies an important position in the world s agricultural production owing to their high productivity and drought tolerance sorghum and sudangrass are also used for forage in semi arid regions moreover dercas and liakatas 2007 observed that sweet sorghum has a high above ground dry biomass among the c4 hatch slack carbon fixation pathway crops under unlimited water conditions therefore forage sorghum sudangrass and forage maize have broad development and utilization prospects in livestock husbandry in arid and semi arid regions crop yield and nutritional quality are important plant traits to evaluate the value and suitability of forages miron et al 2007 yield reflects the potential ability of plants to accumulate dry matter the utilization ratio of energy transformed from forage constituents by animals is usually denoted as the forage feeding value wang et al 2016 the in vitro dry matter digestibility ivdmd coefficient is one of the most critical characters of forages high ivdmd values and reduced lignin contents are the main selection criteria to identify forage crops of high nutritional quality casler 2001 a higher neutral detergent fiber ndf digestibility of forages is beneficial to increase feed intake and thus the yields of milk and protein of dairy cows ferraretto and shaver 2015 the ndf contains celluloses hemicelluloses and lignins while acid detergent fiber adf is the residual of ndf obtained through acid detergent treatment the residue includes cellulose and lignins cardinal et al 2003 the contents of ndf and adf have a crucial influence on forage digestibility therefore the forage nutritional quality and digestibility levels are the most important factors to select forage crops many studies have investigated the yield and nutritive value of forage crops dercas and liakatas 2007 zhang et al 2006 elliott et al 2014 however these studies mainly evaluated single issues such as drought tolerance schittenhelm and schroetter 2014 hadebe et al 2016 water use efficiency zegada lizarazu et al 2012 and forage value miron et al 2007 a number of studies have been focused on the nutritive value of the plants but the effects of soil water on forage yields were based on irrigated conditions and thus results cannot be extrapolated to rainfed agriculture dercas and liakatas 2007 li et al 2015 varzi and oad 2018 nevertheless rainfall is the only source for soil water in many arid and semi arid regions such as the study area in this study which is located in the loess plateau china therefore a good understanding of yield nutritional quality and soil water consumption characteristics of different forage crops would be conductive to improve the dryland forage farming production in water limited regions maize is the traditional primary crop in the study area while as forage there is still the necessity of evaluating whether it has the advantage in yield and water saving thus it is important to seek the optimum balance between nutritional value biomass and water consumption of the different forage crops that are cultivated in the loess plateau where water is a limited resource the hypothesis of this work is that sweet sorghum may have a higher yield and nutritional quality and higher water use efficiency compared with the other main forage species to test this hypothesis we measured the dry matter yield nutritional quality and soil water content up to 200 cm soil depth of sweet sorghum sorghum dochna sudangrass sorghum sudanense and forage maize zea mays plots in a comparative way under natural rainfall conditions and during two years 2017 and 2018 this study aims to determine whether sweet sorghum has yield nutritional quality and water use advantages over other common dryland forage farming crops in a semi arid rainfed cropland 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

experiment with sparse rainfall and intense evaporation soil water shortage generally existed during the growing season taking into account that soil water availability is the major factor limiting sustainable forage growth especially in dryland farming it is essential to evaluate the production capacity of forage crops under limited water resources which may contribute to the optimal choice of the forage species 4 1 dry matter yield and water use efficiency of the forage crops in this study and among the forage crops sweet sorghum stood out for its performance in terms of yield under natural rainfall condition this result was consistent with the previous research made by varzi and oad 2018 and miron et al 2007 regarding the soil water consumption forage maize was the highest followed by sweet sorghum being sudangrass the lowest these results indicated that compared with other forages crops sweet sorghum could acquire more yield with similar values of soil water consumption miron et al 2007 reported that to acquire more biomass maize requires over two times as much water as sweet sorghum does furthermore many studies have found that the yields of sorghum and maize were not significantly different under water sufficient condition while the yield of sorghum was higher than that of maize under drought stress e g schittenhelm and schroetter 2014 these studies showed that compared with sorghum maize requires more soil water and sweet sorghum has higher capacity to sustain the optimum yield under drought conditions zegada lizarazu et al 2012 prażak 2016 that fact may be explained by the higher and more stable water use efficiency wue of sorghum crop compared to the wue of maize hadebe et al 2016 this study indicated that water use efficiency wue of sweet sorghum was the highest compared with 2017 the precipitation decreased approximately 30 in 2018 while the yield of sweet sorghum increased by 30 and as expected the yield of maize decreased by 52 zegada lizarazu et al 2012 indicated that under drought stress the yield of sweet sorghum and maize was reduced by approximately 38 and 47 respectively while the water use efficiency of sweet sorghum was increased by 20 and reduced by 5 in maize the higher water use efficiency of crops could improve their drought tolerance hund et al 2009 moreover sweet sorghum can accumulate large amounts of sugars in their stems during the inflorescence offering greater drought resistance ability than maize zegada lizarazu et al 2012 the higher productivity of sweet sorghum under natural rainfall conditions could account for the higher water uptake capacity schittenhelm and schroetter 2014 4 2 soil water use of the forage crops the amount of soil water consumption within the different soil depths was different in the various forage crops this study suggested that the decreasing of soil water content of forage maize was mainly concentrated in the 0 150 cm soil layers while for the sweet sorghum and sudangrass it was mainly observed in the 0 100 cm soil layers in 2018 moreover forage crops used water from the whole soil profile up to 200 cm depth in 2017 that may be due to the higher rainfall and lower average monthly temperature in 2017 than in 2018 fig 1 furthermore there was no fertilizer in either year and thus forage crops that were grown in 2017 might have a higher level of nutrition to use being residual from previous land management activities the nutrient limited conditions were more severe in 2018 which restricted the soil water use of the forage crops results from the two years showed that the soil water consumption of forage maize was higher than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass furthermore this study showed that the average daily evapotranspiration etd of forage maize was 10 and 14 higher than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass respectively this finding also indicated that the stored soil water usage was higher in the forage maize these results are of interest if we consider that potential evapotranspiration is generally higher than rainfall in semi arid regions huang et al 2018 and soil water loss through evaporation is higher than transpiration in the 0 60 cm soil layers liu et al 2015 the canopy radiation interception is highly related to the leaf area dercas and liakatas 2007 few studies have indicated that the leaf area index of sorghum is higher than that of maize skerikova et al 2018 in this study the plant density of forage maize was lower than that of sweet sorghum and sudangrass and the evaporation in the forage maize could be higher than that in the sweet sorghum and sudangrass other factors that affect soil water content and should be included in further studies in the loess plateau are the slope orientation sunlight and shade and local changes in the predominant type of soil lópez vicente et al 2009 4 3 nutritional quality and in vitro dry matter digestibility of the forage crops the nutritional quality are vital standards to evaluate the crop s feeding value and water shortage has negative effects on crops nutritional content hadebe et al 2016 in this study the samples for analyzing nutritional quality were collected during the second year of successive cropping the second growing year was drier and without fertilizer and thus compared with the first year the soil fertility decreased therefore our results reflected the forage quality under relatively poor agronomic conditions this study indicated that except for higher ivdmd and lower ndf and adf content of sudangrass the nutrient compositions were similar among the different evaluated forage crops indicating that the nutritive values of sweet sorghum and maize were not different moreover and compared with sweet sorghum sudangrass had the lowest cp content it is known that the voluntary intake is positively related to cp and in vivo digestibility and negatively connected to ndf jensen et al 2017 hence the feed intake and palatability are lower for sweet sorghum and maize compared to sudangrass but it has higher cp content the comprehensive analysis of the results showed that the yield ndf and adf content of sweet sorghum was the highest fig 7 sudangrass had the highest ivdmd and the lowest soil water consumption and forage maize presented the highest soil water consumption these results indicated that forage maize consumed more water than the other forage species and it had the less productivity hence the planting of sweet sorghum might be a better choice in drylands in order to obtain the higher biomass at a lower soil water consumption level however prussic acid poisoning is an important issue for the rational utilization of forage crops how will livestock utilize the forage reasonably and securely is an important topic that should be included in further studies 5 conclusions global drylands are extensive and widely used for animal husbandry improving the quality productivity and drought tolerance of forage crops is a means of improving forage production and favoring long term sustainability of resources the cp content among the three crops were not significantly different and the content of ndf and adf of sudangrass were lower than that of sweet sorghum and forage maize the results indicated that the soil water consumption of sudangrass was the lowest and followed by that of sweet sorghum while forage maize presented the highest consumption moreover the yield of sweet sorghum was obviously higher than that of forage maize and sudangrass overall sweet sorghum had a higher yield less soil water consumption and similar nutritional quality compared to forage maize and therefore it appears as an advisable option for improving forage yield in the soil water limited semi arid regions sweet sorghum can help improve forage productivity and ensure food security in drylands over cultivation of forage maize this study was limited to one site in the loess plateau and more study areas in china and abroad should be included to generate and analyze larger databases in order to refine and obtain sound conclusions declaration of competing
