gumara 11 30 n 12 13 n and 38 25 e 37 30 e watersheds are located in the tana sub basin of the blue nile basin gilgel abay starts with a small spring in the western part of the ethiopian highland at elevation of 3 000 m and meanders 140 km before entering lake tana gumara watershed starts on one of the highest mountain in the country mount guna the gauged area extracted from a 30 m resolution shuttle radar topographic mission srtm digital elevation model dem is 1 650 km2 for gilgel abay and 1 284 km2 for gumara fig 1 indicates the drainage pattern and the monitoring stations of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds the watersheds have a complex topography with significant elevation variation ranging from 1890 to 3530 m in gilgel abay and 1800 to 3710m in gumara the slope varies between zero to 140 with an average value of 12 for gilgel abay and 17 for gumara the land use and soil map of the study watersheds were collected from the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and electricity both watersheds are dominated by agricultural land the dominant soils in gilgel abay are luvisols and alisols covering approximately 56 and 40 of the watershed respectively approximately 87 of gumara watershed is dominated with luvisols both luvisols and alisols have a higher clay content in the subsoil than in the topsoil michéli et al 2006 both watersheds have a largest surface irrigation potential compared to the sub basins in the lake tana watershed worqlul et al 2015b rainfall in the study area on average varies between 1300 and 2300mm 1994 2013 the main rainfall season called kremt in local language from may to september accounts for up to 80 90 of the annual rainfall 2 2 climate and discharge data meteorological and hydrological data for 2010 2013 were collected from the ethiopian national meteorological agency nma and ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and electricity emwie respectively this time range was selected due to its coincidence with the mpeg data availability daily rainfall data were collected from six nearby stations dangila adet injibara bahir dar debre tabor and mekane yesus fig 1 minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity wind speed and daily sunshine hour were available from dangila bahir dara and debre tabor stations the two rivers selected gilgel abay and gumara have relatively quality data in the region the average monthly flow of gilgel abay and gumara rivers indicated a higher correlation coefficient of 0 96 however gilgel abay annual average flow is approximately 1 6 times gumara river flow since 2006 dry season flow of gilgel abay has shifted significantly but the wet season flow did not show a significant variation compared to 1980 to 2005 flow enku et al 2014 2 3 mpeg data multi sensor precipitation estimate geostationary mpeg is produced by the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat meteorological product extraction facility mpef mpeg was created by blending rain rates derived from special sensor microwave imager ssm i on board the us dmsp satellite with brightness temperature from infrared channel of mtp meteosat satellites heinemann and kerényi 2003 the data are freely available through the geonetcast near real time satellite based data dissemination system wale et al 2011 worqlul et al 2014 mpeg data is available at 3km spatial resolution and 15 minute interval since 2010 the mpeg satellite rainfall estimate from mpef was downloaded from the international institute for geo information science and earth observation itc ftp server and from bahir dar university geonetcast reception station for this study daily mpeg rainfall estimate of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds were constructed for the study period from 2010 to 2013 2 4 methods the mpeg sre was used as forcing to a hbv semi distributed hydrologic model to capture the observed flow of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds three steps followed in this study are outlined below first the areal mpeg satellite rainfall estimate was compared to areal gauged rainfall data for 2010 2013 the comparison was done on monthly basis to determine how accurately the mpeg rainfall captures the pattern and volume of gauged rainfall second the bias associated with the mpeg data was corrected using a linear monthly correction coefficient the correction coefficient was adjusted until the volume of monthly mpeg sre and gauged rainfall data match a one year delay in the release of hydrological and meteorological data makes it practically difficult to establish a correction factor for a current year data therefore to make use of the near real time mpeg data the long term average correction coefficients of the watersheds were developed instead the mean monthly gauge rainfall was calculated by aggregating the daily areal gauge rainfall the point data was converted to areal rainfall using inverse distance interpolation idw idw assumes that the value of the unsampled is the weighted average of the sampled values within the neighborhood and the weights are inversely related to the distance between the prediction location and the sampled location similarly mean monthly areal mpeg data are calculated by aggregating the daily satellite grid rainfall products third the gauged original and bias corrected mpeg rainfall products were used in forcing hbv hydrologic model to reproduce observed flow of gilgel abay and gumara through model parameter calibration the model performance was evaluated using multiple objective functions the performance of bias corrected mpeg sre was also cross validated by using as input to the gauged rainfall calibrated model in this case the calibrated model parameter sets obtained using the gauged rainfall data was used to simulate the observed flow of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds forced with bias corrected mpeg rainfall 2 4 1 bias correction some of the errors associated with satellite rainfall are consistent under predictions missing seasonal variation worqlul et al 2014 and a low or higher number of dry days piani et al 2010 model parameter values obtained using biased sre as forcing might not yield reliable estimate of watershed characteristics behrangi et al 2011 bitew et al 2012 therefore understanding and correcting the bias associated within sre is a necessity step bias correction may vary from simple additive correction berg et al 2012 to a more complex histogram matching that can correct multiple moments of the distribution of a variable at a time haerter et al 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2012a in this study the bias of mpeg rainfall was corrected by applying a monthly multiplicative correction coefficients the correction coefficients applied was to match the volume of monthly mpeg with the monthly gauged rainfall eq 1 1 p corrmpeg i p mpeg i p obsmi p mpegmi where p corrmpeg i is the daily bias corrected mpeg rainfall p mpeg i and p mpegmi are the daily and monthly average original mpeg rainfalls respectively and p obsmi is the monthly average gauge rainfall 2 4 2 hbv model the hbv hydrologic model lindström et al 1997 is a conceptual semi distributed rainfall runoff model for streamflow simulation the hbv model consists of subroutines for soil moisture accounting procedure runoff generation and a simple routing procedure the soil moisture accounting routine is based on three parameters beta fc and lp smhi 2006 beta controls the contribution to the response function from each millimeter of rainfall fc is the maximum soil moisture storage the limit for potential evaporation lp dictates a soil moisture value above which evaporation reaches its potential the runoff generation routine transforms excess water from the soil moisture zone into runoff this routine consists of an upper non linear and a lower linear reservoir connected by percolation parameter perc khq and k4 are recession coefficients of the upper and lower reservoir respectively alfa is the measure of non linearity of the upper reservoir and it is used to fit the higher peaks into the observed hydrograph a complete description of the model can be found in various literatures lindström et al 1997 smhi 2006 in hbv the watershed is subdivided into sub basins and further into different elevation and land use zones the hydrological and climate input data for flow simulation includes daily rainfall temperature observed flow and long term average monthly potential evapotranspiration long term potential evaporation was estimated by using the penman combination equation using data from dangila station for gilgel abay and bahir dara and debre tabor were used for gumara a 30m dem was used to delineate watershed area draining to the gauging site of the watersheds and divide the watersheds into sub basins and elevations zones 2 4 3 model calibration and validation prior to model calibration the minimum and maximum model parameter space were determined from literature and based on our local knowledge optimized model parameters sets of rientjes et al 2011 and wale et al 2009 were used to initialize the models for model calibration the most sensitive model parameters listed in smhi 2006 controlling the volume and shape of the hydrograph were selected the initialised models were calibrated first for volume controlling parameters fc lp beta and khq followed by shape controlling parameters alfa k4 and perc the hbv model was calibrated for all rainfall products gauge original mpeg and bias corrected mpeg independently due to data limitation a one year data i e 2013 was used to validate the calibrated model parameters 2 4 4 statistical analysis the performance of the model was evaluated using multiple objective functions including percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r square pbias calculates the relative volume difference between simulated and observed volume a negative value indicates over prediction and a positive value indicates under prediction of simulation a pbias value of zero might not mean a perfect simulation since the distribution through time is not considered nse is the normalized statistic that describes the relative magnitude of residual variance compared to the observed flow variance nse indicates how well the plot between observed and simulated flow fits the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 nse value between 0 6 and 0 8 is considered fair to good and values greater than 0 8 are considered very good r square evaluates the degree of linear association between observed and simulated flow for a

rainfall of gauged rainfall of gilgel abay and gumara were estimated by inverse distance interpolation method for mpeg data the areal rainfall was determined by aggregating 15 minutes interval rainfall data to daily monthly gauged areal rainfall were well correlated with the mpeg satellite rainfall for both watersheds correlation coefficient greater than 0 78 fig 2 a and b mpeg rainfall explained 81 and 78 of the ground rainfall variation of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds respectively however despite the good correlation with observed rainfall pattern mpeg sre underestimated the gauged rainfall of both watershed by about approximately 60 thus the consistent bias with a high correlation mpeg sre can be adjusted using a linear bias correction coefficient 3 2 performance of bias corrected mpeg data the mpeg data was corrected to match the monthly gauged rainfall amounts of gauged rainfall using a monthly correction coefficients fig 3 shows the difference between original and bias corrected mpeg from the gauged rainfall data for gilgel abay 2010 2013 on a daily basis throughout the study period the original daily mpeg areal rainfall product was less than the gauged areal rainfall for more than 87 of the time fig 3 after bias correction approximately 63 of the daily events have a rainfall record less than the gauged record the annual cumulative rainfall plot for 2010 fig 4 a and b for both watersheds indicated that the bias corrected mpeg rainfall estimate predicts the cumulative gauged rainfall very well for both watersheds fig 5 shows the correction coefficients of the mpeg data on a monthly basis for the main rainfall season the monthly mean bias correction coefficients of mpeg data compared over the study period indicated a similar value for the main rainy season from may to september which accounts 80 90 of the annual rainfall the monthly correction coefficients for the dry season have a significant variation as both satellite and gauged rainfall products have poor performance in capturing lower rainfall amounts berg et al 2012 toté et al 2015 the line in fig 5 indicates the average values of the monthly average correction coefficients the average values correction coefficients can be used to correct the near real time mpeg data for further use this is especially useful in the ethiopian context where gauged rainfall data usually takes up to a year or more to be available for commercial use due to delays in data entry moving and sharing procedures 3 3 discharge simulation with gauged rainfall original mpeg and bias corrected mpeg data the hbv model was calibrated for gauge rainfall as well as original and bias corrected mpeg sre independently prior to calibration the parameter space minimum and maximum values were specified to represent the watershed conditions based on literature and local knowledge hbv model was initialized with the optimal model parameter sets of rientjes et al 2011 and wale et al 2009 the initialized hbv model was further fine tuned systematically by first calibrating the volume controlling parameters and then fine tuning the shape controlling parameters the shape controlling parameters influence the shape of the hydrograph by distributing the calculated discharge over time the list of sensitive parameters controlling volume and shape of the hydrograph are tabulated in seibert and vis 2012 smhi 2006 wale et al 2009 in tables 1 and 2 the optimized model parameter sets and model performance of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds calibrated with gauged original and bias corrected mpeg rainfall are tabulated the performance of the simulated flow using gauged and bias corrected mpeg sre indicated a fair to good performance for both watersheds in gilgel abay gauged and bias corrected mpeg indicated a nsh of 0 78 and 0 80 respectively and a pbias of less than 10 table 1 fig 6 a figs 7 and 8 a the gauged and bias corrected rainfall resulted in a comparable model performance in gumara watershed with nse of 0 78 and 0 79 table 2 fig 6b fig 8a and b both watershed models validated for independent gauge and bias corrected rainfall indicated acceptable result with a minimum of 0 8 nse with a nse of 0 16 and a 70 pbias for gilgel abay and nse of 0 22 and pbias of 69 4 for gumara watershed the original mpeg sre performance was poor in simulating the observed flow figs 7b and 8b the fitted model parameter sets of gauged rainfall and corrected mpeg data were close except for fc and khq for gilgel abay and in gumara a minor difference was observed in perc the result of simple sensitivity analysis done by sequentially changing one model parameter value while keeping others at their optimal value indicated that fc and khq were the most sensitive model parameters and lp and beta parameters were less sensitive while the model parameters alfa k4 and perc were the least sensitive even though the percolation parameter perc which links the upper and lower reservoir was kept at the maximum value the model did not capture the dry season flow of gilgel abay very well fig 9a otherwise the model has captured the rising and recession of the hydrograph of both watersheds for the gauged and bias corrected mpeg data although the effort made to get the rating curve data of gilgel abay at the emwie was not successful we recommend a further examination of the dry season flow october may after 2006 as it has increased significantly by 200 compared to the long term average from 1980 to 2005 fig 9b shows the comparison daily simulated and observed flow of gilgel abay 3 4 cross validation of bias corrected mpeg data the calibrated model parameter sets obtained using the gauged rainfall data were used to validate the flow prediction performance of bias corrected mpeg data comparison of calibrated model parameters using gauged rainfall and bias corrected mpeg data are listed in tables 1 and 2 for gilgel abay and gumara respectively except for the fc khq and lp for gilgel abay and perc for gumara other parameters have identical values the bias corrected mpeg dataset has a higher fc for gilgel abay watershed indicating a larger active soil layer that store water and emptied by evaporation which is clearly attributed to the stronger effect of the linear multiplication correction coefficient which has a larger effect on the higher mpeg rainfall values the bias correction has a higher scaling effect on the extreme precipitation events than the dry season rainfall berg et al 2012 leander and buishand 2007 simulation of bias corrected mpeg rainfall estimate using gauged rainfall parameters perform well for both watersheds with nse value of 0 74 and with acceptable pbias value of 8 for gilgel abay and nse of 0 78 and pbias of 10 for gumara watershed in capturing the observed flow 2010 2013 4 conclusions rainfall is a major input to hydrological models its spatial and temporal variability is prohibitively difficult to represent using traditional ground gauging stations while sres using various remote sensing techniques are freely available for use their potential to study hydrologic processes and or assess water resources potential at watershed scale is not thoroughly explored in this research we evaluated the rainfall volume estimation performance of mpeg rainfall products using in situ rainfall measurements the performance of a hbv model forced using mpeg rainfall products is also used to evaluate the rainfall product performance in simulating the observed flow of two watersheds in the upper blue nile basin ethiopia our results indicated that mpeg sres are prone to systematic error understanding and correcting the bias associated within should be a mandatory procedure in using them as forcing to a hydrological model the mpeg rainfall estimate compared with the gauged rainfall data indicated a higher correlation coefficient in capturing 81 and 78 of the gauged rainfall variation in gilgel abay and gumara watersheds respectively however in comparison to gauged rainfall measurements mpeg sres consistently under predicts rainfall volume by about 60 the bias corrected mpeg data captured the volume on monthly basis while capturing 81 and 78 of the gauged rainfall variation for gilgel abay and gumara respectively the performance of bias corrected mpeg data was validated by its predictive ability of the observed flow of gilgel abay and gumara daily observed flow though model calibration the result indicated that the performance of the mpeg data performed as good as the gauged rainfall simulation for both watersheds the performance of bias corrected mpeg data validated with gauged rainfall model parameters has also performed well in capturing the observed flow of both watersheds these hydrologic models performance indicates the potential of mpeg sre in water budget studies after applying a linear bias correction the long term mean monthly mpeg rainfall correction coefficients estimated from 2010 to 2013 indicated a consistent value especially for the rainy season the average of mpeg correction coefficients can be used to correct the bias of mpeg data where there is limited

in local language from may to september accounts for up to 80 90 of the annual rainfall 2 2 climate and discharge data meteorological and hydrological data for 2010 2013 were collected from the ethiopian national meteorological agency nma and ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and electricity emwie respectively this time range was selected due to its coincidence with the mpeg data availability daily rainfall data were collected from six nearby stations dangila adet injibara bahir dar debre tabor and mekane yesus fig 1 minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity wind speed and daily sunshine hour were available from dangila bahir dara and debre tabor stations the two rivers selected gilgel abay and gumara have relatively quality data in the region the average monthly flow of gilgel abay and gumara rivers indicated a higher correlation coefficient of 0 96 however gilgel abay annual average flow is approximately 1 6 times gumara river flow since 2006 dry season flow of gilgel abay has shifted significantly but the wet season flow did not show a significant variation compared to 1980 to 2005 flow enku et al 2014 2 3 mpeg data multi sensor precipitation estimate geostationary mpeg is produced by the european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat meteorological product extraction facility mpef mpeg was created by blending rain rates derived from special sensor microwave imager ssm i on board the us dmsp satellite with brightness temperature from infrared channel of mtp meteosat satellites heinemann and kerényi 2003 the data are freely available through the geonetcast near real time satellite based data dissemination system wale et al 2011 worqlul et al 2014 mpeg data is available at 3km spatial resolution and 15 minute interval since 2010 the mpeg satellite rainfall estimate from mpef was downloaded from the international institute for geo information science and earth observation itc ftp server and from bahir dar university geonetcast reception station for this study daily mpeg rainfall estimate of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds were constructed for the study period from 2010 to 2013 2 4 methods the mpeg sre was used as forcing to a hbv semi distributed hydrologic model to capture the observed flow of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds three steps followed in this study are outlined below first the areal mpeg satellite rainfall estimate was compared to areal gauged rainfall data for 2010 2013 the comparison was done on monthly basis to determine how accurately the mpeg rainfall captures the pattern and volume of gauged rainfall second the bias associated with the mpeg data was corrected using a linear monthly correction coefficient the correction coefficient was adjusted until the volume of monthly mpeg sre and gauged rainfall data match a one year delay in the release of hydrological and meteorological data makes it practically difficult to establish a correction factor for a current year data therefore to make use of the near real time mpeg data the long term average correction coefficients of the watersheds were developed instead the mean monthly gauge rainfall was calculated by aggregating the daily areal gauge rainfall the point data was converted to areal rainfall using inverse distance interpolation idw idw assumes that the value of the unsampled is the weighted average of the sampled values within the neighborhood and the weights are inversely related to the distance between the prediction location and the sampled location similarly mean monthly areal mpeg data are calculated by aggregating the daily satellite grid rainfall products third the gauged original and bias corrected mpeg rainfall products were used in forcing hbv hydrologic model to reproduce observed flow of gilgel abay and gumara through model parameter calibration the model performance was evaluated using multiple objective functions the performance of bias corrected mpeg sre was also cross validated by using as input to the gauged rainfall calibrated model in this case the calibrated model parameter sets obtained using the gauged rainfall data was used to simulate the observed flow of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds forced with bias corrected mpeg rainfall 2 4 1 bias correction some of the errors associated with satellite rainfall are consistent under predictions missing seasonal variation worqlul et al 2014 and a low or higher number of dry days piani et al 2010 model parameter values obtained using biased sre as forcing might not yield reliable estimate of watershed characteristics behrangi et al 2011 bitew et al 2012 therefore understanding and correcting the bias associated within sre is a necessity step bias correction may vary from simple additive correction berg et al 2012 to a more complex histogram matching that can correct multiple moments of the distribution of a variable at a time haerter et al 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2012a in this study the bias of mpeg rainfall was corrected by applying a monthly multiplicative correction coefficients the correction coefficients applied was to match the volume of monthly mpeg with the monthly gauged rainfall eq 1 1 p corrmpeg i p mpeg i p obsmi p mpegmi where p corrmpeg i is the daily bias corrected mpeg rainfall p mpeg i and p mpegmi are the daily and monthly average original mpeg rainfalls respectively and p obsmi is the monthly average gauge rainfall 2 4 2 hbv model the hbv hydrologic model lindström et al 1997 is a conceptual semi distributed rainfall runoff model for streamflow simulation the hbv model consists of subroutines for soil moisture accounting procedure runoff generation and a simple routing procedure the soil moisture accounting routine is based on three parameters beta fc and lp smhi 2006 beta controls the contribution to the response function from each millimeter of rainfall fc is the maximum soil moisture storage the limit for potential evaporation lp dictates a soil moisture value above which evaporation reaches its potential the runoff generation routine transforms excess water from the soil moisture zone into runoff this routine consists of an upper non linear and a lower linear reservoir connected by percolation parameter perc khq and k4 are recession coefficients of the upper and lower reservoir respectively alfa is the measure of non linearity of the upper reservoir and it is used to fit the higher peaks into the observed hydrograph a complete description of the model can be found in various literatures lindström et al 1997 smhi 2006 in hbv the watershed is subdivided into sub basins and further into different elevation and land use zones the hydrological and climate input data for flow simulation includes daily rainfall temperature observed flow and long term average monthly potential evapotranspiration long term potential evaporation was estimated by using the penman combination equation using data from dangila station for gilgel abay and bahir dara and debre tabor were used for gumara a 30m dem was used to delineate watershed area draining to the gauging site of the watersheds and divide the watersheds into sub basins and elevations zones 2 4 3 model calibration and validation prior to model calibration the minimum and maximum model parameter space were determined from literature and based on our local knowledge optimized model parameters sets of rientjes et al 2011 and wale et al 2009 were used to initialize the models for model calibration the most sensitive model parameters listed in smhi 2006 controlling the volume and shape of the hydrograph were selected the initialised models were calibrated first for volume controlling parameters fc lp beta and khq followed by shape controlling parameters alfa k4 and perc the hbv model was calibrated for all rainfall products gauge original mpeg and bias corrected mpeg independently due to data limitation a one year data i e 2013 was used to validate the calibrated model parameters 2 4 4 statistical analysis the performance of the model was evaluated using multiple objective functions including percent bias pbias nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r square pbias calculates the relative volume difference between simulated and observed volume a negative value indicates over prediction and a positive value indicates under prediction of simulation a pbias value of zero might not mean a perfect simulation since the distribution through time is not considered nse is the normalized statistic that describes the relative magnitude of residual variance compared to the observed flow variance nse indicates how well the plot between observed and simulated flow fits the 1 1 line moriasi et al 2007 nse value between 0 6 and 0 8 is considered fair to good and values greater than 0 8 are considered very good r square evaluates the degree of linear association between observed and simulated flow for a

rainfall of gauged rainfall of gilgel abay and gumara were estimated by inverse distance interpolation method for mpeg data the areal rainfall was determined by aggregating 15 minutes interval rainfall data to daily monthly gauged areal rainfall were well correlated with the mpeg satellite rainfall for both watersheds correlation coefficient greater than 0 78 fig 2 a and b mpeg rainfall explained 81 and 78 of the ground rainfall variation of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds respectively however despite the good correlation with observed rainfall pattern mpeg sre underestimated the gauged rainfall of both watershed by about approximately 60 thus the consistent bias with a high correlation mpeg sre can be adjusted using a linear bias correction coefficient 3 2 performance of bias corrected mpeg data the mpeg data was corrected to match the monthly gauged rainfall amounts of gauged rainfall using a monthly correction coefficients fig 3 shows the difference between original and bias corrected mpeg from the gauged rainfall data for gilgel abay 2010 2013 on a daily basis throughout the study period the original daily mpeg areal rainfall product was less than the gauged areal rainfall for more than 87 of the time fig 3 after bias correction approximately 63 of the daily events have a rainfall record less than the gauged record the annual cumulative rainfall plot for 2010 fig 4 a and b for both watersheds indicated that the bias corrected mpeg rainfall estimate predicts the cumulative gauged rainfall very well for both watersheds fig 5 shows the correction coefficients of the mpeg data on a monthly basis for the main rainfall season the monthly mean bias correction coefficients of mpeg data compared over the study period indicated a similar value for the main rainy season from may to september which accounts 80 90 of the annual rainfall the monthly correction coefficients for the dry season have a significant variation as both satellite and gauged rainfall products have poor performance in capturing lower rainfall amounts berg et al 2012 toté et al 2015 the line in fig 5 indicates the average values of the monthly average correction coefficients the average values correction coefficients can be used to correct the near real time mpeg data for further use this is especially useful in the ethiopian context where gauged rainfall data usually takes up to a year or more to be available for commercial use due to delays in data entry moving and sharing procedures 3 3 discharge simulation with gauged rainfall original mpeg and bias corrected mpeg data the hbv model was calibrated for gauge rainfall as well as original and bias corrected mpeg sre independently prior to calibration the parameter space minimum and maximum values were specified to represent the watershed conditions based on literature and local knowledge hbv model was initialized with the optimal model parameter sets of rientjes et al 2011 and wale et al 2009 the initialized hbv model was further fine tuned systematically by first calibrating the volume controlling parameters and then fine tuning the shape controlling parameters the shape controlling parameters influence the shape of the hydrograph by distributing the calculated discharge over time the list of sensitive parameters controlling volume and shape of the hydrograph are tabulated in seibert and vis 2012 smhi 2006 wale et al 2009 in tables 1 and 2 the optimized model parameter sets and model performance of gilgel abay and gumara watersheds calibrated with gauged original and bias corrected mpeg rainfall are tabulated the performance of the simulated flow using gauged and bias corrected mpeg sre indicated a fair to good performance for both watersheds in gilgel abay gauged and bias corrected mpeg indicated a nsh of 0 78 and 0 80 respectively and a pbias of less than 10 table 1 fig 6 a figs 7 and 8 a the gauged and bias corrected rainfall resulted in a comparable model performance in gumara watershed with nse of 0 78 and 0 79 table 2 fig 6b fig 8a and b both watershed models validated for independent gauge and bias corrected rainfall indicated acceptable result with a minimum of 0 8 nse with a nse of 0 16 and a 70 pbias for gilgel abay and nse of 0 22 and pbias of 69 4 for gumara watershed the original mpeg sre performance was poor in simulating the observed flow figs 7b and 8b the fitted model parameter sets of gauged rainfall and corrected mpeg data were close except for fc and khq for gilgel abay and in gumara a minor difference was observed in perc the result of simple sensitivity analysis done by sequentially changing one model parameter value while keeping others at their optimal value indicated that fc and khq were the most sensitive model parameters and lp and beta parameters were less sensitive while the model parameters alfa k4 and perc were the least sensitive even though the percolation parameter perc which links the upper and lower reservoir was kept at the maximum value the model did not capture the dry season flow of gilgel abay very well fig 9a otherwise the model has captured the rising and recession of the hydrograph of both watersheds for the gauged and bias corrected mpeg data although the effort made to get the rating curve data of gilgel abay at the emwie was not successful we recommend a further examination of the dry season flow october may after 2006 as it has increased significantly by 200 compared to the long term average from 1980 to 2005 fig 9b shows the comparison daily simulated and observed flow of gilgel abay 3 4 cross validation of bias corrected mpeg data the calibrated model parameter sets obtained using the gauged rainfall data were used to validate the flow prediction performance of bias corrected mpeg data comparison of calibrated model parameters using gauged rainfall and bias corrected mpeg data are listed in tables 1 and 2 for gilgel abay and gumara respectively except for the fc khq and lp for gilgel abay and perc for gumara other parameters have identical values the bias corrected mpeg dataset has a higher fc for gilgel abay watershed indicating a larger active soil layer that store water and emptied by evaporation which is clearly attributed to the stronger effect of the linear multiplication correction coefficient which has a larger effect on the higher mpeg rainfall values the bias correction has a higher scaling effect on the extreme precipitation events than the dry season rainfall berg et al 2012 leander and buishand 2007 simulation of bias corrected mpeg rainfall estimate using gauged rainfall parameters perform well for both watersheds with nse value of 0 74 and with acceptable pbias value of 8 for gilgel abay and nse of 0 78 and pbias of 10 for gumara watershed in capturing the observed flow 2010 2013 4 conclusions rainfall is a major input to hydrological models its spatial and temporal variability is prohibitively difficult to represent using traditional ground gauging stations while sres using various remote sensing techniques are freely available for use their potential to study hydrologic processes and or assess water resources potential at watershed scale is not thoroughly explored in this research we evaluated the rainfall volume estimation performance of mpeg rainfall products using in situ rainfall measurements the performance of a hbv model forced using mpeg rainfall products is also used to evaluate the rainfall product performance in simulating the observed flow of two watersheds in the upper blue nile basin ethiopia our results indicated that mpeg sres are prone to systematic error understanding and correcting the bias associated within should be a mandatory procedure in using them as forcing to a hydrological model the mpeg rainfall estimate compared with the gauged rainfall data indicated a higher correlation coefficient in capturing 81 and 78 of the gauged rainfall variation in gilgel abay and gumara watersheds respectively however in comparison to gauged rainfall measurements mpeg sres consistently under predicts rainfall volume by about 60 the bias corrected mpeg data captured the volume on monthly basis while capturing 81 and 78 of the gauged rainfall variation for gilgel abay and gumara respectively the performance of bias corrected mpeg data was validated by its predictive ability of the observed flow of gilgel abay and gumara daily observed flow though model calibration the result indicated that the performance of the mpeg data performed as good as the gauged rainfall simulation for both watersheds the performance of bias corrected mpeg data validated with gauged rainfall model parameters has also performed well in capturing the observed flow of both watersheds these hydrologic models performance indicates the potential of mpeg sre in water budget studies after applying a linear bias correction the long term mean monthly mpeg rainfall correction coefficients estimated from 2010 to 2013 indicated a consistent value especially for the rainy season the average of mpeg correction coefficients can be used to correct the bias of mpeg data where there is limited or no gauged rainfall data at near real time to predict floods in the lake tana sub basin acknowledgements this research was supported by a graduate student fellowship for the senior author by the

7611,this work evaluates the impact of climate change on the water balance of a catchment in india rainfall and hydro meteorological variables for current 20c3m scenario 1981 2000 and two future time periods mid of the 21st century 2046 2065 and end of the century 2081 2100 are simulated using modified markov model kernel density estimation mmm kde and k nearest neighbor downscaling models climate projections from an ensemble of 5 gcms mpi echam5 bccr bcm2 0 csiro mk3 5 ipsl cm4 and mri cgcm2 are used in this study hydrologic simulations for the current as well as future climate scenarios are carried out using soil and water assessment tool swat integrated with arcgis arcswat v 2009 the results show marginal reduction in runoff ratio annual streamflow and groundwater recharge towards the end of the century increased temperature and evapotranspiration project an increase in the irrigation demand towards the end of the century rainfall projections for the future shows marginal increase in the annual average rainfall short and moderate wet spells are projected to decrease whereas short and moderate dry spells are projected to increase in the future projected reduction in streamflow and groundwater recharge along with the increase in irrigation demand is likely to aggravate the water stress in the region under the future scenario keywords arcswat gcm climate change mmm kde downscaling model 1 introduction global climate change and its impact on hydrologic processes have been widely discussed in the recent past with increase in temperature climate change is accelerating the global hydrologic cycle huntington 2006 oki and kanae 2006 climate change is projected to cause changes in precipitation pattern variation in the frequency and distribution of floods and droughts and increase in evapotranspiration rate over different regions in the world frederick and major 1997 ficklin et al 2012 under the changing climate scenario changes in streamflows have been found to be largely linked with the variations in precipitation however for some locations especially for moisture limited regions small increase in temperature and the associated increase in evapotranspiration can cause larger variations in streamflows mccabe and wolock 2011 in a study by sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 storage processes within the catchment have been identified as the major factor that defines the non linearity between the streamflow and precipitation for moisture limited arid regions actual evapotranspiration is limited due to the limited moisture availability for such regions any increase in precipitation causes a proportional increase in actual evapotranspiration causing changes in the runoff to be less dramatic on the other hand in humid regions where moisture availability is not limited any increase in precipitation may not result in proportional increase in evapotranspiration in other words changes in evapotranspiration rate with respect to changes in rainfall are less prominent therefore any changes in rainfall are likely to cause larger changes in streamflow sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 basin level hydrologic analyses are therefore essential to assess the sensitivity of the basin to climate change scenarios and to develop appropriate water resources management policies and climate change adaptation strategies global climate models gcms are the primary tools that provide future projections of climate variables in the changing environment gcms are complex mathematical models capable of simulating the behavior of the earth s atmosphere ocean and land surface in three dimensions mcguffie and henderson sellers 1997 however they remain relatively coarse in resolution and are unable to resolve significant sub grid scale features often necessary in any hydrologic study allen and ingram 2002 fowler et al 2007 therefore studies dealing with the climate change impact assessment at catchment scale require downscaling of gcm projections to an appropriate scale to represent the catchment heterogeneity silberstein et al 2012 various statistical anandhi et al 2008 mehrotra and sharma 2010 and dynamic downscaling methods misra et al 2003 dominguez et al 2012 have been adopted in the past to downscale large scale atmospheric variables from the gcms to a regional scale or to a finer scale representative of a catchment downscaled climate simulations are often used as an input to hydrologic models to simulate the hydrologic responses and to assess the impact of climate change on water resources chang and jung 2010 vaze and teng 2011 ruelland et al 2012 in such studies the hydrologic models are first calibrated using historic data and then run using future scenarios to translate the climate change signals into corresponding changes in the hydrologic responses when gcm data are used large amount of uncertainty is inherent in the analyses for instance climate change projections are based on the green house gas ghg emission scenarios under different conditions of economic and technological development as well as the balance between global and local growth there are many emission scenarios mentioned in the special report on the emission scenario sres ipcc sres 2000 besides that there are many gcms available giving different projections of the climate variables for the same future ghg emission scenario from the previous studies wilby and harris 2006 chen et al 2011 choice of a single gcm has been consistently identified as the major contributor to the overall uncertainty in such analyses uncertainties arising from ghg emission scenario and the hydrologic model structure have been identified to be the least significant wilby and harris 2006 minville et al 2008 chen et al 2011 woldemeskel et al 2012 due to the large uncertainty introduced by the gcms climate change impacts estimated from the use of a single gcm need to be interpreted cautiously hence multi model ensemble climate simulations have been used in many of the recent studies tebaldi and knutti 2007 knutti et al 2010 jung et al 2012 zhang and huang 2013 multi model mean has been found to be giving better simulation of the climate variables compared to the individual models gleckler et al 2008 knutti et al 2010 zhang and huang 2013 in light of these facts in this study the hydrologic impact of climate change on malaprabha catchment in india is evaluated using climate projections from an ensemble of 5 gcms rainfall and meteorological variables are downscaled from large scale atmospheric variables simulated by the gcms a conceptual yet spatially distributed hydrologic model swat is used to derive the hydrologic simulation using inputs from each gcm in this study swat integrated with arcgis graphical user interface arcswat v 2009 is adopted a weighted ensemble average approach is used to estimate the average hydrologic responses of the catchment under future scenarios and to evaluate the hydrologic impact of climate change in the catchment the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 and cmip5 datasets each contain output from a large number of gcms both datasets use different scenarios describing the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere in the future cmip3 uses scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc special report on emissions scenarios sres whereas cmip5 uses representative concentration pathways recommended in the ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 in this study gcms included in the cmip3 project and ipcc sres emission scenario are used to obtain the climate projection for the 20th century as well as the future scenarios the ipcc notes that for both large scale climate patterns and the magnitudes of climate change there is overall consistency between the projections based on cmip3 and cmip5 ipcc 2013 results of a few recent studies show that both cmip3 and cmip5 models well simulate the large scale atmospheric variables used in this study for the statistical downscaling of rainfall mueller and seneviratne 2014 woldemeskel et al 2016 in addition based on the studies conducted using cmip3 and cmip5 models shashikanth et al 2014 concluded that the indian summer monsoon rainfall simulations from both models do not differ significantly hence the current study helps to understand the sensitivity of the catchment to the projected climate scenarios even though an additional analysis using cmip5 models and appropriate rcps would further strengthen the findings of the study 2 study area and input data 2 1 study area malaprabha river originates from the western ghats in the belgaum district in north karnataka india the area drained by malaprabha river and its tributaries up to malaprabha dam is selected as the present study area the catchment area is 2564 sq km with elevation ranging from 1024m to 430m location map of the malaprabha catchment is shown in fig 1 based on the survey of india maps http www surveyofindia gov in climatology of the catchment varies from tropical humid in the upper catchment to semi arid in the lower catchment annual average rainfall in the catchment exhibits large spatial variation ranging from 3000mm in the upper region to less than 500mm in the lower region annual average rainfall averaged over the catchment is 1051mm much of which is received during the south west monsoon period from june to september anandhi et al 2008 mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures in the catchment vary from 25 to 34 c and 17 to 21 c respectively anandhi et al 2009 malaprabha reservoir is the major source of irrigation water for the 218 191 hectares anandhi et al 2009 of agricultural area in the arid regions in north karnataka and is also the major source of drinking water for about one million people in hubli and dharwad cities malaprabha catchment is a hydrologically sensitive area such that any change in water yield in the catchment is likely to effect vast areas that are dependent on the reservoir for irrigation and drinking water in addition due to extensive groundwater extraction to meet the irrigation demand groundwater table in a large part of the catchment has been drastically depleted cgwb 2007 reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2012 scientific studies are therefore essential to analyse the hydrologic responses of this water scarce catchment under the projected climate change scenario to facilitate the planning of appropriate mitigation measures 2 2 data used digital elevation model dem digital soil map and land use land cover lu lc map are used to represent the catchment heterogeneity for the hydrologic analysis dem of malaprabha catchment at 30m spatial resolution is obtained from advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global dem gdem data set released by the japan s ministry of economy trade and industry meti and nasa multi season landsat 7 etm imageries are used to extract lu lc map of the catchment in this study a combination of visual and digital image interpretation technique is used to extract the lu lc map from the satellite imagery reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2012 seven main lu lc classes viz water agricultural land barren fallow land rocky area forest urban settlement and grass land are extracted in the first step appropriate bands that show unique band ratio are identified for each land cover class a combination of visual interpretation and unsupervised classification using band ratio lillesand et al 2004 is used to identify the seven major land cover classes the second level classification i e classification of the crop types is achieved using multi temporal satellite images dutta et al 1998 representing different cropping seasons depending upon the presence or absence of crop in each image different crop types are classified field information and the district statistical information about the crop production are used to substantiate the classification soil map of the area is obtained from the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur india monthly inflow into the malaprabha reservoir for the period 1973 2000 is obtained from the water resources development organization bangalore india and is used as the observed streamflow data to calibrate the hydrologic model rainfall and meteorological variables viz maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity at daily time steps are used for hydrologic simulation in order to incorporate the large spatial heterogeneity rainfall data from 9 stations are used in this study locations of the stations for which the downscaled rainfall and meteorological data are available are shown in fig 1 daily rainfall data at these 9 stations in the catchment are available for the period 1971 2000 whereas observed meteorological data are available only for a short period 1993 2000 mass curve analysis of the rainfall data was performed from which the period 1993 2000 was found to be insufficient to represent the entire study period 1971 2000 therefore rainfall and meteorological variables are downscaled from the national centre for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis data for the period 1971 2000 in addition for historic and future time periods rainfall and hydro meteorological variables are downscaled from multiple gcms modified markov model kernel density estimation mmm kde model mehrotra and sharma 2010 is used to downscale rainfall from large scale atmospheric variables to the multiple raingauge stations shown in fig 1 also the k nearest neighbor resampling method is used to downscale the meteorological variables to the single location shown in fig 1 the mmm kde model and the k nearest neighbor resampling methods are explained in the next section based on the easy availability of daily data of the atmospheric variables from the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 5 gcms are considered in this study these are i bccr bcm2 0 developed by the bjerknes centre for climate research bccr university of bergen norway ii mri cgcm2 developed by the meteorological research institute

and v ipsl cm4 developed by the institute pierre simon laplace ipsl france the 20th century climate experiment 20c3m for the period 1981 2000 is selected to represent the historic scenario hydrologic impact of climate change is also studied for two 20year future time periods 2046 2065 referred hereafter as mid of the century to represent the mid 21st century and 2081 2100 referred hereafter as end of the century to represent the end of 21st century for each time period required atmospheric variables at gcm grid nodes over the catchment are extracted from a single continuous transient run corresponding to sres a2 emission scenario the a2 scenario which is at the higher end of the sres emission scenarios but not the highest is selected in this study as it would be more informative from impact and adaptation point of view compared to the lower end scenario hydrologic model swat is used to simulate the catchment hydrologic responses for historic and two future time periods under the a2 scenario please note that during the time of this study runs from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were not available nevertheless many studies have raised concerns about whether cmip5 models are capturing the historic monsoon trends accurately kitoh et al 2013 ogata et al 2014 sooraj et al 2014 saha et al 2014 and whether the monsoon projections are reliable in these models sabeerali et al 2014 recent study by shashikanth et al 2014 shows that biases in the statistically downscaled indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr data do not differ significantly for cmip3 and cmip5 data sets in this study future estimates of runoff and rainfall are derived using smooth varying atmospheric variables which are considered to be equally well estimated by majority of gcms used in both cmip3 and cmip5 projects mueller and seneviratne 2014 woldemeskel et al 2016 hence the current study is restricted only to the cmip3 data 3 methodology and model description 3 1 statistical

correction procedure johnson and sharma 2012 the nested bias correction nbc method offers an improvement over the quantile mapping method by incorporating the persistence of rainfall through lag 1 autocorrelation also corrections are nested from finer to coarser time scales by which the gcm outputs are corrected for biases in mean standard deviation and lag 1 auto correlation at daily monthly seasonal and annual time scales simultaneously any biases in the gcm atmospheric fields are thus removed before their use for downscaling while the mean shift from current to future climate is preserved previous studies have demonstrated successful use of nbc for bias correction of atmospheric variables in reproducing the observed low frequency variability in the rainfall simulations johnson and sharma 2011 sharma et al 2012 ojha et al 2013 modified markov model kernel density estimation mmm kde modelling framework mehrotra and sharma 2010 is used to downscale rainfall at multiple sites in the catchment the model operates in two steps in the first step the modified markov model mmm is used to identify wet and dry days and in the second step intensity of rainfall during wet days is estimated using the kernel density estimation kde approach a wet day is defined as a day with rainfall greater than or equal to 0 3mm markov model is a stochastic model that predicts a state variable at any point of time as a function of the variable in the previous time step in mmm to include the influence of changing climate the simple markov model is modified by including atmospheric predictors as conditioning variables thus in mmm probability of occurrence of a wet or dry day consists of two terms first term showing the transition probability of rainfall similar to a simple markov model and the second term showing the effect of inclusion of a predictor set consisting of the atmospheric variables of interest the kde approach simulates the intensity of rainfall during each time step which is identified as a wet day by the mmm based on the rainfall intensity of previous time step and selected atmospheric variables conditional nonparametric multivariate probability density of rainfall amount rt for day t for each site may be defined as follows mehrotra et al 2013 1 f r t x t i 1 n 1 2 π λ 2 s 1 2 w i exp r i b i 2 2 λ 2 s where λ is the kernel bandwidth and xt is the vector representing the climate variables influencing the rainfall s is the measure of spread of the conditional density and bi is the conditional mean both expressed in terms of covariance between r and x wi is the weight associated with each kernel since rainfall at multiple stations are considered in this study spatial dependence over these point locations at each time step is incorporated by using uniform random variates that are independent in time but exhibit a strong dependence across the multiple point locations considered more details on the mmm kde model structure are available in mehrotra and sharma 2010 and mehrotra et al 2013 mmm kde model produces multiple realizations of the downscaled variables in this study 20 such realizations generated for 20c3m and the future scenarios are considered and the average hydrologic responses are estimated for each scenario daily values of maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity are downscaled from the large scale atmospheric variables using the k nearest neighbor resampling 3 2 arcswat arcswat is the soil and water assessment tool swat with a powerful user interface integrated with the arcgis platform winchell et al 2007 swat is a conceptual model capable of simulating the catchment hydrologic processes at a continuous time scale arnold et al 1998 capability of swat to simulate basin level hydrologic characteristics for varying land use and climate conditions makes it a widely adopted tool for climate change studies related to hydrology wang et al 2008 bae et al 2011 ficklin et al 2012 geographical information system gis interface of arcswat allows the users to provide spatially referenced data using the topographical information arcswat divides the catchment into sub basins each sub basin is further divided into homogeneous hydrological response units hrus using the spatially distributed soil land use land cover and slope information each hru is vertically divided into different control volumes like surface layer root zone shallow aquifer and deep aquifer different approaches and approximations are used to partition the precipitation into various hydrologic components in these control volumes a part of the precipitation is available as surface runoff and the remaining portion infiltrates into the soil layer partitioning of rainfall into surface runoff and infiltration is achieved using the soil conservation services curve number scs cn method scs 1972 embedded in arcswat large number of studies conducted over a wide range of catchments have shown that swat gives reasonably good simulation of the surface runoff processes steenhuis et al 1995 ponce and hawkins 1996 mishra and singh 2004 reshmidevi et al 2008 runoff from each hru is further routed through channels to the watershed outlet using the variable storage method williams 1969 a part of infiltrated water leaves the soil layer as lateral flow which is estimated using a kinematic flow equation involving saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil layer slope drainable porosity and drainable volume of water present in the layer another fraction of water that reaches the soil layer percolates further and joins the groundwater storage which is called groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is computed as a function of drainable volume of water present in the soil layer this groundwater recharge may be further divided into shallow aquifer recharge and deep aquifer recharge reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2012 shallow aquifer storage contributes to the groundwater flow and adds to the streamflow within the watershed whereas groundwater flow from the deep aquifer is assumed to meet the stream only outside the catchment in this study hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 available in the arcswat interface is used for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet arcswat provides options to define various agricultural operations for each crop at the hru level irrigation requirement for the crops is defined according to the plant water stress condition reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2012 digital elevation model of the catchment spatial variation in soil and lu lc are the primary spatially referenced data used in arcswat rainfall and meteorological data viz maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity at daily time step are also used as input to the model details of arcswat components can be found in literature arnold et al 1998 3 3 arcswat calibration and validation arcswat v 2009 is applied at daily time scale over the study area the catchment is first divided into 12 sub basins and each sub basin is further divided into hrus using the lu lc soil and slope information irrigated areas in the catchment are identified and the irrigation application is defined when plant water stress exceeds a threshold of 0 95 daily values of rainfall at 9 stations and hydro meteorological variables at the single location shown in fig 1 are downscaled from the reanalysis data and are used for model calibration and validation simulated discharge is compared with the observed monthly streamflow data the period 1971 2000 is selected in this study out of which the first two years are used as the warm up period for the model and the period 1973 2000 is used for model calibration and validation multiple realizations of the downscaled rainfall and climate variables produced by mmm kde approach are used in the hydrologic modelling in order to derive stable values of model parameters during calibration concatenated data set is formed using multiple realizations from the ensemble of 20 realizations first 9 realizations are used for calibration and the remaining 11 realizations are used for model validation each realization being of 28years excluding the warm up period total length of the calibration run is thus 252years model sensitivity analysis is performed using latin hypercube lh and one factor at a time oat methods included in the arcswat van griensven 2005 and the sensitive parameters are manually calibrated capability of the model to accurately produce flow duration curve fdc for the annual and monsoon june september streamflows is considered as the evaluation criteria during calibration using monthly streamflow simulations from the model annual and monsoon streamflows are calculated for each realization and the average fdcs for the annual and monsoon periods are generated deviation of the simulated fdc from the observed fdc is measured using mean absolute relative error mare as given in eq 2 2 mare 1 n i 1 n q obs q sim q sim where n is the number of points considered from the fdc qobs and qsim are the corresponding flow values from the observed fdc and the simulated fdc respectively 3 4 multi model ensemble projection under the future scenario ensemble of simulations from the hydrologic model obtained by using rainfall and meteorological data from the 5 gcms is used to evaluate the hydrologic impact of climate change in the catchment by comparing hydrologic responses in the future time periods with that obtained under 20c3m scenario when the temporal periods do not overlap fdcs are commonly used for comparing the flow regimes in the hydrologic analyses sugawara 1979 yu and yang 2000 westerberg et al 2011 since the temporal periods of the 20c3m and the future scenarios do not overlap fdcs of annual and monsoon flows are used here for the comparison a weighted ensemble average approach is used to derive ensemble average streamflow simulation from the 5 gcms arcswat is run using the downscaled rainfall and meteorological data from each gcm and fdcs for the annual and monsoon flows are generated simulated fdcs for 20c3m scenario are then compared against fdcs of the observed streamflow data for the same period deviation of the simulated fdcs from the observed fdc expressed in terms of mare is used as the evaluation criterion for each hydrologic simulation using input from different gcms mare of the annual and monsoon fdcs are estimated and the mean of these two values is used to derive the weight for each simulation using eq 3 3 weight 1 meanmare m 1 5 1 meanmare where m is the model index using this set of weights weighted fdcs of the annual and monsoon flows are generated for the 20c3m scenario and are used as the reference fdcs to quantify the future changes in the streamflow gcms simulating the historic scenario satisfactorily are expected to be capable of simulating the future scenarios reasonably well reichler and kim 2008 errasti et al 2010 therefore the weights derived for the hydrologic simulations under 20c3m scenario are adopted for the future time periods as well hydrologic responses of the catchment under the future time periods mid of the century and end of the century are simulated by using the downscaled rainfall and meteorological variables from each gcm and the fdcs of both annual and monsoon flows are generated further using the set of weights derived from the 20c3m scenario weighted average fdcs for the future scenarios are generated future projections are compared with 20c3m simulations to quantify the streamflow variation under future scenarios a flowchart of the methodology is shown in fig 2 hydrologic simulations from the 5 gcms are aggregated to find variations in other water budget components viz potential evapotranspiration pet actual evapotranspiration et irrigation demand and groundwater recharge in the future time periods 3 5 test for statistical significance statistical significance of projected changes in the mean annual and monsoon streamflows is evaluated using non parametric rank based mann whitney test wilcoxon 1945 mann and whitney 1947 mann whitney test is commonly used to identify statistical significance of the difference in mean or median of hydrological time series lettenmaier 1976 xu et al 2003 caloiero et al 2011 the test is based on the null hypothesis that medians of the two series compared are the same and the alternate hypothesis that they differ significantly from one another when two series of size n 1 and n 2 are compared the standardized test statistic is represented as follows chen et al 2006 4 z c r 1 n 1 n 1 n 2 1 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 12 where r 1 is the rank sum of the values in series 1 the ranks are assigned by combining all the values in series 1 and 2 and arranging them in the ascending order for a large sample size the null hypothesis is rejected in other words a difference between the medians is established at a significance level α when the probability of occurrence of zc obtained from the standardized normal distribution table is greater than or equal to 1 α 2 in this study the weighted average annual and monsoon streamflow series of the future time periods are compared against the 20c3m scenario and the test statistic is derived this test statistic is used to find the corresponding α which indicates the statistical significance of difference in the medians of the two streamflow series compared 4 results and discussion 4 1 arcswat calibration and validation dem soil map and lu lc map of the malaprabha catchment are used as spatially referenced input to arcswat to simulate the catchment hydrological processes the model is run at daily time scale using downscaled rainfall and hydro meteorological data from the reanalysis data set streamflow simulations at daily time scale are aggregated to monthly scale and are compared with the observed data table 1 shows the mare values for annual and monsoon flows mare is found to be less than 0 1 for both calibration and validation phases further monthly streamflow data series is generated taking average of 20 realizations used for calibration and validation and the same is compared with the observed monthly streamflow data in fig 3 simulated monthly streamflow series matches well with the observed data albeit slight underestimation of the peak flow values nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient is found to be 0 82 which is considered to be excellent according to the general performance rating for monthly streamflow recommended by moriasi et al 2007 since a simple averaged monthly flow is used as the benchmark model in nse higher values of nse may be due to the high seasonality of the monthly data therefore as recommended by schaefli and gupta 2007 an additional index nseb is also used in this study to evaluate the model performance long term average streamflow for each month is used as the benchmark model to calculate nseb during the calibration period nseb is obtained as 0 74 for the monthly streamflow simulations higher values of nse and nseb indicate better performance of the current hydrologic model compared to the selected benchmark models the calibrated hydrologic model is used to simulate hydrological responses under 20c3m scenario simulated fdcs of annual and monsoon flows obtained using the downscaled rainfall and meteorological data from the 5 gcms are compared with the fdcs of the observed data in fig 4 table 2 shows the mare of the annual and monsoon flows for the 5 gcms and the corresponding weights using the set of weights weighted average fdc for the 20c3m scenario is derived which is also plotted in fig 4 the weighted average annual fdc matches well with the observed data with the exception of some underestimation of moderate and low monsoon flows this may be mainly due to the small differences between the observed and the downscaled rainfall data in terms of annual wet days and the amount of rainfall per wet day mehrotra et al 2013 since bias corrected gcm outputs are used in the downscaling such variations may be due to systemic errors from the downscaling model and therefore may persist for the future scenarios as well hence to quantify the future changes in the streamflow hydrologic responses in the future time periods are compared with the weighted ensemble average streamflow for the 20c3m scenario 4 2 hydrologic responses in the future fig 5 presents the weighted ensemble average fdcs of the annual and monsoon flows for the 20c3m mid of the century and end of the century scenarios from which some interesting observations can be drawn moderate corresponding to 40 60 exceedance probability and high corresponding to 10 exceedance probability streamflows at both annual and monsoon timescales show nominal increases for the mid of the century scenario whereas low flows corresponding to 90 exceedance probability show some reduction in the future fig 5a and b streamflow projections for the end of the century show an overall reduction in monsoon flows as seen from fig 5b this may be attributed to the changes in the rainfall pattern projected towards the end of the century and an increase in the evaporation demand study conducted by mehrotra et al 2013 shows a plausible reduction in the number of short 2 4days duration and moderate 5 7days duration wet spells whereas an increase in the rainfall amounts from short moderate and long more than 7days duration wet spells over the study area by the mid of the century on the other hand short 2 9days duration and moderate 10 18days duration dry spells are projected to increase under the future scenarios mehrotra et al 2013 projected increase in the dry spells is likely to cause a reduction in the annual and monsoon low flows using the weighted ensemble simulation mean annual and monsoon flows are calculated for mid of the century and end of the century scenarios in addition annual and monsoon streamflow values corresponding to 10 90 and 95 exceedance probability are also estimated from the fdcs which are given in table 3 since streamflow values with less than 10 exceedance probability indicate peak flows years corresponding to the peak flows are called wet years on the other hand 90 and 95 dependable flows indicate lower annual flows and the years in which annual average flow corresponds to 90 or 95 dependable flows are considered as the low flow years or dry years the results show an increase in the average annual and monsoon flows in the mid of the century scenario the study also shows an increase in peak flows as indicated by the increase in the annual and monsoon streamflow values corresponding to 10 exceedance probability accordingly in the mid of the century more number of years are projected to have annual streamflow in excess of the current peak flow corresponding to 10 exceedance probability in other words more number of wet years are projected under the mid of the century scenario further a reduction in the 90 and 95 dependable flows indicate an increase in the number of dry years in other words frequencies of both wet and dry years are projected to increase towards the mid of the century some of the previous studies analyzing the historic rainfall in the 20th century have also reported an increase in the wet and dry years in the changing climate conditions changnon 1987 sousa et al 2009 streamflow simulations for the end of the century scenario show some reduction in mean annual and monsoon flows corresponding to 10 exceedance probability whereas no significant changes in the lower flows 90 and 95 dependability this implies that frequency of wet years is likely to decrease towards the end of the century these changes however are insignificant as indicated by the mann whitney test the test statistics and significance levels of the percentage changes in the mean annual and monsoon flows are presented in table 4 although the projected changes in mean annual and monsoon flows are not significant the intra annual variation of flows needs to be analysed box whisker plots of the weighted ensemble average monthly flows for the 20c3m and the two future scenarios are shown in fig 6 these plots show some variations in the monthly flows during the monsoon period median and the 75 percentile flows are projected to increase in june while some reduction is noted during july and august under the future scenario close to 25 reduction in the streamflow is observed in july towards the end of the century being the peak sowing period for the kharif crops in india any drop in the water availability in july in the future scenario may have adverse impact on the agriculture 4 3 climate change impact on water budget components monthly hydrologic simulations of the catchment under the 20c3m and future scenarios are used to analyse the changes in other catchment water budget components as well variations in et irrigation demand and groundwater recharge are estimated under the projected climate conditions fig 7 shows the variations in streamflow and irrigation demand with the changes in rainfall and temperature in general an increase in rainfall causes an increase in streamflow rainfall projections from various gcms vary from 10 9 to 8 4 with respect to the 20c3m scenario whereas the streamflow projections vary from 20 6 to 9 0 towards the end of the 21st century fig 7a likewise the irrigation demand is projected to increase by 3 2 to 15 7 across various gcms by the end of the 21st century fig 7b from fig 7a and b it can be observed that changes in the streamflow and irrigation demand are largely related to the variation in rainfall and the gcm nevertheless small deviations may be observed which may be attributed to the changes in tmax and tmin as shown in fig 7c to f for example using bccr bcm2 0 larger increases in irrigation demand towards the end of the century is projected which may be attributed to the highest increase in tmax as shown in fig 7d likewise results from csiro mk3 5 project significant reduction in streamflow and increase in irrigation demand which may be attributed to the combined effect of large increases in tmax and tmin and significant reduction in rainfall fig 8 shows the catchment water budget components for the 20c3m scenario at the annual time scale as well as for the monsoon period evapotranspiration is the major abstraction from the rainfall amounting close to 70 annually and close to 45 during the monsoon period irrigation supplements the crop water demand to a large extent ground water recharge is the amount of water that reaches the shallow aquifer a part of it appears as groundwater flow and contributes to the streamflow at the watershed outlet percentage changes in the water budget components projected under the future scenario with respect to 20c3m scenario at the annual time scale are shown in fig 9 a weighted ensemble average simulations show marginal increases in annual average rainfall under the future scenarios 2 2 towards the mid of the century and 1 6 towards the end of the century though the changes in the annual average rainfall are nominal the variations in the rainfall pattern in terms of number and durations of wet and dry spells are of major concern tmax is projected to increase by 0 51 c and 0 84 c 1 8 and 2 9 towards the mid of the century and end of the century respectively similarly tmin is projected to increase by 0 29 c and 0 46 c 1 5 and 2 4 towards the mid of the century and end of the century respectively with changes in temperature and rainfall pattern evapotranspiration rates are projected to increase by 2 3 and 4 1 respectively for the mid of the century and end of the century scenarios runoff ratio ratio of average annual runoff to average annual rainfall of the catchment is found to be 0 4184 0 4178 and 0 4083 for 20c3m mid of the century and end of the century scenarios respectively the 2 5 reduction in the runoff ratio shows 1 2 reduction in the annual average streamflow towards the end of the century in addition groundwater recharge rates are also projected to decline by 7 3 towards the end of the century the projected variations in the water budget component may be attributed to the increase in the temperature as well as the changes in the rainfall pattern in the catchment under the future scenarios the upper catchment is under tropical humid zone whereas the lower catchment is under semi arid agro climatic zone with limited moisture availability increase in precipitation and temperature therefore results in increase in evapotranspiration from the catchment and consequently increase in the irrigation demand projected increases in the short and moderate rainfall events are likely to cause more infiltration into the soil layer thus a relatively less fraction of rainfall would appear as streamflow at watershed outlet on the other hand projected increases in the short and moderate dry spells results in more soil moisture extraction to meet the increased evapotranspiration rates thereby reducing the groundwater recharge monsoon rainfall being the source of water for the catchment projected changes in the water budget components during the monsoon season is also studied fig 9 b during the monsoon period the rainfall is projected to decline by 1 4 towards the end of the century reduction in the rainfall together with the increase in the temperature is projected to result in 18 5 increase in the irrigation demand during the monsoon period in addition streamflow is also projected to decline under the future scenarios the analysis shows that percentage changes in the water budget components are more during the monsoon period this may be attributed to the changes in the rainfall distribution in the form of reduction in the short and moderate wet spells and increase in the dry spells the projected increase in irrigation demand when combined with the likely reduction in the recharge would aggravate the water scarcity problems of the area which is already identified as a groundwater overexploited region 5 summary and conclusions this study explores the impacts of climate change on the hydrology and water budget components of the malaprabha catchment for two future periods mid of the 21st century 2046 2065 and end of the century 2081 2100 in order to address the uncertainty issues that arise from the use of a single gcm an ensemble of 5 gcms mpi echam5 bccr bcm2 0 csiro mk3 5 ipsl cm4 and mri cgcm2 is used in this study large scale climate variables simulated by the gcms are first bias corrected using the nbc approach and are used to downscale rainfall and meteorological variables at the catchment level using mmm kde model rainfall and meteorological variables downscaled from each of the 5 gcms are used as input to a conceptual hydrological model and the corresponding hydrological components for current and future climate scenarios are simulated hydrologic simulations using inputs from various gcms are evaluated for their ability to simulate the hydrologic responses for the 20c3m scenario and the weights are assigned accordingly weighted ensemble average outputs are used to analyse the changes in hydrologic components under the future scenarios not many studies have attempted similar kind of work for indian catchments the limited data availability and the large scale heterogeneity in the catchment characteristics often hinders such studies standing within the constraints of data availability the study is an efforts to analyse the hydrologic sensitivity of the catchment under the projected climate change scenarios this would be a stepping stone to understand the climate change vulnerability of the catchment the results show only marginal changes in annual average rainfall in the catchment under the future scenarios corresponding changes in the hydrologic components are also found to be statistically insignificant both for the annual and monsoon periods even though the changes in the streamflow and irrigation demand are strongly related to the variation in rainfall they are not directly proportional to each other such deviations may be attributed to the gcms used as well as the changes in rainfall pattern and atmospheric temperature with 0 84 c and 0 46 c increases in the daily maximum and minimum temperatures towards the end of the century evapotranspiration rate is projected to increase by 4 1 irrigation demand is projected to increase by 7 7 and groundwater recharge is projected to decline by 7 3 streamflow projections for the end of the century scenario show nominal reduction in the average annual and monsoon flows changes in rainfall and temperatures are projected to reduce the runoff ratio by 2 5 by the end of the century projected increase in the evapotranspiration and irrigation demand associated with the decrease in the groundwater recharge and streamflow is an indication of possible aggravation of the water stress in the catchment in future hydrological analyses to investigate the impact of climate change on the catchment water balance are affected by the uncertainty in the climate projections as well as the uncertainty in the hydrological model itself in order to reduce the uncertainty in the climate projection in the present study an ensemble of gcms included in the cmip 3 data sets are used to derive the climate projections on the other hand uncertainty in the hydrological model still persists even though the streamflow simulations are validated with respect to the observed data lack of sufficient observed data for the catchment restricts the validation of the other water budget components the use of an ensemble of hydrological models may help to address this issue to some extent nevertheless as reported in literature wolock and mccabe 1999 arnell and liv 2001 the study helps to indicate the sensitivity of the hydrologic systems to the climate change analysis using cmip5 models and representative concentration pathways might help to further understand the impact of climate change projections over the region acknowledgements this work is supported by the department of science and

7611,this work evaluates the impact of climate change on the water balance of a catchment in india rainfall and hydro meteorological variables for current 20c3m scenario 1981 2000 and two future time periods mid of the 21st century 2046 2065 and end of the century 2081 2100 are simulated using modified markov model kernel density estimation mmm kde and k nearest neighbor downscaling models climate projections from an ensemble of 5 gcms mpi echam5 bccr bcm2 0 csiro mk3 5 ipsl cm4 and mri cgcm2 are used in this study hydrologic simulations for the current as well as future climate scenarios are carried out using soil and water assessment tool swat integrated with arcgis arcswat v 2009 the results show marginal reduction in runoff ratio annual streamflow and groundwater recharge towards the end of the century increased temperature and evapotranspiration project an increase in the irrigation demand towards the end of the century rainfall projections for the future shows marginal increase in the annual average rainfall short and moderate wet spells are projected to decrease whereas short and moderate dry spells are projected to increase in the future projected reduction in streamflow and groundwater recharge along with the increase in irrigation demand is likely to aggravate the water stress in the region under the future scenario keywords arcswat gcm climate change mmm kde downscaling model 1 introduction global climate change and its impact on hydrologic processes have been widely discussed in the recent past with increase in temperature climate change is accelerating the global hydrologic cycle huntington 2006 oki and kanae 2006 climate change is projected to cause changes in precipitation pattern variation in the frequency and distribution of floods and droughts and increase in evapotranspiration rate over different regions in the world frederick and major 1997 ficklin et al 2012 under the changing climate scenario changes in streamflows have been found to be largely linked with the variations in precipitation however for some locations especially for moisture limited regions small increase in temperature and the associated increase in evapotranspiration can cause larger variations in streamflows mccabe and wolock 2011 in a study by sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 storage processes within the catchment have been identified as the major factor that defines the non linearity between the streamflow and precipitation for moisture limited arid regions actual evapotranspiration is limited due to the limited moisture availability for such regions any increase in precipitation causes a proportional increase in actual evapotranspiration causing changes in the runoff to be less dramatic on the other hand in humid regions where moisture availability is not limited any increase in precipitation may not result in proportional increase in evapotranspiration in other words changes in evapotranspiration rate with respect to changes in rainfall are less prominent therefore any changes in rainfall are likely to cause larger changes in streamflow sankarasubramanian and vogel 2003 basin level hydrologic analyses are therefore essential to assess the sensitivity of the basin to climate change scenarios and to develop appropriate water resources management policies and climate change adaptation strategies global climate models gcms are the primary tools that provide future projections of climate variables in the changing environment gcms are complex mathematical models capable of simulating the behavior of the earth s atmosphere ocean and land surface in three dimensions mcguffie and henderson sellers 1997 however they remain relatively coarse in resolution and are unable to resolve significant sub grid scale features often necessary in any hydrologic study allen and ingram 2002 fowler et al 2007 therefore studies dealing with the climate change impact assessment at catchment scale require downscaling of gcm projections to an appropriate scale to represent the catchment heterogeneity silberstein et al 2012 various statistical anandhi et al 2008 mehrotra and sharma 2010 and dynamic downscaling methods misra et al 2003 dominguez et al 2012 have been adopted in the past to downscale large scale atmospheric variables from the gcms to a regional scale or to a finer scale representative of a catchment downscaled climate simulations are often used as an input to hydrologic models to simulate the hydrologic responses and to assess the impact of climate change on water resources chang and jung 2010 vaze and teng 2011 ruelland et al 2012 in such studies the hydrologic models are first calibrated using historic data and then run using future scenarios to translate the climate change signals into corresponding changes in the hydrologic responses when gcm data are used large amount of uncertainty is inherent in the analyses for instance climate change projections are based on the green house gas ghg emission scenarios under different conditions of economic and technological development as well as the balance between global and local growth there are many emission scenarios mentioned in the special report on the emission scenario sres ipcc sres 2000 besides that there are many gcms available giving different projections of the climate variables for the same future ghg emission scenario from the previous studies wilby and harris 2006 chen et al 2011 choice of a single gcm has been consistently identified as the major contributor to the overall uncertainty in such analyses uncertainties arising from ghg emission scenario and the hydrologic model structure have been identified to be the least significant wilby and harris 2006 minville et al 2008 chen et al 2011 woldemeskel et al 2012 due to the large uncertainty introduced by the gcms climate change impacts estimated from the use of a single gcm need to be interpreted cautiously hence multi model ensemble climate simulations have been used in many of the recent studies tebaldi and knutti 2007 knutti et al 2010 jung et al 2012 zhang and huang 2013 multi model mean has been found to be giving better simulation of the climate variables compared to the individual models gleckler et al 2008 knutti et al 2010 zhang and huang 2013 in light of these facts in this study the hydrologic impact of climate change on malaprabha catchment in india is evaluated using climate projections from an ensemble of 5 gcms rainfall and meteorological variables are downscaled from large scale atmospheric variables simulated by the gcms a conceptual yet spatially distributed hydrologic model swat is used to derive the hydrologic simulation using inputs from each gcm in this study swat integrated with arcgis graphical user interface arcswat v 2009 is adopted a weighted ensemble average approach is used to estimate the average hydrologic responses of the catchment under future scenarios and to evaluate the hydrologic impact of climate change in the catchment the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 and cmip5 datasets each contain output from a large number of gcms both datasets use different scenarios describing the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere in the future cmip3 uses scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc special report on emissions scenarios sres whereas cmip5 uses representative concentration pathways recommended in the ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 in this study gcms included in the cmip3 project and ipcc sres emission scenario are used to obtain the climate projection for the 20th century as well as the future scenarios the ipcc notes that for both large scale climate patterns and the magnitudes of climate change there is overall consistency between the projections based on cmip3 and cmip5 ipcc 2013 results of a few recent studies show that both cmip3 and cmip5 models well simulate the large scale atmospheric variables used in this study for the statistical downscaling of rainfall mueller and seneviratne 2014 woldemeskel et al 2016 in addition based on the studies conducted using cmip3 and cmip5 models shashikanth et al 2014 concluded that the indian summer monsoon rainfall simulations from both models do not differ significantly hence the current study helps to understand the sensitivity of the catchment to the projected climate scenarios even though an additional analysis using cmip5 models and appropriate rcps would further strengthen the findings of the study 2 study area and input data 2 1 study area malaprabha river originates from the western ghats in the belgaum district in north karnataka india the area drained by malaprabha river and its tributaries up to malaprabha dam is selected as the present study area the catchment area is 2564 sq km with elevation ranging from 1024m to 430m location map of the malaprabha catchment is shown in fig 1 based on the survey of india maps http www surveyofindia gov in climatology of the catchment varies from tropical humid in the upper catchment to semi arid in the lower catchment annual average rainfall in the catchment exhibits large spatial variation ranging from 3000mm in the upper region to less than 500mm in the lower region annual average rainfall averaged over the catchment is 1051mm much of which is received during the south west monsoon period from june to september anandhi et al 2008 mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures in the catchment vary from 25 to 34 c and 17 to 21 c respectively anandhi et al 2009 malaprabha reservoir is the major source of irrigation water for the 218 191 hectares anandhi et al 2009 of agricultural area in the arid regions in north karnataka and is also the major source of drinking water for about one million people in hubli and dharwad cities malaprabha catchment is a hydrologically sensitive area such that any change in water yield in the catchment is likely to effect vast areas that are dependent on the reservoir for irrigation and drinking water in addition due to extensive groundwater extraction to meet the irrigation demand groundwater table in a large part of the catchment has been drastically depleted cgwb 2007 reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2012 scientific studies are therefore essential to analyse the hydrologic responses of this water scarce catchment under the projected climate change scenario to facilitate the planning of appropriate mitigation measures 2 2 data used digital elevation model dem digital soil map and land use land cover lu lc map are used to represent the catchment heterogeneity for the hydrologic analysis dem of malaprabha catchment at 30m spatial resolution is obtained from advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global dem gdem data set released by the japan s ministry of economy trade and industry meti and nasa multi season landsat 7 etm imageries are used to extract lu lc map of the catchment in this study a combination of visual and digital image interpretation technique is used to extract the lu lc map from the satellite imagery reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2012 seven main lu lc classes viz water agricultural land barren fallow land rocky area forest urban settlement and grass land are extracted in the first step appropriate bands that show unique band ratio are identified for each land cover class a combination of visual interpretation and unsupervised classification using band ratio lillesand et al 2004 is used to identify the seven major land cover classes the second level classification i e classification of the crop types is achieved using multi temporal satellite images dutta et al 1998 representing different cropping seasons depending upon the presence or absence of crop in each image different crop types are classified field information and the district statistical information about the crop production are used to substantiate the classification soil map of the area is obtained from the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur india monthly inflow into the malaprabha reservoir for the period 1973 2000 is obtained from the water resources development organization bangalore india and is used as the observed streamflow data to calibrate the hydrologic model rainfall and meteorological variables viz maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity at daily time steps are used for hydrologic simulation in order to incorporate the large spatial heterogeneity rainfall data from 9 stations are used in this study locations of the stations for which the downscaled rainfall and meteorological data are available are shown in fig 1 daily rainfall data at these 9 stations in the catchment are available for the period 1971 2000 whereas observed meteorological data are available only for a short period 1993 2000 mass curve analysis of the rainfall data was performed from which the period 1993 2000 was found to be insufficient to represent the entire study period 1971 2000 therefore rainfall and meteorological variables are downscaled from the national centre for environmental prediction ncep reanalysis data for the period 1971 2000 in addition for historic and future time periods rainfall and hydro meteorological variables are downscaled from multiple gcms modified markov model kernel density estimation mmm kde model mehrotra and sharma 2010 is used to downscale rainfall from large scale atmospheric variables to the multiple raingauge stations shown in fig 1 also the k nearest neighbor resampling method is used to downscale the meteorological variables to the single location shown in fig 1 the mmm kde model and the k nearest neighbor resampling methods are explained in the next section based on the easy availability of daily data of the atmospheric variables from the world climate research programme s coupled model intercomparison project phase 3 cmip3 5 gcms are considered in this study these are i bccr bcm2 0 developed by the bjerknes centre for climate research bccr university of bergen norway ii mri cgcm2 developed by the meteorological research institute mri japan iii csiro mk3 5 developed by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro australia iv mpi echam5 developed by the max planck institute for meteorology mpi germany and v ipsl cm4 developed by the institute pierre simon laplace ipsl france the 20th century climate experiment 20c3m for the period 1981 2000 is selected to represent the historic scenario hydrologic impact of climate change is also studied for two 20year future time periods 2046 2065 referred hereafter as mid of the century to represent the mid 21st century and 2081 2100 referred hereafter as end of the century to represent the end of 21st century for each time period required atmospheric variables at gcm grid nodes over the catchment are extracted from a single continuous transient run corresponding to sres a2 emission scenario the a2 scenario which is at the higher end of the sres emission scenarios but not the highest is selected in this study as it would be more informative from impact and adaptation point of view compared to the lower end scenario hydrologic model swat is used to simulate the catchment hydrologic responses for historic and two future time periods under the a2 scenario please note that during the time of this study runs from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were not available nevertheless many studies have raised concerns about whether cmip5 models are capturing the historic monsoon trends accurately kitoh et al 2013 ogata et al 2014 sooraj et al 2014 saha et al 2014 and whether the monsoon projections are reliable in these models sabeerali et al 2014 recent study by shashikanth et al 2014 shows that biases in the statistically downscaled indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr data do not differ significantly for cmip3 and cmip5 data sets in this study future estimates of runoff and rainfall are derived using smooth varying atmospheric variables which are considered to be equally well estimated by majority of gcms used in both cmip3 and cmip5 projects mueller and seneviratne 2014 woldemeskel et al 2016 hence the current study is restricted only to the cmip3 data 3 methodology and model description 3 1 statistical downscaling of rainfall and meteorological variables the variable convergence score johnson and sharma 2009 is used to identify the gcm atmospheric variables for use in downscaling daily rainfall these variables include mean sea level pressure mslp north south n s gradient of mslp temperature depressions td at 850hpa 700hpa 500hpa n s gradient of td at 850hpa u and v components of the wind velocities at 850hpa equivalent potential temperature ept at 850hpa n s gradient of the geopotential height gph at 700hpa specific humidity sph at 500hpa n s gradient of sph at 500hpa and e w gradient of sph at 850hpa mehrotra et al 2013 the selected gcm atmospheric variables for 20c3m 1981 2000 and future time periods 2046 65 and 2081 2100 are then bias corrected by adopting a nested bias correction procedure johnson and sharma 2012 the nested bias correction nbc method offers an improvement over the quantile mapping method by incorporating the persistence of rainfall through lag 1 autocorrelation also corrections are nested from finer to coarser time scales by which the gcm outputs are corrected for biases in mean standard deviation and lag 1 auto correlation at daily monthly seasonal and annual time scales simultaneously any biases in the gcm atmospheric fields are thus removed before their use for downscaling while the mean shift from current to future climate is preserved previous studies have demonstrated successful use of nbc for bias correction of atmospheric variables in reproducing the observed low frequency variability in the rainfall simulations johnson and sharma 2011 sharma et al 2012 ojha et al 2013 modified markov model kernel density estimation mmm kde modelling framework mehrotra and sharma 2010 is used to downscale rainfall at multiple sites in the catchment the model operates in two steps in the first step the modified markov model mmm is used to identify wet and dry days and in the second step intensity of rainfall during wet days is estimated using the kernel density estimation kde approach a wet day is defined as a day with rainfall greater than or equal to 0 3mm markov model is a stochastic model that predicts a state variable at any point of time as a function of the variable in the previous time step in mmm to include the influence of changing climate the simple markov model is modified by including atmospheric predictors as conditioning variables thus in mmm probability of occurrence of a wet or dry day consists of two terms first term showing the transition probability of rainfall similar to a simple markov model and the second term showing the effect of inclusion of a predictor set consisting of the atmospheric variables of interest the kde approach simulates the intensity of rainfall during each time step which is identified as a wet day by the mmm based on the rainfall intensity of previous time step and selected atmospheric variables conditional nonparametric multivariate probability density of rainfall amount rt for day t for each site may be defined as follows mehrotra et al 2013 1 f r t x t i 1 n 1 2 π λ 2 s 1 2 w i exp r i b i 2 2 λ 2 s where λ is the kernel bandwidth and xt is the vector representing the climate variables influencing the rainfall s is the measure of spread of the conditional density and bi is the conditional mean both expressed in terms of covariance between r and x wi is the weight associated with each kernel since rainfall at multiple stations are considered in this study spatial dependence over these point locations at each time step is incorporated by using uniform random variates that are independent in time but exhibit a strong dependence across the multiple point locations considered more details on the mmm kde model structure are available in mehrotra and sharma 2010 and mehrotra et al 2013 mmm kde model produces multiple realizations of the downscaled variables in this study 20 such realizations generated for 20c3m and the future scenarios are considered and the average hydrologic responses are estimated for each scenario daily values of maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity are downscaled from the large scale atmospheric variables using the k nearest neighbor resampling 3 2 arcswat arcswat is the soil and water assessment tool swat with a powerful user interface integrated with the arcgis platform winchell et al 2007 swat is a conceptual model capable of simulating the catchment hydrologic processes at a continuous time scale arnold et al 1998 capability of swat to simulate basin level hydrologic characteristics for varying land use and climate conditions makes it a widely adopted tool for climate change studies related to hydrology wang et al 2008 bae et al 2011 ficklin et al 2012 geographical information system gis interface of arcswat allows the users to provide spatially referenced data using the topographical information arcswat divides the catchment into sub basins each sub basin is further divided into homogeneous hydrological response units hrus using the spatially distributed soil land use land cover and slope information each hru is vertically divided into different control volumes like surface layer root zone shallow aquifer and deep aquifer different approaches and approximations are used to partition the precipitation into various hydrologic components in these control volumes a part of the precipitation is available as surface runoff and the remaining portion infiltrates into the soil layer partitioning of rainfall into surface runoff and infiltration is achieved using the soil conservation services curve number scs cn method scs 1972 embedded in arcswat large number of studies conducted over a wide range of catchments have shown that swat gives reasonably good simulation of the surface runoff processes steenhuis et al 1995 ponce and hawkins 1996 mishra and singh 2004 reshmidevi et al 2008 runoff from each hru is further routed through channels to the watershed outlet using the variable storage method williams 1969 a part of infiltrated water leaves the soil layer as lateral flow which is estimated using a kinematic flow equation involving saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil layer slope drainable porosity and drainable volume of water present in the layer another fraction of water that reaches the soil layer percolates further and joins the groundwater storage which is called groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is computed as a function of drainable volume of water present in the soil layer this groundwater recharge may be further divided into shallow aquifer recharge and deep aquifer recharge reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2012 shallow aquifer storage contributes to the groundwater flow and adds to the streamflow within the watershed whereas groundwater flow from the deep aquifer is assumed to meet the stream only outside the catchment in this study hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 available in the arcswat interface is used for estimating potential evapotranspiration pet arcswat provides options to define various agricultural operations for each crop at the hru level irrigation requirement for the crops is defined according to the plant water stress condition reshmidevi and nagesh kumar 2012 digital elevation model of the catchment spatial variation in soil and lu lc are the primary spatially referenced data used in arcswat rainfall and meteorological data viz maximum and minimum temperature and relative humidity at daily time step are also used as input to the model details of arcswat components can be found in literature arnold et al 1998 3 3 arcswat calibration and validation arcswat v 2009 is applied at daily time scale over the study area the catchment is first divided into 12 sub basins and each sub basin is further divided into hrus using the lu lc soil and slope information irrigated areas in the catchment are identified and the irrigation application is defined when plant water stress exceeds a threshold of 0 95 daily values of rainfall at 9 stations and hydro meteorological variables at the single location shown in fig 1 are downscaled from the reanalysis data and are used for model calibration and validation simulated discharge is compared with the observed monthly streamflow data the period 1971 2000 is selected in this study out of which the first two years are used as the warm up period for the model and the period 1973 2000 is used for model calibration and validation multiple realizations of the downscaled rainfall and climate variables produced by mmm kde approach are used in the hydrologic modelling in order to derive stable values of model parameters during calibration concatenated data set is formed using multiple realizations from the ensemble of 20 realizations first 9 realizations are used for calibration and the remaining 11 realizations are used for model validation each realization being of 28years excluding the warm up period total length of the calibration run is thus 252years model sensitivity analysis is performed using latin hypercube lh and one factor at a time oat methods included in the arcswat van griensven 2005 and the sensitive parameters are manually calibrated capability of the model to accurately produce flow duration curve fdc for the annual and monsoon june september streamflows is considered as the evaluation criteria during calibration using monthly streamflow simulations from the model annual and monsoon streamflows are calculated for each realization and the average fdcs for the annual and monsoon periods are generated deviation of the simulated fdc from the observed fdc is measured using mean absolute relative error mare as given in eq 2 2 mare 1 n i 1 n q obs q sim q sim where n is the number of points considered from the fdc qobs and qsim are the corresponding flow values from the observed fdc and the simulated fdc respectively 3 4 multi model ensemble projection under the future scenario ensemble of simulations from the hydrologic model obtained by using rainfall and meteorological data from the 5 gcms is used to evaluate the hydrologic impact of climate change in the catchment by comparing hydrologic responses in the future time periods with that obtained under 20c3m scenario when the temporal periods do not overlap fdcs are commonly used for comparing the flow regimes in the hydrologic analyses sugawara 1979 yu and yang 2000 westerberg et al 2011 since the temporal periods of the 20c3m and the future scenarios do not overlap fdcs of annual and monsoon flows are used here for the comparison a weighted ensemble average approach is used to derive ensemble average streamflow simulation from the 5 gcms arcswat is run using the downscaled rainfall and meteorological data from each gcm and fdcs for the annual and monsoon flows are generated simulated fdcs for 20c3m scenario are then compared against fdcs of the observed streamflow data for the same period deviation of the simulated fdcs from the observed fdc expressed in terms of mare is used as the evaluation criterion for each hydrologic simulation using input from different gcms mare of the annual and monsoon fdcs are estimated and the mean of these two values is used to derive the weight for each simulation using eq 3 3 weight 1 meanmare m 1 5 1 meanmare where m is the model index using this set of weights weighted fdcs of the annual and monsoon flows are generated for the 20c3m scenario and are used as the reference fdcs to quantify the future changes in the streamflow gcms simulating the historic scenario satisfactorily are expected to be capable of simulating the future scenarios reasonably well reichler and kim 2008 errasti et al 2010 therefore the weights derived for the hydrologic simulations under 20c3m scenario are adopted for the future time periods as well hydrologic responses of the catchment under the future time periods mid of the century and end of the century are simulated by using the downscaled rainfall and meteorological variables from each gcm and the fdcs of both annual and monsoon flows are generated further using the set of weights derived from the 20c3m scenario weighted average fdcs for the future scenarios are generated future projections are compared with 20c3m simulations to quantify the streamflow variation under future scenarios a flowchart of the methodology is shown in fig 2 hydrologic simulations from the 5 gcms are aggregated to find variations in other water budget components viz potential evapotranspiration pet actual evapotranspiration et irrigation demand and groundwater recharge in the future time periods 3 5 test for statistical significance statistical significance of projected changes in the mean annual and monsoon streamflows is evaluated using non parametric rank based mann whitney test wilcoxon 1945 mann and whitney 1947 mann whitney test is commonly used to identify statistical significance of the difference in mean or median of hydrological time series lettenmaier 1976 xu et al 2003 caloiero et al 2011 the test is based on the null hypothesis that medians of the two series compared are the same and the alternate hypothesis that they differ significantly from one another when two series of size n 1 and n 2 are compared the standardized test statistic is represented as follows chen et al 2006 4 z c r 1 n 1 n 1 n 2 1 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 12 where r 1 is the rank sum of the values in series 1 the ranks are assigned by combining all the values in series 1 and 2 and arranging them in the ascending order for a large sample size the null hypothesis is rejected in other words a difference between the medians is established at a significance level α when the probability of occurrence of zc obtained from the standardized normal distribution table is greater than or equal to 1 α 2 in this study the weighted average annual and monsoon streamflow series of the future time periods are compared against the 20c3m scenario and the test statistic is derived this test statistic is used to find the corresponding α which indicates the statistical significance of difference in the medians of the two streamflow series compared 4 results and discussion 4 1 arcswat calibration and validation dem soil map and lu lc map of the malaprabha catchment are used as spatially referenced input to arcswat to simulate the catchment hydrological processes the model is run at daily time scale using downscaled rainfall and hydro meteorological data from the reanalysis data set streamflow simulations at daily time scale are aggregated to monthly scale and are compared with the observed data table 1 shows the mare values for annual and monsoon flows mare is found to be less than 0 1 for both calibration and validation phases further monthly streamflow data series is generated taking average of 20 realizations used for calibration and validation and the same is compared with the observed monthly streamflow data in fig 3 simulated monthly streamflow series matches well with the observed data albeit slight underestimation of the peak flow values nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient is found to be 0 82 which is considered to be excellent according to the general performance rating for monthly streamflow recommended by moriasi et al 2007 since a simple averaged monthly flow is used as the benchmark model in nse higher values of nse may be due to the high seasonality of the monthly data therefore as recommended by schaefli and gupta 2007 an additional index nseb is also used in this study to evaluate the model performance long term average streamflow for each month is used as the benchmark model to calculate nseb during the calibration period nseb is obtained as 0 74 for the monthly streamflow simulations higher values of nse and nseb indicate better performance of the current hydrologic model compared to the selected benchmark models the calibrated hydrologic model is used to simulate hydrological responses under 20c3m scenario simulated fdcs of annual and monsoon flows obtained using the downscaled rainfall and meteorological data from the 5 gcms are compared with the fdcs of the observed data in fig 4 table 2 shows the mare of the annual and monsoon flows for the 5 gcms and the corresponding weights using the set of weights weighted average fdc for the 20c3m scenario is derived which is also plotted in fig 4 the weighted average annual fdc matches well with the observed data with the exception of some underestimation of moderate and low monsoon flows this may be mainly due to the small differences between the observed and the downscaled rainfall data in terms of annual wet days and the amount of rainfall per wet day mehrotra et al 2013 since bias corrected gcm outputs are used in the downscaling such variations may be due to systemic errors from the downscaling model and therefore may persist for the future scenarios as well hence to quantify the future changes in the streamflow hydrologic responses in the future time periods are compared with the weighted ensemble average streamflow for the 20c3m scenario 4 2 hydrologic responses in the future fig 5 presents the weighted ensemble average fdcs of the annual and monsoon flows for the 20c3m mid of the century and end of the century scenarios from which some interesting observations can be drawn moderate corresponding to 40 60 exceedance probability and high corresponding to 10 exceedance probability streamflows at both annual and monsoon timescales show nominal increases for the mid of the century scenario whereas low flows corresponding to 90 exceedance probability show some reduction in the future fig 5a and b streamflow projections for the end of the century show an overall reduction in monsoon flows as seen from fig 5b this may be attributed to the changes in the rainfall pattern projected towards the end of the century and an increase in the evaporation demand study conducted by mehrotra et al 2013 shows a plausible reduction in the number of short 2 4days duration and moderate 5 7days duration wet spells whereas an increase in the rainfall amounts from short moderate and long more than 7days duration wet spells over the study area by the mid of the century on the other hand short 2 9days duration and moderate 10 18days duration dry spells are projected to increase under the future scenarios mehrotra et al 2013 projected increase in the dry spells is likely to cause a reduction in the annual and monsoon low flows using the weighted ensemble simulation mean annual and monsoon flows are calculated for mid of the century and end of the century scenarios in addition annual and monsoon streamflow values corresponding to 10 90 and 95 exceedance probability are also estimated from the fdcs which are given in table 3 since streamflow values with less than 10 exceedance probability indicate peak flows years corresponding to the peak flows are called wet years on the other hand 90 and 95 dependable flows indicate lower annual flows and the years in which annual average flow corresponds to 90 or 95 dependable flows are considered as the low flow years or dry years the results show an increase in the average annual and monsoon flows in the mid of the century scenario the study also shows an increase in peak flows as indicated by the increase in the annual and monsoon streamflow values corresponding to 10 exceedance probability accordingly in the mid of the century more number of years are projected to have annual streamflow in excess of the current peak flow corresponding to 10 exceedance probability in other words more number of wet years are projected under the mid of the century scenario further a reduction in the 90 and 95 dependable flows indicate an increase in the number of dry years in other words frequencies of both wet and dry years are projected to increase towards the mid of the century some of the previous studies analyzing the historic rainfall in the 20th century have also reported an increase in the wet and dry years in the changing climate conditions changnon 1987 sousa et al 2009 streamflow simulations for the end of the century scenario show some reduction in mean annual and monsoon flows corresponding to 10 exceedance probability whereas no significant changes in the lower flows 90 and 95 dependability this implies that frequency of wet years is likely to decrease towards the end of the century these changes however are insignificant as indicated by the mann whitney test the test statistics and significance levels of the percentage changes in the mean annual and monsoon flows are presented in table 4 although the projected changes in mean annual and monsoon flows are not significant the intra annual variation of flows needs to be analysed box whisker plots of the weighted ensemble average monthly flows for the 20c3m and the two future scenarios are shown in fig 6 these plots show some variations in the monthly flows during the monsoon period median and the 75 percentile flows are projected to increase in june while some reduction is noted during july and august under the future scenario close to 25 reduction in the streamflow is observed in july towards the end of the century being the peak sowing period for the kharif crops in india any drop in the water availability in july in the future scenario may have adverse impact on the agriculture 4 3 climate change impact on water budget components monthly hydrologic simulations of the catchment under the 20c3m and future scenarios are used to analyse the changes in other catchment water budget components as well variations in et irrigation demand and groundwater recharge are estimated under the projected climate conditions fig 7 shows the variations in streamflow and irrigation demand with the changes in rainfall and temperature in general an increase in rainfall causes an increase in streamflow rainfall projections from various gcms vary from 10 9 to 8 4 with respect to the 20c3m scenario whereas the streamflow projections vary from 20 6 to 9 0 towards the end of the 21st century fig 7a likewise the irrigation demand is projected to increase by 3 2 to 15 7 across various gcms by the end of the 21st century fig 7b from fig 7a and b it can be observed that changes in the streamflow and irrigation demand are largely related to the variation in rainfall and the gcm nevertheless small deviations may be observed which may be attributed to the changes in tmax and tmin as shown in fig 7c to f for example using bccr bcm2 0 larger increases in irrigation demand towards the end of the century is projected which may be attributed to the highest increase in tmax as shown in fig 7d likewise results from csiro mk3 5 project significant reduction in streamflow and increase in irrigation demand which may be attributed to the combined effect of large increases in tmax and tmin and significant reduction in rainfall fig 8 shows the catchment water budget components for the 20c3m scenario at the annual time scale as well as for the monsoon period evapotranspiration is the major abstraction from the rainfall amounting close to 70 annually and close to 45 during the monsoon period irrigation supplements the crop water demand to a large extent ground water recharge is the amount of water that reaches the shallow aquifer a part of it appears as groundwater flow and contributes to the streamflow at the watershed outlet percentage changes in the water budget components projected under the future scenario with respect to 20c3m scenario at the annual time scale are shown in fig 9 a weighted ensemble average simulations show marginal increases in annual average rainfall under the future scenarios 2 2 towards the mid of the century and 1 6 towards the end of the century though the changes in the annual average rainfall are nominal the variations in the rainfall pattern in terms of number and durations of wet and dry spells are of major concern tmax is projected to increase by 0 51 c and 0 84 c 1 8 and 2 9 towards the mid of the century and end of the century respectively similarly tmin is projected to increase by 0 29 c and 0 46 c 1 5 and 2 4 towards the mid of the century and end of the century respectively with changes in temperature and rainfall pattern evapotranspiration rates are projected to increase by 2 3 and 4 1 respectively for the mid of the century and end of the century scenarios runoff ratio ratio of average annual runoff to average annual rainfall of the catchment is found to be 0 4184 0 4178 and 0 4083 for 20c3m mid of the century and end of the century scenarios respectively the 2 5 reduction in the runoff ratio shows 1 2 reduction in the annual average streamflow towards the end of the century in addition groundwater recharge rates are also projected to decline by 7 3 towards the end of the century the projected variations in the water budget component may be attributed to the increase in the temperature as well as the changes in the rainfall pattern in the catchment under the future scenarios the upper catchment is under tropical humid zone whereas the lower catchment is under semi arid agro climatic zone with limited moisture availability increase in precipitation and temperature therefore results in increase in evapotranspiration from the catchment and consequently increase in the irrigation demand projected increases in the short and moderate rainfall events are likely to cause more infiltration into the soil layer thus a relatively less fraction of rainfall would appear as streamflow at watershed outlet on the other hand projected increases in the short and moderate dry spells results in more soil moisture extraction to meet the increased evapotranspiration rates thereby reducing the groundwater recharge monsoon rainfall being the source of water for the catchment projected changes in the water budget components during the monsoon season is also studied fig 9 b during the monsoon period the rainfall is projected to decline by 1 4 towards the end of the century reduction in the rainfall together with the increase in the temperature is projected to result in 18 5 increase in the irrigation demand during the monsoon period in addition streamflow is also projected to decline under the future scenarios the analysis shows that percentage changes in the water budget components are more during the monsoon period this may be attributed to the changes in the rainfall distribution in the form of reduction in the short and moderate wet spells and increase in the dry spells the projected increase in irrigation demand when combined with the likely reduction in the recharge would aggravate the water scarcity problems of the area which is already identified as a groundwater overexploited region 5 summary and conclusions this study explores the impacts of climate change on the hydrology and water budget components of the malaprabha catchment for two future periods mid of the 21st century 2046 2065 and end of the century 2081 2100 in order to address the uncertainty issues that arise from the use of a single gcm an ensemble of 5 gcms mpi echam5 bccr bcm2 0 csiro mk3 5 ipsl cm4 and mri cgcm2 is used in this study large scale climate variables simulated by the gcms are first bias corrected using the nbc approach and are used to downscale rainfall and meteorological variables at the catchment level using mmm kde model rainfall and meteorological variables downscaled from each of the 5 gcms are used as input to a conceptual hydrological model and the corresponding hydrological components for current and future climate scenarios are simulated hydrologic simulations using inputs from various gcms are evaluated for their ability to simulate the hydrologic responses for the 20c3m scenario and the weights are assigned accordingly weighted ensemble average outputs are used to analyse the changes in hydrologic components under the future scenarios not many studies have attempted similar kind of work for indian catchments the limited data availability and the large scale heterogeneity in the catchment characteristics often hinders such studies standing within the constraints of data availability the study is an efforts to analyse the hydrologic sensitivity of the catchment under the projected climate change scenarios this would be a stepping stone to understand the climate change vulnerability of the catchment the results show only marginal changes in annual average rainfall in the catchment under the future scenarios corresponding changes in the hydrologic components are also found to be statistically insignificant both for the annual and monsoon periods even though the changes in the streamflow and irrigation demand are strongly related to the variation in rainfall they are not directly proportional to each other such deviations may be attributed to the gcms used as well as the changes in rainfall pattern and atmospheric temperature with 0 84 c and 0 46 c increases in the daily maximum and minimum temperatures towards the end of the century evapotranspiration rate is projected to increase by 4 1 irrigation demand is projected to increase by 7 7 and groundwater recharge is projected to decline by 7 3 streamflow projections for the end of the century scenario show nominal reduction in the average annual and monsoon flows changes in rainfall and temperatures are projected to reduce the runoff ratio by 2 5 by the end of the century projected increase in the evapotranspiration and irrigation demand associated with the decrease in the groundwater recharge and streamflow is an indication of possible aggravation of the water stress in the catchment in future hydrological analyses to investigate the impact of climate change on the catchment water balance are affected by the uncertainty in the climate projections as well as the uncertainty in the hydrological model itself in order to reduce the uncertainty in the climate projection in the present study an ensemble of gcms included in the cmip 3 data sets are used to derive the climate projections on the other hand uncertainty in the hydrological model still persists even though the streamflow simulations are validated with respect to the observed data lack of sufficient observed data for the catchment restricts the validation of the other water budget components the use of an ensemble of hydrological models may help to address this issue to some extent nevertheless as reported in literature wolock and mccabe 1999 arnell and liv 2001 the study helps to indicate the sensitivity of the hydrologic systems to the climate change analysis using cmip5 models and representative concentration pathways might help to further understand the impact of climate change projections over the region acknowledgements this work is supported by the department of science and

7612,hydrologic modeling and other geophysical applications are sensitive to precipitation forcing data quality and there are known challenges in spatially distributing gauge based precipitation over complex terrain we conduct a comparison of six high resolution daily and monthly gridded precipitation datasets over the western united states we compare the long term average spatial patterns and interannual variability of water year total precipitation as well as multi year trends in precipitation across the datasets we find that the greatest absolute differences among datasets occur in high elevation areas and in the maritime mountain ranges of the western united states while the greatest percent differences among datasets relative to annual total precipitation occur in arid and rain shadowed areas differences between datasets in some high elevation areas exceed 200mmyr 1 on average and relative differences range from 5 to 60 across the western united states in areas of high topographic relief true uncertainties and biases are likely higher than the differences among the datasets we present evidence of this based on streamflow observations precipitation trends in the datasets differ in magnitude and sign at smaller scales and are sensitive to how temporal inhomogeneities in the underlying precipitation gauge data are handled keywords precipitation hydroclimatology gridded forcing data orographic enhancement uncertainty climate trends 1 introduction the use of spatially distributed precipitation data has grown as distributed hydrologic ecological and land surface models which generally require distributed precipitation as an input have made advances in resolution and process representation in addition distributed precipitation data are needed for the validation of weather and climate models and of new precipitation datasets based on remote sensing e g behrangi et al 2016 in the extensive mountainous terrain of the western united states observations of precipitation are largely limited to in situ precipitation gauges this is because ground based radar measurements of precipitation have limited effectiveness in mountainous areas due to terrain blockage westrick et al 1999 and current satellite based remote sensing of precipitation lacks sufficient spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy in quantifying solid phase precipitation lettenmaier et al 2015 as a result it is necessary to generate distributed estimates of precipitation based on measurements made at the point gauge scale estimation of precipitation fields in complex terrain from gauge observations is challenging due to high spatial and temporal variability many observational studies have demonstrated that topography can produce large differences in precipitation over small spatial scales and these differences are apparent over both event and climatological timescales e g frei and schar 1998 minder et al 2008 roe 2005 in addition precipitation gauge networks are sparser in high elevation mountainous areas e g lundquist et al 2003 due to limited access and infrastructure and gauges often suffer significant undercatch errors in snow dominated and windy areas rasmussen et al 2012 sieck et al 2007 thus there is the potential for substantial uncertainty in the distribution of precipitation inferred from gauge observations for datasets covering the mountainous western united states distributed precipitation information is typically generated via spatial interpolation of gauge observations with adjustment for elevation given the role of orographic enhancement in precipitation cosgrove et al 2003 daly et al 2008 1994 hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 hamlet et al 2010 livneh et al 2015 2013 maurer et al 2002 newman et al 2015 thornton et al 1997 xia et al 2012 the time interval of the data may be hourly daily monthly or multi year because many precipitation gauges provide data daily this is the most common interval spatial resolution can vary depending on the goals of the dataset and ranges from about 1km to hundreds of km for global datasets though significant smoothing of the topography occurs at coarser resolutions which limits the representation of mountain precipitation thus we focus here on datasets with spatial resolution of no larger than 1 8 12km and with daily or monthly time intervals because of the complex orographic effects on precipitation it is useful to include a long term empirical climatology of precipitation when applying a topographic correction the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 1994 provides 30 year spatial precipitation climatologies at 800m resolution over the continental united states the prism methodology uses multiple gauge networks and weighted linear regression of precipitation with elevation that takes into account many empirical influences on the long term mean spatial pattern which for precipitation include topographical aspect and complexity and coastal proximity the spatial prism precipitation climatologies are used in other gridded datasets cosgrove et al 2003 hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 livneh et al 2015 2013 maurer et al 2002 schaake et al 2004 as a way of understanding the relationship between precipitation at the gauge with that over the surrounding terrain this can be accomplished by forcing long term average precipitation patterns to match prism climatology or by using prism in weighted spatial interpolation thus prism climatology plays an important role in many distributed estimates of precipitation in the western united states see table 1 of lundquist et al 2015 due to the challenges in estimating precipitation over complex terrain multiple studies have demonstrated uncertainty or biases in the estimates of precipitation in gridded datasets in two cases in the colorado rocky mountains where precipitation gauges had not been incorporated into the prism dataset differences between predicted and observed precipitation of hundreds of mm per year were found or 50 100 of the annual total gutmann et al 2012 livneh et al 2014 lundquist et al 2015 compared daily increases in sierra nevada snow pillow snow water equivalent swe to daily gridded dataset precipitation and found an individual water year in which the gridded products had up to 21 too little precipitation to account for snow pillow swe increases because gridded precipitation datasets use topography as a predictor and precipitation gauges tend to be located at lower elevations we hypothesize that uncertainties and thus differences between datasets will be larger at higher elevations gridded precipitation datasets have been used for many purposes such as assessing climatic trends in streamflow and snowpack e g hamlet et al 2007 2005 downscaling of global climate models e g gutmann et al 2014 estimating forest transpiration patterns and trends christensen et al 2008 and assessing ecological impacts of climate change e g ogden et al 2014 see table 1 of lundquist et al 2015 which shows that various gridded precipitation datasets have been cited thousands of times in the literature primarily in the fields of hydrology ecology and atmospheric science in hydrologic modeling for example errors and biases in precipitation forcing data have been shown to impact the reliability of model calibration and regionalization renard et al 2010 to have dramatic impacts on simulations of hydrologic variables such as snowpack raleigh et al 2015 and to confound efforts to predict the effects of climate change on regional hydrology mendoza et al 2015 additionally biases in gridded precipitation datasets may hinder evaluation of regional and global climate models caldwell et al 2009 gutmann et al 2014 thus how precipitation is represented in these datasets including its uncertainty and bias has wide ranging scientific and operational implications in particular hydrologic modelers should be cognizant of the potential for biased precipitation forcing data that is implied by differences between gridded datasets and so this study is conducted with modeling implications in mind systematic evaluation of differences among gridded precipitation datasets would help make modelers aware of the magnitudes of the uncertainty associated with precipitation datasets with the exception of a small number of heavily instrumented research watersheds e g daly et al 2017 there is currently no ground truth for distributed precipitation in complex terrain beyond the often sparse gauge measurements making it challenging to estimate uncertainty some datasets explicitly estimate and publish the uncertainty in the methodology used to generate them newman et al 2015 or compare the differences in mean spatial patterns between datasets livneh et al 2015 however we are not aware of prior studies that have evaluated the differences between high resolution gridded precipitation accumulations over a comprehensive spatial domain over many years in this study we first describe the six gridded precipitation datasets that we compare over the western united states section 2 then we describe the methods used to calculate differences among them section 3 and then we present these differences in terms of their climatological pattern interannual variability and multi year trends section 4 we discuss potential reasons for these differences and assess the implications of the differences on hydrologic applications in section 5 and conclude in section 6 2 data we compare six publicly available gridded precipitation datasets over the western united states hamlet et al 2010 hereafter h10 which extends an earlier dataset hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 livneh et al 2015 hereafter l15 which extends the earlier dataset of maurer et al 2002 prism 2 5 arc minute 4km monthly data hereafter prism m nldas 2 cosgrove et al 2003 xia et al 2012 newman et al 2015 hereafter n15 and daymet thornton et al 1997 table 1 describes each dataset s major characteristics and methodological choices see also lundquist et al 2015 their table 1 and newman et al 2015 their table 1 for similar comparisons among gridded datasets we chose these datasets because they are publicly available have sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to capture precipitation in the complex terrain of the western united states and represent several independent efforts to distribute precipitation across complex terrain from gauge observations the h10 and l15 datasets share several characteristics both are at 1 16 6km spatial resolution use united states national weather service cooperative observer nws coop network precipitation gauge data and both use prism precipitation climatology the 1971 2000 version for h10 and the 1981 2010 version for l15 for topographic correction in which the interpolated gauge data are rescaled for each month and grid cell by the ratio of their corresponding 30 year average to the prism climatology this results in monthly long term averages matching prism over the corresponding time period but daily variation is different between h10 and l15 in addition to prism h10 employs an additional correction such that trends in the dataset are not influenced by gauge data that is available only for partial periods the precipitation time series at each grid cell is rescaled to match spatially interpolated temporally filtered trends from a subset of long term stations hamlet et al 2010 this ensures that trends in h10 match interpolated trends at long term stations in contrast l15 does not perform a temporal correction but does only include stations with at least 20years of data to minimize inhomogeneities h10 data are available from 1916 to 2006 across the western united states while l15 data are available from 1950 to 2013 for the western united states all of mexico and portions of southern canada the prism climate group prism oregonstate edu makes gridded precipitation datasets available at different spatial resolutions and time intervals here we use the monthly 2 5 arc minute precipitation totals time series prism m 2 5 arc minute daily precipitation grids are also freely available but we use monthly totals here because we conduct comparisons only at monthly timescales or longer the prism m dataset has higher spatial resolution 2 5 arc minutes or 4km than h10 and l15 it also utilizes prism climatology to inform the interpolation at the monthly timescale and it incorporates a much broader array of precipitation gauges than the coop network monthly precipitation data are available beginning in 1895 though we use a dataset of more recent monthly totals that begins in 1981 the north american land data assimilation system project phase 2 nldas 2 retrospective precipitation data is generated from the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration climate prediction center s noaa cpc gauge based precipitation analysis which itself includes coop daily reports gridded through optimal interpolation to 1 8 12km resolution nldas 2 data are further disaggregated to hourly resolution using hourly fractions of cpc daily precipitation derived from national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage ii radar data where available cosgrove et al 2003 however we consider only daily totals in this analysis nldas 2 precipitation fields are scaled for each month to match prism 1961 1990 climatology xia et al 2012 and are available beginning in 1979 the n15 dataset is an extension of the approach of clark and slater 2006 which uses probabilistic interpolation and multiple linear regression against topographic predictors latitude longitude elevation and aspect that is independent of prism n15 samples the uncertainty associated with the regression of precipitation observations against topography this is accomplished using spatially correlated random numbers to generate a 100 member ensemble of daily gridded precipitation over the continental united states thus the uncertainty of the daily precipitation is explicitly estimated at each grid cell via the ensemble newman et al 2015 the underlying precipitation data come from the coop network as well as the natural resources conservation service s snow telemetry snotel network of precipitation gauges snotel precipitation is adjusted using a wind undercatch correction the daily ensemble dataset is available at 1 8 12km resolution over 1980 2012 compared to the other datasets daymet thornton et al 1997 provides higher 1km spatial resolution of daily precipitation from 1980 to the latest full calendar year the dataset uses coop and snotel precipitation gauges and applies weighted linear regression of precipitation against elevation using weights that depend on distance from the grid cell center using a truncated gaussian filter and other factors the topographic regression is independent of prism climatology in addition to the distributed precipitation datasets we consider streamflow and swe observations from the sierra nevada mountain range of california in this analysis because the six datasets above generally make use of most or all available precipitation gauge observations in mountainous areas in order to generate distributed estimates evaluation of the datasets against independent precipitation observations is difficult however we can compare interannual variability and trends in streamflow and swe observations against their equivalents in the distributed precipitation datasets as we would expect there to be correlation between the two therefore we use a dataset of daily streamflow measurements from 30 stream gauges and april 1 swe observations from 161 snow courses and 26 snow pillows in the sierra nevada the streamflow dataset was compiled as part of a study on inferring sierra nevada precipitation from streamflow henn et al 2018 these gauges measure streamflow from basins without diversions or reservoir storage larger than a few percent of annual flow volumes most basins have no diversions or dams and had 90 complete observations over water years 1982 2006 we use daily streamflow volumes and compute water year totals for each basin the majority of the streamflow data are from usgs sites while two sites are full natural flows estimated by reservoir operators from release and storage measurements for a list of streamflow sites see supplementary material table s1 the swe observations are mainly from california department of water resources cdwr courses and pillows as well as several snotel sites in the sierra nevada and also include only sites that had 90 complete april 1 measurements over 1982 2006 swe observation sites are listed in the supplementary material table s2 3 methods 3 1 regridding of datasets for comparison given of the disparate spatial resolutions of the datasets table 1 it is necessary to resample the datasets to a common grid in order to directly compare precipitation values we conduct two resampling operations first we aggregate the higher resolution 800m prism climatology to the coarser grids of the other datasets for comparison of climatological patterns second we also aggregate each of the higher resolution datasets h10 l15 prism m and daymet to the coarser 1 8 grid of nldas 2 and n15 the second resampling allows for comparison of water year precipitation totals across all datasets when resampling the 30 arc second 800m prism grid to the 2 5 arc minute 4km 1 16 6km and 1 8 12km grids we averaged all of the 800m grid cells inside the coarser grid cells to calculate the resampled grid due to the fairly similar grid cell sizes when resampling the 800m prism grid to the 1km daymet grid we used bilinear interpolation instead to avoid biases associated with some 1km grid cells containing multiple 800m cell centers while some contain only one when resampling the coarser datasets to the 1 8 grid we calculated the resampled 1 8 grid cells as the average of the higher resolution cells within each coarser cell 3 2 comparison of water year total precipitation the six datasets have a temporal overlap that covers water years 1982 2006 for each water year and for each grid cell in the 1 8 domain covering the western united states defined here as areas in the united states from 32 to 49 n and 105 to 125 w we converted daily or hourly datasets to water year totals by summing all times between 1 october of the previous year and 30 september we then calculated the pairwise differences between each dataset and every other datasets for each year we calculate the mean absolute difference mad between a pair of datasets at a grid cell as 1 mad i j 1 n k 1 n abs p i k p j k where i j indicates the difference between datasets i and j k indicates the water year n is the total number of water years and p i k and p j k indicate the water year total precipitation for datasets i and j respectively for water year k we then calculate the mean relative difference mrd between a pair of datasets which is defined as 2 mrd i j 1 n k 1 n abs p i k p j k 1 6 m 1 6 p m k where m indicates the dataset and p m k indicates the water year total precipitation for that dataset and year in other words the mrd is the absolute difference between a pair of datasets for a given year and grid cell divided by the six dataset mean precipitation for that year and grid cell and averaged over all water years this provides an indication of the magnitude of the average differences between a pair of datasets at a grid cell relative to an estimate of the average precipitation at that grid cell finally we calculate an estimate of the average differences between one dataset and the others relative to the average differences between the other datasets in the group we define this measure as the mean absolute difference anomaly δmad 3 δ mad i 1 5 j 1 5 mad i j 1 10 k 1 10 mad k where for a given grid cell the first term is the average of the five mean absolute differences between dataset i and the other datasets and the second term is the average of the ten mean absolute differences among all unique pairs in the five datasets here denoted by k not including dataset i this indicator will highlight where a particular dataset tends to have larger positive values or smaller negative values differences with the other datasets relative to the average differences across all datasets 3 3 comparing basin mean precipitation against streamflow for each precipitation dataset we compute basin mean water year total precipitation for four example basins in the sierra nevada from the dataset of streamflow observations described above this accomplished by taking the average water year total precipitation for each grid cell within the basin fractionally weighting the grid cells that are partially within the basin water year total streamflow volumes are divided by the basin area to yield a normalized runoff depth for comparison with precipitation 3 4 calculations of multi year trends we investigate the representation of multi year trends in each dataset by calculating the linear least squares trendline through each dataset s water year total precipitation over the common 1982 2006 period at each grid cell following the convention used by mote et al 2005 we define trends as the change in the fitted trendline over the time period divided by the starting year s best fit value 4 trend β 1 year n year 1 β 1 year 1 β 0 where β 1 and β 0 are the regression coefficients of precipitation against time slope and y intercept respectively and year 1 and year n are the first and last years of the time period we repeat the same trend calculation for the annual streamflow volumes and april 1 swe observation series using only sites with at least 90 of years available over the 1982 2006 time period 4 results 4 1 comparison of climatological patterns we first compare the 1981 2010 average annual precipitation in the nldas 2 n15 and daymet datasets against the prism 1981 2010 annual precipitation climatology fig 1 when compared over the appropriate time period h10 l15 and prism m exactly match by construction the prism climatology and so their differences are not shown compared to the prism climatology fig 1b nldas 2 generally has small differences 100mm in lowland areas but nldas 2 has noticeably less precipitation over high elevation terrain such as the sierra nevada cascade range coast ranges of california and oregon olympic mountains and rocky mountains of colorado utah and idaho these differences average 100 500mm per year over most high elevation areas the n15 dataset s climatological pattern is wetter than nldas 2 fig 1c here we show the mean of the 100 member n15 ensemble many areas of the cascades of washington and oregon particularly their eastern leeward slope as well as the northern rockies are wetter than the prism climatology however n15 is drier than prism in the windward areas of the olympics coast ranges and some portions of the sierra nevada daymet another dataset that does not use prism climatology shows a different mean pattern than the other datasets fig 1d it places less precipitation than prism on the higher portions of the sierra nevada olympics coast ranges northern cascades and colorado rockies but somewhat more precipitation in portions of the northern rockies and in inter mountain valleys of the western united states in section 5 we discuss differences among the datasets in handling of orographic enhancement and rain shadowing when spatially distributing precipitation 4 2 differences in water year precipitation totals in contrast to the long term average spatial patterns in fig 1 in fig 2 we present a comparison of the different datasets estimates of water year total precipitation across the western united states over 1982 2006 fig 2 compares differences among the six datasets with one another both using the absolute and relative differences defined in section 3 2 panels above the diagonal in fig 2 show mad eq 1 for each comparison between pairs of datasets panels below the diagonal show mrd eq 2 between dataset pairs panels on the diagonal show the mean absolute difference anomaly eq 3 for that dataset taken together the above diagonal panels suggest that the highest absolute differences between the datasets occur in the maritime mountain ranges of the western united states sierra nevada coast ranges and cascades with additional significant differences over the rockies thus not surprisingly the largest absolute differences occur in areas with higher mean precipitation where methodological differences interpolation techniques can produce larger differences these are predominantly higher elevation and coastal regions however an examination of dataset pairs differences show significant variation between pairs the h10 l15 and prism m precipitation totals tend to be more similar to one another than the nldas 2 n15 and daymet totals are to other the datasets for example when the spatial distribution of mad is sorted and percentiles are computed the 95th percentile water year total mad between prism m and l15 is 131mm while the 95th percentile absolute difference between nldas 2 and n15 is 375mm in particular n15 has larger differences with other datasets along the eastern slope of the cascade and sierra nevada ranges while nldas 2 and daymet have larger differences at the highest elevation areas of these same ranges table 2 summarizes the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of mad between all dataset pairs the along diagonal panels showing the difference anomalies for each dataset largely confirm these patterns areas where datasets tend to produce significantly different water year totals minus the average differences between the other datasets are shown in red while areas where datasets tend to adhere to the group mean are shown in blue the l15 and prism m datasets and to a lesser extent the h10 dataset behave more similarly in high elevation areas while the nldas 2 and daymet datasets behave less similarly while the n15 dataset has difference anomalies that are most pronounced on the lee sides of the maritime ranges when absolute differences for given water years are divided by the six dataset mean total precipitation to estimate the differences as a fraction of average precipitation fig 2 below diagonal panels different spatial patterns are observed in contrast to mad mrd tends to be greatest in the rain shadows and deserts of the inter mountain western united states while mrd is smallest in coastal lowlands and windward foothills of the maritime ranges the percentiles of mrd for each dataset pair are also shown in table 2 95th percentile mrd largely found in arid and rain shadowed areas areas to the east of maritime mountain ranges was between 0 18 and 0 61 for all dataset pairs to highlight the general patterns of absolute and relative differences we show the mean pattern of each across all dataset pairs in fig 3 a and b maps of these differences are available in geotiff format in the supplementary material for this article and interactively in the online version in fig 3c e we examine two subsets of the overall patterns from the colorado rocky mountains and the cascade mountains of washington and oregon in fig 3c we plot mad from each area against elevation which shows that in both regions absolute differences increase with elevation the relationship with elevation is stronger in the rockies than in the cascades in fig 3d we plot mrd against elevation for both regions while there is still greater relative uncertainty at higher elevations the relationships are weaker than for mad in particular relatively dry regions on the lee of the cascades have high mrd despite being lower in elevation than the crest of the range itself in fig 3e we plot 90 percent confidence range on water year total precipitation from the n15 dataset versus elevation for each of the two subset areas the range of the ensemble dataset increases with elevation in the rockies in a manner similar to the differences between datasets though the n15 90 percent confidence range is larger than the inter dataset mad in fig 3e however the similarity suggests that the methodology used to estimate uncertainty in n15 produces similar uncertainty estimates to the methodological differences between the datasets while a full comparison of sub annual variability in differences between datasets is beyond the scope of this study we briefly examine monthly differences between datasets we compare monthly precipitation totals for each grid cell in the prism m l15 h10 and n15 datasets in fig 4 the absolute and relative differences in fig 4 are averaged over a spatial domain covering the sierra nevada mountain range of california domain shown in fig 5 the monthly analysis shows that mad is greatest during the winter months when most of the precipitation occurs in the climate of the sierra nevada relative differences however are much greater in the summer when precipitation amounts are generally small and often driven by localized convection which is presumably difficult to represent accurately by gauge interpolation thus the monthly differences vary in a similar fashion to the spatial variability shown in fig 3 greater mad occurs in places and times where precipitation is greater whereas mrd is greater in relatively dry locations and times 4 3 comparison of basin mean water year precipitation totals with streamflow observations next we focus on a subset area the sierra nevada mountain range of california for a particular water year 2005 as an illustration of annual differences among datasets fig 5a f show water year precipitation totals across the subset area for each of the six datasets there are major differences in the area of greatest water year total precipitation among the datasets h10 nldas 2 and daymet have the greatest accumulations in the northern portion of the range the yuba and feather river basins in particular nldas 2 and daymet place less precipitation in the central and southern sierra nevada than the other datasets l15 places the greatest accumulations in two areas of the central portion of the range while n15 places the maximum to the north just southwest of lake tahoe prism m has multiple precipitation maxima generally corresponding to the areas of highest elevation and places substantially more precipitation in the southern sierra nevada in particular differences between the datasets for the high elevation areas in the central sierra nevada are seen the differences in these parts of the domain are on the order of 500 1 500mm or 25 60 of the mean water year total precipitation across the six datasets fig 5 also shows the outlines of three basins for which unimpaired streamflow observations are available and one for which full natural flows area available against which precipitation totals can be compared the four basins are a the north fork of the american river at north fork dam usgs gauge 11427000 basin area 884km2 b cherry and eleanor creeks combined basin area 486km2 c the san joaquin river at miller s crossing usgs gauge 11226500 basin area 651km2 and d bear creek usgs gauge 11230500 basin area 136km2 for the combined cherry and eleanor basin we use full natural flows provided by the operator of the reservoirs at both creeks outlets see henn et al 2018 for more information on the streamflow data the comparison of the datasets basin mean water year total precipitation and the comparison against streamflow are shown for water years 1982 2006 in fig 6 fig 6a shows the time series of precipitation for the north fork of the american river for this basin the six datasets tend to cluster closely for each water year and the datasets generally fall within the spread of the n15 ensemble with the exception of nldas 2 in some years when compared against streamflow observations the datasets water year totals mimic the observed temporal variability between wet and dry years and generally are greater than streamflow by 500 1000mm per year a plausible estimate of evaporative losses for this basin e g kurpius et al 2003 for both cherry eleanor and the san joaquin fig 6b and c the gridded datasets precipitation is of a similar magnitude to streamflow san joaquin streamflow observations were not made after 1991 because of the basin water balance given negligible inter annual storage precipitation minus evapotranspiration equals streamflow precipitation that is similar to or less than streamflow implies implausible near zero evapotranspiration in these basins these are examples of the long term precipitation likely being underestimated to varying degrees by all six of the gridded datasets in these cases nldas 2 and daymet in particular the differences between precipitation and streamflow vary substantially between years for each gridded product suggesting that these biases may differ from year to year in an unpredictable fashion in addition the differences among the datasets are much larger in these central and southern sierra nevada basins than in the north fork of the american often falling outside the n15 ensemble estimate of the spread bear creek precipitation fig 6d is more reliably greater than streamflow for most of the datasets except daymet suggesting that precipitation underestimation may be generally less severe in this basin however the agreement among the gridded datasets water year precipitation is worse in this basin with differences of over 500mm or 40 appearing for many years in particular disagreement between l15 and the other datasets in water years 2005 and 2006 is apparent over 1982 2006 the mrds of basin mean water year total precipitation averaged across all combinations of the six datasets were 11 for the north fork of the american 17 for cherry eleanor 21 for san joaquin and 24 for bear however actual uncertainties between the datasets estimates and true basin mean precipitation may be substantially higher if the datasets are collectively biased low or high on average low biases are almost certainly the case for some of these basins given the comparisons to streamflow discussed above 4 4 comparison of precipitation streamflow and snow trends over the sierra nevada we compute trends in water year total precipitation in the six datasets over the time period when all are available over the western united states water years 1982 2006 trends in these six gridded datasets are shown in figs 7 a 6f qualitatively some similarities are noticeable between the datasets trends most or all datasets show increasing precipitation in coastal southern california and decreasing precipitation over the deserts of interior southern california and arizona and parts of the great basin and rocky mountains however the computed trends are also substantially different across the six datasets three of the datasets l15 nldas 2 and daymet exhibit higher frequency spatial variability with large changes in the sign and magnitude of trends over distances of only tens of km these high frequency variations differ between the l15 nldas 2 and daymet datasets the other three datasets h10 prism m and n15 have spatially smoother trends we discuss potential reasons for these trend differences in section 5 in fig 7g we show the mean absolute differences between trends in the six datasets but over a range of grid scales for each grid scale we aggregate the trends in each dataset to a consistent grid and compute mean absolute differences between all dataset pairs in the same manner as the water year total differences fig 7g shows that as the grid scale is increased the differences between trends in datasets decline particularly at grid scales of 1 or coarser this suggests that the datasets disagreement in trends occurs at the smaller scales necessary representing topographical features such as ridges and valleys whereas trends at regional scales are in better agreement to further examine the spatial patterns of 1982 2006 precipitation trends we outline the sierra nevada subset fig 7a f gray dashed box this area is shown in more detail in fig 8 but instead of precipitation trends we plot the 1982 2006 trends in water year total streamflow volumes colored outlines and april 1 swe at snow courses and pillows triangles the trends in streamflow are generally negative over this time period and spatial domain with the greatest decreases in the northern and southern reaches of the range where most gauges show decreases of 10 30 in the central sierra nevada streamflow trends are less negative with most basins trends declining by less than 10 or slightly increasing april 1 swe trends generally correspond spatially with the streamflow trends almost every site shows negative swe trends in the far southern and northern regions of the domain while the central region shows a mix of positive and negative trends of smaller magnitudes swe is influenced by both precipitation and temperature variability and so care should be taken when interpreting trends collectively however these results suggests declines in precipitation at the northern and southern ends of the range but no strong trend in the central portion over 1982 2006 the datasets precipitation trends do not obviously follow the spatial patterns of trends in streamflow and swe while the nldas 2 l15 and daymet trends appear to show decreases at the northern and southern ends of the domain their high frequency variations make them difficult to compare against the trend patterns of h10 prism m and n15 generally show slight decreases across most of the sierra nevada appearing not to reflect the small increases in streamflow and swe seen in the central region these results should be interpreted carefully as it is possible that increases in streamflow and swe could be due to factors other than increasing precipitation however the inter comparison of the datasets and the comparison against streamflow and swe trends suggests that estimation of precipitation trends using gridded datasets is subject to substantial uncertainty in high elevation areas 5 discussion the preceding results show that gridded precipitation datasets which interpolate gauge data across complex terrain may have mean absolute differences in water year total precipitation of several hundred mm in high elevation areas and mean relative differences of 10 30 over many of the same areas absolute differences are consistently larger at higher elevation areas than in nearby lowlands though areas in the lee of the major maritime mountain ranges of the western united states also show high absolute differences the true uncertainty in precipitation in fact may be higher if the datasets collectively underestimate or overestimate precipitation the examination of streamflow observations suggests collective underestimation in some selected areas where absolute differences between datasets are also large these areas may have insufficient gauge observations to robustly interpolate precipitation see below we emphasize that there are no robust observations of distributed precipitation in areas of complex terrain against which to evaluate the datasets so we do not assess whether one dataset is more or less accurate than another instead we examine potential reasons for these differences between datasets as well as the potential biases in water year precipitation totals and trends one driver of the differences in high elevation precipitation estimates is likely the estimation of the relationship between precipitation and elevation in general the number of precipitation gauges declines rapidly with elevation as a result precipitation estimates for high elevation terrain are often extrapolations of precipitation elevation relationships from lower elevation stations all of the datasets considered here assume locally linear relationships between precipitation and elevation that are derived from weighted least squares regression however the details of this estimation are different between datasets prism m and l15 use the prism 1981 2010 climatology itself a modified weighted least squares regression of precipitation against elevation and aspect to establish the local topographic relationship with elevation h10 uses the prism 1971 2000 climatology n15 and daymet conduct independent regressions of precipitation against elevation but differ in how they weight stations with respect to their distance from the grid cell nldas 2 utilizes the prism 1961 1990 climatology and is also subject to influences not present in the other datasets including data from the atmospheric model used in assimilation cosgrove et al 2003 while other differences between the datasets namely the differing sets of precipitation gauge observations discussed below make it difficult to quantify how much of the differences derive from the precipitation elevation uncertainty the results in figs 2 3 and 5 make it clear that differences between datasets increase with elevation one consistent difference in the climatological precipitation patterns between the prism based and other datasets is in how precipitation is distributed over the windward and leeward sides of mountain ranges for example the prism climatological pattern is wetter on the windward slopes of the maritime coast ranges cascades and olympics and is drier on the leeward slopes as compared to n15 and daymet fig 1c and d prism employs several methods to produce sharp gradients of precipitation in the interpolation of gauge data which has a tendency to smooth sharp spatial variation these include more heavily weighting stations on the same topographic aspect as the grid cell and stations having similar distance to prevailing moisture sources the ocean as the grid cell daly et al 2008 2002 daly et al 2008 argue that these measures are necessary to reproduce observed sharp boundaries in precipitation at topographic barriers as evidenced by a comparison to streamflow gradients over the olympic mountains these methods are not used in daymet n15 includes topographic aspect as a predictor but does not consider distance to moisture sources these methodological choices produce differences in the climatological precipitation pattern that are apparent in fig 1 the climatological pattern of precipitation has much greater differences among datasets in areas of high topographic relief and low gauge density while the gridded precipitation datasets do appear to capture much of the topographic and temporal variability of precipitation certain features e g local precipitation maxima and high elevation trends may not be observed by the gauge network in areas of sparse coverage for example the disagreements in water year total precipitation in the cherry eleanor san joaquin and bear basins are likely related to the fact that they feature relatively steep terrain large elevation gradients and limited or non existent road access for gauge maintenance fig 9 shows the precipitation gauges used in the prism m dataset in water year 2005 against the topography of the sierra nevada the gauge density around the north fork of the american river basin is much greater than around the three basins to the south which almost certainly explains why the datasets converge on a physically plausible result in the american but differ substantially and may underestimate precipitation in the other basins compounding this is the very large topographic relief in the central and southern sierra nevada such that much of the basins areas are far above any nearby precipitation gauges as well as the lack of gauges to the east of the crest of the range these factors make estimation of precipitation amounts near the crest very difficult another factor in the differences among datasets is the use of different precipitation gauge networks for example prism m n15 and daymet use snotel precipitation in the interpolation but the other datasets do not n15 uses a bulk undercatch correction at the snotel sites to try to account for undercatch of solid precipitation newman et al 2015 but daymet does not this may be one reason why n15 tends to place more precipitation at high elevations than the prism based datasets or daymet a related factor that likely drives precipitation differences is the handling of inhomogeneities i e changes in the set of precipitation gauges over time and missing data h10 seeks to control for changing station sets over time by forcing the data to match trends at long term stations hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 hamlet et al 2010 l15 requires that stations have at least 20years of data compared to the 5years required for h10 but does not explicitly force trends to match those at gauges with complete records over the full time period n15 uses a static station set and filling of missing data via quantile matching the stationary relationships between stations assumed in a quantile matching approach to filling missing data may smooth trends and reduce the effects of inhomogeneities methods for dealing with inhomogeneities are not described for nldas 2 or daymet for the above reasons the authors of the n15 and prism m datasets state that the data are not appropriate for use in estimating climatic trends newman et al 2015 it is possible that the high frequency variability in the spatial maps of trends in l15 nldas 2 and daymet reflect the appearance or disappearance of precipitation gauges in those locations station re siting or sensor change temporal inhomogeneities such as these can strongly influence apparent trends in the data guentchev et al 2010 mizukami and smith 2012 also we present the mean of the trends in the n15 ensemble which also damps out much of the substantial variability in the trends of the individual ensemble members not shown the intra ensemble variability suggests that trends in high elevation areas such as the sierra nevada are uncertain in this dataset one factor that did not appear to systematically influence the estimation of precipitation over complex terrain was the spatial resolution of the gridded datasets for example fig 5 shows the different spatial resolutions of the datasets over the complex terrain of the sierra nevada one hypothesis to explain the differences in precipitation would be that coarser datasets n15 or nldas 2 at 1 8 fail to resolve the topographic sufficiently to capture orographic patterns daymet the highest resolution dataset at 1km does show more finescale detail in the precipitation fields with major river valleys and ridgelines clearly visible however daymet did not produce any more precipitation over the streamflow basins examined in fig 6 in fact in these limited examples it appears to suffer from more severe underestimation than the coarser datasets thus we do not find evidence that spatial resolution higher than 1 8 improves representation of high elevation precipitation patterns the high uncertainties in gridded precipitation datasets over complex terrain have implications for their use in evaluating scientific hypothesis related to precipitation in these regions while the datasets may describe the results of leave one out type uncertainty estimation conducted during dataset development all of the gridded precipitation datasets considered here except n15 are deterministic and so there may be a tendency to accept these estimates as truth when they are applied to force a hydrologic model or evaluate a remotely sensed precipitation dataset however it is clear that users of these data should be aware of the potential for substantial uncertainties and consider how this may influence their results given these findings it will be useful to examine proxy data related to precipitation that may help to reduce the uncertainty in gridded datasets e g streamflow and snow observations additionally precipitation estimates based on computational weather models e g the weather research and forecasting model wrf skamarock and klemp 2008 may provide useful information about precipitation where gauge based estimates are uncertain e g hughes et al in press while model precipitation and precipitation inferred from streamflow and snow may have substantial uncertainties themselves even approximate estimates may help resolve some of the disagreements between gridded datasets shown here for example henn et al 2015 show that while there is substantial uncertainty in the absolute amounts of precipitation inferred from streamflow basin to basin and year to year variability can likely be inferred more robustly finally the differences and uncertainties discussed here motivate continued research on remote sensing and modeling approaches that can quantify distributed precipitation over areas of complex terrain including robust measurements of solid phase precipitation and snow accumulation 6 conclusions over the western united states we compared six distributed precipitation datasets that have temporal daily or monthly and spatial 1 8 or higher resolution sufficient to capture patterns of precipitation in complex terrain h10 hamlet et al 2010 l15 livneh et al 2015 prism m daly et al 2008 1994 nldas 2 cosgrove et al 2003 xia et al 2012 n15 newman et al 2015 and daymet thornton et al 1997 while there are no observations against which to evaluate the datasets distributed precipitation estimates in complex terrain we examine the differences in their long term average spatial patterns of precipitation their yearly variability in precipitation accumulations and their multi year precipitation trends and we conduct a limited comparison against streamflow and swe observations from these analyses we draw the following conclusions 1 the long term 30 year average spatial patterns of prism based and independently based precipitation datasets agree on broad climatic gradients of precipitation but disagree in many high elevation areas of the western united states by 200mmyr 1 or more 2 mean absolute differences and mean relative differences among the precipitation datasets water year totals averaged 30 70mm and 11 18 across the western united states spatial domain but the largest absolute differences of 100 200mm or more were concentrated in high elevation areas while the largest relative differences of 18 61 were concentrated in arid areas and leeward rain shadows 3 a limited comparison of distributed precipitation estimates against streamflow suggests that in some areas of high uncertainty low gauge density and strong topographic relief all of the datasets examined may be biased such that their water year precipitation totals are insufficient to produce observed streamflow totals thus the true uncertainty in distributed precipitation estimation may be greater than the differences among the datasets estimates due to systematic biases 4 a comparison of the multi year trends in the precipitation datasets water year totals shows substantially different spatial patterns that may be due to the methodological handling of changing precipitation gauge networks with time and missing data it is not clear whether the precipitation gauge based distributed datasets match observed high elevation spatial patterns of trends in streamflow and swe from a set of observations in the sierra nevada 5 users of distributed precipitation datasets should be cognizant of the differences among datasets described above as they have the potential to introduce substantial uncertainty into

7612,hydrologic modeling and other geophysical applications are sensitive to precipitation forcing data quality and there are known challenges in spatially distributing gauge based precipitation over complex terrain we conduct a comparison of six high resolution daily and monthly gridded precipitation datasets over the western united states we compare the long term average spatial patterns and interannual variability of water year total precipitation as well as multi year trends in precipitation across the datasets we find that the greatest absolute differences among datasets occur in high elevation areas and in the maritime mountain ranges of the western united states while the greatest percent differences among datasets relative to annual total precipitation occur in arid and rain shadowed areas differences between datasets in some high elevation areas exceed 200mmyr 1 on average and relative differences range from 5 to 60 across the western united states in areas of high topographic relief true uncertainties and biases are likely higher than the differences among the datasets we present evidence of this based on streamflow observations precipitation trends in the datasets differ in magnitude and sign at smaller scales and are sensitive to how temporal inhomogeneities in the underlying precipitation gauge data are handled keywords precipitation hydroclimatology gridded forcing data orographic enhancement uncertainty climate trends 1 introduction the use of spatially distributed precipitation data has grown as distributed hydrologic ecological and land surface models which generally require distributed precipitation as an input have made advances in resolution and process representation in addition distributed precipitation data are needed for the validation of weather and climate models and of new precipitation datasets based on remote sensing e g behrangi et al 2016 in the extensive mountainous terrain of the western united states observations of precipitation are largely limited to in situ precipitation gauges this is because ground based radar measurements of precipitation have limited effectiveness in mountainous areas due to terrain blockage westrick et al 1999 and current satellite based remote sensing of precipitation lacks sufficient spatiotemporal resolution and accuracy in quantifying solid phase precipitation lettenmaier et al 2015 as a result it is necessary to generate distributed estimates of precipitation based on measurements made at the point gauge scale estimation of precipitation fields in complex terrain from gauge observations is challenging due to high spatial and temporal variability many observational studies have demonstrated that topography can produce large differences in precipitation over small spatial scales and these differences are apparent over both event and climatological timescales e g frei and schar 1998 minder et al 2008 roe 2005 in addition precipitation gauge networks are sparser in high elevation mountainous areas e g lundquist et al 2003 due to limited access and infrastructure and gauges often suffer significant undercatch errors in snow dominated and windy areas rasmussen et al 2012 sieck et al 2007 thus there is the potential for substantial uncertainty in the distribution of precipitation inferred from gauge observations for datasets covering the mountainous western united states distributed precipitation information is typically generated via spatial interpolation of gauge observations with adjustment for elevation given the role of orographic enhancement in precipitation cosgrove et al 2003 daly et al 2008 1994 hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 hamlet et al 2010 livneh et al 2015 2013 maurer et al 2002 newman et al 2015 thornton et al 1997 xia et al 2012 the time interval of the data may be hourly daily monthly or multi year because many precipitation gauges provide data daily this is the most common interval spatial resolution can vary depending on the goals of the dataset and ranges from about 1km to hundreds of km for global datasets though significant smoothing of the topography occurs at coarser resolutions which limits the representation of mountain precipitation thus we focus here on datasets with spatial resolution of no larger than 1 8 12km and with daily or monthly time intervals because of the complex orographic effects on precipitation it is useful to include a long term empirical climatology of precipitation when applying a topographic correction the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 1994 provides 30 year spatial precipitation climatologies at 800m resolution over the continental united states the prism methodology uses multiple gauge networks and weighted linear regression of precipitation with elevation that takes into account many empirical influences on the long term mean spatial pattern which for precipitation include topographical aspect and complexity and coastal proximity the spatial prism precipitation climatologies are used in other gridded datasets cosgrove et al 2003 hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 livneh et al 2015 2013 maurer et al 2002 schaake et al 2004 as a way of understanding the relationship between precipitation at the gauge with that over the surrounding terrain this can be accomplished by forcing long term average precipitation patterns to match prism climatology or by using prism in weighted spatial interpolation thus prism climatology plays an important role in many distributed estimates of precipitation in the western united states see table 1 of lundquist et al 2015 due to the challenges in estimating precipitation over complex terrain multiple studies have demonstrated uncertainty or biases in the estimates of precipitation in gridded datasets in two cases in the colorado rocky mountains where precipitation gauges had not been incorporated into the prism dataset differences between predicted and observed precipitation of hundreds of mm per year were found or 50 100 of the annual total gutmann et al 2012 livneh et al 2014 lundquist et al 2015 compared daily increases in sierra nevada snow pillow snow water equivalent swe to daily gridded dataset precipitation and found an individual water year in which the gridded products had up to 21 too little precipitation to account for snow pillow swe increases because gridded precipitation datasets use topography as a predictor and precipitation gauges tend to be located at lower elevations we hypothesize that uncertainties and thus differences between datasets will be larger at higher elevations gridded precipitation datasets have been used for many purposes such as assessing climatic trends in streamflow and snowpack e g hamlet et al 2007 2005 downscaling of global climate models e g gutmann et al 2014 estimating forest transpiration patterns and trends christensen et al 2008 and assessing ecological impacts of climate change e g ogden et al 2014 see table 1 of lundquist et al 2015 which shows that various gridded precipitation datasets have been cited thousands of times in the literature primarily in the fields of hydrology ecology and atmospheric science in hydrologic modeling for example errors and biases in precipitation forcing data have been shown to impact the reliability of model calibration and regionalization renard et al 2010 to have dramatic impacts on simulations of hydrologic variables such as snowpack raleigh et al 2015 and to confound efforts to predict the effects of climate change on regional hydrology mendoza et al 2015 additionally biases in gridded precipitation datasets may hinder evaluation of regional and global climate models caldwell et al 2009 gutmann et al 2014 thus how precipitation is represented in these datasets including its uncertainty and bias has wide ranging scientific and operational implications in particular hydrologic modelers should be cognizant of the potential for biased precipitation forcing data that is implied by differences between gridded datasets and so this study is conducted with modeling implications in mind systematic evaluation of differences among gridded precipitation datasets would help make modelers aware of the magnitudes of the uncertainty associated with precipitation datasets with the exception of a small number of heavily instrumented research watersheds e g daly et al 2017 there is currently no ground truth for distributed precipitation in complex terrain beyond the often sparse gauge measurements making it challenging to estimate uncertainty some datasets explicitly estimate and publish the uncertainty in the methodology used to generate them newman et al 2015 or compare the differences in mean spatial patterns between datasets livneh et al 2015 however we are not aware of prior studies that have evaluated the differences between high resolution gridded precipitation accumulations over a comprehensive spatial domain over many years in this study we first describe the six gridded precipitation datasets that we compare over the western united states section 2 then we describe the methods used to calculate differences among them section 3 and then we present these differences in terms of their climatological pattern interannual variability and multi year trends section 4 we discuss potential reasons for these differences and assess the implications of the differences on hydrologic applications in section 5 and conclude in section 6 2 data we compare six publicly available gridded precipitation datasets over the western united states hamlet et al 2010 hereafter h10 which extends an earlier dataset hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 livneh et al 2015 hereafter l15 which extends the earlier dataset of maurer et al 2002 prism 2 5 arc minute 4km monthly data hereafter prism m nldas 2 cosgrove et al 2003 xia et al 2012 newman et al 2015 hereafter n15 and daymet thornton et al 1997 table 1 describes each dataset s major characteristics and methodological choices see also lundquist et al 2015 their table 1 and newman et al 2015 their table 1 for similar comparisons among gridded datasets we chose these datasets because they are publicly available have sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to capture precipitation in the complex terrain of the western united states and represent several independent efforts to distribute precipitation across complex terrain from gauge observations the h10 and l15 datasets share several characteristics both are at 1 16 6km spatial resolution use united states national weather service cooperative observer nws coop network precipitation gauge data and both use prism precipitation climatology the 1971 2000 version for h10 and the 1981 2010 version for l15 for topographic correction in which the interpolated gauge data are rescaled for each month and grid cell by the ratio of their corresponding 30 year average to the prism climatology this results in monthly long term averages matching prism over the corresponding time period but daily variation is different between h10 and l15 in addition to prism h10 employs an additional correction such that trends in the dataset are not influenced by gauge data that is available only for partial periods the precipitation time series at each grid cell is rescaled to match spatially interpolated temporally filtered trends from a subset of long term stations hamlet et al 2010 this ensures that trends in h10 match interpolated trends at long term stations in contrast l15 does not perform a temporal correction but does only include stations with at least 20years of data to minimize inhomogeneities h10 data are available from 1916 to 2006 across the western united states while l15 data are available from 1950 to 2013 for the western united states all of mexico and portions of southern canada the prism climate group prism oregonstate edu makes gridded precipitation datasets available at different spatial resolutions and time intervals here we use the monthly 2 5 arc minute precipitation totals time series prism m 2 5 arc minute daily precipitation grids are also freely available but we use monthly totals here because we conduct comparisons only at monthly timescales or longer the prism m dataset has higher spatial resolution 2 5 arc minutes or 4km than h10 and l15 it also utilizes prism climatology to inform the interpolation at the monthly timescale and it incorporates a much broader array of precipitation gauges than the coop network monthly precipitation data are available beginning in 1895 though we use a dataset of more recent monthly totals that begins in 1981 the north american land data assimilation system project phase 2 nldas 2 retrospective precipitation data is generated from the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration climate prediction center s noaa cpc gauge based precipitation analysis which itself includes coop daily reports gridded through optimal interpolation to 1 8 12km resolution nldas 2 data are further disaggregated to hourly resolution using hourly fractions of cpc daily precipitation derived from national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage ii radar data where available cosgrove et al 2003 however we consider only daily totals in this analysis nldas 2 precipitation fields are scaled for each month to match prism 1961 1990 climatology xia et al 2012 and are available beginning in 1979 the n15 dataset is an extension of the approach of clark and slater 2006 which uses probabilistic interpolation and multiple linear regression against topographic predictors latitude longitude elevation and aspect that is independent of prism n15 samples the uncertainty associated with the regression of precipitation observations against topography this is accomplished using spatially correlated random numbers to generate a 100 member ensemble of daily gridded precipitation over the continental united states thus the uncertainty of the daily precipitation is explicitly estimated at each grid cell via the ensemble newman et al 2015 the underlying precipitation data come from the coop network as well as the natural resources conservation service s snow telemetry snotel network of precipitation gauges snotel precipitation is adjusted using a wind undercatch correction the daily ensemble dataset is available at 1 8 12km resolution over 1980 2012 compared to the other datasets daymet thornton et al 1997 provides higher 1km spatial resolution of daily precipitation from 1980 to the latest full calendar year the dataset uses coop and snotel precipitation gauges and applies weighted linear regression of precipitation against elevation using weights that depend on distance from the grid cell center using a truncated gaussian filter and other factors the topographic regression is independent of prism climatology in addition to the distributed precipitation datasets we consider streamflow and swe observations from the sierra nevada mountain range of california in this analysis because the six datasets above generally make use of most or all available precipitation gauge observations in mountainous areas in order to generate distributed estimates evaluation of the datasets against independent precipitation observations is difficult however we can compare interannual variability and trends in streamflow and swe observations against their equivalents in the distributed precipitation datasets as we would expect there to be correlation between the two therefore we use a dataset of daily streamflow measurements from 30 stream gauges and april 1 swe observations from 161 snow courses and 26 snow pillows in the sierra nevada the streamflow dataset was compiled as part of a study on inferring sierra nevada precipitation from streamflow henn et al 2018 these gauges measure streamflow from basins without diversions or reservoir storage larger than a few percent of annual flow volumes most basins have no diversions or dams and had 90 complete observations over water years 1982 2006 we use daily streamflow volumes and compute water year totals for each basin the majority of the streamflow data are from usgs sites while two sites are full natural flows estimated by reservoir operators from release and storage measurements for a list of streamflow sites see supplementary material table s1 the swe observations are mainly from california department of water resources cdwr courses and pillows as well as several snotel sites in the sierra nevada and also include only sites that had 90 complete april 1 measurements over 1982 2006 swe observation sites are listed in the supplementary material table s2 3 methods 3 1 regridding of datasets for comparison given of the disparate spatial resolutions of the datasets table 1 it is necessary to resample the datasets to a common grid in order to directly compare precipitation values we conduct two resampling operations first we aggregate the higher resolution 800m prism climatology to the coarser grids of the other datasets for comparison of climatological patterns second we also aggregate each of the higher resolution datasets h10 l15 prism m and daymet to the coarser 1 8 grid of nldas 2 and n15 the second resampling allows for comparison of water year precipitation totals across all datasets when resampling the 30 arc second 800m prism grid to the 2 5 arc minute 4km 1 16 6km and 1 8 12km grids we averaged all of the 800m grid cells inside the coarser grid cells to calculate the resampled grid due to the fairly similar grid cell sizes when resampling the 800m prism grid to the 1km daymet grid we used bilinear interpolation instead to avoid biases associated with some 1km grid cells containing multiple 800m cell centers while some contain only one when resampling the coarser datasets to the 1 8 grid we calculated the resampled 1 8 grid cells as the average of the higher resolution cells within each coarser cell 3 2 comparison of water year total precipitation the six datasets have a temporal overlap that covers water years 1982 2006 for each water year and for each grid cell in the 1 8 domain covering the western united states defined here as areas in the united states from 32 to 49 n and 105 to 125 w we converted daily or hourly datasets to water year totals by summing all times between 1 october of the previous year and 30 september we then calculated the pairwise differences between each dataset and every other datasets for each year we calculate the mean absolute difference mad between a pair of datasets at a grid cell as 1 mad i j 1 n k 1 n abs p i k p j k where i j indicates the difference between datasets i and j k indicates the water year n is the total number of water years and p i k and p j k indicate the water year total precipitation for datasets i and j respectively for water year k we then calculate the mean relative difference mrd between a pair of datasets which is defined as 2 mrd i j 1 n k 1 n abs p i k p j k 1 6 m 1 6 p m k where m indicates the dataset and p m k indicates the water year total precipitation for that dataset and year in other words the mrd is the absolute difference between a pair of datasets for a given year and grid cell divided by the six dataset mean precipitation for that year and grid cell and averaged over all water years this provides an indication of the magnitude of the average differences between a pair of datasets at a grid cell relative to an estimate of the average precipitation at that grid cell finally we calculate an estimate of the average differences between one dataset and the others relative to the average differences between the other datasets in the group we define this measure as the mean absolute difference anomaly δmad 3 δ mad i 1 5 j 1 5 mad i j 1 10 k 1 10 mad k where for a given grid cell the first term is the average of the five mean absolute differences between dataset i and the other datasets and the second term is the average of the ten mean absolute differences among all unique pairs in the five datasets here denoted by k not including dataset i this indicator will highlight where a particular dataset tends to have larger positive values or smaller negative values differences with the other datasets relative to the average differences across all datasets 3 3 comparing basin mean precipitation against streamflow for each precipitation dataset we compute basin mean water year total precipitation for four example basins in the sierra nevada from the dataset of streamflow observations described above this accomplished by taking the average water year total precipitation for each grid cell within the basin fractionally weighting the grid cells that are partially within the basin water year total streamflow volumes are divided by the basin area to yield a normalized runoff depth for comparison with precipitation 3 4 calculations of multi year trends we investigate the representation of multi year trends in each dataset by calculating the linear least squares trendline through each dataset s water year total precipitation over the common 1982 2006 period at each grid cell following the convention used by mote et al 2005 we define trends as the change in the fitted trendline over the time period divided by the starting year s best fit value 4 trend β 1 year n year 1 β 1 year 1 β 0 where β 1 and β 0 are the regression coefficients of precipitation against time slope and y intercept respectively and year 1 and year n are the first and last years of the time period we repeat the same trend calculation for the annual streamflow volumes and april 1 swe observation series using only sites with at least 90 of years available over the 1982 2006 time period 4 results 4 1 comparison of climatological patterns we first compare the 1981 2010 average annual precipitation in the nldas 2 n15 and daymet datasets against the prism 1981 2010 annual precipitation climatology fig 1 when compared over the appropriate time period h10 l15 and prism m exactly match by construction the prism climatology and so their differences are not shown compared to the prism climatology fig 1b nldas 2 generally has small differences 100mm in lowland areas but nldas 2 has noticeably less precipitation over high elevation terrain such as the sierra nevada cascade range coast ranges of california and oregon olympic mountains and rocky mountains of colorado utah and idaho these differences average 100 500mm per year over most high elevation areas the n15 dataset s climatological pattern is wetter than nldas 2 fig 1c here we show the mean of the 100 member n15 ensemble many areas of the cascades of washington and oregon particularly their eastern leeward slope as well as the northern rockies are wetter than the prism climatology however n15 is drier than prism in the windward areas of the olympics coast ranges and some portions of the sierra nevada daymet another dataset that does not use prism climatology shows a different mean pattern than the other datasets fig 1d it places less precipitation than prism on the higher portions of the sierra nevada olympics coast ranges northern cascades and colorado rockies but somewhat more precipitation in portions of the northern rockies and in inter mountain valleys of the western united states in section 5 we discuss differences among the datasets in handling of orographic enhancement and rain shadowing when spatially distributing precipitation 4 2 differences in water year precipitation totals in contrast to the long term average spatial patterns in fig 1 in fig 2 we present a comparison of the different datasets estimates of water year total precipitation across the western united states over 1982 2006 fig 2 compares differences among the six datasets with one another both using the absolute and relative differences defined in section 3 2 panels above the diagonal in fig 2 show mad eq 1 for each comparison between pairs of datasets panels below the diagonal show mrd eq 2 between dataset pairs panels on the diagonal show the mean absolute difference anomaly eq 3 for that dataset taken together the above diagonal panels suggest that the highest absolute differences between the datasets occur in the maritime mountain ranges of the western united states sierra nevada coast ranges and cascades with additional significant differences over the rockies thus not surprisingly the largest absolute differences occur in areas with higher mean precipitation where methodological differences interpolation techniques can produce larger differences these are predominantly higher elevation and coastal regions however an examination of dataset pairs differences show significant variation between pairs the h10 l15 and prism m precipitation totals tend to be more similar to one another than the nldas 2 n15 and daymet totals are to other the datasets for example when the spatial distribution of mad is sorted and percentiles are computed the 95th percentile water year total mad between prism m and l15 is 131mm while the 95th percentile absolute difference between nldas 2 and n15 is 375mm in particular n15 has larger differences with other datasets along the eastern slope of the cascade and sierra nevada ranges while nldas 2 and daymet have larger differences at the highest elevation areas of these same ranges table 2 summarizes the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of mad between all dataset pairs the along diagonal panels showing the difference anomalies for each dataset largely confirm these patterns areas where datasets tend to produce significantly different water year totals minus the average differences between the other datasets are shown in red while areas where datasets tend to adhere to the group mean are shown in blue the l15 and prism m datasets and to a lesser extent the h10 dataset behave more similarly in high elevation areas while the nldas 2 and daymet datasets behave less similarly while the n15 dataset has difference anomalies that are most pronounced on the lee sides of the maritime ranges when absolute differences for given water years are divided by the six dataset mean total precipitation to estimate the differences as a fraction of average precipitation fig 2 below diagonal panels different spatial patterns are observed in contrast to mad mrd tends to be greatest in the rain shadows and deserts of the inter mountain western united states while mrd is smallest in coastal lowlands and windward foothills of the maritime ranges the percentiles of mrd for each dataset pair are also shown in table 2 95th percentile mrd largely found in arid and rain shadowed areas areas to the east of maritime mountain ranges was between 0 18 and 0 61 for all dataset pairs to highlight the general patterns of absolute and relative differences we show the mean pattern of each across all dataset pairs in fig 3 a and b maps of these differences are available in geotiff format in the supplementary material for this article and interactively in the online version in fig 3c e we examine two subsets of the overall patterns from the colorado rocky mountains and the cascade mountains of washington and oregon in fig 3c we plot mad from each area against elevation which shows that in both regions absolute differences increase with elevation the relationship with elevation is stronger in the rockies than in the cascades in fig 3d we plot mrd against elevation for both regions while there is still greater relative uncertainty at higher elevations the relationships are weaker than for mad in particular relatively dry regions on the lee of the cascades have high mrd despite being lower in elevation than the crest of the range itself in fig 3e we plot 90 percent confidence range on water year total precipitation from the n15 dataset versus elevation for each of the two subset areas the range of the ensemble dataset increases with elevation in the rockies in a manner similar to the differences between datasets though the n15 90 percent confidence range is larger than the inter dataset mad in fig 3e however the similarity suggests that the methodology used to estimate uncertainty in n15 produces similar uncertainty estimates to the methodological differences between the datasets while a full comparison of sub annual variability in differences between datasets is beyond the scope of this study we briefly examine monthly differences between datasets we compare monthly precipitation totals for each grid cell in the prism m l15 h10 and n15 datasets in fig 4 the absolute and relative differences in fig 4 are averaged over a spatial domain covering the sierra nevada mountain range of california domain shown in fig 5 the monthly analysis shows that mad is greatest during the winter months when most of the precipitation occurs in the climate of the sierra nevada relative differences however are much greater in the summer when precipitation amounts are generally small and often driven by localized convection which is presumably difficult to represent accurately by gauge interpolation thus the monthly differences vary in a similar fashion to the spatial variability shown in fig 3 greater mad occurs in places and times where precipitation is greater whereas mrd is greater in relatively dry locations and times 4 3 comparison of basin mean water year precipitation totals with streamflow observations next we focus on a subset area the sierra nevada mountain range of california for a particular water year 2005 as an illustration of annual differences among datasets fig 5a f show water year precipitation totals across the subset area for each of the six datasets there are major differences in the area of greatest water year total precipitation among the datasets h10 nldas 2 and daymet have the greatest accumulations in the northern portion of the range the yuba and feather river basins in particular nldas 2 and daymet place less precipitation in the central and southern sierra nevada than the other datasets l15 places the greatest accumulations in two areas of the central portion of the range while n15 places the maximum to the north just southwest of lake tahoe prism m has multiple precipitation maxima generally corresponding to the areas of highest elevation and places substantially more precipitation in the southern sierra nevada in particular differences between the datasets for the high elevation areas in the central sierra nevada are seen the differences in these parts of the domain are on the order of 500 1 500mm or 25 60 of the mean water year total precipitation across the six datasets fig 5 also shows the outlines of three basins for which unimpaired streamflow observations are available and one for which full natural flows area available against which precipitation totals can be compared the four basins are a the north fork of the american river at north fork dam usgs gauge 11427000 basin area 884km2 b cherry and eleanor creeks combined basin area 486km2 c the san joaquin river at miller s crossing usgs gauge 11226500 basin area 651km2 and d bear creek usgs gauge 11230500 basin area 136km2 for the combined cherry and eleanor basin we use full natural flows provided by the operator of the reservoirs at both creeks outlets see henn et al 2018 for more information on the streamflow data the comparison of the datasets basin mean water year total precipitation and the comparison against streamflow are shown for water years 1982 2006 in fig 6 fig 6a shows the time series of precipitation for the north fork of the american river for this basin the six datasets tend to cluster closely for each water year and the datasets generally fall within the spread of the n15 ensemble with the exception of nldas 2 in some years when compared against streamflow observations the datasets water year totals mimic the observed temporal variability between wet and dry years and generally are greater than streamflow by 500 1000mm per year a plausible estimate of evaporative losses for this basin e g kurpius et al 2003 for both cherry eleanor and the san joaquin fig 6b and c the gridded datasets precipitation is of a similar magnitude to streamflow san joaquin streamflow observations were not made after 1991 because of the basin water balance given negligible inter annual storage precipitation minus evapotranspiration equals streamflow precipitation that is similar to or less than streamflow implies implausible near zero evapotranspiration in these basins these are examples of the long term precipitation likely being underestimated to varying degrees by all six of the gridded datasets in these cases nldas 2 and daymet in particular the differences between precipitation and streamflow vary substantially between years for each gridded product suggesting that these biases may differ from year to year in an unpredictable fashion in addition the differences among the datasets are much larger in these central and southern sierra nevada basins than in the north fork of the american often falling outside the n15 ensemble estimate of the spread bear creek precipitation fig 6d is more reliably greater than streamflow for most of the datasets except daymet suggesting that precipitation underestimation may be generally less severe in this basin however the agreement among the gridded datasets water year precipitation is worse in this basin with differences of over 500mm or 40 appearing for many years in particular disagreement between l15 and the other datasets in water years 2005 and 2006 is apparent over 1982 2006 the mrds of basin mean water year total precipitation averaged across all combinations of the six datasets were 11 for the north fork of the american 17 for cherry eleanor 21 for san joaquin and 24 for bear however actual uncertainties between the datasets estimates and true basin mean precipitation may be substantially higher if the datasets are collectively biased low or high on average low biases are almost certainly the case for some of these basins given the comparisons to streamflow discussed above 4 4 comparison of precipitation streamflow and snow trends over the sierra nevada we compute trends in water year total precipitation in the six datasets over the time period when all are available over the western united states water years 1982 2006 trends in these six gridded datasets are shown in figs 7 a 6f qualitatively some similarities are noticeable between the datasets trends most or all datasets show increasing precipitation in coastal southern california and decreasing precipitation over the deserts of interior southern california and arizona and parts of the great basin and rocky mountains however the computed trends are also substantially different across the six datasets three of the datasets l15 nldas 2 and daymet exhibit higher frequency spatial variability with large changes in the sign and magnitude of trends over distances of only tens of km these high frequency variations differ between the l15 nldas 2 and daymet datasets the other three datasets h10 prism m and n15 have spatially smoother trends we discuss potential reasons for these trend differences in section 5 in fig 7g we show the mean absolute differences between trends in the six datasets but over a range of grid scales for each grid scale we aggregate the trends in each dataset to a consistent grid and compute mean absolute differences between all dataset pairs in the same manner as the water year total differences fig 7g shows that as the grid scale is increased the differences between trends in datasets decline particularly at grid scales of 1 or coarser this suggests that the datasets disagreement in trends occurs at the smaller scales necessary representing topographical features such as ridges and valleys whereas trends at regional scales are in better agreement to further examine the spatial patterns of 1982 2006 precipitation trends we outline the sierra nevada subset fig 7a f gray dashed box this area is shown in more detail in fig 8 but instead of precipitation trends we plot the 1982 2006 trends in water year total streamflow volumes colored outlines and april 1 swe at snow courses and pillows triangles the trends in streamflow are generally negative over this time period and spatial domain with the greatest decreases in the northern and southern reaches of the range where most gauges show decreases of 10 30 in the central sierra nevada streamflow trends are less negative with most basins trends declining by less than 10 or slightly increasing april 1 swe trends generally correspond spatially with the streamflow trends almost every site shows negative swe trends in the far southern and northern regions of the domain while the central region shows a mix of positive and negative trends of smaller magnitudes swe is influenced by both precipitation and temperature variability and so care should be taken when interpreting trends collectively however these results suggests declines in precipitation at the northern and southern ends of the range but no strong trend in the central portion over 1982 2006 the datasets precipitation trends do not obviously follow the spatial patterns of trends in streamflow and swe while the nldas 2 l15 and daymet trends appear to show decreases at the northern and southern ends of the domain their high frequency variations make them difficult to compare against the trend patterns of h10 prism m and n15 generally show slight decreases across most of the sierra nevada appearing not to reflect the small increases in streamflow and swe seen in the central region these results should be interpreted carefully as it is possible that increases in streamflow and swe could be due to factors other than increasing precipitation however the inter comparison of the datasets and the comparison against streamflow and swe trends suggests that estimation of precipitation trends using gridded datasets is subject to substantial uncertainty in high elevation areas 5 discussion the preceding results show that gridded precipitation datasets which interpolate gauge data across complex terrain may have mean absolute differences in water year total precipitation of several hundred mm in high elevation areas and mean relative differences of 10 30 over many of the same areas absolute differences are consistently larger at higher elevation areas than in nearby lowlands though areas in the lee of the major maritime mountain ranges of the western united states also show high absolute differences the true uncertainty in precipitation in fact may be higher if the datasets collectively underestimate or overestimate precipitation the examination of streamflow observations suggests collective underestimation in some selected areas where absolute differences between datasets are also large these areas may have insufficient gauge observations to robustly interpolate precipitation see below we emphasize that there are no robust observations of distributed precipitation in areas of complex terrain against which to evaluate the datasets so we do not assess whether one dataset is more or less accurate than another instead we examine potential reasons for these differences between datasets as well as the potential biases in water year precipitation totals and trends one driver of the differences in high elevation precipitation estimates is likely the estimation of the relationship between precipitation and elevation in general the number of precipitation gauges declines rapidly with elevation as a result precipitation estimates for high elevation terrain are often extrapolations of precipitation elevation relationships from lower elevation stations all of the datasets considered here assume locally linear relationships between precipitation and elevation that are derived from weighted least squares regression however the details of this estimation are different between datasets prism m and l15 use the prism 1981 2010 climatology itself a modified weighted least squares regression of precipitation against elevation and aspect to establish the local topographic relationship with elevation h10 uses the prism 1971 2000 climatology n15 and daymet conduct independent regressions of precipitation against elevation but differ in how they weight stations with respect to their distance from the grid cell nldas 2 utilizes the prism 1961 1990 climatology and is also subject to influences not present in the other datasets including data from the atmospheric model used in assimilation cosgrove et al 2003 while other differences between the datasets namely the differing sets of precipitation gauge observations discussed below make it difficult to quantify how much of the differences derive from the precipitation elevation uncertainty the results in figs 2 3 and 5 make it clear that differences between datasets increase with elevation one consistent difference in the climatological precipitation patterns between the prism based and other datasets is in how precipitation is distributed over the windward and leeward sides of mountain ranges for example the prism climatological pattern is wetter on the windward slopes of the maritime coast ranges cascades and olympics and is drier on the leeward slopes as compared to n15 and daymet fig 1c and d prism employs several methods to produce sharp gradients of precipitation in the interpolation of gauge data which has a tendency to smooth sharp spatial variation these include more heavily weighting stations on the same topographic aspect as the grid cell and stations having similar distance to prevailing moisture sources the ocean as the grid cell daly et al 2008 2002 daly et al 2008 argue that these measures are necessary to reproduce observed sharp boundaries in precipitation at topographic barriers as evidenced by a comparison to streamflow gradients over the olympic mountains these methods are not used in daymet n15 includes topographic aspect as a predictor but does not consider distance to moisture sources these methodological choices produce differences in the climatological precipitation pattern that are apparent in fig 1 the climatological pattern of precipitation has much greater differences among datasets in areas of high topographic relief and low gauge density while the gridded precipitation datasets do appear to capture much of the topographic and temporal variability of precipitation certain features e g local precipitation maxima and high elevation trends may not be observed by the gauge network in areas of sparse coverage for example the disagreements in water year total precipitation in the cherry eleanor san joaquin and bear basins are likely related to the fact that they feature relatively steep terrain large elevation gradients and limited or non existent road access for gauge maintenance fig 9 shows the precipitation gauges used in the prism m dataset in water year 2005 against the topography of the sierra nevada the gauge density around the north fork of the american river basin is much greater than around the three basins to the south which almost certainly explains why the datasets converge on a physically plausible result in the american but differ substantially and may underestimate precipitation in the other basins compounding this is the very large topographic relief in the central and southern sierra nevada such that much of the basins areas are far above any nearby precipitation gauges as well as the lack of gauges to the east of the crest of the range these factors make estimation of precipitation amounts near the crest very difficult another factor in the differences among datasets is the use of different precipitation gauge networks for example prism m n15 and daymet use snotel precipitation in the interpolation but the other datasets do not n15 uses a bulk undercatch correction at the snotel sites to try to account for undercatch of solid precipitation newman et al 2015 but daymet does not this may be one reason why n15 tends to place more precipitation at high elevations than the prism based datasets or daymet a related factor that likely drives precipitation differences is the handling of inhomogeneities i e changes in the set of precipitation gauges over time and missing data h10 seeks to control for changing station sets over time by forcing the data to match trends at long term stations hamlet and lettenmaier 2005 hamlet et al 2010 l15 requires that stations have at least 20years of data compared to the 5years required for h10 but does not explicitly force trends to match those at gauges with complete records over the full time period n15 uses a static station set and filling of missing data via quantile matching the stationary relationships between stations assumed in a quantile matching approach to filling missing data may smooth trends and reduce the effects of inhomogeneities methods for dealing with inhomogeneities are not described for nldas 2 or daymet for the above reasons the authors of the n15 and prism m datasets state that the data are not appropriate for use in estimating climatic trends newman et al 2015 it is possible that the high frequency variability in the spatial maps of trends in l15 nldas 2 and daymet reflect the appearance or disappearance of precipitation gauges in those locations station re siting or sensor change temporal inhomogeneities such as these can strongly influence apparent trends in the data guentchev et al 2010 mizukami and smith 2012 also we present the mean of the trends in the n15 ensemble which also damps out much of the substantial variability in the trends of the individual ensemble members not shown the intra ensemble variability suggests that trends in high elevation areas such as the sierra nevada are uncertain in this dataset one factor that did not appear to systematically influence the estimation of precipitation over complex terrain was the spatial resolution of the gridded datasets for example fig 5 shows the different spatial resolutions of the datasets over the complex terrain of the sierra nevada one hypothesis to explain the differences in precipitation would be that coarser datasets n15 or nldas 2 at 1 8 fail to resolve the topographic sufficiently to capture orographic patterns daymet the highest resolution dataset at 1km does show more finescale detail in the precipitation fields with major river valleys and ridgelines clearly visible however daymet did not produce any more precipitation over the streamflow basins examined in fig 6 in fact in these limited examples it appears to suffer from more severe underestimation than the coarser datasets thus we do not find evidence that spatial resolution higher than 1 8 improves representation of high elevation precipitation patterns the high uncertainties in gridded precipitation datasets over complex terrain have implications for their use in evaluating scientific hypothesis related to precipitation in these regions while the datasets may describe the results of leave one out type uncertainty estimation conducted during dataset development all of the gridded precipitation datasets considered here except n15 are deterministic and so there may be a tendency to accept these estimates as truth when they are applied to force a hydrologic model or evaluate a remotely sensed precipitation dataset however it is clear that users of these data should be aware of the potential for substantial uncertainties and consider how this may influence their results given these findings it will be useful to examine proxy data related to precipitation that may help to reduce the uncertainty in gridded datasets e g streamflow and snow observations additionally precipitation estimates based on computational weather models e g the weather research and forecasting model wrf skamarock and klemp 2008 may provide useful information about precipitation where gauge based estimates are uncertain e g hughes et al in press while model precipitation and precipitation inferred from streamflow and snow may have substantial uncertainties themselves even approximate estimates may help resolve some of the disagreements between gridded datasets shown here for example henn et al 2015 show that while there is substantial uncertainty in the absolute amounts of precipitation inferred from streamflow basin to basin and year to year variability can likely be inferred more robustly finally the differences and uncertainties discussed here motivate continued research on remote sensing and modeling approaches that can quantify distributed precipitation over areas of complex terrain including robust measurements of solid phase precipitation and snow accumulation 6 conclusions over the western united states we compared six distributed precipitation datasets that have temporal daily or monthly and spatial 1 8 or higher resolution sufficient to capture patterns of precipitation in complex terrain h10 hamlet et al 2010 l15 livneh et al 2015 prism m daly et al 2008 1994 nldas 2 cosgrove et al 2003 xia et al 2012 n15 newman et al 2015 and daymet thornton et al 1997 while there are no observations against which to evaluate the datasets distributed precipitation estimates in complex terrain we examine the differences in their long term average spatial patterns of precipitation their yearly variability in precipitation accumulations and their multi year precipitation trends and we conduct a limited comparison against streamflow and swe observations from these analyses we draw the following conclusions 1 the long term 30 year average spatial patterns of prism based and independently based precipitation datasets agree on broad climatic gradients of precipitation but disagree in many high elevation areas of the western united states by 200mmyr 1 or more 2 mean absolute differences and mean relative differences among the precipitation datasets water year totals averaged 30 70mm and 11 18 across the western united states spatial domain but the largest absolute differences of 100 200mm or more were concentrated in high elevation areas while the largest relative differences of 18 61 were concentrated in arid areas and leeward rain shadows 3 a limited comparison of distributed precipitation estimates against streamflow suggests that in some areas of high uncertainty low gauge density and strong topographic relief all of the datasets examined may be biased such that their water year precipitation totals are insufficient to produce observed streamflow totals thus the true uncertainty in distributed precipitation estimation may be greater than the differences among the datasets estimates due to systematic biases 4 a comparison of the multi year trends in the precipitation datasets water year totals shows substantially different spatial patterns that may be due to the methodological handling of changing precipitation gauge networks with time and missing data it is not clear whether the precipitation gauge based distributed datasets match observed high elevation spatial patterns of trends in streamflow and swe from a set of observations in the sierra nevada 5 users of distributed precipitation datasets should be cognizant of the differences among datasets described above as they have the potential to introduce substantial uncertainty into

7613,analogue methods provide a statistical precipitation prediction based on synoptic predictors supplied by general circulation models or numerical weather prediction models the method samples a selection of days in the archives that are similar to the target day to be predicted and consider their set of corresponding observed precipitation the predictand as the conditional distribution for the target day the relationship between the predictors and predictands relies on some parameters that characterize how and where the similarity between two atmospheric situations is defined this relationship is usually established by a semi automatic sequential procedure that has strong limitations i it cannot automatically choose the pressure levels and temporal windows hour of the day for a given meteorological variable ii it cannot handle dependencies between parameters and iii it cannot easily handle new degrees of freedom in this work a global optimization approach relying on genetic algorithms could optimize all parameters jointly and automatically the global optimization was applied to some variants of the analogue method for the rhône catchment in the swiss alps the performance scores increased compared to reference methods especially for days with high precipitation totals the resulting parameters were found to be relevant and coherent between the different subregions of the catchment moreover they were obtained automatically and objectively which reduces the effort that needs to be invested in exploration attempts when adapting the method to a new region or for a new predictand for example it obviates the need to assess a large number of combinations of pressure levels and temporal windows of predictor variables that were manually selected beforehand the optimization could also take into account parameter inter dependencies in addition the approach allowed for new degrees of freedom such as a possible weighting between pressure levels and non overlapping spatial windows keywords precipitation prediction analogue method optimization genetic algorithms alpine climate 1 introduction the analogue method am is a downscaling technique based on the idea expressed by lorenz 1956 1969 that similar situations in terms of atmospheric circulation are likely to lead to similar local weather duband 1970 it uses predictor variables describing the synoptic atmospheric circulation to predict local scale predictands of interest it is often used to predict daily precipitation either in an operational forecasting context e g guilbaud 1997 bontron and obled 2005 hamill and whitaker 2006 bliefernicht 2010 marty et al 2012 horton et al 2012 hamill et al 2015 ben daoud et al 2016 or a climate downscaling context e g radanovics et al 2013 chardon et al 2014 dayon et al 2015 raynaud et al 2016 other predictands are also considered such as precipitation radar images panziera et al 2011 foresti et al 2015 temperature radinovic 1975 woodcock 1980 kruizinga and murphy 1983 delle monache et al 2013 caillouet et al 2016 raynaud et al 2016 wind gordon 1987 delle monache et al 2013 delle monache et al 2011 vanvyve et al 2015 alessandrini et al 2015b junk et al 2015b junk et al 2015a and solar radiation or power production alessandrini et al 2015a bessa et al 2015 raynaud et al 2016 in real time forecasting it is used mainly by practitioners notably hydropower companies or flood forecasting services that need to anticipate water yields or issue early flood warnings several days in advance the classical forecasting chain consists of using limited area models e g arome or cosmo forced by global nwp numerical weather prediction models with a lower resolution however their use requires very important processing capacities and the resulting forecast still presents large uncertainties and biases although these outputs are essential they can be supplemented by other sources of forecasts providing useful information in contrast to local nwp models ams can transform at low cost the synoptic scale information provided by the global nwp model into precipitation forecasts they rely on the inherent relationship between the synoptic scale influences and the related local weather that can be exploited from the archive of observed precipitation running an am approach is fast enough that it can search for analogues for each day up to ten days ahead in a matter of seconds to minutes it can eventually use the different members of an ensemble forecast and or those issued by different nwp models e g noaa gfs or ecmwf ifs in climate studies ams are used to downscale the outputs of a general circulation model gcm or regional climate model rcm simulation runs dayon et al 2015 or to reconstruct past weather conditions caillouet et al 2016 in future climate studies rcms are often used to dynamically downscale precipitation to a local scale however even though the relevance of rcms outputs increases a bias correction of the outputs is often still required particularly in complex terrain moreover their application is computer intensive which makes it difficult to cover all combinations of climate scenarios and gcms therefore the idea is to bypass the small scale simulations and to go from the large scale situation to the end variables such as precipitation by statistical downscaling maraun et al 2010 the spatial transferability of ams is analysed in chardon et al 2014 and radanovics et al 2013 and their temporal transferability in dayon et al 2015 and caillouet et al 2016 the physical consistency of multivariate predictions is presented in raynaud et al 2016 the method can be designed with multiple successive subsampling steps or analogy levels each of them relying on different meteorological variables a certain number of parameters define the relationship between predictors and predictands such as the choice of the predictor variable its pressure level and temporal window hour of the day to consider the spatial domain to use for the comparison as well as the analogy criterion itself and finally the number of analogue situations to keep at each subsampling level these parameters are usually calibrated by means of a semi automatic sequential procedure bontron 2004 radanovics et al 2013 i e by optimizing each single parameter one at a time in an arbitrarily chosen order with no or little reassessment this sequential approach therefore has strong limitations i it cannot automatically choose the optimal pressure levels and the temporal windows for a given meteorological variable ii it cannot handle dependencies between the parameters within a level of analogy and even less between them and iii it cannot easily handle new degrees of freedom such as a possible weighting between the pressure levels thus even if the processing involved is relatively fast the sequential approach requires laborious assessments of predictor combinations variables pressure levels temporal windows moreover it presents a high risk of ending in a local optimum because of subjective initial choices and lack of consideration of parameter inter dependencies other calibration methods exist for specific applications such as radar images panziera et al 2011 foresti et al 2015 aiming to overcome these limitations a global optimization by genetic algorithms gas was introduced an intensive assessment resulted in recommendations to parametrize gas in order to optimize ams successfully horton et al 2017 the present paper is based on these recommendations and applies them to precipitation prediction for the upper rhône catchment in the swiss alps using ams of varying complexity it aims at illustrating the relevance of a fully automatic objective and global optimization technique for ams the applications are indeed numerous as ams must be adapted to every new location they are applied or to any new predictand they should predict the data ams and optimization techniques sequential and gas are presented in section 2 the results are first given for the optimization of the analogy of atmospheric circulation only section 3 before being extended to a method adding a second level of analogy on moisture variables section 4 general discussions section 5 and conclusions section 6 follow 2 data and methods 2 1 description of study area the study area is the alpine upper rhône catchment in switzerland fig 1 the altitude ranges from 372 to 4634m a s l and the area is 5524km2 this region is the target of the minerve modélisation des intempéries de nature extrême sur les rivières valaisannes et de leurs effets project which aimed at real time flood management on the upper rhône catchment garcía hernández et al 2009 even though the region is rather small the meteorological influences related to extreme weather conditions vary substantially within it see horton et al 2012 indeed a high spatial variability of precipitation climatology exists which is due to the complex orography of the region and the mix of various meteorological influences based on different climatological analyses the precipitation gauge stations in the catchment were clustered in ten subregions fig 1 1 swiss chablais 2 trient valley 3 west bernese alps 4 lower rhone valley 5 southern valleys 6 southern ridges 7 upper rhone valley 8 southeast ridges 9 east bernese alps 10 conches valley 2 2 data ams rely on two types of data predictors which are atmospheric variables describing the state of the atmosphere at a synoptic scale and the predictand which is the local weather variable one wants to predict predictors are generally extracted from reanalysis datasets the ncep ncar reanalysis i 6 hourly 17 pressure levels at a resolution of 2 5 kalnay et al 1996 was used here but it could have been any other reanalysis dataset the predictand which is to be predicted is here the daily precipitation 6 a m to 6 a m the next day measured at the meteoswiss network stations for the period 1961 2008 the time series from every available gauge station were averaged over the ten subregions fig 1 which were approximately 500km2 each to smooth local effects obled et al 2002 marty et al 2012 this helps accounting for local variability mainly when convective processes are involved which slightly increases the prediction skill it must be stressed that the predictand here is a temporally cumulated variable compared to the meteorological predictors which may be considered instantaneous depending on the duration of the accumulation period here 24h but could have been 6h 12h or more than 24h the choice of predictors will vary the 48 yr precipitation dataset was divided into a calibration period cp and a validation period vp using data independent of the cp to validate the results is very important in order to assess the robustness of the proposed improvements and to avoid over parametrization of the method in order to reduce potential biases related to trends linked to climate change or to the evolution in measurement techniques the selection of the vp was evenly distributed over the entire series ben daoud 2010 thus one out of every six years was selected for validation which represents a total of 8years for the vp and 40 for the cp this choice of sequence was made to have similar statistical characteristics between the cp and vp 2 3 the analogue method multiple variations of the analogue method exist most of which are not detailed here see ben daoud et al 2016 for a more comprehensive listing however there are mainly two parameterizations that are most often used for precipitation prediction and that are considered as reference one that relies on an analogy of the atmospheric circulation and another that adds a second level of analogy on moisture variables obled et al 2002 bontron and obled 2005 marty et al 2012 the method based on the analogy of synoptic circulation consists of the following steps table 1 the similarity of the atmospheric circulation of a target date with every day of the archive is assessed by processing the s1 criterion eq 1 teweles and wobus 1954 drosdowsky and zhang 2003 which is a comparison of gradients over a certain spatial window 1 s 1 100 i δ z i δ z i i max δ z i δ z i where δ z i is the difference in geopotential height between the i th pair of adjacent points of gridded data describing the target situation and δ z i is the corresponding observed geopotential height difference in the candidate situation the differences are processed separately in both north and east directions over the selected spatial domain the smaller the s1 values the more similar the pressure fields bontron and obled 2005 showed that the geopotential height at 500hpa z500 and 1000hpa z1000 are the best first predictors of the ncep ncar reanalysis i dataset and that the s1 criterion performs better than scores based on absolute distances the reason for such better results is that the s1 criterion allows comparison of the circulation patterns by means of the gradients rather than the absolute value of the geopotential height which better represent the flow direction to cope with seasonal effects candidate dates are extracted within a period of four months centered around the target date for every year of the archive this method using two geopotential heights is named here 2z the n 1 dates with the lowest values of s1 are considered as analogues to the target day the number of analogues n 1 is a parameter to calibrate then the daily observed precipitation amount for the n 1 selected dates provide the empirical conditional distribution considered as the probabilistic prediction for the target day the other most well known parametrization adds a second level of analogy on the moisture variables method 2z 2mi table 2 the predictor that bontron 2004 found optimal for france is a moisture index made of the product of the total precipitable water tpw with the relative humidity at 850hpa rh850 horton 2012 confirmed that this index is also better for the swiss alps than any other variable from the ncep ncar reanalysis i considered independently when adding a second level of analogy n 2 dates are subsampled within the n 1 analogues of the atmospheric circulation to end up with a smaller number of analogue situations when this second level of analogy is added a higher number of analogues n 1 is kept on the first level prediction of moisture fields by nwp models are more model dependent and more uncertain than pressure variables this implies that the 2z 2mi method when used in real time forecasting is very dependent on the skill of the nwp model in predicting moisture fields therefore its use is often restricted to the first lead times 2 4 performance assessment the performance assessment in the present context consists of verifying the prediction of an ensemble probabilistic technique the set of precipitation values collected with each analogue can be considered as a sample drawn from the conditional distribution associated with the current circulation the score that is most often used to assess an am performance is the crps continuous ranked probability score brown 1974 matheson and winkler 1976 hersbach 2000 it allows evaluating the predicted cumulative distribution functions f y for example of the precipitation values y from analogue situations compared to the observed value y 0 the better the prediction the smaller the score the mean crps of a prediction series of length n can be written as 2 crps 1 n i 1 n f i y h i y y i 0 2 dy where h y y i 0 is the heaviside function that is null when y y i 0 0 and has the value 1 otherwise in order to compare the value of the score relative to a reference one often considers its skill score expression and uses the climatological distribution of precipitation from the entire archive as the reference the crpss continuous ranked probability skill score is thus defined as follows 3 crpss crps crps r crps p crps r 1 crps crps r where crps r is the crps value for the reference and crps p would be the one for a perfect prediction which implies crps p 0 a better prediction is characterized by an increase in crpss note however that the choice of reference does not matter so much when assessing potential improvements of the method since we consider more its relative increase or decrease rather than the crpss absolute value 2 5 sequential calibration ams are usually calibrated by a semi automatic sequential procedure as elaborated by bontron 2004 see also radanovics et al 2013 ben daoud et al 2016 the calibration technique optimizes the spatial windows in which the predictors are compared and the number of analogues for every level of analogy by maximizing the performance score crpss however the different analogy levels are calibrated sequentially and the meteorological variables pressure levels and temporal windows are chosen manually the procedure as defined by bontron 2004 consists of the following steps 1 manual selection of the following parameters a meteorological variable b pressure level c temporal window hour of the day d number of analogues n 1 2 for every level of analogy a identification for the analogy level considered of the most skilled unitary cell of all predictors jointly over a large domain by a full scanning of the grid b from this most skilled cell the spatial window is expanded by successive iterations in the direction of greater performance gain until no improvement is reached c the number of analogue situations is then reconsidered and optimized for the current level of analogy 3 a new level of analogy can then be added based on other variables such as the moisture index with some chosen pressure levels temporal windows and initial number of analogues n 2 the procedure starts again from step 2 calibration of the spatial window and the number of analogues for the new level the parameters calibrated on the previous analogy levels are fixed and do not change 4 finally the number of analogues n 1 and n 2 for the different levels of analogy are reassessed this is done iteratively by varying the number of analogues of each level in a systematic way the calibration is done in successive steps with a limited number of parameters previously calibrated parameters are generally not reassessed except for the number of analogues this procedure was used to calibrate the methods that were here considered as references to further assess the ability of genetic algorithms to outperform the classic approach 2 6 genetic algorithms genetic algorithms gas were developed by holland 1992 and goldberg 1989 they are part of the evolutionary algorithms bäck and schwefel 1993 schwefel 1993 which were inspired by some mechanisms in biological evolution such as reproduction genetic mutations chromosomal crossovers and natural selection gas seek the global optimum on a complex surface theoretically without restriction this is of interest for ams which are characterized by a complex high dimensional error function having multiple local optima practically gas allow rapidly approaching satisfactory solutions but they are not guaranteed to provide the optimum solution zitzler et al 2004 it is indeed mainly a matter of time when the optimizer gets closer to the global optimum any new improvement takes more time to appear and the final adjustment of the parameters can be very time consuming bäck 1993 for problems that require a significant amount of time to evaluate the objective function as in the case of ams because it needs to make a prediction for every day of the cp the number of generations must be limited to ensure a reasonable processing time thus different acceptable solutions can result from one or more optimization runs holland 1992 this is both a strength and a weakness of gas they are very good at exploring complex parameter spaces to identify the most promising areas but they will not necessarily always find the best solution with the optimal values for all parameters holland 1992 the optimizations here were performed based on the recommended ga parametrization for ams as described in horton et al 2017 as the optimization is mostly sensitive to the mutation operator that randomly changes some values in the parameter sets parallel optimizations are considered with variants of this operator according to horton et al 2017 3 non uniform mutation michalewicz 1996 with varying parameters 1 multi scale mutation horton et al 2017 2 chromosome of adaptive search radius horton et al 2017 a population size of 500 individuals i e parameter sets of the am was considered and the optimization was stopped when the best individual with the highest crpss performance score did not evolve for 20 generations cycles of optimization 3 optimization of the circulation analogy the analogy of the atmospheric circulation was optimized for the ten subregions section 2 1 independently we started from the simplest am and increased the complexity to identify the degrees of freedom that are of interest thus the tested parametrization evolved iteratively in complexity the detailed results of the intermediate stages are not provided in this paper see horton 2012 for the details the reference method for the analogy of the atmospheric circulation 2z table 1 based on z500 and z1000 was first considered the optimizer had to choose simultaneously the number of analogues both spatial windows with no overlapping constraint i e they can differ from one pressure level to another as well as the temporal windows hours of observation of the geopotential height which cannot be achieved with the sequential calibration technique the performance score crpss was slightly improved with these limited degrees of freedom relative to the 2z reference method calibrated with the sequential procedure some tests showed that most of the gains were due to the non overlapping spatial windows this demonstrated that the optimizer could obtain relevant parameters for a simple method then an additional degree of freedom was provided to the gas by letting them choose the pressure levels along with the other parameters number of analogues spatial and temporal windows which is also a non automated process in the sequential calibration this degree of freedom increased the optimization time and might decrease the number of simulations that converge to a single solution however most solutions were very close in terms of the performance score which was further improved the selected pressure levels were z500 or z700 for the upper level and z925 or z1000 most often for the lower level parallel analyses showed that the analogy of circulation is incomplete and that geopotential heights still contain relevant information that can improve the statistical relationship therefore a third followed by a fourth circulation predictor were added still only geopotential heights there was no constraint on the predictors so that the same pressure level could be selected more than once further improvements were found in the performance score both for the cp and the vp confirming that this additional information was beneficial for the quality of the prediction finally a weighting of the analogy criteria values per pressure level was proposed again optimized by gas the weighting operates in the combination of the s1 criteria processed on every level which were previously averaged with equal weights the role of this new degree of freedom is to give more weight to the levels with greater predictive capacity and to consider the differences in the geopotential height variability with altitude the number of circulation predictors still only geopotential heights was then successively increased up to ten considering the weighting of the analogy criteria values the addition of circulation predictors substantially improved the prediction skill for both the cp and the vp only up to four predictors fig 2 afterwards the score on the vp was more variable eventually even showing a decrease which revealed an over parametrization of the method and thus a lack of robustness the score for the cp might also present local decreases when many predictors are involved due to increasing difficulty for the optimizer to converge selecting four circulation predictors geopotential heights was considered optimal for this case study since the gain in crpss was significant and the model remained relatively simple it cannot be ruled out that another number would prevail in a region other than the upper rhône catchment under other meteorological conditions or with another reanalysis dataset 3 1 which parameters are optimized the chosen method for the atmospheric circulation analogy based on four circulation predictors geopotential heights and which is here named 4zo o for optimized was based on the following degrees of freedom selection of pressure levels 4 degrees temporal windows 4 degrees spatial windows 4 4 degrees weights 4 degrees number of analogues 1 degree this adds up to 29 degrees of freedom that were optimized simultaneously 3 2 results for the 4zo method the resulting optimized parameters for 4zo vary from one subregion to another the optimized spatial windows are given for every subregion in fig 3 and the selected pressure levels in table 3 the resulting crpss scores are provided in fig 4 and were on average 35 8 for the cp and 35 5 for the vp compared to 31 1 and 32 3 respectively for the reference method 2z on the atmospheric circulation optimized by the sequential procedure the score was also calculated for three precipitation thresholds p 1mm p 0 1 p10 and p 0 5 p10 p10 being the daily precipitation with a 10year return period table 4 the gain in score increased with the precipitation threshold the relative improvement of the crpss was on average for the different thresholds 13 3 15 4 and 29 1 for the cp and 7 9 11 1 and 34 5 for the vp the optimization thus improved the prediction even more for days with heavy precipitation than for the usual days to assess the parameters cross compatibility and the spatial coherence of the resulting parameters those optimized for one subregion were applied to the others the resulting losses or gains of the crpss are displayed in fig 5 3 3 analysis the automatic selections of pressure levels table 3 and temporal windows not shown for the analogy of circulation showed a great homogeneity and were spatially consistent first the level z1000 was always selected twice the first time at 6 or 12h and the second always at 30h and z700 was selected once for every subregion always at 24h the level that varied from one subregion to another albeit in a spatially consistent way was the upper level always at 12h which was z300 for the north west part of the catchment z500 for most of the other subregions and z600 for the conches valley the optimizer thus provided consistent selections of pressure levels and temporal windows the automatic selection of pressure levels is a big advantage in favour of global optimization the resulting spatial windows fig 3 may look very diverse first but there are significant similarities for subregions located within the same vicinity the first four subregions were characterized by a large spatial window on the upper level whereas it was smaller elsewhere for most subregions the second level z700 was characterized by thin and longitudinally extended spatial windows the third level z1000 at 6 or 12h also had longitudinally extended domains which were slightly larger the last one z1000 at 30h had rather large and squared windows subregions number 5 southern valleys and 6 southern ridges had exactly the same spatial windows which suggests that they behave in a similar way and thus could have been merged this similarity is a good sign for the accuracy of the optimized parameters the performance scores showed non negligible improvements for both the cp and vp fig 4 compared to the 2z reference method optimized by the sequential procedure even more interestingly the results for higher precipitation thresholds table 4 showed the largest improvements this is of particular interest in the framework of flood forecasting the further improvement of days with higher precipitation totals is likely related to the fact that larger values contribute more to the crps score which means that better predicting these days results in significant increase in the global performance score the analysis of the parameters cross compatibility showed that the parameters were obviously optimal on the cp for the subregion for which they were optimized fig 5 top however the losses in crpss when exchanging the parameters were not of the same magnitude among the different subregions indeed the upper rhone valley 7 and moreover the southeast ridges 8 seemed to behave differently these two regions have different climatic properties than the others as they are particularly sensitive to southerly flows indeed almost all heavy precipitation events occurred under a southerly regime such as in the liguria piedmont and aosta regions in italy whereas the other subregions of the catchment had extreme events mainly under a westerly regime horton et al 2012 thus as the performance score is significantly influenced by heavy precipitation values the parameters for the different subregions are likely optimized to better predict these days it can then be expected that the optimal parameters differ between these two subregions and the others this points at the importance of considering leading meteorological influences during precipitation station clustering which are not always best represented by physical distance globally the same cross compatibility structure could be observed for the vp fig 5 bottom but in this case minor improvements were occasionally observed when switching the parameters because of the presence of other events in the vp that might be better predicted by a different parameter set the relatively small differences in scores between parameterizations indicated that even though the parameters might differ significantly the performance might not be drastically affected even a change in the pressure level did not mean a radical drop in the score value a different parametrization may lead to a distinct selection of analogue days and thus to an improvement of the prediction under certain weather conditions at the expense of others 4 optimization of the analogy with moisture information it is known that moisture variables as a second level of analogy do provide improvements to the method section 2 3 the moisture index which is a combination of the relative humidity and precipitable water has thus also to be optimized in order to do so a constraint on the optimizer had to be introduced to select the same temporal window hour of the day for both variables two methods were assessed one with two moisture predictors moisture index on two pressure levels or at two different hours named 4zo 2mio and one with four moisture predictors named 4zo 4mio when introducing two predictors for the moisture analogy the number of degrees of freedom increased to 42 and to 54 with four predictors however there was no substantial difference in the performance scores between both 4zo 2mio and 4zo 4mio methods which suggests that considering four moisture predictors is not necessary for this reason only the results of 4zo 2mio are presented the optimization was processed on both levels of analogy simultaneously this implies that the analogy of the atmospheric circulation could change because of the new moisture information 4 1 results for the 4zo 2mio method as previously the optimized parameters differed from one subregion to another but to an even greater extent the resulting spatial windows are displayed in fig 6 for 4zo 2mio along with the selected pressure levels for both the circulation and moisture analogy table 5 the crpss scores of the optimized 4zo 2mio method are provided in fig 7 and amounted on average to 40 cp and 40 3 vp compared to 35 2 cp and 36 2 vp for the reference method 2z 2mi on the moisture analogy optimized with the sequential procedure the parameters cross compatibilities are shown in fig 8 as for 4zo the 4zo 2mio method presented larger improvements in the prediction of heavy rainfall table 6 4 2 analysis when optimizing a method consisting of two levels of analogy the introduction of moisture variables in the second level has an influence on the parameter values of the first level this means that the two levels of analogy bring complementary information and are thus not independent this is first visible in the number n 1 of analogues to be selected on the first level and in the selection of the pressure levels for the circulation analogy a change in the optimal value of n 1 was already known and taken into account in the 2z 2mi method table 2 however a change in the optimal pressure levels for the circulation analogy is a new result that has never been highlighted before as for the sequential procedure the optimal value of n 1 increased when adding a second level of analogy fig 9 one can also see that the optimal number of analogues n 2 for the second level of analogy of 4zo 2mio was slightly inferior to n 1 from 4zo but very close there is a globally common tendency between the optimal number of analogues of both methods n 1 of the 4zo method and n 1 and n 2 of 4zo 2mio tend to be higher or lower together for a given subregion the optimal final number of analogues did not vary much 23 n 1 33 for 4zo and 21 n 2 28 for 4zo 2mio however the optimal number of the n 1 analogues of the first level of 4zo 2mio varied to a greater extent 48 n 1 84 in this latter method it may be problematic to consider a fixed and unique value for all regions as for the pressure levels z1000 which was previously systematically selected twice table 3 was here less often chosen once or even not at all for 4zo 2mio table 5 there was indeed a vertical shift in the previously selected z1000 for lower pressure levels that was even slightly stronger with four moisture predictors than with two not shown this change is likely due to the fact that when considering only the circulation analogy the method tried to consider information that can serve as a proxy for moisture assessment whereas it did not need it with the moisture index this can only be assessed by a global optimization technique that can work jointly on both levels of analogy the selected pressure levels for the analogy of the moisture index were strongly centered around 700hpa and 600hpa no other value was selected when considering two moisture predictors table 5 it was sometimes more efficient in terms of prediction performance to consider the moisture at 700hpa twice but at different hours rather than selecting another pressure level besides the optimizer never chose the same pressure level at the same hour for any variable even though it could do so the selected pressure levels for the moisture analogy differed from the reference method tables 2 and 5 last row the selection of temporal windows for atmospheric circulation was similar to the preceding optimization in order of increasing pressure 12h 24 30h 12h 30h but sometimes with some variability when it comes to the moisture analogy there was a clear tendency to select 12h and 24h the optimized spatial windows for the atmospheric circulation have also changed fig 6 the very large domains on the upper level of the first four subregions were not present anymore and more variability could be observed the selected points for the moisture analogy were always located near the catchment including at least one of the nearest points from the reanalysis dataset and the spatial windows were relatively small thus for this case study there is no need to look for distant moisture information and the search could be reduced to a smaller domain the crpss scores were improved by considering the moisture information fig 7 to be compared with fig 4 the optimized method also performed significantly better than the 2z 2mi reference method optimized by the sequential procedure when it comes to improvements for days with precipitation above the three thresholds p 1mm p 0 1 p10 and p 0 5 p10 the conclusion is the same as before that is a significant improvement in the prediction compared to the reference method mainly for heavy rainfall the analysis of the parameters cross compatibility fig 8 was also very similar to the one of the circulation analogy only the same pattern could be observed with a drop of performance for the subregions characterized by different meteorological influences however the losses in performance were globally more important than before suggesting that more complex methods with moisture variables are less transposable to another subregion consistent with the observations of chardon et al 2014 even though both were located within the same grid cell of the reanalysis dataset moisture fields have greater variability than pressure fields and thus a change in the spatial windows can have a greater impact on the method performance indeed the two regions with the lowest cross compatibility with the others were the upper rhone valley 7 and the southeast ridges 8 which had similar optimal pressure levels and temporal windows to other regions but had rather different spatial windows for the moisture predictor predictors based on moisture variables do significantly increase the prediction skill and are thus recommended as long as they are reliable in real time forecasting their reliability depends on the lead time for lead times superior to 3 4days the uncertainties related to moisture variables from nwp models become fairly high which reduces the relevance of methods relying on this information in climate downscaling studies it mainly depends on the coherence of the climatologies between the archive and the gcm model outputs one should however not establish an am with moisture variables for too large a region as the transferability is reduced see chardon et al 2014 for alternative approaches 5 discussion the optimization of the am by means of gas has been undertaken in successive stages by releasing progressively new degrees of freedom this approach allowed us to differentiate the contributions to performance gains as well as to identify possible over parametrization the main improvements obtained in the present case study are due to the following elements using four pressure levels for the circulation analogy seemed to be an optimal number for the studied region length of archive available and target predictand considered beyond four the validation score was more variable revealing a loss in robustness due to over parametrization the automatic and joint optimization of all parameters the number of analogues selection of pressure levels temporal and spatial windows these parameters are highly interdependent so one needs to optimize them jointly to identify optimal combinations indeed there is a strong interdependence between space and time in the atmospheric circulation so that e g the spatial window should move upstream the main atmospheric flow for earlier temporal windows the introduction of distinct spatial windows between pressure levels the synoptic circulation is characterized by features with very different scales depending on the height and important information for predicting precipitation is not necessarily located in the same area from one level to another the weighting of the analogy criteria between different pressure levels this can be influenced by the variability of the geopotential height with altitude or the levels of significance in regard to the meteorological processes specific to a region there is a trend in the weighting of circulation predictors to decrease with the increase in pressure as one can see in fig 10 for the three optimized methods however the values remained approximately equal this may not be the most influencing factor and we may suggest removing it first when trying to reduce the degrees of freedom the joint optimization of the circulation and moisture analogy levels which are usually calibrated successively we could demonstrate that there is a dependency between the analogy levels and that in order to find the optimal parameters one must consider them jointly gas have proved very useful to optimize complex variants of the am and to assess new degrees of freedom that were not available so far however it can be dangerous to add too many parameters to optimize indeed the optimizer will probably use them to successfully improve the calibration score so the validation control remains very important to determine if one is actually improving the method or if it is being over parametrized moreover it might not always be desirable to increase the degrees of freedom and some constraints e g same weighting of the analogy criteria between different pressure levels can be justified however one should first assess the consequence of a constraint before establishing it in this sense even though not all degrees of freedom are useful gas allow us to assess their influence finally gas could be used to identify among other things the best pairs of spatial and temporal windows in order to later create a simpler regional method the convergence of parallel optimizations decreased when the am to optimize became more and more complex the optimizer did not always converge to the exact global optimum but to its surroundings this is related to the fact that the optimization slows down when it gets closer to the global optimum and that one must stop it before the end because of the required processing time see for example the slow down of the improvements over generations in fig 11 the resulting parameters might sometimes present non negligible differences even though the score is similar through monte carlo analyses of the parameter space properties of the am horton 2012 showed that some parameters of the method have a wide range of acceptable values the spatial windows for example can be larger than the optimal size without much impact on the score while they cannot be smaller see also bontron 2004 we also observed that the selection of pressure levels is not a parameter as discrete as we would have thought as sometimes choosing another level had reduced impact on the performance this is particularly true for levels at higher altitude but can be more critical for lower layers it was thus interesting to sometimes obtain several sets of near optimal parameters but with some nuances to get an idea of the sensitivity of the parameters for a given region and to compare the score for the vp in this regard a cross validation technique may be advisable however as solutions identified in different regions of the parameter space might provide sufficiently good performance an ensemble of these could be used instead of a unique solution these could account for the parameters uncertainty in the am and could also increase the sample size contributing to the empirical distribution of precipitation values an approach that can also be recommended is to first explore a wide range of the parameter space with some optimizations and to narrow it according to the results for more targeted optimizations that are likely to go faster and to perform better we tried to optimize the length of the preselection period i e the seasonal stratification which is a 4 month window jointly with the other parameters but no improvement was observed optimizing the moisture flux which is composed of the moisture index multiplied by the wind flux was also assessed however the results were not better than when considering the moisture index alone this may be related to the fact that the optimizer tries to provide the best analogy of the atmospheric circulation in the first place which makes the wind information less relevant in the second level of analogy methods with higher complexity that integrate moisture predictors are less transposable than simpler ones it was also noticed in another unpublished work that it is by far better to optimize for two subregions jointly than to optimize on one and to apply its parametrization to the other finally the discretization in subregions is an important process and should be handled with care indeed the physical distance is not always the leading factor to define a subregion for example the southeast ridges subregion does not behave like its surroundings and differs in its parametrization because of different leading meteorological influences gas are relatively heavy on processing and require an it infrastructure capable of performing thousands of hours of calculations here a single optimization over 100 generations took almost 300h cpu on a small intel xeon based high performance computing cluster with xeon 5670 2 97ghz 12 cores running linux redhat however they automatically optimize all parameters of the am which is not possible with the sequential calibration therefore much human time previously required to successively assess numerous combinations of parameters particularly the selection of pressure levels and temporal windows is saved the ability to jointly optimize all parameters is important given the strong dependencies between them and between the levels of analogy furthermore ams optimized with gas showed an improvement in predictions for days with heavier precipitation including extremes even though no new extreme value was added to the existing precipitation archive the distribution of analogue precipitation values for a target situation can move towards the targeted extreme by sampling better candidate situations then the subset of precipitation values collected on the analogue dates can be considered as a sample of the conditional distribution of precipitation associated with this situation a truncated exponential or a gamma distribution model can be fitted and extrapolated to extreme values not contained in the sample or even in the whole precipitation archive obled et al 2002 another possible approach is to combine ams with other methods e g chardon et al 2014 6 conclusions and perspectives ams are usually calibrated by a semi automatic sequential procedure that has strong limitations i it cannot automatically choose the pressure levels and temporal windows for a given meteorological variable ii it cannot handle dependencies between parameters and iii it cannot easily handle new degrees of freedom here a global optimization approach relying on genetic algorithms could optimize all parameters jointly and automatically it allowed objective selection of some parameters that were manually assessed beforehand the parameters resulting from the optimization by gas were very consistent in terms of the selection of pressure levels and temporal and spatial windows there was a good coherence and even identical results for subregions under similar meteorological influences which confirm that the optimized parameters were coherent despite an eventual first impression of great variability in the spatial windows when adding moisture variables the results showed a higher variability but remained highly acceptable and coherent strong dependencies between the parameters of the am were observed thus the sequential calibration which optimizes the parameters successively may not lead to the optimal combination moreover it contains several manual systematic assessments such as the selection of pressure levels and temporal windows gas however can automatically select pressure levels and temporal windows which can save a considerable amount of human time a great advantage of a global optimization is its ability to approach or reach optimal parameter values when they are considered jointly a dependence in the selected parameters between the circulation analogy and moisture variables was identified when the two analogy levels are considered together the optimal parameters of the circulation analogy changed this complexity can only be exploited in a suitable manner by global optimization methods for the present case study there seemed to be an optimum number of pressure levels to consider for the circulation analogy which was four before losing consistency of the real gains the circulation analogy was improved by introducing a weighting between pressure levels and considering independent spatial windows between pressure levels gas provided parameterizations of ams that exceeded the performance of the sequential calibration in addition it has been observed that the prediction for days with strong precipitation were improved to a greater extent which is clearly interesting in a hydrological context this work is by no means exhaustive and is meant to open a door to new explorations of ams with gas or another global optimization technique it is even possible to let the optimizer chose the meteorological variable to be used as a predictor as well as the analogy criteria which is the topic of work in progress moreover the am has been explored for decades for precipitation prediction but not as intensively for other predictands a global optimizer such

7613,analogue methods provide a statistical precipitation prediction based on synoptic predictors supplied by general circulation models or numerical weather prediction models the method samples a selection of days in the archives that are similar to the target day to be predicted and consider their set of corresponding observed precipitation the predictand as the conditional distribution for the target day the relationship between the predictors and predictands relies on some parameters that characterize how and where the similarity between two atmospheric situations is defined this relationship is usually established by a semi automatic sequential procedure that has strong limitations i it cannot automatically choose the pressure levels and temporal windows hour of the day for a given meteorological variable ii it cannot handle dependencies between parameters and iii it cannot easily handle new degrees of freedom in this work a global optimization approach relying on genetic algorithms could optimize all parameters jointly and automatically the global optimization was applied to some variants of the analogue method for the rhône catchment in the swiss alps the performance scores increased compared to reference methods especially for days with high precipitation totals the resulting parameters were found to be relevant and coherent between the different subregions of the catchment moreover they were obtained automatically and objectively which reduces the effort that needs to be invested in exploration attempts when adapting the method to a new region or for a new predictand for example it obviates the need to assess a large number of combinations of pressure levels and temporal windows of predictor variables that were manually selected beforehand the optimization could also take into account parameter inter dependencies in addition the approach allowed for new degrees of freedom such as a possible weighting between pressure levels and non overlapping spatial windows keywords precipitation prediction analogue method optimization genetic algorithms alpine climate 1 introduction the analogue method am is a downscaling technique based on the idea expressed by lorenz 1956 1969 that similar situations in terms of atmospheric circulation are likely to lead to similar local weather duband 1970 it uses predictor variables describing the

resulting forecast still presents large uncertainties and biases although these outputs are essential they can be supplemented by other sources of forecasts providing useful information in contrast to local nwp models ams can transform at low cost the synoptic scale information provided by the global nwp model into precipitation forecasts they rely on the inherent relationship between the synoptic scale influences and the related local weather that can be exploited from the archive of observed precipitation running an am approach is fast enough that it can search for analogues for each day up to ten days ahead in a matter of seconds to minutes it can eventually use the different members of an ensemble forecast and or those issued by different nwp models e g noaa gfs or ecmwf ifs in climate studies ams are used to downscale the outputs of a general circulation model gcm or regional climate model rcm simulation runs dayon et al 2015 or to reconstruct past weather conditions caillouet et al 2016 in future climate studies rcms are often used to dynamically downscale precipitation to a local scale however even though the relevance of rcms outputs increases a bias correction of the outputs is often still required particularly in complex terrain moreover their application is computer intensive which makes it difficult to cover all combinations of climate scenarios and gcms therefore the idea is to bypass the small scale simulations and to go from the large scale situation to the end variables such as precipitation by statistical downscaling maraun et al 2010 the spatial transferability of ams is analysed in chardon et al 2014 and radanovics et al 2013 and their temporal transferability in dayon et al 2015 and caillouet et al 2016 the physical consistency of multivariate predictions is presented in raynaud et al 2016 the method can be designed with multiple successive subsampling steps or analogy levels each of them relying on different meteorological variables a certain number of parameters define the relationship between predictors and predictands such as the choice of the predictor variable its pressure level and temporal window hour of the day to consider the spatial domain to use for the comparison as well as the analogy criterion itself and finally the number of analogue situations to keep at each subsampling level these parameters are usually calibrated by means of a semi automatic sequential procedure bontron 2004 radanovics et al 2013 i e by optimizing each single parameter one at a time in an arbitrarily chosen order with no or little reassessment this sequential approach therefore has strong limitations i it cannot automatically choose the optimal pressure levels and the temporal windows for a given meteorological variable ii it cannot handle dependencies between the parameters within a level of analogy and even less between them and iii it cannot easily handle new degrees of freedom such as a possible weighting between the pressure levels thus even if the processing involved is relatively fast the sequential approach requires laborious assessments of predictor combinations variables pressure levels temporal windows moreover it presents a high risk of ending in a local optimum because of subjective initial choices and lack of consideration of parameter inter dependencies other calibration methods exist for specific applications such as radar images panziera et al 2011 foresti et al 2015 aiming to overcome these limitations a global optimization by genetic algorithms gas was introduced an intensive assessment resulted in recommendations to parametrize gas in order to optimize ams successfully horton et al 2017 the present paper is based on these recommendations and applies them to precipitation prediction for the upper rhône catchment in the swiss alps using ams of varying complexity it aims at illustrating the relevance of a fully automatic objective and global optimization technique for ams the applications are indeed numerous as ams must be adapted to every new location they are applied or to any new predictand they should predict the data ams and optimization techniques sequential and gas are presented in section 2 the results are first given for the optimization of the analogy of atmospheric circulation only section 3 before being extended to a method adding a second level of analogy on moisture variables section 4 general discussions section 5 and conclusions section 6 follow 2 data and methods 2 1 description of study area the study area is the alpine upper rhône catchment in switzerland fig 1 the altitude ranges from 372 to 4634m a s l and the area is 5524km2 this region is the target of the minerve modélisation des intempéries de nature extrême sur les rivières valaisannes et de leurs effets project which aimed at real time flood management on the upper rhône catchment garcía hernández et al 2009 even though the region is rather small the meteorological influences related to extreme weather conditions vary substantially within it see horton et al 2012 indeed a high spatial variability of precipitation climatology exists which is due to the complex orography of the region and the mix of various meteorological influences based on different climatological analyses the precipitation gauge stations in the catchment were clustered in ten subregions fig 1 1 swiss chablais 2 trient valley 3 west bernese alps 4 lower rhone valley 5 southern valleys 6 southern ridges 7 upper rhone valley 8 southeast ridges 9 east bernese alps 10 conches valley 2 2 data ams rely on two types of data predictors which are atmospheric variables describing the state of the atmosphere at a synoptic scale and the predictand which is the local weather variable one wants to predict predictors are generally extracted from reanalysis datasets the ncep ncar reanalysis i 6 hourly 17 pressure levels at a resolution of 2 5 kalnay et al 1996 was used here but it could have been any other reanalysis dataset the predictand which is to be predicted is here the daily precipitation 6 a m to 6 a m the next day measured at the meteoswiss network stations for the period 1961 2008 the time series from every available gauge station were averaged over the ten subregions fig 1 which were approximately 500km2 each to smooth local effects obled et al 2002 marty et al 2012 this helps accounting for local variability mainly when convective processes are involved which slightly increases the prediction skill it must be stressed that the predictand here is a temporally cumulated variable compared to the meteorological predictors which may be considered instantaneous depending on the duration of the accumulation period here 24h but could have been 6h 12h or more than 24h the choice of predictors will vary the 48 yr precipitation dataset was divided into a calibration period cp and a validation period vp using data independent of the cp to validate the results is very important in order to assess the robustness of the proposed improvements and to avoid over parametrization of the method in order to reduce potential biases related to trends linked to climate change or to the evolution in measurement techniques the selection of the vp was evenly distributed over the entire series ben daoud 2010 thus one out of every six years was selected for validation which represents a total of 8years for the vp and 40 for the cp this choice of sequence was made to have similar statistical characteristics between the cp and vp 2 3 the analogue method multiple variations of the analogue method exist most of which are not detailed here see ben daoud et al 2016 for a more comprehensive listing however there are mainly two parameterizations that are most often used for precipitation prediction and that are considered as reference one that relies on an analogy of the atmospheric circulation and another that adds a second level of analogy on moisture variables obled et al 2002 bontron and obled 2005 marty et al 2012 the method based on the analogy of synoptic circulation consists of the following steps table 1 the similarity of the atmospheric circulation of a target date with every day of the archive is assessed by processing the s1 criterion eq 1 teweles and wobus 1954 drosdowsky and zhang 2003 which is a comparison of gradients over a certain spatial window 1 s 1 100 i δ z i δ z i i max δ z i δ z i where δ z i is the difference in geopotential height between the i th pair of adjacent points of gridded data describing the target situation and δ z i is the corresponding observed geopotential height difference in the candidate situation the differences are processed separately in both north and east directions over the selected spatial domain the smaller the s1 values the more similar the pressure fields bontron and obled 2005 showed that the geopotential height at 500hpa z500 and 1000hpa z1000 are the best first predictors of the ncep ncar reanalysis i dataset and that the s1 criterion performs better than scores based on absolute distances the reason for such better results is that the s1 criterion allows comparison of the circulation patterns by means of the gradients rather than the absolute value of the geopotential height which better represent the flow direction to cope with seasonal effects candidate dates are extracted within a period of four months centered around the target date for every year of the archive this method using two geopotential heights is named here 2z the n 1 dates with the lowest values of s1 are considered as analogues to the target day the number of analogues n 1 is a parameter to calibrate then the daily observed precipitation amount for the n 1 selected dates provide the empirical conditional distribution considered as the probabilistic prediction for the target day the other most well known parametrization adds a second level of analogy on the moisture variables method 2z 2mi table 2 the predictor that bontron 2004 found optimal for france is a moisture index made of the product of the total precipitable water tpw with the relative humidity at 850hpa rh850 horton 2012 confirmed that this index is also better for the swiss alps than any other variable from the ncep ncar reanalysis i considered independently when adding a second level of analogy n 2 dates are subsampled within the n 1 analogues of the atmospheric circulation to end up with a smaller number of analogue situations when this second level of analogy is added a higher number of analogues n 1 is kept on the first level prediction of moisture fields by nwp models are more model dependent and more uncertain than pressure variables this implies that the 2z 2mi method when used in real time forecasting is very dependent on the skill of the nwp model in predicting moisture fields therefore its use is often restricted to the first lead times 2 4 performance assessment the performance assessment in the present context consists of verifying the prediction of an ensemble probabilistic technique the set of precipitation values collected with each analogue can be considered as a sample drawn from the conditional distribution associated with the current circulation the score that is most often used to assess an am performance is the crps continuous ranked probability score brown 1974 matheson and winkler 1976 hersbach 2000 it allows evaluating the predicted cumulative distribution functions f y for example of the precipitation values y from analogue situations compared to the observed value y 0 the better the prediction the smaller the score the mean crps of a prediction series of length n can be written as 2 crps 1 n i 1 n f i y h i y y i 0 2 dy where h y y i 0 is the heaviside function that is null when y y i 0 0 and has the value 1 otherwise in order to compare the value of the score relative to a reference one often considers its skill score expression and uses the climatological distribution of precipitation from the entire archive as the reference the crpss continuous ranked probability skill score is thus defined as follows 3 crpss crps crps r crps p crps r 1 crps crps r where crps r is the crps value for the reference and crps p would be the one for a perfect prediction which implies crps p 0 a better prediction is characterized by an increase in crpss note however that the choice of reference does not matter so much when assessing potential improvements of the method since we consider more its relative increase or decrease rather than the crpss absolute value 2 5 sequential calibration ams are usually calibrated by a semi automatic sequential procedure as elaborated by bontron 2004 see also radanovics et al 2013 ben daoud et al 2016 the calibration technique optimizes the spatial windows in which the predictors are compared and the number of analogues for every level of analogy by maximizing the performance score crpss however the different analogy levels are calibrated sequentially and the meteorological variables pressure levels and temporal windows are chosen manually the procedure as defined by bontron 2004 consists of the following steps 1 manual selection of the following parameters a meteorological variable b pressure level c temporal window hour of the day d number of analogues n 1 2 for every level of analogy a identification for the analogy level considered of the most skilled unitary cell of all predictors jointly over a large domain by a full scanning of the grid b from this most skilled cell the spatial window is expanded by successive iterations in the direction of greater performance gain until no improvement is reached c the number of analogue situations is then reconsidered and optimized for the current level of analogy 3 a new level of analogy can then be added based on other variables such as the moisture index with some chosen pressure levels temporal windows and initial number of analogues n 2 the procedure starts again from step 2 calibration of the spatial window and the number of analogues for the new level the parameters calibrated on the previous analogy levels are fixed and do not change 4 finally the number of analogues n 1 and n 2 for the different levels of analogy are reassessed this is done iteratively by varying the number of analogues of each level in a systematic way the calibration is done in successive steps with a limited number of parameters previously calibrated parameters are generally not reassessed except for the number of analogues this procedure was used to calibrate the methods that were here considered as references to further assess the ability of genetic algorithms to outperform the classic approach 2 6 genetic algorithms genetic algorithms gas were developed by holland 1992 and goldberg 1989 they are part of the evolutionary algorithms bäck and schwefel 1993 schwefel 1993 which were inspired by some mechanisms in biological evolution such as reproduction genetic mutations chromosomal crossovers and natural selection gas seek the global optimum on a complex surface theoretically without restriction this is of interest for ams which are characterized by a complex high dimensional error function having multiple local optima practically gas allow rapidly approaching satisfactory solutions but they are not guaranteed to provide the optimum solution zitzler et al 2004 it is indeed mainly a matter of time when the optimizer gets closer to the global optimum any new improvement takes more time to appear and the final adjustment of the parameters can be very time consuming bäck 1993 for problems that require a significant amount of time to evaluate the objective function as in the case of ams because it needs to make a prediction for every day of the cp the number of generations must be limited to ensure a reasonable processing time thus different acceptable solutions can result from one or more optimization runs holland 1992 this is both a strength and a weakness of gas they are very good at exploring complex parameter spaces to identify the most promising areas but they will not necessarily always find the best solution with the optimal values for all parameters holland 1992 the optimizations here were performed based on the recommended ga parametrization for ams as described in horton et al 2017 as the optimization is mostly sensitive to the mutation operator that randomly changes some values in the parameter sets parallel optimizations are considered with variants of this operator according to horton et al 2017 3 non uniform mutation michalewicz 1996 with varying parameters 1 multi scale mutation horton et al 2017 2 chromosome of adaptive search radius horton et al 2017 a population size of 500 individuals i e parameter sets of the am was considered and the optimization was stopped when the best individual with the highest crpss performance score did not evolve for 20 generations cycles of optimization 3 optimization of the circulation analogy the analogy of the atmospheric circulation was optimized for the ten subregions section 2 1 independently we started from the simplest am and increased the complexity to identify the degrees of freedom that are of interest thus the tested parametrization evolved iteratively in complexity the detailed results of the intermediate stages are not provided in this paper see horton 2012 for the details the reference method for the analogy of the atmospheric circulation 2z table 1 based on z500 and z1000 was first considered the optimizer had to choose simultaneously the number of analogues both spatial windows with no overlapping constraint i e they can differ from one pressure level to another as well as the temporal windows hours of observation of the geopotential height which cannot be achieved with the sequential calibration technique the performance score crpss was slightly improved with these limited degrees of freedom relative to the 2z reference method calibrated with the sequential procedure some tests showed that most of the gains were due to the non overlapping spatial windows this demonstrated that the optimizer could obtain relevant parameters for a simple method then an additional degree of freedom was provided to the gas by letting them choose the pressure levels along with the other parameters number of analogues spatial and temporal windows which is also a non automated process in the sequential calibration this degree of freedom increased the optimization time and might decrease the number of simulations that converge to a single solution however most solutions were very close in terms of the performance score which was further improved the selected pressure levels were z500 or z700 for the upper level and z925 or z1000 most often for the lower level parallel analyses showed that the analogy of circulation is incomplete and that geopotential heights still contain relevant information that can improve the statistical relationship therefore a third followed by a fourth circulation predictor were added still only geopotential heights there was no constraint on the predictors so that the same pressure level could be selected more than once further improvements were found in the performance score both for the cp and the vp confirming that this additional information was beneficial for the quality of the prediction finally a weighting of the analogy criteria values per pressure level was proposed again optimized by gas the weighting operates in the combination of the s1 criteria processed on every level which were previously averaged with equal weights the role of this new degree of freedom is to give more weight to the levels with greater predictive capacity and to consider the differences in the geopotential height variability with altitude the number of circulation predictors still only geopotential heights was then successively increased up to ten considering the weighting of the analogy criteria values the addition of circulation predictors substantially improved the prediction skill for both the cp and the vp only up to four predictors fig 2 afterwards the score on the vp was more variable eventually even showing a decrease which revealed an over parametrization of the method and thus a lack of robustness the score for the cp might also present local decreases when many predictors are involved due to increasing difficulty for the optimizer to converge selecting four circulation predictors geopotential heights was considered optimal for this case study since the gain in crpss was significant and the model remained relatively simple it cannot be ruled out that another number would prevail in a region other than the upper rhône catchment under other meteorological conditions or with another reanalysis dataset 3 1 which parameters are optimized the chosen method for the atmospheric circulation analogy based on four circulation predictors geopotential heights and which is here named 4zo o for optimized was based on the following degrees of freedom selection of pressure levels 4 degrees temporal windows 4 degrees spatial windows 4 4 degrees weights 4 degrees number of analogues 1 degree this adds up to 29 degrees of freedom that were optimized simultaneously 3 2 results for the 4zo method the resulting optimized parameters for 4zo vary from one subregion to another the optimized spatial windows are given for every subregion in fig 3 and the selected pressure levels in table 3 the resulting crpss scores are provided in fig 4 and were on average 35 8 for the cp and 35 5 for the vp compared to 31 1 and 32 3 respectively for the reference method 2z on the atmospheric circulation optimized by the sequential procedure the score was also calculated for three precipitation thresholds p 1mm p 0 1 p10 and p 0 5 p10 p10 being the daily precipitation with a 10year return period table 4 the gain in score increased with the precipitation threshold the relative improvement of the crpss was on average for the different thresholds 13 3 15 4 and 29 1 for the cp and 7 9 11 1 and 34 5 for the vp the optimization thus improved the prediction even more for days with heavy precipitation than for the usual days to assess the parameters cross compatibility and the spatial coherence of the resulting parameters those optimized for one subregion were applied to the others the resulting losses or gains of the crpss are displayed in fig 5 3 3 analysis the automatic selections of pressure levels table 3 and temporal windows not shown for the analogy of circulation showed a great homogeneity and were spatially consistent first the level z1000 was always selected twice the first time at 6 or 12h and the second always at 30h and z700 was selected once for every subregion always at 24h the level that varied from one subregion to another albeit in a spatially consistent way was the upper level always at 12h which was z300 for the north west part of the catchment z500 for most of the other subregions and z600 for the conches valley the optimizer thus provided consistent selections of pressure levels and temporal windows the automatic selection of pressure levels is a big advantage in favour of global optimization the resulting spatial windows fig 3 may look very diverse first but there are significant similarities for subregions located within the same vicinity the first four subregions were characterized by a large spatial window on the upper level whereas it was smaller elsewhere for most subregions the second level z700 was characterized by thin and longitudinally extended spatial windows the third level z1000 at 6 or 12h also had longitudinally extended domains which were slightly larger the last one z1000 at 30h had rather large and squared windows subregions number 5 southern valleys and 6 southern ridges had exactly the same spatial windows which suggests that they behave in a similar way and thus could have been merged this similarity is a good sign for the accuracy of the optimized parameters the performance scores showed non negligible improvements for both the cp and vp fig 4 compared to the 2z reference method optimized by the sequential procedure even more interestingly the results for higher precipitation thresholds table 4 showed the largest improvements this is of particular interest in the framework of flood forecasting the further improvement of days with higher precipitation totals is likely related to the fact that larger values contribute more to the crps score which means that better predicting these days results in significant increase in the global performance score the analysis of the parameters cross compatibility showed that the parameters were obviously optimal on the cp for the subregion for which they were optimized fig 5 top however the losses in crpss when exchanging the parameters were not of the same magnitude among the different subregions indeed the upper rhone valley 7 and moreover the southeast ridges 8 seemed to behave differently these two regions have different climatic properties than the others as they are particularly sensitive to southerly flows indeed almost all heavy precipitation events occurred under a southerly regime such as in the liguria piedmont and aosta regions in italy whereas the other subregions of the catchment had extreme events mainly under a westerly regime horton et al 2012 thus as the performance score is significantly influenced by heavy precipitation values the parameters for the different subregions are likely optimized to better predict these days it can then be expected that the optimal parameters differ between these two subregions and the others this points at the importance of considering leading meteorological influences during precipitation station clustering which are not always best represented by physical distance globally the same cross compatibility structure could be observed for the vp fig 5 bottom but in this case minor improvements were occasionally observed when switching the parameters because of the presence of other events in the vp that might be better predicted by a different parameter set the relatively small differences in scores between parameterizations indicated that even though the parameters might differ significantly the performance might not be drastically affected even a change in the pressure level did not mean a radical drop in the score value a different parametrization may lead to a distinct selection of analogue days and thus to an improvement of the prediction under certain weather conditions at the expense of others 4 optimization of the analogy with moisture information it is known that moisture variables as a second level of analogy do provide improvements to the method section 2 3 the moisture index which is a combination of the relative humidity and precipitable water has thus also to be optimized in order to do so a constraint on the optimizer had to be introduced to select the same temporal window hour of the day for both variables two methods were assessed one with two moisture predictors moisture index on two pressure levels or at two different hours named 4zo 2mio and one with four moisture predictors named 4zo 4mio when introducing two predictors for the moisture analogy the number of degrees of freedom increased to 42 and to 54 with four predictors however there was no substantial difference in the performance scores between both 4zo 2mio and 4zo 4mio methods which suggests that considering four moisture predictors is not necessary for this reason only the results of 4zo 2mio are presented the optimization was processed on both levels of analogy simultaneously this implies that the analogy of the atmospheric circulation could change because of the new moisture information 4 1 results for the 4zo 2mio method as previously the optimized parameters differed from one subregion to another but to an even greater extent the resulting spatial windows are displayed in fig 6 for 4zo 2mio along with the selected pressure levels for both the circulation and moisture analogy table 5 the crpss scores of the optimized 4zo 2mio method are provided in fig 7 and amounted on average to 40 cp and 40 3 vp compared to 35 2 cp and 36 2 vp for the reference method 2z 2mi on the moisture analogy optimized with the sequential procedure the parameters cross compatibilities are shown in fig 8 as for 4zo the 4zo 2mio method presented larger improvements in the prediction of heavy rainfall table 6 4 2 analysis when optimizing a method consisting of two levels of analogy the introduction of moisture variables in the second level has an influence on the parameter values of the first level this means that the two levels of analogy bring complementary information and are thus not independent this is first visible in the number n 1 of analogues to be selected on the first level and in the selection of the pressure levels for the circulation analogy a change in the optimal value of n 1 was already known and taken into account in the 2z 2mi method table 2 however a change in the optimal pressure levels for the circulation analogy is a new result that has never been highlighted before as for the sequential procedure the optimal value of n 1 increased when adding a second level of analogy fig 9 one can also see that the optimal number of analogues n 2 for the second level of analogy of 4zo 2mio was slightly inferior to n 1 from 4zo but very close there is a globally common tendency between the optimal number of analogues of both methods n 1 of the 4zo method and n 1 and n 2 of 4zo 2mio tend to be higher or lower together for a given subregion the optimal final number of analogues did not vary much 23 n 1 33 for 4zo and 21 n 2 28 for 4zo 2mio however the optimal number of the n 1 analogues of the first level of 4zo 2mio varied to a greater extent 48 n 1 84 in this latter method it may be problematic to consider a fixed and unique value for all regions as for the pressure levels z1000 which was previously systematically selected twice table 3 was here less often chosen once or even not at all for 4zo 2mio table 5 there was indeed a vertical shift in the previously selected z1000 for lower pressure levels that was even slightly stronger with four moisture predictors than with two not shown this change is likely due to the fact that when considering only the circulation analogy the method tried to consider information that can serve as a proxy for moisture assessment whereas it did not need it with the moisture index this can only be assessed by a global optimization technique that can work jointly on both levels of analogy the selected pressure levels for the analogy of the moisture index were strongly centered around 700hpa and 600hpa no other value was selected when considering two moisture predictors table 5 it was sometimes more efficient in terms of prediction performance to consider the moisture at 700hpa twice but at different hours rather than selecting another pressure level besides the optimizer never chose the same pressure level at the same hour for any variable even though it could do so the selected pressure levels for the moisture analogy differed from the reference method tables 2 and 5 last row the selection of temporal windows for atmospheric circulation was similar to the preceding optimization in order of increasing pressure 12h 24 30h 12h 30h but sometimes with some variability when it comes to the moisture analogy there was a clear tendency to select 12h and 24h the optimized spatial windows for the atmospheric circulation have also changed fig 6 the very large domains on the upper level of the first four subregions were not present anymore and more variability could be observed the selected points for the moisture analogy were always located near the catchment including at least one of the nearest points from the reanalysis dataset and the spatial windows were relatively small thus for this case study there is no need to look for distant moisture information and the search could be reduced to a smaller domain the crpss scores were improved by considering the moisture information fig 7 to be compared with fig 4 the optimized method also performed significantly better than the 2z 2mi reference method optimized by the sequential procedure when it comes to improvements for days with precipitation above the three thresholds p 1mm p 0 1 p10 and p 0 5 p10 the conclusion is the same as before that is a significant improvement in the prediction compared to the reference method mainly for heavy rainfall the analysis of the parameters cross compatibility fig 8 was also very similar to the one of the circulation analogy only the same pattern could be observed with a drop of performance for the subregions characterized by different meteorological influences however the losses in performance were globally more important than before suggesting that more complex methods with moisture variables are less transposable to another subregion consistent with the observations of chardon et al 2014 even though both were located within the same grid cell of the reanalysis dataset moisture fields have greater variability than pressure fields and thus a change in the spatial windows can have a greater impact on the method performance indeed the two regions with the lowest cross compatibility with the others were the upper rhone valley 7 and the southeast ridges 8 which had similar optimal pressure levels and temporal windows to other regions but had rather different spatial windows for the moisture predictor predictors based on moisture variables do significantly increase the prediction skill and are thus recommended as long as they are reliable in real time forecasting their reliability depends on the lead time for lead times superior to 3 4days the uncertainties related to moisture variables from nwp models become fairly high which reduces the relevance of methods relying on this information in climate downscaling studies it mainly depends on the coherence of the climatologies between the archive and the gcm model outputs one should however not establish an am with moisture variables for too large a region as the transferability is reduced see chardon et al 2014 for alternative approaches 5 discussion the optimization of the am by means of gas has been undertaken in successive stages by releasing progressively new degrees of freedom this approach allowed us to differentiate the contributions to performance gains as well as to identify possible over parametrization the main improvements obtained in the present case study are due to the following elements using four pressure levels for the circulation analogy seemed to be an optimal number for the studied region length of archive available and target predictand considered beyond four the validation score was more variable revealing a loss in robustness due to over parametrization the automatic and joint optimization of all parameters the number of analogues selection of pressure levels temporal and spatial windows these parameters are highly interdependent so one needs to optimize them jointly to identify optimal combinations indeed there is a strong interdependence between space and time in the atmospheric circulation so that e g the spatial window should move upstream the main atmospheric flow for earlier temporal windows the introduction of distinct spatial windows between pressure levels the synoptic circulation is characterized by features with very different scales depending on the height and important information for predicting precipitation is not necessarily located in the same area from one level to another the weighting of the analogy criteria between different pressure levels this can be influenced by the variability of the geopotential height with altitude or the levels of significance in regard to the meteorological processes specific to a region there is a trend in the weighting of circulation predictors to decrease with the increase in pressure as one can see in fig 10 for the three optimized methods however the values remained approximately equal this may not be the most influencing factor and we may suggest removing it first when trying to reduce the degrees of freedom the joint optimization of the circulation and moisture analogy levels which are usually calibrated successively we could demonstrate that there is a dependency between the analogy levels and that in order to find the optimal parameters one must consider them jointly gas have proved very useful to optimize complex variants of the am and to assess new degrees of freedom that were not available so far however it can be dangerous to add too many parameters to optimize indeed the optimizer will probably use them to successfully improve the calibration score so the validation control remains very important to determine if one is actually improving the method or if it is being over parametrized moreover it might not always be desirable to increase the degrees of freedom and some constraints e g same weighting of the analogy criteria between different pressure levels can be justified however one should first assess the consequence of a constraint before establishing it in this sense even though not all degrees of freedom are useful gas allow us to assess their influence finally gas could be used to identify among other things the best pairs of spatial and temporal windows in order to later create a simpler regional method the convergence of parallel optimizations decreased when the am to optimize became more and more complex the optimizer did not always converge to the exact global optimum but to its surroundings this is related to the fact that the optimization slows down when it gets closer to the global optimum and that one must stop it before the end because of the required processing time see for example the slow down of the improvements over generations in fig 11 the resulting parameters might sometimes present non negligible differences even though the score is similar through monte carlo analyses of the parameter space properties of the am horton 2012 showed that some parameters of the method have a wide range of acceptable values the spatial windows for example can be larger than the optimal size without much impact on the score while they cannot be smaller see also bontron 2004 we also observed that the selection of pressure levels is not a parameter as discrete as we would have thought as sometimes choosing another level had reduced impact on the performance this is particularly true for levels at higher altitude but can be more critical for lower layers it was thus interesting to sometimes obtain several sets of near optimal parameters but with some nuances to get an idea of the sensitivity of the parameters for a given region and to compare the score for the vp in this regard a cross validation technique may be advisable however as solutions identified in different regions of the parameter space might provide sufficiently good performance an ensemble of these could be used instead of a unique solution these could account for the parameters uncertainty in the am and could also increase the sample size contributing to the empirical distribution of precipitation values an approach that can also be recommended is to first explore a wide range of the parameter space with some optimizations and to narrow it according to the results for more targeted optimizations that are likely to go faster and to perform better we tried to optimize the length of the preselection period i e the seasonal stratification which is a 4 month window jointly with the other parameters but no improvement was observed optimizing the moisture flux which is composed of the moisture index multiplied by the wind flux was also assessed however the results were not better than when considering the moisture index alone this may be related to the fact that the optimizer tries to provide the best analogy of the atmospheric circulation in the first place which makes the wind information less relevant in the second level of analogy methods with higher complexity that integrate moisture predictors are less transposable than simpler ones it was also noticed in another unpublished work that it is by far better to optimize for two subregions jointly than to optimize on one and to apply its parametrization to the other finally the discretization in subregions is an important process and should be handled with care indeed the physical distance is not always the leading factor to define a subregion for example the southeast ridges subregion does not behave like its surroundings and differs in its parametrization because of different leading meteorological influences gas are relatively heavy on processing and require an it infrastructure capable of performing thousands of hours of calculations here a single optimization over 100 generations took almost 300h cpu on a small intel xeon based high performance computing cluster with xeon 5670 2 97ghz 12 cores running linux redhat however they automatically optimize all parameters of the am which is not possible with the sequential calibration therefore much human time previously required to successively assess numerous combinations of parameters particularly the selection of pressure levels and temporal windows is saved the ability to jointly optimize all parameters is important given the strong dependencies between them and between the levels of analogy furthermore ams optimized with gas showed an improvement in predictions for days with heavier precipitation including extremes even though no new extreme value was added to the existing precipitation archive the distribution of analogue precipitation values for a target situation can move towards the targeted extreme by sampling better candidate situations then the subset of precipitation values collected on the analogue dates can be considered as a sample of the conditional distribution of precipitation associated with this situation a truncated exponential or a gamma distribution model can be fitted and extrapolated to extreme values not contained in the sample or even in the whole precipitation archive obled et al 2002 another possible approach is to combine ams with other methods e g chardon et al 2014 6 conclusions and perspectives ams are usually calibrated by a semi automatic sequential procedure that has strong limitations i it cannot automatically choose the pressure levels and temporal windows for a given meteorological variable ii it cannot handle dependencies between parameters and iii it cannot easily handle new degrees of freedom here a global optimization approach relying on genetic algorithms could optimize all parameters jointly and automatically it allowed objective selection of some parameters that were manually assessed beforehand the parameters resulting from the optimization by gas were very consistent in terms of the selection of pressure levels and temporal and spatial windows there was a good coherence and even identical results for subregions under similar meteorological influences which confirm that the optimized parameters were coherent despite an eventual first impression of great variability in the spatial windows when adding moisture variables the results showed a higher variability but remained highly acceptable and coherent strong dependencies between the parameters of the am were observed thus the sequential calibration which optimizes the parameters successively may not lead to the optimal combination moreover it contains several manual systematic assessments such as the selection of pressure levels and temporal windows gas however can automatically select pressure levels and temporal windows which can save a considerable amount of human time a great advantage of a global optimization is its ability to approach or reach optimal parameter values when they are considered jointly a dependence in the selected parameters between the circulation analogy and moisture variables was identified when the two analogy levels are considered together the optimal parameters of the circulation analogy changed this complexity can only be exploited in a suitable manner by global optimization methods for the present case study there seemed to be an optimum number of pressure levels to consider for the circulation analogy which was four before losing consistency of the real gains the circulation analogy was improved by introducing a weighting between pressure levels and considering independent spatial windows between pressure levels gas provided parameterizations of ams that exceeded the performance of the sequential calibration in addition it has been observed that the prediction for days with strong precipitation were improved to a greater extent which is clearly interesting in a hydrological context this work is by no means exhaustive and is meant to open a door to new explorations of ams with gas or another global optimization technique it is even possible to let the optimizer chose the meteorological variable to be used as a predictor as well as the analogy criteria which is the topic of work in progress moreover the am has been explored for decades for precipitation prediction but not as intensively for other predictands a global optimizer such

7614,understanding the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall has always been a great challenge and the impacts of climate change further complicate this issue the present study employs the concepts of complex networks to study the spatial connections in rainfall with emphasis on climate change and rainfall scaling rainfall outputs during 1961 1990 from a regional climate model i e weather research and forecasting wrf model that downscaled the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 40 reanalyses over southeast asia are studied and data corresponding to eight different temporal scales 6 hr 12 hr daily 2 day 4 day weekly biweekly and monthly are analyzed two network based methods are applied to examine the connections in rainfall clustering coefficient a measure of the network s local density and degree distribution a measure of the network s spread the influence of rainfall correlation threshold t on spatial connections is also investigated by considering seven different threshold levels ranging from 0 5 to 0 8 the results indicate that 1 rainfall networks corresponding to much coarser temporal scales exhibit properties similar to that of small world networks regardless of the threshold 2 rainfall networks corresponding to much finer temporal scales may be classified as either small world networks or scale free networks depending upon the threshold and 3 rainfall spatial connections exhibit a transition phase at intermediate temporal scales especially at high thresholds these results suggest that the most appropriate model for studying spatial connections may often be different at different temporal scales and that a combination of small world and scale free network models might be more appropriate for rainfall upscaling downscaling across all scales in the strict sense of scale invariance the results also suggest that spatial connections in the studied rainfall networks in southeast asia are weak especially when more stringent conditions are imposed i e when t is very high except at the monthly scale keywords rainfall scaling regional climate models complex networks clustering coefficient degree distribution 1 introduction the rainfall process exhibits considerable amount of spatial and temporal variability due to prevailing climatic conditions rainfall generating mechanisms and topographic properties among others as a result rainfall modeling is in general a challenging task with the past present and future impacts of global climate change on rainfall including in the form of significant changes in frequency magnitude and intensity rainfall modeling will likely become far more challenging in the future see for example dai et al 1997 zhang et al 2007 trenberth 2011 and donat et al 2016 for some details there exist numerous approaches for studying the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall including those based on correlation trend linearity vs nonlinearity stationarity vs nonstationarity determinism vs stochasticity scaling or fractal dimensionality entropy and many other properties e g eagleson 1967 waymire and gupta 1981 berndtsson 1988 krstanovic and singh 1992 onof and wheater 1993 salas et al 1995 carsteanu and foufoula georgiou 1996 deidda 2000 sivakumar et al 2001 molnar and burlando 2005 langousis and veneziano 2007 bárdossy and pegram 2009 li et al 2013 niu 2013 liew et al 2014 poornima and jothiprakash 2015 although such approaches and their applications have significantly enhanced our understanding of rainfall variability there is still a long way to go in our quest to achieve reliable outcomes in rainfall modeling what is also clear is that new approaches including those that can supplement and complement the existing ones are clearly needed to this end new developments in some other scientific fields can as they often do provide useful avenues one such field is the field of complex systems science especially considering that hydroclimatic systems are inherently complex systems with many components that are highly interconnected and governed by nonlinear interactions feedbacks self organization scale thresholds emergence and sensitive dependence on initial conditions among other properties among the new developments in the field of complex systems science developments in network theory and complex networks in particular e g watts and strogatz 1998 barabási and albert 1999 girvan and newman 2002 milo et al 2002 have been found to be very useful for studying the spatial and temporal evolution of a wide range of complex systems and associated phenomena see for example watts 1999 barabási 2002 and estrada 2012 for comprehensive accounts as the concepts of complex networks have obvious relevance in hydrology and water resources their applications in this field have been gaining attention in recent years e g rinaldo et al 2006 zaliapin et al 2010 suweis et al 2011 malik et al 2012 scarsoglio et al 2013 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 fang et al 2017 including for studying connections in rainfall streamflow river networks and virtual water trade networks see sivakumar 2015 for a general account in the specific context of rainfall a few recent studies have applied the concepts of complex networks for instance malik et al 2012 applied several complex networks based methods degree centrality degree distribution clustering coefficient and closeness centrality to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme summer monsoonal rainfall over south asia they analyzed daily gridded rainfall data over the period 1951 2007 from the asian rainfall highly resolved observational data integration towards the evaluation of water resources aphrodite project yatagai et al 2009 boers et al 2013 applied networks based concepts to investigate the spatial characteristics of extreme rainfall synchronicity of the south american monsoon system sams by analyzing gridded daily rainfall data 1999 2012 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 v7 satellite product see also boers et al 2014 2015 for subsequent complex networks based studies on south american rainfall scarsoglio et al 2013 applied several complex networks based methods degree centrality clustering coefficient degree distribution and shortest path length to examine the spatial dynamics of annual precipitation around the globe they analyzed a 70 year long january 1941 december 2010 gridded precipitation data from the global precipitation climatology center gpcc database sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 employed the concepts of clustering coefficient and degree distribution to examine the spatial connections in rainfall in australia by analyzing monthly rainfall observed over a period of 68years 1940 2007 at 230 raingage stations across australia they also studied the influence of rainfall correlation threshold on the outcomes of clustering coefficient and degree distribution methods jha et al 2015 attempted to offer hydrologic explanation for the outcomes of the complex networks based methods for rainfall they applied the clustering coefficient method to two different raingage networks in australia 57 stations from western australia and 45 stations from the sydney region and interpreted the results in terms of topographic properties of raingage stations latitude longitude and elevation and characteristics of rainfall data mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation with the encouraging outcomes reported by these studies on the suitability and usefulness of complex networks for rainfall analysis the present study attempts to advance research in this direction further specifically the study focuses on two aspects 1 investigation of spatial connections in rainfall data from a regional climate model in the context of climate change and 2 examination of the effects of temporal scale on rainfall connections in the context of scaling or scale invariance rainfall outputs over the period 1961 1990 a period that is generally used as the current climate in the context of climate change from the weather research and forecasting wrf model that downscaled the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 40 reanalyses data over southeast asia are studied see uppala et al 2005 for details of the era 40 reanalyses datasets for examination of the influence of temporal scale on connections rainfall data corresponding to eight different scales are considered 6 hr 12 hr 24 hr daily 48 hr 2 day 96 hr 4 day 168 hr weekly 336 hr biweekly and 720 hr monthly 30days while the primary criterion in the selection of these different scales is to represent successively doubled resolutions to facilitate interpretations linking scale and connections some coarser scales are also chosen to coincide with weekly biweekly and monthly scales in view of practical considerations in terms of water planning and management two complex networks based methods are employed to study the connections in these rainfall data clustering coefficient a measure of the network s local density and degree distribution a measure of the network s spread the influence of rainfall correlation thresholds on the connections is also studied the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 explains the concept of a network and the procedure for calculation of clustering coefficient and degree distribution section 3 presents details of the study area and rainfall data considered analysis results and discussion are reported in section 4 followed by conclusions in section 5 2 networks clustering coefficient and degree distribution 2 1 network a network or a graph is a set of points connected together by a set of lines as shown in fig 1 the points are called nodes or vertices and the lines are called links or edges mathematically a network can be represented as g p e where p is a set of n nodes p 1 p 2 pn and e is a set of n links networks can have many different forms such as networks 1 with identical nodes and links 2 with more than one different type of node and or link 3 with different weights for different nodes and links 4 with links that can be directed either cyclic or acyclic 5 with multilinks self links or hyperlinks and 6 that are bipartite some additional details on these can be found in sivakumar 2015 there exist a large number of measures to study the properties of complex networks see newman 2010 and estrada 2012 for details the measures include centrality clustering adjacency distance community structure bipartivity fragments or subgraphs communicability and global invariants among others while these different measures identify quantify different properties of networks they also often provide cross verification of results for some measures there are also different definitions sub measures and corresponding methods for example clustering coefficient is used as an indicator of clustering properties and degree distribution is used as an indicator of adjacency properties these two are described below as they are employed in the present study for studying the connections in rainfall data 2 2 clustering coefficient one of the most fundamental properties of networks is their tendency to cluster the concept of clustering has its origin in sociology under the name fraction of transitive triples e g wasserman and faust 1994 however in the context of complex networks watts and strogatz 1998 were the first to use the clustering concept the tendency of a network to cluster is quantified by the clustering coefficient there exist several definitions of clustering coefficient see watts and strogatz 1998 barrat and weigt 2000 and newman 2001 for details however the clustering coefficient method proposed by watts and strogatz 1998 which measures the local density is very widely used a brief description of its calculation is presented here see sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 for an example let us consider a node i in a network and that it has ki links identified based on some criterion such as correlation which connect it to ki other nodes as shown in fig 2 left this is what is normally done in most of the traditional similarity based approaches such as those based on distance or correlation or other measures to identify the existence of connections between nodes e g rainfall stations the clustering coefficient method involves another step in this first the initial connections are identified by determining similar nodes based on some property as is done in traditional approaches fig 2 a and then the actual connections are identified by looking into the connections among those similar nodes that is if the neighbors of the original node i were part of a cluster there would be ki ki 1 2 links between them as shown in fig 2 right with this the clustering coefficient of node i is the ratio between the number ei of links that actually exist between these ki nodes solid lines and the total number ki ki 1 2 all lines given by 1 c i 2 e i k i k i 1 this way the strength of connections in the network is identified in a much better way which allows studying the system as a whole rather than through its parts e g just one to one connection between nodes the procedure is then repeated for each node of the network the clustering coefficient of the whole network c is then given by the average of the clustering coefficients of all the individual nodes the clustering coefficient of the individual nodes and of the entire network can be used to obtain important information about the type of network grouping or classification of nodes and identification of dominant nodes e g super nodes among others for instance a very high clustering coefficient close to 1 0 indicates a regular network while a very low clustering coefficient close to zero with c p where p is the probability that every pair of nodes is connected equally indicates a classical random network see erdös and rényi 1959 1960 the clustering coefficient of for example a small world network e g watts and strogatz 1998 and a scale free network e g barabási and albert 1999 is generally smaller than that of the regular network but also larger than that of a comparable classical random network i e having the same number of nodes and links the clustering coefficient value can also be used to make a further distinction between small world networks and scale free networks in general small world networks have relatively much higher clustering coefficients than those of scale free networks however there are exceptions to such an interpretation since for example some scale free networks can have high clustering coefficients it is important to note that both the small world networks and the scale free networks are also random networks however they have different forms and properties when compared to the classifical random networks see albert and barabási 2002 for details the small world networks start with a fixed number of nodes like classifical random networks are stable with significantly high clustering coefficient unlike classical random networks and are efficient like classifical random networks the scale free networks unlike classical random networks start with a few nodes and grow by the continuous addition of new nodes exhibit preferential attachment and display power law degree distribution i e a few nodes with high degree and a large proportion of nodes with relatively low degree see section 2 3 for further details on degree distribution 2 3 degree distribution in a network several structural properties are related to adjacency relationships between nodes there are different ways to measure the adjacency relations including node adjacency degree distribution degree degree correlation and link adjacency among these the degree distribution is a particularly useful measure e g barabási and albert 1999 especially for the identification of the type of network and is widely used in network studies in a network different nodes may have different number of links the number of links k of a node is called as node degree the spread in the node degrees is characterized by a distribution function p k which expresses the fraction of nodes in a network with degree k this distribution is called degree distribution and is often a reliable indicator of the type of network for instance in a purely random graph since the links are placed randomly the majority of nodes have approximately the same degree and close to the average degree k of the network therefore the degree distribution of a completely random graph is a poisson distribution given by 2 p k e k k k k however scale free networks are characterized by a few nodes of high degree and a large proportion of nodes with relatively low degree barabási and albert 1999 although such networks can display a wide range of fat tail degree distributions the easiest way of conceptualizing such characteristics is to consider power law degree distribution given by 3 p k k γ where γ is the degree exponent in other words a model in which the probability of finding a node with degree k decreases as a power law of its degree similarly depending upon the properties of networks degree distribution can be for example gaussian exponential or other or even a combination of any of the above among these distributions the power law or scale free distribution has attracted considerable attention in the literature on complex networks as such has been found in a large number of natural and social networks e g barabási and albert 1999 kim et al 2004 keller 2005 clauset et al 2010 the fractal or scale free nature of numerous natural and social systems and their ability also to self organize themselves already well documented in the literature e g mandelbrot 1983 bak 1996 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 barnsley 2012 certainly give credence and motivation to further advance research on scale free networks the scale free nature of networks has particular relevance in the present study both for the scale free nature of rainfall e g lovejoy and mandelbrot 1985 gupta and waymire 1993 carsteanu and foufoula georgiou 1996 puente and obregon 1996 deidda 2000 sivakumar et al 2001 veneziano et al 2006 langousis and veneziano 2007 özger et al 2010 langousis et al 2013 and for the analysis of rainfall network corresponding to different temporal scales studied herein to examine connections at such scales 3 study area and data in the present study connections in rainfall dynamics in southeast asia are investigated using the concepts of complex networks the study region considered herein spans between 79 58 58 e to 132 1 2 e longitude and 19 26 54 s to 26 48 16 n latitude see fig 3 this region covers almost all of southeast asia some parts of south asia and china and territories a very small part of northern western australia as well as parts of the indian ocean that lie within this region the climate over much of this region is mainly tropical being generally hot and humid throughout the year with significant amounts of rainfall some parts of the region however have a sub tropical climate with cold winter with some snow seasonal shifts in winds or monsoon cause wet and dry seasons over a majority of this region the tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season the rain forest in this region is the oldest and the second largest in the world next only in size to that of the amazon an exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern parts where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape the rainfall data considered in this study are obtained from a 30km 30km climate simulations of a regional climate model weather research and forecasting wrf downscaling of the global era 40 reanalyses datasets uppala et al 2005 see also http www ecmwf int research era the era 40 reanalyses developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf uk provide information about a suite of climate variables including rainfall humidity temperature and pressure at every 6 hr at a horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 for rainfall the era 40 reanalyses data are made available for the period 1957 2002 in the present study the wrf model downscaled rainfall data for the period 1961 1990 over southeast asia are investigated for spatial connections using clustering coefficient and degree distribution methods the data are first extracted from the above mentioned regional climate model simulations the extraction of the time series is done through bilinear interpolation see liew et al 2014 for additional details for each grid 30km 30km there are approximately 43 800 values of 6 hr data i e 30years 365days 4 values per day some other studies that have used this data for rainfall analyses over southeast asia are liew et al 2014 vu et al 2014 and raghavan et al 2015 to assess the influence of temporal scale on rainfall connections data corresponding to different scales are analyzed to this end in addition to the original 6 hr data seven other coarser scales are also considered 12 hr 24 hr daily 48 hr 2 day 96 hr 4 day 168 hr weekly 336 hr biweekly and 720 hr monthly 30days all these scales are chosen in such a way that they 1 are useful to link the temporal scale of rainfall data and spatial connections particularly in terms of scale invariance and 2 have practical relevance in terms of short term emergency measures e g floods as well as medium to long term management strategies e g water supply 4 analysis results and discussion the clustering coefficient and the degree distribution methods are applied to rainfall data over southeast asia for each of the eight different temporal scales for each temporal scale each grid serves as a node in the network with each node consisting of a time series of rainfall at that particular scale the existence non existence of links in the network is identified using the pearson correlation coefficient of rainfall between the different nodes for instance if the pearson correlation coefficient between two nodes exceeds an assumed threshold t then there is a link between the two nodes otherwise the link does not exist it is important to note that the outcomes of the clustering coefficient and degree distribution methods can be significantly influenced by the correlation threshold t used for identification of neighbors i e links see sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 2015 and jha et al 2015 for additional details in view of this different threshold values are considered to assess their influence and interpret the results keeping in mind the range of temporal scales considered i e 6 hr to monthly and the possible extent of variability in spatial correlations on one hand and the computational time required to implement the methods on the other seven different threshold values are considered 0 5 0 55 0 6 0 65 0 7 0 75 and 0 8 therefore with eight temporal scales and seven correlation thresholds there is a total of 56 rainfall networks to analyze 4 1 clustering coefficient fig 3 a g presents for example the clustering coefficient cc values obtained for the rainfall network when the 2 day temporal scale is considered for the seven different thresholds respectively as normally expected for any given node i e grid and consequently for the whole network the clustering coefficient generally decreases with an increase in the threshold when the threshold is low say t 0 55 fig 3 a and b most of the grids have high clustering coefficient values say cc 0 60 see the green 1 for interpretation of color in figs 3 and 4 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 color for much of the study region when the threshold is high say t 0 75 fig 3 f and g most of the grids have low clustering coefficient values say cc 0 40 see the red and also the white colors including very low and even zero cc values over a significant part of the study region especially in the middle at intermediate thresholds most of the grids have intermediate clustering coefficient values see a combination of green and red colors over much of the region the clustering coefficient value for the entire network at the 2 day scale is 0 598 0 590 0 579 0 563 0 537 0 494 and 0 418 for t 0 50 0 55 0 60 0 65 0 70 0 75 and 0 80 respectively fig 4 a h presents for example the clustering coefficient results for the rainfall network corresponding to the eight temporal scales respectively when the threshold level is 0 6 for any given node and consequently for the whole network the clustering coefficient generally increases with an increase in the temporal scale at very fine temporal scales say 6 hr and 12 hr scales fig 4 a and b most of the grids have low clustering coefficient values say cc 0 40 and this is particularly the case in the middle of the study region at very coarse temporal scales say biweekly and monthly scales fig 4 g and h most of the grids have high clustering coefficient values say cc 0 60 at intermediate temporal scales daily to weekly scales fig 4 c f most of the grids have intermediate clustering coefficient values considering the entire networks corresponding to the eight temporal scales the clustering coefficient value consistently increases from 0 376 at the 6 hr scale to 0 629 at the monthly scale table 1 and fig 5 summarize the clustering coefficient results obtained for the 56 rainfall networks i e eight temporal scales and seven thresholds the results generally indicate a negative relationship between clustering coefficient and threshold level and a positive relationship between clustering coefficient and temporal scale that is for any given temporal scale the clustering coefficient decreases with an increase in the threshold fig 5 a for any given threshold the clustering coefficient increases with an increase in the temporal scale fig 5 b these general observations are along expected lines however the clustering coefficient results also reveal some specific observations as to the nature and extent of connections in rainfall with respect to temporal scale and threshold as the results in table 1 indicate the clustering coefficient values range anywhere from as low as 0 163 for 6 hr scale at t 0 75 to as high as 0 635 for monthly scale at t 0 5 considering the eight temporal scales and seven correlation thresholds considering a clustering coefficient value 0 50 as a reasonably medium to high value the cc values obtained for the different networks and especially their differences between the different networks have some important implications such as 1 none of the 56 rainfall networks is a purely i e classical random network since the clustering coefficient should be close to 0 0 for a purely random graph or a regular network since the clustering coefficient should be close to 1 0 for a fully connected network the networks are of some other type such as small world or scale free or other see section 2 2 when the threshold level is low say t 0 55 all the networks except one 6 hr scale at t 0 55 have medium to high clustering coefficients cc 0 45 regardless of the temporal scale and may be classified as small world networks when the threshold level is high say t 0 70 there are significant differences in clustering coefficients between networks corresponding to different temporal scales networks that correspond to coarser temporal scales say scale 4 day have medium to high clustering coefficients and may be classified as small world networks while networks that correspond to finer temporal scales say scale 4 day have low clustering coefficients and may be classified as scale free networks or some other 3 all networks that correspond to coarser temporal scales say scale 4 day with medium to high clustering coefficients seem to belong to the small world network type regardless of the threshold level however networks that correspond to finer scales say scale 12 hr exhibit very different clustering coefficients depending upon the threshold such networks may be classified as small world networks when the threshold is low and scale free networks or other when the threshold is high networks that correspond to intermediate temporal scales say daily and 2 day scales and intermediate thresholds say t 0 6 and 0 65 seem to belong to small world networks as well these observations seem to suggest that the spatial connections in rainfall are different at different temporal scales in terms of the strength of connections in the rainfall network reflected by the clustering coefficient there are clear differences between very coarse scales say scale 4 day and especially weekly and very fine scales say scale 12 hr including in the nature of the network that is small world network in the former and scale free network in the latter the differences are particularly evident at very high threshold levels say t 0 70 the clustering coefficient results also suggest a transition phase in the strength of spatial connections corresponding to intermediate temporal scales i e at daily and 2 day scales this transition is again particularly evident at very high threshold levels t 0 70 and to a certain extent at medium threshold levels t 0 6 and 0 65 all these results have important implications for scaling based studies in rainfall including in the identification of appropriate scales and models for upscaling downscaling of rainfall for instance rainfall upscaling downscaling may be more effective within very coarse scales say scale 4 day and especially weekly and within very fine scales say scale 12 hr but not between or across them since a noticeable transition seems to occur between these scales this is particularly the case when high accuracy in upscaling downscaling is expected or needed including for flood forecasting as clearly reflected by the noticeable differences in the strength of spatial connections i e clustering coefficients between very coarse scales and very fine scales at very high threshold levels as the results also suggest the appropriate model for studying spatial connections at different scales may also be different for instance models based on scale free concepts seem to be more appropriate for very fine temporal scales while models based on small world concepts seem to be more appropriate for very coarse temporal scales therefore perhaps a combination of small world and scale free models might be more appropriate for the transition phase of temporal scales and for rainfall upscaling downscaling across all scales whether in time or space or space time in the strict sense of scale invariance to illustrate further the strength of spatial connections in rainfall in the study region fig 6 presents the percentage of grids that have very high clustering coefficient values i e cc 0 85 as normally expected the percentage of grids decreases with an increase in the threshold value fig 6 a and increases with an increase in the temporal scale fig 6 b however the actual values reveal some interesting observations regardless of the temporal scale and threshold value only less than 3 5 of the grids have cc 0 85 see fig 6 a indeed the number of grids with cc 0 85 exceeds 2 only for the coarsest scale monthly for all the other seven temporal scales i e daily to biweekly the number of grids with cc 0 85 is less than 2 and is even less than 1 in most cases in terms of the threshold the number of grids with cc 0 85 is less than 2 even for thresholds down to as low as 0 5 except for the monthly scale fig 6 b these observations suggest that the spatial connections in all the studied rainfall networks are weak perhaps with the exception of the monthly scale 4 2 degree distribution fig 7 a n presents the degree distribution results for rainfall networks at the eight different temporal scales in each plot left to right in increasing order of magnitude for the seven different thresholds top to bottom plots in increasing order of magnitude the values are the complementary cumulative degree distribution values defined as the fraction of nodes with degree at least k and denoted as p k k the plots show the results in the normal scale left side plots and log log scale right side plots the degree distribution results reveal the following 1 for any given threshold the degree distribution exhibits a general trend rainfall networks corresponding to very coarse temporal scales say scale weekly exhibit a distribution that is more similar to exponential and perhaps small world networks rainfall networks corresponding to very fine temporal scales say scale 12 hr exhibit a distribution that is more similar to power law and perhaps scale free networks rainfall networks corresponding to intermediate temporal scales exhibit a distribution that is somewhat of a combination of exponential perhaps small world and power law perhaps scale free distributions 2 the exponential distribution for rainfall networks at very coarse temporal scales is more evident at low thresholds say t 0 55 fig 7 a to d when the threshold is high say t 0 75 fig 7 k n the exponential distribution perhaps small world network is not that evident and the distribution seems to approach a power law behavior perhaps scale free network 3 for very fine temporal scales say scale 12 hr while the distribution of the rainfall networks seems to be similar and power law behavior perhaps scale free network for any threshold the power law distribution is more evident at high thresholds say t 0 75 fig 7 k n when compared to that at low thresholds say t 0 55 fig 7 a d at low thresholds the distribution seems to deviate from power law behavior perhaps scale free network towards exponential behavior perhaps small world network these observations seem to suggest that a power law distribution perhaps scale free network is more fitting for very fine temporal scales and an exponential distribution perhaps small world network is more fitting for very coarse temporal scales while their combination is more fitting for intermediate temporal scales these observations are consistent with those made using the clustering coefficients in that the rainfall spatial connections at very coarse temporal scales exhibit one type of behavior small world and those at very fine temporal scales exhibit another type of behavior scale free while connections at the intermediate temporal scales exhibit a combination of exponential and perhaps small world and power law and perhaps scale free behaviors and thus a transient phase further none of the 56 rainfall networks 56 combinations of temporal scale and threshold level exhibit a degree distribution that is similar to poisson or gaussian suggesting that the networks are not classical random networks the results presented in fig 7 also indicate that even considering the lowest threshold level i e t 0 50 even the most connected grid is connected with only less than 19 of the network size when far more stringent conditions in connections are imposed say t 0 80 even the most connected grid is connected with only less than 2 of the network size these results again suggest that the spatial connections in the rainfall networks are generally weak and thus support the results from the clustering coefficient method in other words any of the grids in the rainfall network including the grid that has the most connection has only very little influence on the network as a whole despite the fact that power law distribution is observed for rainfall networks at finer temporal scales these observations have implications for rainfall studies including in the context of upscaling downscaling and interpolation extrapolation of rainfall 5 conclusions the present study has applied the concepts of complex networks to study the connections in rainfall outputs from a regional climate model application of the clustering coefficient and degree distribution methods to rainfall in southeast asia during the period 1961 1990 current climate and at different temporal scales ranging from 6 hr to monthly has provided some interesting results about the connections in rainfall the results indicate that the properties of spatial connections in rainfall are different at different temporal scales and also influenced by the correlation threshold t the connections at much coarser temporal scales scale weekly exhibit properties similar to that of small world networks regardless of the threshold at much finer temporal scales scale 12 hr the threshold plays an important role with spatial connections exhibiting properties of either small world networks for low thresholds or scale free networks at high thresholds the connections at intermediate scales exhibit a transition phase especially at high thresholds overall the spatial connections in rainfall in southeast asia are weak especially when more stringent conditions are imposed i e when t is very high except at the monthly scale the present results have important implications for studies on rainfall variability rainfall scaling and related aspects first the different network properties at different temporal scales imply that the appropriate model for studying spatial connections may be different at different temporal scales second the transition phase in spatial connections at intermediate temporal scales implies breaking points or critical points in rainfall behavior third combination of small world and scale free network models seems more appropriate for rainfall modeling across all scales in the strict sense of scale invariance the implications of the present results can be particularly realized in the context of climate change since climate change is anticipated to significantly change the frequency magnitude and intensity of rainfall and hence the properties of spatial connections across different temporal scales the present study leads to several future directions of research 1 application of complex networks concepts to rainfall data obtained from ground measurements to examine the consistency of results with those obtained in the present study with rcm rainfall outputs 2 study of future rainfall projections from climate models to check whether the present results on network properties would still hold for future conditions and 3 development of a rainfall model that can represent both small world network properties and scale free network properties of spatial connections at different temporal scales i e space time network model research in these directions are currently underway and the details will be reported elsewhere finally one of the eventual purposes in studying spatial connections in rainfall at one or more temporal scales is to estimate rainfall data at ungagged locations using interpolation or extrapolation methods although the present study provides some interesting results about spatial connections in rainfall at different temporal scales and helps identify suitable complex networks based models it does not actually develop any new model developing a complex networks based model whether in space or in time or in space time for rainfall networks and its proper use for rainfall interpolation will be important future steps in research in this direction comparison of the performance of such a complex networks based model with that of existing methods for rainfall interpolation e g nearest neighbors and their variants splines kriging would be a necessary and appropriate endeavor to assess the superiority of such a model if any this however is beyond the scope of the present study we

7614,understanding the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall has always been a great challenge and the impacts of climate change further complicate this issue the present study employs the concepts of complex networks to study the spatial connections in rainfall with emphasis on climate change and rainfall scaling rainfall outputs during 1961 1990 from a regional climate model i e weather research and forecasting wrf model that downscaled the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 40 reanalyses over southeast asia are studied and data corresponding to eight different temporal scales 6 hr 12 hr daily 2 day 4 day weekly biweekly and monthly are analyzed two network based methods are applied to examine the connections in rainfall clustering coefficient a measure of the network s local density and degree distribution a measure of the network s spread the influence of rainfall correlation threshold t on spatial connections is also investigated by considering seven different threshold levels ranging from 0 5 to 0 8 the results indicate that 1 rainfall networks corresponding to much coarser temporal scales exhibit properties similar to that of small world networks regardless of the threshold 2 rainfall networks corresponding to much finer temporal scales may be classified as either small world networks or scale free networks depending upon the threshold and 3 rainfall spatial connections exhibit a transition phase at intermediate temporal scales especially at high thresholds these results suggest that the most appropriate model for studying spatial connections may often be different at different temporal scales and that a combination of small world and scale free network models might be more appropriate for rainfall upscaling downscaling across all scales in the strict sense of scale invariance the results also suggest that spatial connections in the studied rainfall networks in southeast asia are weak especially when more stringent conditions are imposed i e when t is very high except at the monthly scale keywords rainfall scaling regional climate models complex networks clustering coefficient degree distribution 1 introduction the rainfall process exhibits considerable amount of spatial and temporal variability due to prevailing climatic conditions rainfall generating mechanisms and topographic properties among others as a result rainfall modeling is in general a challenging task with the past present and future impacts of global climate change on rainfall including in the form of significant changes in frequency magnitude and intensity rainfall modeling will likely become far more challenging in the future see for example dai et al 1997 zhang et al 2007 trenberth 2011 and donat et al 2016 for some details there exist numerous approaches for studying the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall including those based on correlation trend linearity vs nonlinearity stationarity vs nonstationarity determinism vs stochasticity scaling or fractal dimensionality entropy and many other properties e g eagleson 1967 waymire and gupta 1981 berndtsson 1988 krstanovic and singh 1992 onof and wheater 1993 salas et al 1995 carsteanu and foufoula georgiou 1996 deidda 2000 sivakumar et al 2001 molnar and burlando 2005 langousis and veneziano 2007 bárdossy and pegram 2009 li et al 2013 niu 2013 liew et al 2014 poornima and jothiprakash 2015 although such approaches and their applications have significantly enhanced our understanding of rainfall variability there is still a long way to go in our quest to achieve reliable outcomes in rainfall modeling what is also clear is that new approaches including those that can supplement and complement the existing ones are clearly needed to this end new developments in some other scientific fields can as they often do provide useful avenues one such field is the field of complex systems science especially considering that hydroclimatic systems are inherently complex systems with many components that are highly interconnected and governed by nonlinear interactions feedbacks self organization scale thresholds emergence and sensitive dependence on initial conditions among other properties among the new developments in the field of complex systems science developments in network theory and complex networks in particular e g watts and strogatz 1998 barabási and albert 1999 girvan and newman 2002 milo et al 2002 have been found to be very useful for studying the spatial and temporal evolution of a wide range of complex systems and associated phenomena see for example watts 1999 barabási 2002 and estrada 2012 for comprehensive accounts as the concepts of complex networks have obvious relevance in hydrology and water resources their applications in this field have been gaining attention in recent years e g rinaldo et al 2006 zaliapin et al 2010 suweis et al 2011 malik et al 2012 scarsoglio et al 2013 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 braga et al 2016 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 fang et al 2017 including for studying connections in rainfall streamflow river networks and virtual water trade networks see sivakumar 2015 for a general account in the specific context of rainfall a few recent studies have applied the concepts of complex networks for instance malik et al 2012 applied several complex networks based methods degree centrality degree distribution clustering coefficient and closeness centrality to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme summer monsoonal rainfall over south asia they analyzed daily gridded rainfall data over the period 1951 2007 from the asian rainfall highly resolved observational data integration towards the evaluation of water resources aphrodite project yatagai et al 2009 boers et al 2013 applied networks based concepts to investigate the spatial characteristics of extreme rainfall synchronicity of the south american monsoon system sams by analyzing gridded daily rainfall data 1999 2012 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 v7 satellite product see also boers et al 2014 2015 for subsequent complex networks based studies on south american rainfall scarsoglio et al 2013 applied several complex networks based methods degree centrality clustering coefficient degree distribution and shortest path length to examine the spatial dynamics of annual precipitation around the globe they analyzed a 70 year long january 1941 december 2010 gridded precipitation data from the global precipitation climatology center gpcc database sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 employed the concepts of clustering coefficient and degree distribution to examine the spatial connections in rainfall in australia by analyzing monthly rainfall observed over a period of 68years 1940 2007 at 230 raingage stations across australia they also studied the influence of rainfall correlation threshold on the outcomes of clustering coefficient and degree distribution methods jha et al 2015 attempted to offer hydrologic explanation for the outcomes of the complex networks based methods for rainfall they applied the clustering coefficient method to two different raingage networks in australia 57 stations from western australia and 45 stations from the sydney region and interpreted the results in terms of topographic properties of raingage stations latitude longitude and elevation and characteristics of rainfall data mean standard deviation and coefficient of variation with the encouraging outcomes reported by these studies on the suitability and usefulness of complex networks for rainfall analysis the present study attempts to advance research in this direction further specifically the study focuses on two aspects 1 investigation of spatial connections in rainfall data from a regional climate model in the context of climate change and 2 examination of the effects of temporal scale on rainfall connections in the context of scaling or scale invariance rainfall outputs over the period 1961 1990 a period that is generally used as the current climate in the context of climate change from the weather research and forecasting wrf model that downscaled the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era 40 reanalyses data over southeast asia are studied see uppala et al 2005 for details of the era 40 reanalyses datasets for examination of the influence of temporal scale on connections rainfall data corresponding to eight different scales are considered 6 hr 12 hr 24 hr daily 48 hr 2 day 96 hr 4 day 168 hr weekly 336 hr biweekly and 720 hr monthly 30days while the primary criterion in the selection of these different scales is to represent successively doubled resolutions to facilitate interpretations linking scale and connections some coarser scales are also chosen to coincide with weekly biweekly and monthly scales in view of practical considerations in terms of water planning and management two complex networks based methods are employed to study the connections in these rainfall data clustering coefficient a measure of the network s local density and degree distribution a measure of the network s spread the influence of rainfall correlation thresholds on the connections is also studied the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 explains the concept of a network and the procedure for calculation of clustering coefficient and degree distribution section 3 presents details of the study area and rainfall data considered analysis results and discussion are reported in section 4 followed by conclusions in section 5 2 networks clustering coefficient and degree distribution 2 1 network a network or a graph is a set of points connected together by a set of lines as shown in fig 1 the points are called nodes or vertices and the lines are called links or edges mathematically a network can be represented as g p e where p is a set of n nodes p 1 p 2 pn and e is a set of n links networks can have many different forms such as networks 1 with identical nodes and links 2 with more than one different type of node and or link 3 with different weights for different nodes and links 4 with links that can be directed either cyclic or acyclic 5 with multilinks self links or hyperlinks and 6 that are bipartite some additional details on these can be found in sivakumar 2015 there exist a large number of measures to study the properties of complex networks see newman 2010 and estrada 2012 for details the measures include centrality clustering adjacency distance community structure bipartivity fragments or subgraphs communicability and global invariants among others while these different measures identify quantify different properties of networks they also often provide cross verification of results for some measures there are also different definitions sub measures and corresponding methods for example clustering coefficient is used as an indicator of clustering properties and degree distribution is used as an indicator of adjacency properties these two are described below as they are employed in the present study for studying the connections in rainfall data 2 2 clustering coefficient one of the most fundamental properties of networks is their tendency to cluster the concept of clustering has its origin in sociology under the name fraction of transitive triples e g wasserman and faust 1994 however in the context of complex networks watts and strogatz 1998 were the first to use the clustering concept the tendency of a network to cluster is quantified by the clustering coefficient there exist several definitions of clustering coefficient see watts and strogatz 1998 barrat and weigt 2000 and newman 2001 for details however the clustering coefficient method proposed by watts and strogatz 1998 which measures the local density is very widely used a brief description of its calculation is presented here see sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 for an example let us consider a node i in a network and that it has ki links identified based on some criterion such as correlation which connect it to ki other nodes as shown in fig 2 left this is what is normally done in most of the traditional similarity based approaches such as those based on distance or correlation or other measures to identify the existence of connections between nodes e g rainfall stations the clustering coefficient method involves another step in this first the initial connections are identified by determining similar nodes based on some property as is done in traditional approaches fig 2 a and then the actual connections are identified by looking into the connections among those similar nodes that is if the neighbors of the original node i were part of a cluster there would be ki ki 1 2 links between them as shown in fig 2 right with this the clustering coefficient of node i is the ratio between the number ei of links that actually exist between these ki nodes solid lines and the total number ki ki 1 2 all lines given by 1 c i 2 e i k i k i 1 this way the strength of connections in the network is identified in a much better way which allows studying the system as a whole rather than through its parts e g just one to one connection between nodes the procedure is then repeated for each node of the network the clustering coefficient of the whole network c is then given by the average of the clustering coefficients of all the individual nodes the clustering coefficient of the individual nodes and of the entire network can be used to obtain important information about the type of network grouping or classification of nodes and identification of dominant nodes e g super nodes among others for instance a very high clustering coefficient close to 1 0 indicates a regular network while a very low clustering coefficient close to zero with c p where p is the probability that every pair of nodes is connected equally indicates a classical random network see erdös and rényi 1959 1960 the clustering coefficient of for example a small world network e g watts and strogatz 1998 and a scale free network e g barabási and albert 1999 is generally smaller than that of the regular network but also larger than that of a comparable classical random network i e having the same number of nodes and links the clustering coefficient value can also be used to make a further distinction between small world networks and scale free networks in general small world networks have relatively much higher clustering coefficients than those of scale free networks however there are exceptions to such an interpretation since for example some scale free networks can have high clustering coefficients it is important to note that both the small world networks and the scale free networks are also random networks however they have different forms and properties when compared to the classifical random networks see albert and barabási 2002 for details the small world networks start with a fixed number of nodes like classifical random networks are stable with significantly high clustering coefficient unlike classical random networks and are efficient like classifical random networks the scale free networks unlike classical random networks start with a few nodes and grow by the continuous addition of new nodes exhibit preferential attachment and display power law degree distribution i e a few nodes with high degree and a large proportion of nodes with relatively low degree see section 2 3 for further details on degree distribution 2 3 degree distribution in a network several structural properties are related to adjacency relationships between nodes there are different ways to measure the adjacency relations including node adjacency degree distribution degree degree correlation and link adjacency among these the degree distribution is a particularly useful measure e g barabási and albert 1999 especially for the identification of the type of network and is widely used in network studies in a network different nodes may have different number of links the number of links k of a node is called as node degree the spread in the node degrees is characterized by a distribution function p k which expresses the fraction of nodes in a network with degree k this distribution is called degree distribution and is often a reliable indicator of the type of network for instance in a purely random graph since the links are placed randomly the majority of nodes have approximately the same degree and close to the average degree k of the network therefore the degree distribution of a completely random graph is a poisson distribution given by 2 p k e k k k k however scale free networks are characterized by a few nodes of high degree and a large proportion of nodes with relatively low degree barabási and albert 1999 although such networks can display a wide range of fat tail degree distributions the easiest way of conceptualizing such characteristics is to consider power law degree distribution given by 3 p k k γ where γ is the degree exponent in other words a model in which the probability of finding a node with degree k decreases as a power law of its degree similarly depending upon the properties of networks degree distribution can be for example gaussian exponential or other or even a combination of any of the above among these distributions the power law or scale free distribution has attracted considerable attention in the literature on complex networks as such has been found in a large number of natural and social networks e g barabási and albert 1999 kim et al 2004 keller 2005 clauset et al 2010 the fractal or scale free nature of numerous natural and social systems and their ability also to self organize themselves already well documented in the literature e g mandelbrot 1983 bak 1996 rodriguez iturbe and rinaldo 1997 barnsley 2012 certainly give credence and motivation to further advance research on scale free networks the scale free nature of networks has particular relevance in the present study both for the scale free nature of rainfall e g lovejoy and mandelbrot 1985 gupta and waymire 1993 carsteanu and foufoula georgiou 1996 puente and obregon 1996 deidda 2000 sivakumar et al 2001 veneziano et al 2006 langousis and veneziano 2007 özger et al 2010 langousis et al 2013 and for the analysis of rainfall network corresponding to different temporal scales studied herein to examine connections at such scales 3 study area and data in the present study connections in rainfall dynamics in southeast asia are investigated using the concepts of complex networks the study region considered herein spans between 79 58 58 e to 132 1 2 e longitude and 19 26 54 s to 26 48 16 n latitude see fig 3 this region covers almost all of southeast asia some parts of south asia and china and territories a very small part of northern western australia as well as parts of the indian ocean that lie within this region the climate over much of this region is mainly tropical being generally hot and humid throughout the year with significant amounts of rainfall some parts of the region however have a sub tropical climate with cold winter with some snow seasonal shifts in winds or monsoon cause wet and dry seasons over a majority of this region the tropical rain belt causes additional rainfall during the monsoon season the rain forest in this region is the oldest and the second largest in the world next only in size to that of the amazon an exception to this type of climate and vegetation is the mountain areas in the northern parts where high altitudes lead to milder temperatures and drier landscape the rainfall data considered in this study are obtained from a 30km 30km climate simulations of a regional climate model weather research and forecasting wrf downscaling of the global era 40 reanalyses datasets uppala et al 2005 see also http www ecmwf int research era the era 40 reanalyses developed by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf uk provide information about a suite of climate variables including rainfall humidity temperature and pressure at every 6 hr at a horizontal resolution of 2 5 2 5 for rainfall the era 40 reanalyses data are made available for the period 1957 2002 in the present study the wrf model downscaled rainfall data for the period 1961 1990 over southeast asia are investigated for spatial connections using clustering coefficient and degree distribution methods the data are first extracted from the above mentioned regional climate model simulations the extraction of the time series is done through bilinear interpolation see liew et al 2014 for additional details for each grid 30km 30km there are approximately 43 800 values of 6 hr data i e 30years 365days 4 values per day some other studies that have used this data for rainfall analyses over southeast asia are liew et al 2014 vu et al 2014 and raghavan et al 2015 to assess the influence of temporal scale on rainfall connections data corresponding to different scales are analyzed to this end in addition to the original 6 hr data seven other coarser scales are also considered 12 hr 24 hr daily 48 hr 2 day 96 hr 4 day 168 hr weekly 336 hr biweekly and 720 hr monthly 30days all these scales are chosen in such a way that they 1 are useful to link the temporal scale of rainfall data and spatial connections particularly in terms of scale invariance and 2 have practical relevance in terms of short term emergency measures e g floods as well as medium to long term management strategies e g water supply 4 analysis results and discussion the clustering coefficient and the degree distribution methods are applied to rainfall data over southeast asia for each of the eight different temporal scales for each temporal scale each grid serves as a node in the network with each node consisting of a time series of rainfall at that particular scale the existence non existence of links in the network is identified using the pearson correlation coefficient of rainfall between the different nodes for instance if the pearson correlation coefficient between two nodes exceeds an assumed threshold t then there is a link between the two nodes otherwise the link does not exist it is important to note that the outcomes of the clustering coefficient and degree distribution methods can be significantly influenced by the correlation threshold t used for identification of neighbors i e links see sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 2015 and jha et al 2015 for additional details in view of this different threshold values are considered to assess their influence and interpret the results keeping in mind the range of temporal scales considered i e 6 hr to monthly and the possible extent of variability in spatial correlations on one hand and the computational time required to implement the methods on the other seven different threshold values are considered 0 5 0 55 0 6 0 65 0 7 0 75 and 0 8 therefore with eight temporal scales and seven correlation thresholds there is a total of 56 rainfall networks to analyze 4 1 clustering coefficient fig 3 a g presents for example the clustering coefficient cc values obtained for the rainfall network when the 2 day temporal scale is considered for the seven different thresholds respectively as normally expected for any given node i e grid and consequently for the whole network the clustering coefficient generally decreases with an increase in the threshold when the threshold is low say t 0 55 fig 3 a and b most of the grids have high clustering coefficient values say cc 0 60 see the green 1 for interpretation of color in figs 3 and 4 the reader is referred to the web version of this article 1 color for much of the study region when the threshold is high say t 0 75 fig 3 f and g most of the grids have low clustering coefficient values say cc 0 40 see the red and also the white colors including very low and even zero cc values over a significant part of the study region especially in the middle at intermediate thresholds most of the grids have intermediate clustering coefficient values see a combination of green and red colors over much of the region the clustering coefficient value for the entire network at the 2 day scale is 0 598 0 590 0 579 0 563 0 537 0 494 and 0 418 for t 0 50 0 55 0 60 0 65 0 70 0 75 and 0 80 respectively fig 4 a h presents for example the clustering coefficient results for the rainfall network corresponding to the eight temporal scales respectively when the threshold level is 0 6 for any given node and consequently for the whole network the clustering coefficient generally increases with an increase in the temporal scale at very fine temporal scales say 6 hr and 12 hr scales fig 4 a and b most of the grids have low clustering coefficient values say cc 0 40 and this is particularly the case in the middle of the study region at very coarse temporal scales say biweekly and monthly scales fig 4 g and h most of the grids have high clustering coefficient values say cc 0 60 at intermediate temporal scales daily to weekly scales fig 4 c f most of the grids have intermediate clustering coefficient values considering the entire networks corresponding to the eight temporal scales the clustering coefficient value consistently increases from 0 376 at the 6 hr scale to 0 629 at the monthly scale table 1 and fig 5 summarize the clustering coefficient results obtained for the 56 rainfall networks i e eight temporal scales and seven thresholds the results generally indicate a negative relationship between clustering coefficient and threshold level and a positive relationship between clustering coefficient and temporal scale that is for any given temporal scale the clustering coefficient decreases with an increase in the threshold fig 5 a for any given threshold the clustering coefficient increases with an increase in the temporal scale fig 5 b these general observations are along expected lines however the clustering coefficient results also reveal some specific observations as to the nature and extent of connections in rainfall with respect to temporal scale and threshold as the results in table 1 indicate the clustering coefficient values range anywhere from as low as 0 163 for 6 hr scale at t 0 75 to as high as 0 635 for monthly scale at t 0 5 considering the eight temporal scales and seven correlation thresholds considering a clustering coefficient value 0 50 as a reasonably medium to high value the cc values obtained for the different networks and especially their differences between the different networks have some important implications such as 1 none of the 56 rainfall networks is a purely i e classical random network since the clustering coefficient should be close to 0 0 for a purely random graph or a regular network since the clustering coefficient should be close to 1 0 for a fully connected network the networks are of some other type such as small world or scale free or other see section 2 2 when the threshold level is low say t 0 55 all the networks except one 6 hr scale at t 0 55 have medium to high clustering coefficients cc 0 45 regardless of the temporal scale and may be classified as small world networks when the threshold level is high say t 0 70 there are significant differences in clustering coefficients between networks corresponding to different temporal scales networks that correspond to coarser temporal scales say scale 4 day have medium to high clustering coefficients and may be classified as small world networks while networks that correspond to finer temporal scales say scale 4 day have low clustering coefficients and may be classified as scale free networks or some other 3 all networks that correspond to coarser temporal scales say scale 4 day with medium to high clustering coefficients seem to belong to the small world network type regardless of the threshold level however networks that correspond to finer scales say scale 12 hr exhibit very different clustering coefficients depending upon the threshold such networks may be classified as small world networks when the threshold is low and scale free networks or other when the threshold is high networks that correspond to intermediate temporal scales say daily and 2 day scales and intermediate thresholds say t 0 6 and 0 65 seem to belong to small world networks as well these observations seem to suggest that the spatial connections in rainfall are different at different temporal scales in terms of the strength of connections in the rainfall network reflected by the clustering coefficient there are clear differences between very coarse scales say scale 4 day and especially weekly and very fine scales say scale 12 hr including in the nature of the network that is small world network in the former and scale free network in the latter the differences are particularly evident at very high threshold levels say t 0 70 the clustering coefficient results also suggest a transition phase in the strength of spatial connections corresponding to intermediate temporal scales i e at daily and 2 day scales this transition is again particularly evident at very high threshold levels t 0 70 and to a certain extent at medium threshold levels t 0 6 and 0 65 all these results have important implications for scaling based studies in rainfall including in the identification of appropriate scales and models for upscaling downscaling of rainfall for instance rainfall upscaling downscaling may be more effective within very coarse scales say scale 4 day and especially weekly and within very fine scales say scale 12 hr but not between or across them since a noticeable transition seems to occur between these scales this is particularly the case when high accuracy in upscaling downscaling is expected or needed including for flood forecasting as clearly reflected by the noticeable differences in the strength of spatial connections i e clustering coefficients between very coarse scales and very fine scales at very high threshold levels as the results also suggest the appropriate model for studying spatial connections at different scales may also be different for instance models based on scale free concepts seem to be more appropriate for very fine temporal scales while models based on small world concepts seem to be more appropriate for very coarse temporal scales therefore perhaps a combination of small world and scale free models might be more appropriate for the transition phase of temporal scales and for rainfall upscaling downscaling across all scales whether in time or space or space time in the strict sense of scale invariance to illustrate further the strength of spatial connections in rainfall in the study region fig 6 presents the percentage of grids that have very high clustering coefficient values i e cc 0 85 as normally expected the percentage of grids decreases with an increase in the threshold value fig 6 a and increases with an increase in the temporal scale fig 6 b however the actual values reveal some interesting observations regardless of the temporal scale and threshold value only less than 3 5 of the grids have cc 0 85 see fig 6 a indeed the number of grids with cc 0 85 exceeds 2 only for the coarsest scale monthly for all the other seven temporal scales i e daily to biweekly the number of grids with cc 0 85 is less than 2 and is even less than 1 in most cases in terms of the threshold the number of grids with cc 0 85 is less than 2 even for thresholds down to as low as 0 5 except for the monthly scale fig 6 b these observations suggest that the spatial connections in all the studied rainfall networks are weak perhaps with the exception of the monthly scale 4 2 degree distribution fig 7 a n presents the degree distribution results for rainfall networks at the eight different temporal scales in each plot left to right in increasing order of magnitude for the seven different thresholds top to bottom plots in increasing order of magnitude the values are the complementary cumulative degree distribution values defined as the fraction of nodes with degree at least k and denoted as p k k the plots show the results in the normal scale left side plots and log log scale right side plots the degree distribution results reveal the following 1 for any given threshold the degree distribution exhibits a general trend rainfall networks corresponding to very coarse temporal scales say scale weekly exhibit a distribution that is more similar to exponential and perhaps small world networks rainfall networks corresponding to very fine temporal scales say scale 12 hr exhibit a distribution that is more similar to power law and perhaps scale free networks rainfall networks corresponding to intermediate temporal scales exhibit a distribution that is somewhat of a combination of exponential perhaps small world and power law perhaps scale free distributions 2 the exponential distribution for rainfall networks at very coarse temporal scales is more evident at low thresholds say t 0 55 fig 7 a to d when the threshold is high say t 0 75 fig 7 k n the exponential distribution perhaps small world network is not that evident and the distribution seems to approach a power law behavior perhaps scale free network 3 for very fine temporal scales say scale 12 hr while the distribution of the rainfall networks seems to be similar and power law behavior perhaps scale free network for any threshold the power law distribution is more evident at high thresholds say t 0 75 fig 7 k n when compared to that at low thresholds say t 0 55 fig 7 a d at low thresholds the distribution seems to deviate from power law behavior perhaps scale free network towards exponential behavior perhaps small world network these observations seem to suggest that a power law distribution perhaps scale free network is more fitting for very fine temporal scales and an exponential distribution perhaps small world network is more fitting for very coarse temporal scales while their combination is more fitting for intermediate temporal scales these observations are consistent with those made using the clustering coefficients in that the rainfall spatial connections at very coarse temporal scales exhibit one type of behavior small world and those at very fine temporal scales exhibit another type of behavior scale free while connections at the intermediate temporal scales exhibit a combination of exponential and perhaps small world and power law and perhaps scale free behaviors and thus a transient phase further none of the 56 rainfall networks 56 combinations of temporal scale and threshold level exhibit a degree distribution that is similar to poisson or gaussian suggesting that the networks are not classical random networks the results presented in fig 7 also indicate that even considering the lowest threshold level i e t 0 50 even the most connected grid is connected with only less than 19 of the network size when far more stringent conditions in connections are imposed say t 0 80 even the most connected grid is connected with only less than 2 of the network size these results again suggest that the spatial connections in the rainfall networks are generally weak and thus support the results from the clustering coefficient method in other words any of the grids in the rainfall network including the grid that has the most connection has only very little influence on the network as a whole despite the fact that power law distribution is observed for rainfall networks at finer temporal scales these observations have implications for rainfall studies including in the context of upscaling downscaling and interpolation extrapolation of rainfall 5 conclusions the present study has applied the concepts of complex networks to study the connections in rainfall outputs from a regional climate model application of the clustering coefficient and degree distribution methods to rainfall in southeast asia during the period 1961 1990 current climate and at different temporal scales ranging from 6 hr to monthly has provided some interesting results about the connections in rainfall the results indicate that the properties of spatial connections in rainfall are different at different temporal scales and also influenced by the correlation threshold t the connections at much coarser temporal scales scale weekly exhibit properties similar to that of small world networks regardless of the threshold at much finer temporal scales scale 12 hr the threshold plays an important role with spatial connections exhibiting properties of either small world networks for low thresholds or scale free networks at high thresholds the connections at intermediate scales exhibit a transition phase especially at high thresholds overall the spatial connections in rainfall in southeast asia are weak especially when more stringent conditions are imposed i e when t is very high except at the monthly scale the present results have important implications for studies on rainfall variability rainfall scaling and related aspects first the different network properties at different temporal scales imply that the appropriate model for studying spatial connections may be different at different temporal scales second the transition phase in spatial connections at intermediate temporal scales implies breaking points or critical points in rainfall behavior third combination of small world and scale free network models seems more appropriate for rainfall modeling across all scales in the strict sense of scale invariance the implications of the present results can be particularly realized in the context of climate change since climate change is anticipated to significantly change the frequency magnitude and intensity of rainfall and hence the properties of spatial connections across different temporal scales the present study leads to several future directions of research 1 application of complex networks concepts to rainfall data obtained from ground measurements to examine the consistency of results with those obtained in the present study with rcm rainfall outputs 2 study of future rainfall projections from climate models to check whether the present results on network properties would still hold for future conditions and 3 development of a rainfall model that can represent both small world network properties and scale free network properties of spatial connections at different temporal scales i e space time network model research in these directions are currently underway and the details will be reported elsewhere finally one of the eventual purposes in studying spatial connections in rainfall at one or more temporal scales is to estimate rainfall data at ungagged locations using interpolation or extrapolation methods although the present study provides some interesting results about spatial connections in rainfall at different temporal scales and helps identify suitable complex networks based models it does not actually develop any new model developing a complex networks based model whether in space or in time or in space time for rainfall networks and its proper use for rainfall interpolation will be important future steps in research in this direction comparison of the performance of such a complex networks based model with that of existing methods for rainfall interpolation e g nearest neighbors and their variants splines kriging would be a necessary and appropriate endeavor to assess the superiority of such a model if any this however is beyond the scope of the present study we
