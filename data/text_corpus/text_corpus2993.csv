plankton that underpin the functions of these aquatic ecosystems are often impacted by human activities however understanding the biogeographical patterns of diversity and community structure of microeukaryotic plankton and the role that major shaping factors play at the continent scale is still a challenge in coastal ecology here the biogeographic patterns of biodiversity community structure and co occurrence patterns were investigated by environmental dna edna based approaches unlike most edna studies we combined several methods in silico pcr mock and environmental communities to systematically evaluate the specificity and coverage of primers to overcome the limitation of marker selection on biodiversity recovery the 1380f 1510r primer set showed the best performance for the amplification of coastal plankton with the highest coverage sensitivity and resolution we showed a unimodal pattern for planktonic alpha diversity with latitude p 0 001 and nutrient related factors

coastal regions which play an essential role in economic development are believed to be particularly vulnerable to human activity and are therefore the most impacted parts of all oceans assessment 2005 the ongoing increase in coastal surface water pollution has knock on effects on the entire marine ecosystem by altering other abiotic factors with rapid urbanization anthropogenic pressures such as marine pollution led by population density growth harm coastal ecosystems and result in the mass loss of biodiversity in these aquatic ecosystems al et al 2021 todd et al 2019 microeukaryotic plankton communities as the key components of the marine microbial food web play a dominant role in coastal ecosystems and their variation might change the aquatic ecosystem structure and function guidi et al 2016 simon et al 2015 thus they are usually regarded as reliable bioindicators for aquatic quality biomonitoring visco et al 2015 currently traditional methods such as morphological identification are still widely adopted to routinely monitor coastal planktonic communities but there have been doubts as to whether they offer sufficient information about planktonic diversity yang et al 2021 mainly due to the small body size of microeukaryotes and difficulty in identifying cryptic immature stages which require special advanced taxonomic expertise uusitalo et al 2013 zhan et al 2014 consequently there is a need for methods incorporating quick easy sampling and high sensitivity for the biomonitoring of microeukaryotic plankton in coastal ecosystems environment dna edna metabarcoding is a powerful molecular based approach for assessing plankton biodiversity which could overcome the main limitations mentioned above cordier et al 2021 but it also has its own limitations for instance the metabarcoding results strongly rely on the sensitivity and taxonomic coverage of different genetic markers li et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 thus selecting suitable primers is critical to accurately depict the entire biodiversity of the aquatic system alberdi et al 2017 to date there have been numerous 18s ribosomal dna based metabarcoding studies characterizing the planktonic communities in various aquatic ecosystems ibarbalz et al 2019 lambert et al 2019 lima mendez et al 2015 xue et al 2018 notably the taxonomic resolution and phylogenetic biases of different regions of the 18s rrna gene have been found to be distinct choi and park 2020 more recently edna metabarcoding laboratory protocols have seen significant improvement and many researchers have ignored screening the sensitivity accuracy and specificity of chosen markers before performing aquatic diversity or community assessment yang et al 2021 it is difficult to judge whether the primers utilized in these studies were appropriate for the habitat or effective in detecting the target organisms li et al 2019 hence before environmental experiments appropriate primers should be selected for the specific organisms and habitats to maximize the limit and accuracy of detection it has long been discussed as to whether the latitudinal diversity gradient ldg pattern of microeukaryotic plankton may assist in understanding underlying mechanistic processes in other organisms hillebrand 2004 tittensor et al 2010 understanding continental level diversity patterns and predictors might promote the analysis of stability in ecosystems and raise these analyses from the regional to global scale tittensor et al 2010 the distance decay relationship ddr as a well described pattern of community composition can reveal the spatial structure of biodiversity and is generally regulated by both deterministic and stochastic processes ning et al 2019 socolar et al 2016 wang et al 2017 except for spatial distance biogeochemical composition and biotic interactions are also considered to have decisive effects on community construction chesson 2000 groult et al 2022 for instance habitat heterogeneity could significantly shape the community composition and structure at the local scale zhao et al 2022 there is mounting evidence that correlation based networks are useful for extracting simple patterns to represent the mechanisms of species interaction deng et al 2012 feng et al 2022 co occurrence patterns are key in providing new insights into revealing the selection processes which governs microeukaryotic community assembly and detected the response of communities to environmental disturbance goberna and verd√∫ 2021 elucidating the drivers of how biological diversity varies with spatial and environmental gradients has been a central focus in biodiversity science zhou et al 2016 the disturbance of anthropogenic effects on coastal ecosystems is becoming more serious and a dominant pressure on planktonic community variation wu and liu 2018 zou et al 2021 land based pollution e g nutrients and heavy metals in coastal water could respond quickly and promptly to anthropogenic disturbance hassan 2006 yet even though coastal regions are the most vulnerable to stress from rivers and oceans few studies have investigated the influences of human activities on the biodiversity and composition of microeukaryotic plankton in these areas furthermore while it is accepted that everything is everywhere but the environment selects distinguishing the relative contribution of each environmental driver in controlling community structure and how those driving factors vary across space is a major goal in coastal ecology martiny et al 2006 thompson et al 2017 in this study we used an edna metabarcoding method based on 18s rrna genes to explore the biogeographic pattern and interaction mechanism of the microeukaryotic community we selected the most suitable primers by in silico evaluation of the coverage for five pairs of widely used primers and examined the accuracy and sensitivity of mock and environmental communities to identify the key drivers of the geographic patterns in microeukaryotic plankton communities along the coastline we carried out a large scale surface water survey in three coastal areas located in northeast middle and southern china along a latitudinal gradient ranging from 20 to 40 n fig s2 in the current study we attempted to address the following questions i what is the most suitable 18s primer pair for monitoring chinese coastal microeukaryotic plankton ii what are the geographic patterns of microeukaryotic plankton biodiversity and community in coastal ecosystems at the continental scale iii which environmental factors are the best predictors of geographic pattern variation 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of suitable edna primers for planktonic biodiversity monitoring targeting chinese coastal ecosystems a general workflow of primer evaluation includes three major parts fig 1 a we collected a chinese coastal plankton sequence database ccpd for in silico pcr primer evaluation first all marine planktonic phytoplankton and zooplankton sequences were downloaded from the pr2 database version 4 14 0 at the genus level and named pr2 marine planktonic database pr2 mp subsequently a list of chinese coastal planktonic species was compiled based on previous morphological studies zhang et al 2022b zhang et al 2022c and all taxonomic information was verified based on the world register of marine species worms https www marinespecies org database table s1 and s2 matching between the chinese coastal plankton species list and pr2 mp was used to generate the pr2 chinese coastal plankton database pr2 ccpd next the following search criteria were applied for obtaining the marine planktonic sequences from ncbi as marine or coastal or sea or ocean and chinese planktonic taxonomic information 18s finally the ccpd was constructed by combining the ncbi marine planktonic 18s sequences and pr2 ccpd sequence lengths in the ccpd were limited to 1000 2000 bp to increase the taxonomy identification accuracy and after deduplication resulted in 17 556 nonredundant genomic sequences being retained 9548 zooplanktonic and 8008 phytoplanktonic sequences fig 1b subsequent in silico evaluation of primers coverage and the mock and environmental communities to test the pcr primers are described in the supplemental materials 2 2 spatial patterns and predictors of microeukaryotic biodiversity and community edna study area and sampling edna sampling was conducted along the entire coastline of china fig s2 a total of sixty four surface water samples were collected from three separate regions yalujiang estuary ylj 39 62 39 91 n 123 74 124 22 e the east china sea ecs 28 03 38 00 n 120 27 123 80 e and beibu bay bb 20 33 21 54 n 108 29 109 64 e each water sample was divided into two subsamples one for edna extraction and diversity analyses and the other for analysis of environmental variables for diversity analysis the water was filtered through a 0 22 Œºm polycarbonate membrane all filters were then stored at 80 c until dna extraction ph salinity cod do nh4 n no3 n no2 n cd cr as zn cu and water temperature were measured according to the methods described in previous studies zhang et al 2022b the heavy metals in ecs were extracted using kriging interpolation by arcgis based on the previously reported environmental data zhang et al 2022b the edna was extracted from the filters using the dnseay powersoil pro kit qiagen gembh based on the manufacturer s protocol the hypervariable v9 region of microeukaryotic 18s rrna gene was amplified using the primers based on the marker selection the pcr system and thermocycler profile was same as mentioned above 2 3 bioinformatics processing the amplified products were mixed and quantified for sequencing using the illumina hiseq instrument with 2 250 bp at magigene biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china the raw data from sequencing were demultiplexed and barcodes and primer sequences were trimmed from the paired end sequences then merged by flash in the bioinformatic analysis platform http mem rcees ac cn 8080 feng et al 2017 in order to retain a larger portion of the high quality reads the length of reads 200 bp were further discarded then using unoise3 the reads were processed to generate amplicon sequence variants asvs using default 8 parameters li et al 2021 subsequently singletons were removed and the representative reads were annotated with the protist ribosomal reference database pr2 v4 10 to focus on the microeukaryotic plankton the asvs assigned to metazoa rhodophyta ulvophyceae streptophyta and unclassified were excluded adl et al 2019 finally the total dataset was randomly normalized to 37 838 sequences for per sample and the rarefaction analyses indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient for a diversity study 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed in the r environment r version 4 1 3 http www r project org environmental heterogeneity was calculated as the pairwise euclidean distance in all environmental variables among the three sampling regions and the significance was tested by the kruskal wallis test the alpha diversity indices of each sample including shannon phylogenetic distance pd and observed richness or were calculated using the vegan package dixon 2003 linear fit and generalized additive models gams were used to visualize the latitudinal trendline of microeukaryotic alpha diversity wood 2017 to visualize the environmental heterogeneity between sampling regions principal component analysis pca analysis was performed based on the euclidean distance of environmental variables anderson et al 2006 beta diversity of the microeukaryotic community was estimated based on bray curtis distances and the differences in the community composition across sampling regions were visualized by principal coordinates analysis pcoa paradis et al 2004 significance was tested by nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance permanova analysis of similarity anosim and multiple response permutation procedure mrpp using the vegan package to test for differences in beta diversity across regions the kruskal wallis test was used in r a series of generalized linear models glms were used to distinguish how regional variables influence the dynamics of planktonic alpha diversity and gage their relative importance dobson and barnett 2018 to determine the most optimal model we used the exhaustive search algorithm to evaluate the glms in the leaps r package random forest rf analyses were performed to identify the relative importance of predictors in the model that influenced the diversity randomforest r package liaw and wiener 2002 principal coordinates of the neighbor matrix vector pcnm vectors were used to interpret in terms of spatial scales based on the longitude and latitude coordinates of each sampling site borcard et al 2004 to avoid collinearity among regional variations and pcnm variance inflation factors vifs were calculated and factors with vif 10 were removed vegan r package redundancy analysis rda based on bray curtis distance was performed to assess the relationship between community composition and regional variables the hierarchical partitioning model was performed to quantify the relative importance of purely spatial and purely environmental components using the rdacca hp package lai et al 2022 mantel test was deployed to evaluate the impacts of regional variations and water traits on microeukaryotic diversity to explore biotic interactions regional molecular ecological networks mens were constructed for asvs which were present in more than 50 of samples in an individual region via the molecular ecological network analyses pipeline menap http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena main cgi deng et al 2012 deng et al 2016 the mens under different regions were constructed using random matrix theory and the correlation was calculated by spearman coefficient to compare the properties of the three regional networks uniform thresholds 0 86 were selected calculations global network properties and network randomization were also performed in the pipeline to reveal how regional variables affected network composition the correlation between module based eigengenes and environmental factors were calculated finally cytoscape 3 8 0 was used to visualize networks and perform modular analysis 3 results 3 1 mock and environmental community metabarcoding analyses overview of ccpd and in silico primers evaluation analysis are described in the supplemental materials for the mock communities a total 427 890 927 891 and 1 144 425 clean sequences were obtained for primer pairs ssuf04 ssur22 ssuf22 ssur09 and 1380f 1510r and the average numbers of reads per sample were 71 315 154 648 and 190 737 respectively the other two primer pairs 1391f eukbr and 1389f 1510r only obtained 58 and 42 total sequences respectively and could not cover any of the species in the mock communities indicating those primer sets were inappropriate for the following biodiversity analyses the results of length distribution for these five primer sets are shown in table s3 by using the full length 18s rrna gene from six planktonic species we found that 1380f 1510r exhibited the highest sensitivity in detecting all species fig 2 a primer pairs ssuf04 ssur22 and ssuf22 ssur09 would miss chloropicon primus strain ccmp1205 which represents the rare species in the ecosystem only 0 1 ng dna in the mock community fig 2b and 2c for staggered mock communities ssuf04 ssur22 and ssuf22 ssur09 did not detect the lowest dna concentration level 0 1 ng fig 2d indicating that the lack of detection was due to the amount of dna and not a mismatch with the primers additionally we found that the relative abundance of platymonas helgolandica tsingtaoensis was significantly underestimated by 1380f 1510r in the even community and amphidinium carterae hulburt was overvalued by those three primers sets in the staggered mock community fig 2a a total of six sediments and fifteen water samples were collected from two chinese coastal areas near the yalujiang estuary ylj and beibu bay bb about 69 53 of planktonic species detected by morphology in chinese coastal ecosystems could be verified by the edna approach and the number of covered species and asvs was highest using 1380f 1510r fig 2e these results indicated that the edna approach could recover most planktonic species and that 1380f 1510r might be the most appropriate primer pair for monitoring chinese coastal plankton in our research 3 2 the distribution of microeukaryotic plankton in chinese coastal waters thereafter we used this verified primer set to assess the distribution of microeukaryotic plankton across chinese coastal marine surface water samples fig s2 a series of environmental factors characterizing the chinese coastal environments are shown in fig s3 environmental parameters varied greatly between the three coastal regions with significant differences in environmental heterogeneity were observed fig 3 a and s3 by using edna metabarcoding sequencing with 2421 632 reads from 64 samples a total of 2177 unique amplicon sequence variants asvs were identified the alpha diversity of microeukaryotic plankton including the asvs richness shannon and phylogenetic diversity pd were measured we observed significant variations in alpha diversity indices with latitude that followed a unimodal pattern the plankton exhibited maximal diversity in the middle region ecs 28 38 n which then decreased to the north and south of the coastline fig 3b and fig s4 p 0 05 the results of a principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the bray curtis dissimilarity index revealed that planktonic communities primarily clustered into three regions with significant differences mrpp anosim and permanova tests p 0 001 fig 3c which was consistent with the environmental factors fig 3a we estimated the differences in planktonic beta diversity among regions and showed significantly lower dispersion for communities in the middle ecs region p 0 05 fig 3c furthermore the dissimilarity of the planktonic community showed a comparable correlations with geographic distances in each region and the slopes of the distance decay curve varied across the three regions fig 3d these results indicated that coastal marine plankton exhibited strong region specific patterns in order to determine the relative contribution of environmental variables to regional alpha diversity generalized linear models glms were used all planktonic alpha diversity indexes were best predicted by models containing inorganic nitrogen across all regions the best fitting model for most regional alpha diversities included heavy metals hms table s4 random forest analysis showed that not all environmental variables in the models contributed to the same degree to the species diversity fig 4 a for example inorganic nitrogen no3 n and nh4 n was the most important variable for predicting diversity in the bb and ylj while the important variables for predicting phylogenetic distance pd and observed richness or in the ecs were dissolved oxygen do and no3 n respectively additionally cu and cd were important variables for predicting diversity in bb and ylj these results indicated the importance of human activity factors nutrient and metal factors in regional planktonic diversity to test the explanation of environmental and geographic variables in shaping the regional planktonic community composition hierarchical partitioning analysis was performed fig 4b the results indicated that pure environmental factor was the prerequisite correlation with the variance planktonic communities in all three regions this finding was supported by redundancy analysis rda which showed hm factors cd as cu and cr were major environmental variables influencing the planktonic community structure in bb and ylj and nutrient related factors inorganic nitrogen explained a large portion of compositional variation in all regions p 0 001 fig 4c e only in ylj was geographic distance pcnm found to be a dominant variable for community assemblage meanwhile mantel test was conducted to demonstrate the association between environmental factors and planktonic diversity in all regions fig 5 the significance of environmental drivers shaping regional planktonic diversity and community variation varied greatly among the three regions the results also revealed that both nutrient related factors and hms significantly explained the variation in planktonic diversity and community composition in bb and ylj therefore the shifts in planktonic biodiversity and community structure along the chinese coastline were significantly related to regional environments especially nutrients and hms 3 3 spatial pattern of networks structure and the potential environmental drivers co occurrence networks were established to explore the strong association among planktonic organisms and their response to environmental variations fig 6 the networks exhibited significantly different modular structures among the different regions clearly divided into six nine and ten major modules which accounted for 86 76 bb 80 09 ecs and 78 10 ylj of the nodes within the networks respectively the topological properties of the networks were also divergent among regions the co occurrence networks of ylj and ecs were more complex than that of bb as reflected by the larger network size total number of nodes as well as higher network of links total number of links average degree avgk centralization of stress centrality cs and connectedness table 1 to further predict and quantify modules relevance to environmental changes module eigenvalue analysis was used to link the module members and environmental variables fig 6d f in the bb network all six major modules were significantly correlated with dissolved nitrogen and hms and only two modules m1 and m5 showed a significant association with water temperature p 0 05 the cd cr and no3 n were significantly correlated with most modules in the ecs network and some water traits temperature ph and salinity showed significant association with few modules similarly the strong correlations with modules in the ylj network were observed with nutrients and hms suggesting that regional nutrients and hms were the principal factors leading to changes in the regional planktonic association 4 discussion because microeukaryotic plankton in hydrologically complex coastal systems mediate a substantial fraction of global ocean biogeochemical fluxes they are expected to be bioindicators of climate and environmental changes worden et al 2015 although the geographic pattern of planktonic communities of freshwater and urban waterbodies are well documented chen et al 2019 mo et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 little is known about coastal ecosystems at continental scale especially for large estuarine areas affected by human activities to avoid biases in amplicon and species coverage resulting from primer selection we presented a systematic methodology to select the most appropriate metabarcoding primers to target specific taxa and regions before biodiversity monitoring based on edna by examining surface water samples from across a wide area of the chinese coastline our results showed that the microeukaryotic planktonic diversity community and co occurrence patterns exhibited significant latitudinal patterns the result demonstrated a latitudinal pattern likely due to the regional environmental heterogeneity and that human activity related factors e g nutrients and hms could strongly shape the planktonic communities monitoring microeukaryotic plankton biodiversity is essential in measuring anthropogenic influence on coastal waters and to help protect ecosystems fiser et al 2018 edna metabarcoding as a recent rapidly developing technology could overcome the limitations of conventional methods to rapidly and accurately identify microeukaryotic plankton deiner et al 2017 liu et al 2017 selecting the most powerful and efficient genetic marker and its corresponding primers largely determine how successful community detection is tang et al 2012 to address the first question in the article we chose to assess several primers that have been applied in various planktonic studies bik et al 2012 lima mendez et al 2015 zhao et al 2022 all primers had been designed based on specific research aims using some species known to be present in the target ecosystems as such previous widely used primers should be validated according to the scope of the specific biodiversity study deiner et al 2017 wang et al 2022 reliable reference databases are crucial for accurate edna based biodiversity monitoring and developing effective primers yang et al 2021 in this study we aimed to find an effective set of primers and therefore collected a comprehensive chinese coastal plankton sequence database ccpd for primer evaluation fig 1b the ccpd is designed for primer evaluation and only focused on the planktonic taxon so that could lose the function information for microeukaryotic plankton but it contains genes and sequences for most plankton observed by microscopy and before primer evaluation we de redundant and length limited all the sequences to improve the quality of the sequences in ccpd the multi criteria evaluation of primers including coverage and sensitivity was performed in silico and with mock and environmental communities li et al 2019 wang et al 2022 the results indicated the 1380f 1510r primer pair was more sensitive to rare species in the mock community and captured significantly higher species coverage than the other primer sets reviewed here therefore the 1380f 1510r performed better than other primer pairs based on the evaluation protocol and it might be the suitable gene primer pair for monitoring the coastal microeukaryotic plankton in this study the edna metabarcoding revealed that microeukaryotic diversity and communities exhibited distinct spatial patterns and that they might be attributed to environmental heterogeneity latitudinal diversity gradients ldgs are the most pervasive ecology and evolution pattern hillebrand 2004 all diversity indexes shannon or and pd peaked around the median latitude region 28 38 n similar to previously observed biogeographic patterns ibarbalz et al 2019 the physiological tolerance hypothesis points out that the ldg is mainly structured by temperature constraints on species distribution currie et al 2004 different spatial tendencies of temperature and diversity index were found fig s3 and s4 which might be due to the relatively small temperature variations of the temperate and subtropical regions which prevented temperature from acting as a constraining factor sampling sites were found to cluster into different regions based on the significant difference in environmental variables fig 3a and s3 suggesting distinct environmental heterogeneity among the three coastal regions therefore we inferred that the regional environment heterogeneity was the potential driver accounting for the planktonic diversity variation this inference is supported by a previous study which demonstrated that local environmental factors displayed a stronger influence in determining microbial diversity fiere and jackson 2006 the planktonic community distribution also exhibited regional specificity which was proven by the robust evidence for significantly dissimilarity patterns and distance decay trends between all three regional communities fig 3c and 3d covering different scale sampling regions microeukaryotic plankton exhibited similar spatial variation with significantly distinct turnover given the environmental and spatial heterogeneity in each coastal region the difference in community turnover rates might strongly relate to the variability of environmental settings and spatial structure among regions logares et al 2013 soininen et al 2007 wang et al 2017 we did observe that the environmental factors were more correlated with regional communities and could explain a larger amount of biogeographic variations of the communities than geographic distance within each region fig 4b e suggesting that the planktonic community was mainly governed by regional environment heterogeneity at the geographic continent scale molecular ecological networks are often used to infer the correlation between taxa and further evaluate the stability and complexity of the communities in various ecosystems barberan et al 2012 lima mendez et al 2015 nuccio et al 2016 the linkages between the co occurrence networks and biogeography could help us to figure out the potential process community assembly barberan et al 2012 a clear biogeographic pattern for the complexity of planktonic co occurrence networks was observed in the present study table 1 and fig 6 the more complicated networks were found in the middle and southern regions according to a series of topological parameters e g average degree average path distance and connectedness yuan et al 2021 according to a previous study the different complex networks of microeukaryotic plankton in the surface water could result in large part from regional heterogeneity shi et al 2016 mougi and kondoh mougi and kondoh 2012 reported that higher environmental heterogeneity create greater network complexity and connectivity therefore the spatial pattern of planktonic co occurrence network structure and complexity might be due to the bb being located in a relatively undeveloped region with lower environmental disturbance than the other two regions fig s3 dou et al 2013 altogether we believe that the heterogeneous environments strongly shaped the spatial variation for planktonic co occurrence networks between sampling regions characterizing the determining environmental factors is crucial for improving the monitoring and prediction of planktonic biodiversity and community composition and to reveal the potential impacts of human activities the coastal regions have been undergoing intense local human impacts by receiving inputs of excessive nutrients and hms lotze et al 2006 the bb as a typical economically developing area is located in the south of fujian province into which many rivers discharged dou et al 2013 and ylj has seen the development large scale aquaculture industry and is a typical shipping area guan et al 2020 the sampling sites located in the ecs included the changjiang river estuary an area with higher anthropogenic disturbance due to relatively advanced industrial activities and a dense human population chen 2008 the location level of economic development and environmental governance capabilities determined distinct environmental heterogeneity and degree of human activities the most intriguing aspect of our findings was the significant effect of human activity related factors on planktonic spatial patterns among the coastal regions among all abiotic factors inorganic nitrogen was observed to contribute the most towards explaining variation in planktonic diversity and community for all regions this result was supported by a previous study that reported nutrients could influence the community composition and turnover by providing sufficient resources for many regional costal species logue et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 furthermore we also observed that hms especially cd as cu and zn contributed a substantial amount to variations in planktonic community composition and co occurrence patterns this was consistent with a recent study in which it was shown that cu and zn were necessary for n utilizing enzymes and subsequently influenced phytoplanktonic growth and distribution morel et al 2020 cd as the catalytic metal center in carbonic anhydrase enzymes has a significant impact on the planktonic community jensen et al 2019 the nutrients inorganic nitrogen and hms closely associated with anthropogenic drivers and could enter coastal waters directly through effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants hale et al 2015 howard et al 2014 zhang et al 2022a nitrogen as the primary limiting macronutrient for phytoplankton has always been the focus of aquatic ecosystem studies and the impacts of human activities on nitrogen fluxes are substantial and accelerated crain et al 2009 galloway et al 2014 similarly hms in waters could be absorbed by marine organisms and transferred through marine food webs jiang et al 2018 hence our research demonstrated that anthropogenic impacts might strongly influence planktonic biodiversity community structure and co occurrence patterns in the chinese coastal ecosystems and offer better ecological services for coastal biodiversity monitoring and anthropogenic stress assessment 5 conclusion in summary through a detailed and systematic primer evaluation protocol we found the 1380f 1510r was the most suitable 18s primer pair for edna based monitoring of the chinese coastal microeukaryotic plankton community and found evidence of the effects of regional anthropogenic activities on coastal planktonic ecosystems we investigated the community geographic distribution and co occurrence patterns of microeukaryotic plankton along the coastline regional environmental heterogeneity played an important role in shaping latitudinal diversity patterns at the continent scale our results provided evidence that the local environmental conditions especially nutrients and heavy metals were the key driving factor in predicting diversity the planktonic communities exhibited distinct spatial turnover rates within each region and anthropogenic activity related factors were the major driver it was also shown that planktonic co occurrence network topological properties and complexity exhibited a significant spatial pattern and the structure showed distinct responses to environments impacted by regional human activity together our results demonstrated that the edna based approach was very helpful in systematically monitoring the biodiversity and provided new knowledge on explaining the drivers of planktonic communities spatial variation in human impacted environments

guidi et al 2016 simon et al 2015 thus they are usually regarded as reliable bioindicators for aquatic quality biomonitoring visco et al 2015 currently traditional methods such as morphological identification are still widely adopted to routinely monitor coastal planktonic communities but there have been doubts as to whether they offer sufficient information about planktonic diversity yang et al 2021 mainly due to the small body size of microeukaryotes and difficulty in identifying cryptic immature stages which require special advanced taxonomic expertise uusitalo et al 2013 zhan et al 2014 consequently there is a need for methods incorporating quick easy sampling and high sensitivity for the biomonitoring of microeukaryotic plankton in coastal ecosystems environment dna edna metabarcoding is a powerful molecular based approach for assessing plankton biodiversity which could overcome the main limitations mentioned above cordier et al 2021 but it also has its own limitations for instance the metabarcoding results strongly rely on the sensitivity and taxonomic coverage of different genetic markers li et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 thus selecting suitable primers is critical to accurately depict the entire biodiversity of the aquatic system alberdi et al 2017 to date there have been numerous 18s ribosomal dna based metabarcoding studies characterizing the planktonic communities in various aquatic ecosystems ibarbalz et al 2019 lambert et al 2019 lima mendez et al 2015 xue et al 2018 notably the taxonomic resolution and phylogenetic biases of different regions of the 18s rrna gene have been found to be distinct choi and park 2020 more recently edna metabarcoding laboratory protocols have seen significant improvement and many researchers have ignored screening the sensitivity accuracy and specificity of chosen markers before performing aquatic diversity or community assessment yang et al 2021 it is difficult to judge whether the primers utilized in these studies were appropriate for the habitat or effective in detecting the target organisms li et al 2019 hence before environmental experiments appropriate primers should be selected for the specific organisms and habitats to maximize the limit and accuracy of detection it has long been discussed as to whether the latitudinal diversity gradient ldg pattern of microeukaryotic plankton may assist in understanding underlying mechanistic processes in other organisms hillebrand 2004 tittensor et al 2010 understanding continental level diversity patterns and predictors might promote the analysis of stability in ecosystems and raise these analyses from the regional to global scale tittensor et al 2010 the distance decay relationship ddr as a well described pattern of community composition can reveal the spatial structure of biodiversity and is generally regulated by both deterministic and stochastic processes ning et al 2019 socolar et al 2016 wang et al 2017 except for spatial distance biogeochemical composition and biotic interactions are also considered to have decisive effects on community construction chesson 2000 groult et al 2022 for instance habitat heterogeneity could significantly shape the community composition and structure at the local scale zhao et al 2022 there is mounting evidence that correlation based networks are useful for extracting simple patterns to represent the mechanisms of species interaction deng et al 2012 feng et al 2022 co occurrence patterns are key in providing new insights into revealing the selection processes which governs microeukaryotic community assembly and detected the response of communities to environmental disturbance goberna and verd√∫ 2021 elucidating the drivers of how biological diversity varies with spatial and environmental gradients has been a central focus in biodiversity science zhou et al 2016 the disturbance of anthropogenic effects on coastal ecosystems is becoming more serious and a dominant pressure on planktonic community variation wu and liu 2018 zou et al 2021 land based pollution e g nutrients and heavy metals in coastal water could respond quickly and promptly to anthropogenic disturbance hassan 2006 yet even though coastal regions are the most vulnerable to stress from rivers and oceans few studies have investigated the influences of human activities on the biodiversity and composition of microeukaryotic plankton in these areas furthermore while it is accepted that everything is everywhere but the environment selects distinguishing the relative contribution of each environmental driver in controlling community structure and how those driving factors vary across space is a major goal in coastal ecology martiny et al 2006 thompson et al 2017 in this study we used an edna metabarcoding method based on 18s rrna genes to explore the biogeographic pattern and interaction mechanism of the microeukaryotic community we selected the most suitable primers by in silico evaluation of the coverage for five pairs of widely used primers and examined the accuracy and sensitivity of mock and environmental communities to identify the key drivers of the geographic patterns in microeukaryotic plankton communities along the coastline we carried out a large scale surface water survey in three coastal areas located in northeast middle and southern china along a latitudinal gradient ranging from 20 to 40 n fig s2 in the current study we attempted to address the following questions i what is the most suitable 18s primer pair for monitoring chinese coastal microeukaryotic plankton ii what are the geographic patterns of microeukaryotic plankton biodiversity and community in coastal ecosystems at the continental scale iii which environmental factors are the best predictors of geographic pattern variation 2 materials and methods 2 1 selection of suitable edna primers for planktonic biodiversity monitoring targeting chinese coastal ecosystems a general workflow of primer evaluation includes three major parts fig 1 a we collected a chinese coastal plankton sequence database ccpd for in silico pcr primer evaluation first all marine planktonic phytoplankton and zooplankton sequences were downloaded from the pr2 database version 4 14 0 at the genus level and named pr2 marine planktonic database pr2 mp subsequently a list of chinese coastal planktonic species was compiled based on previous morphological studies zhang et al 2022b zhang et al 2022c and all taxonomic information was verified based on the world register of marine species worms https www marinespecies org database table s1 and s2 matching between the chinese coastal plankton species list and pr2 mp was used to generate the pr2 chinese coastal plankton database pr2 ccpd next the following search criteria were applied for obtaining the marine planktonic sequences from ncbi as marine or coastal or sea or ocean and chinese planktonic taxonomic information 18s finally the ccpd was constructed by combining the ncbi marine planktonic 18s sequences and pr2 ccpd sequence lengths in the ccpd were limited to 1000 2000 bp to increase the taxonomy identification accuracy and after deduplication resulted in 17 556 nonredundant genomic sequences being retained 9548 zooplanktonic and 8008 phytoplanktonic sequences fig 1b subsequent in silico evaluation of primers coverage and the mock and environmental communities to test the pcr primers are described in the supplemental materials 2 2 spatial patterns and predictors of microeukaryotic biodiversity and community edna study area and sampling edna sampling was conducted along the entire coastline of china fig s2 a total of sixty four surface water samples were collected from three separate regions yalujiang estuary ylj 39 62 39 91 n 123 74 124 22 e the east china sea ecs 28 03 38 00 n 120 27 123 80 e and beibu bay bb 20 33 21 54 n 108 29 109 64 e each water sample was divided into two subsamples one for edna extraction and diversity analyses and the other for analysis of environmental variables for diversity analysis the water was filtered through a 0 22 Œºm polycarbonate membrane all filters were then stored at 80 c until dna extraction ph salinity cod do nh4 n no3 n no2 n cd cr as zn cu and water temperature were measured according to the methods described in previous studies zhang et al 2022b the heavy metals in ecs were extracted using kriging interpolation by arcgis based on the previously reported environmental data zhang et al 2022b the edna was extracted from the filters using the dnseay powersoil pro kit qiagen gembh based on the manufacturer s protocol the hypervariable v9 region of microeukaryotic 18s rrna gene was amplified using the primers based on the marker selection the pcr system and thermocycler profile was same as mentioned above 2 3 bioinformatics processing the amplified products were mixed and quantified for sequencing using the illumina hiseq instrument with 2 250 bp at magigene biotechnology co ltd guangzhou china the raw data from sequencing were demultiplexed and barcodes and primer sequences were trimmed from the paired end sequences then merged by flash in the bioinformatic analysis platform http mem rcees ac cn 8080 feng et al 2017 in order to retain a larger portion of the high quality reads the length of reads 200 bp were further discarded then using unoise3 the reads were processed to generate amplicon sequence variants asvs using default 8 parameters li et al 2021 subsequently singletons were removed and the representative reads were annotated with the protist ribosomal reference database pr2 v4 10 to focus on the microeukaryotic plankton the asvs assigned to metazoa rhodophyta ulvophyceae streptophyta and unclassified were excluded adl et al 2019 finally the total dataset was randomly normalized to 37 838 sequences for per sample and the rarefaction analyses indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient for a diversity study 2 4 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed in the r environment r version 4 1 3 http www r project org environmental heterogeneity was calculated as the pairwise euclidean distance in all environmental variables among the three sampling regions and the significance was tested by the kruskal wallis test the alpha diversity indices of each sample including shannon phylogenetic distance pd and observed richness or were calculated using the vegan package dixon 2003 linear fit and generalized additive models gams were used to visualize the latitudinal trendline of microeukaryotic alpha diversity wood 2017 to visualize the environmental heterogeneity between sampling regions principal component analysis pca analysis was performed based on the euclidean distance of environmental variables anderson et al 2006 beta diversity of the microeukaryotic community was estimated based on bray curtis distances and the differences in the community composition across sampling regions were visualized by principal coordinates analysis pcoa paradis et al 2004 significance was tested by nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance permanova analysis of similarity anosim and multiple response permutation procedure mrpp using the vegan package to test for differences in beta diversity across regions the kruskal wallis test was used in r a series of generalized linear models glms were used to distinguish how regional variables influence the dynamics of planktonic alpha diversity and gage their relative importance dobson and barnett 2018 to determine the most optimal model we used the exhaustive search algorithm to evaluate the glms in the leaps r package random forest rf analyses were performed to identify the relative importance of predictors in the model that influenced the diversity randomforest r package liaw and wiener 2002 principal coordinates of the neighbor matrix vector pcnm vectors were used to interpret in terms of spatial scales based on the longitude and latitude coordinates of each sampling site borcard et al 2004 to avoid collinearity among regional variations and pcnm variance inflation factors vifs were calculated and factors with vif 10 were removed vegan r package redundancy analysis rda based on bray curtis distance was performed to assess the relationship between community composition and regional variables the hierarchical partitioning model was performed to quantify the relative importance of purely spatial and purely environmental components using the rdacca hp package lai et al 2022 mantel test was deployed to evaluate the impacts of regional variations and water traits on microeukaryotic diversity to explore biotic interactions regional molecular ecological networks mens were constructed for asvs which were present in more than 50 of samples in an individual region via the molecular ecological network analyses pipeline menap http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena main cgi deng et al 2012 deng et al 2016 the mens under different regions were constructed using random matrix theory and the correlation was calculated by spearman coefficient to compare the properties of the three regional networks uniform thresholds 0 86 were selected calculations global network properties and network randomization were also performed in the pipeline to reveal how regional variables affected network composition the correlation between module based eigengenes and environmental factors were calculated finally cytoscape 3 8 0 was used to visualize networks and perform modular analysis 3 results 3 1 mock and environmental community metabarcoding analyses overview of ccpd and in silico primers evaluation analysis are described in the supplemental materials for the mock communities a total 427 890 927 891 and 1 144 425 clean sequences were obtained for primer pairs ssuf04 ssur22 ssuf22 ssur09 and 1380f 1510r and the average numbers of reads per sample were 71 315 154 648 and 190 737 respectively the other two primer pairs 1391f eukbr and 1389f 1510r only obtained 58 and 42 total sequences respectively and could not cover any of the species in the mock communities indicating those primer sets were inappropriate for the following biodiversity analyses the results of length distribution for these five primer sets are shown in table s3 by using the full length 18s rrna gene from six planktonic species we found that 1380f 1510r exhibited the highest sensitivity in detecting all species fig 2 a primer pairs ssuf04 ssur22 and ssuf22 ssur09 would miss chloropicon primus strain ccmp1205 which represents the rare species in the ecosystem only 0 1 ng dna in the mock community fig 2b and 2c for staggered mock communities ssuf04 ssur22 and ssuf22 ssur09 did not detect the lowest dna concentration level 0 1 ng fig 2d indicating that the lack of detection was due to the amount of dna and not a mismatch with the primers additionally we found that the relative abundance of platymonas helgolandica tsingtaoensis was significantly underestimated by 1380f 1510r in the even community and amphidinium carterae hulburt was overvalued by those three primers sets in the staggered mock community fig 2a a total of six sediments and fifteen water samples were collected from two chinese coastal areas near the yalujiang estuary ylj and beibu bay bb about 69 53 of planktonic species detected by morphology in chinese coastal ecosystems could be verified by the edna approach and the number of covered species and asvs was highest using 1380f 1510r fig 2e these results indicated that the edna approach could recover most planktonic species and that 1380f 1510r might be the most appropriate primer pair for monitoring chinese coastal plankton in our research 3 2 the distribution of microeukaryotic plankton in chinese coastal waters thereafter we used this verified primer set to assess the distribution of microeukaryotic plankton across chinese coastal marine surface water samples fig s2 a series of environmental factors characterizing the chinese coastal environments are shown in fig s3 environmental parameters varied greatly between the three coastal regions with significant differences in environmental heterogeneity were observed fig 3 a and s3 by using edna metabarcoding sequencing with 2421 632 reads from 64 samples a total of 2177 unique amplicon sequence variants asvs were identified the alpha diversity of microeukaryotic plankton including the asvs richness shannon and phylogenetic diversity pd were measured we observed significant variations in alpha diversity indices with latitude that followed a unimodal pattern the plankton exhibited maximal diversity in the middle region ecs 28 38 n which then decreased to the north and south of the coastline fig 3b and fig s4 p 0 05 the results of a principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the bray curtis dissimilarity index revealed that planktonic communities primarily clustered into three regions with significant differences mrpp anosim and permanova tests p 0 001 fig 3c which was consistent with the environmental factors fig 3a we estimated the differences in planktonic beta diversity among regions and showed significantly lower dispersion for communities in the middle ecs region p 0 05 fig 3c furthermore the dissimilarity of the planktonic community showed a comparable correlations with geographic distances in each region and the slopes of the distance decay curve varied across the three regions fig 3d these results indicated that coastal marine plankton exhibited strong region specific patterns in order to determine the relative contribution of environmental variables to regional alpha diversity generalized linear models glms were used all planktonic alpha diversity indexes were best predicted by models containing inorganic nitrogen across all regions the best fitting model for most regional alpha diversities included heavy metals hms table s4 random forest analysis showed that not all environmental variables in the models contributed to the same degree to the species diversity fig 4 a for example inorganic nitrogen no3 n and nh4 n was the most important variable for predicting diversity in the bb and ylj while the important variables for predicting phylogenetic distance pd and observed richness or in the ecs were dissolved oxygen do and no3 n respectively additionally cu and cd were important variables for predicting diversity in bb and ylj these results indicated the importance of human activity factors nutrient and metal factors in regional planktonic diversity to test the explanation of environmental and geographic variables in shaping the regional planktonic community composition hierarchical partitioning analysis was performed fig 4b the results indicated that pure environmental factor was the prerequisite correlation with the variance planktonic communities in all three regions this finding was supported by redundancy analysis rda which showed hm factors cd as cu and cr were major environmental variables influencing the planktonic community structure in bb and ylj and nutrient related factors inorganic nitrogen explained a large portion of compositional variation in all regions p 0 001 fig 4c e only in ylj was geographic distance pcnm found to be a dominant variable for community assemblage meanwhile mantel test was conducted to demonstrate the association between environmental factors and planktonic diversity in all regions fig 5 the significance of environmental drivers shaping regional planktonic diversity and community variation varied greatly among the three regions the results also revealed that both nutrient related factors and hms significantly explained the variation in planktonic diversity and community composition in bb and ylj therefore the shifts in planktonic biodiversity and community structure along the chinese coastline were significantly related to regional environments especially nutrients and hms 3 3 spatial pattern of networks structure and the potential environmental drivers co occurrence networks were established to explore the strong association among planktonic organisms and their response to environmental variations fig 6 the networks exhibited significantly different modular structures among the different regions clearly divided into six nine and ten major modules which accounted for 86 76 bb 80 09 ecs and 78 10 ylj of the nodes within the networks respectively the topological properties of the networks were also divergent among regions the co occurrence networks of ylj and ecs were more complex than that of bb as reflected by the larger network size total number of nodes as well as higher network of links total number of links average degree avgk centralization of stress centrality cs and connectedness table 1 to further predict and quantify modules relevance to environmental changes module eigenvalue analysis was used to link the module members and environmental variables fig 6d f in the bb network all six major modules were significantly correlated with dissolved nitrogen and hms and only two modules m1 and m5 showed a significant association with water temperature p 0 05 the cd cr and no3 n were significantly correlated with most modules in the ecs network and some water traits temperature ph and salinity showed significant association with few modules similarly the strong correlations with modules in the ylj network were observed with nutrients and hms suggesting that regional nutrients and hms were the principal factors leading to changes in the regional planktonic association 4 discussion because microeukaryotic plankton in hydrologically complex coastal systems mediate a substantial fraction of global ocean biogeochemical fluxes they are expected to be bioindicators of climate and environmental changes worden et al 2015 although the geographic pattern of planktonic communities of freshwater and urban waterbodies are well documented chen et al 2019 mo et al 2021 zhu et al 2021 little is known about coastal ecosystems at continental scale especially for large estuarine areas affected by human activities to avoid biases in amplicon and species coverage resulting from primer selection we presented a systematic methodology to select the most appropriate metabarcoding primers to target specific taxa and regions before biodiversity monitoring based on edna by examining surface water samples from across a wide area of the chinese coastline our results showed that the microeukaryotic planktonic diversity community and co occurrence patterns exhibited significant latitudinal patterns the result demonstrated a latitudinal pattern likely due to the regional environmental heterogeneity and that human activity related factors e g nutrients and hms could strongly shape the planktonic communities monitoring microeukaryotic plankton biodiversity is essential in measuring anthropogenic influence on coastal waters and to help protect ecosystems fiser et al 2018 edna metabarcoding as a recent rapidly developing technology could overcome the limitations of conventional methods to rapidly and accurately identify microeukaryotic plankton deiner et al 2017 liu et al 2017 selecting the most powerful and efficient genetic marker and its corresponding primers largely determine how successful community detection is tang et al 2012 to address the first question in the article we chose to assess several primers that have been applied in various planktonic studies bik et al 2012 lima mendez et al 2015 zhao et al 2022 all primers had been designed based on specific research aims using some species known to be present in the target ecosystems as such previous widely used primers should be validated according to the scope of the specific biodiversity study deiner et al 2017 wang et al 2022 reliable reference databases are crucial for accurate edna based biodiversity monitoring and developing effective primers yang et al 2021 in this study we aimed to find an effective set of primers and therefore collected a comprehensive chinese coastal plankton sequence database ccpd for primer evaluation fig 1b the ccpd is designed for primer evaluation and only focused on the planktonic taxon so that could lose the function information for microeukaryotic plankton but it contains genes and sequences for most plankton observed by microscopy and before primer evaluation we de redundant and length limited all the sequences to improve the quality of the sequences in ccpd the multi criteria evaluation of primers including coverage and sensitivity was performed in silico and with mock and environmental communities li et al 2019 wang et al 2022 the results indicated the 1380f 1510r primer pair was more sensitive to rare species in the mock community and captured significantly higher species coverage than the other primer sets reviewed here therefore the 1380f 1510r performed better than other primer pairs based on the evaluation protocol and it might be the suitable gene primer pair for monitoring the coastal microeukaryotic plankton in this study the edna metabarcoding revealed that microeukaryotic diversity and communities exhibited distinct spatial patterns and that they might be attributed to environmental heterogeneity latitudinal diversity gradients ldgs are the most pervasive ecology and evolution pattern hillebrand 2004 all diversity indexes shannon or and pd peaked around the median latitude region 28 38 n similar to previously observed biogeographic patterns ibarbalz et al 2019 the physiological tolerance hypothesis points out that the ldg is mainly structured by temperature constraints on species distribution currie et al 2004 different spatial tendencies of temperature and diversity index were found fig s3 and s4 which might be due to the relatively small temperature variations of the temperate and subtropical regions which prevented temperature from acting as a constraining factor sampling sites were found to cluster into different regions based on the significant difference in environmental variables fig 3a and s3 suggesting distinct environmental heterogeneity among the three coastal regions therefore we inferred that the regional environment heterogeneity was the potential driver accounting for the planktonic diversity variation this inference is supported by a previous study which demonstrated that local environmental factors displayed a stronger influence in determining microbial diversity fiere and jackson 2006 the planktonic community distribution also exhibited regional specificity which was proven by the robust evidence for significantly dissimilarity patterns and distance decay trends between all three regional communities fig 3c and 3d covering different scale sampling regions microeukaryotic plankton exhibited similar spatial variation with significantly distinct turnover given the environmental and spatial heterogeneity in each coastal region the difference in community turnover rates might strongly relate to the variability of environmental settings and spatial structure among regions logares et al 2013 soininen et al 2007 wang et al 2017 we did observe that the environmental factors were more correlated with regional communities and could explain a larger amount of biogeographic variations of the communities than geographic distance within each region fig 4b e suggesting that the planktonic community was mainly governed by regional environment heterogeneity at the geographic continent scale molecular ecological networks are often used to infer the correlation between taxa and further evaluate the stability and complexity of the communities in various ecosystems barberan et al 2012 lima mendez et al 2015 nuccio et al 2016 the linkages between the co occurrence networks and biogeography could help us to figure out the potential process community assembly barberan et al 2012 a clear biogeographic pattern for the complexity of planktonic co occurrence networks was observed in the present study table 1 and fig 6 the more complicated networks were found in the middle and southern regions according to a series of topological parameters e g average degree average path distance and connectedness yuan et al 2021 according to a previous study the different complex networks of microeukaryotic plankton in the surface water could result in large part from regional heterogeneity shi et al 2016 mougi and kondoh mougi and kondoh 2012 reported that higher environmental heterogeneity create greater network complexity and connectivity therefore the spatial pattern of planktonic co occurrence network structure and complexity might be due to the bb being located in a relatively undeveloped region with lower environmental disturbance than the other two regions fig s3 dou et al 2013 altogether we believe that the heterogeneous environments strongly shaped the spatial variation for planktonic co occurrence networks between sampling regions characterizing the determining environmental factors is crucial for improving the monitoring and prediction of planktonic biodiversity and community composition and to reveal the potential impacts of human activities the coastal regions have been undergoing intense local human impacts by receiving inputs of excessive nutrients and hms lotze et al 2006 the bb as a typical economically developing area is located in the south of fujian province into which many rivers discharged dou et al 2013 and ylj has seen the development large scale aquaculture industry and is a typical shipping area guan et al 2020 the sampling sites located in the ecs included the changjiang river estuary an area with higher anthropogenic disturbance due to relatively advanced industrial activities and a dense human population chen 2008 the location level of economic development and environmental governance capabilities determined distinct environmental heterogeneity and degree of human activities the most intriguing aspect of our findings was the significant effect of human activity related factors on planktonic spatial patterns among the coastal regions among all abiotic factors inorganic nitrogen was observed to contribute the most towards explaining variation in planktonic diversity and community for all regions this result was supported by a previous study that reported nutrients could influence the community composition and turnover by providing sufficient resources for many regional costal species logue et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 furthermore we also observed that hms especially cd as cu and zn contributed a substantial amount to variations in planktonic community composition and co occurrence patterns this was consistent with a recent study in which it was shown that cu and zn were necessary for n utilizing enzymes and subsequently influenced phytoplanktonic growth and distribution morel et al 2020 cd as the catalytic metal center in carbonic anhydrase enzymes has a significant impact on the planktonic community jensen et al 2019 the nutrients inorganic nitrogen and hms closely associated with anthropogenic drivers and could enter coastal waters directly through effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants hale et al 2015 howard et al 2014 zhang et al 2022a nitrogen as the primary limiting macronutrient for phytoplankton has always been the focus of aquatic ecosystem studies and the impacts of human activities on nitrogen fluxes are substantial and accelerated crain et al 2009 galloway et al 2014 similarly hms in waters could be absorbed by marine organisms and transferred through marine food webs jiang et al 2018 hence our research demonstrated that anthropogenic impacts might strongly influence planktonic biodiversity community structure and co occurrence patterns in the chinese coastal ecosystems and offer better ecological services for coastal biodiversity monitoring and anthropogenic stress assessment 5 conclusion in summary through a detailed and systematic primer evaluation protocol we found the 1380f 1510r was the most suitable 18s primer pair for edna based monitoring of the chinese coastal microeukaryotic plankton community and found evidence of the effects of regional anthropogenic activities on coastal planktonic ecosystems we investigated the community geographic distribution and co occurrence patterns of microeukaryotic plankton along the coastline regional environmental heterogeneity played an important role in shaping latitudinal diversity patterns at the continent scale our results provided evidence that the local environmental conditions especially nutrients and heavy metals were the key driving factor in predicting diversity the planktonic communities exhibited distinct spatial turnover rates within each region and anthropogenic activity related factors were the major driver it was also shown that planktonic co occurrence network topological properties and complexity exhibited a significant spatial pattern and the structure showed distinct responses to environments impacted by regional human activity together our results demonstrated that the edna based approach was very helpful in systematically monitoring the biodiversity and provided new knowledge on explaining the drivers of planktonic communities spatial variation in human impacted environments

14966,the performance and intrinsic mechanism of vivianite a natural mineral containing structural fe ii for peroxymonosulfate pms activation and pollutant degradation under dark conditions were comprehensively explored in this study it was found that vivianite was able to efficiently activate pms to degrade various pharmaceutical pollutants under dark conditions in which the corresponding reaction rate constant of ciprofloxacin cip degradation was 47 and 32 fold higher than that of magnetite and siderite respectively so4 oh fe iv and electron transfer processes were found in the vivianite pms system while so4 was the main contributor to cip degradation moreover mechanistic explorations revealed that the fe site on the surface of vivianite could bind pms in the form of a bridge position and thus vivianite could rapidly activate absorbed pms due to its strong electron donating ability additionally it was illustrated that the used vivianite could be efficiently regenerated by either chemical or biological reduction this study may provide an alternative application of vivianite in addition to phosphorus recovery from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vivianite peroxymonosulfate pollutant degradation regeneration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as global phosphorus resources become increasingly tight combining nutrient removal from wastewater with phosphorus recovery is considered one of the most promising options egle et al 2015 vivianite an iron ii phosphate mineral is the main form of bound ferrous iron in wastewater wilfert et al 2016 meanwhile it was demonstrated that the efficiency of phosphorus recovery by vivianite crystallization technology was much higher than that of the conventional crystallization process egle et al 2015 in addition the products of phosphorus recovery by vivianite crystallization technology are used in a wide range of applications such as fertilizers pigments and industrial raw materials zhang et al 2021 due to its excellent performance in phosphorus resource recovery efficiency and economic value it has gradually replaced traditional struvite and hydroxyapatite crystalline products and has become a hot spot of attention wu et al 2019 it is worth noting that vivianite as a natural mineral also contains structural fe ii in addition to phosphorus wilfert et al 2015 numerous studies have shown that iron based materials can activate different oxidizing agents such as peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade contaminants in the presence or absence of light for example magnetic co fe nanocomposites derived from ferric sludge was demonstrated as an efficient peroxymonosulfate catalyst for ciprofloxacin degradation under dark conditions zhu et al 2022 while iron doped mos2 was able to enhance pms activation for tetracycline degradation in the presence of visible light li et al 2022 in particular several studies have shown that various fe ii based minerals including fes2 fese2 siderite feco3 and magnetite fe3o4 could activate pms for pollutant degradation in the absence of light chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 interestingly previous studies demonstrated that the ability to activate pms for the degradation of pollutants with various fe ii based minerals was quite different both fes2 and fese2 were able to effectively activate pms to rapidly remove the pollutants chloramphenicol and bisphenol a from water fang et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 while this ability was much weaker for siderite and magnetite in terms of pollutant degradation feng et al 2018b unfortunately the ability of vivianite for pms activation and pollutant degradation as well as the underlying mechanisms particularly under dark conditions have not been clearly explored only recently vivianite was found to activate peroxodisulfate under the excitation of light to produce active species and degrade antibiotics yi et al 2022 additionally it should be worthwhile to pay attention to how to realize the regeneration of vivianite since the continuous consumption of fe ii would lead to the reduction of the catalytic performance of vivianite for pms activation therefore this study aimed to investigate the ability of vivianite to activate pms and correspondingly degrade various pharmaceutical pollutants including the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin cip under dark conditions elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms by adopting various technologies including synchrotron radiation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy sr ftir and density functional theory dft calculations and finally assess the regeneration feasibility of vivianite using chemical and biological reduction methods in addition the cip degradation performances in terms of active species transformation pathways and toxicity for vivianite pms magnetite pms and siderite pms systems were systemically compared in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in this study were analytical reagent grade and their details can be viewed in text s1 of the supporting information si details of the vivianite synthesis method are shown in text s2 2 2 pollutant degradation experiments batch pollutant degradation experiments were conducted using 50 ml reaction suspensions in a 150 ml glass conical bottle sealed with tin foil for cip degradation vivianite was added to each bottle and mixed thoroughly and subsequently pms solution was added to initiate the reaction the initial concentrations of cip pms and vivianite were 10 mg l 0 84 mm and 0 5 g l respectively the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 6 0 and then the reaction bottles were stirred magnetically at 300 rpm under ambient temperatures 25 c for comparison the control experiments were also conducted under similar conditions by adding either vivianite or pms alone additionally the feasibility of the vivianite activated pms process for degrading other pharmaceutical pollutants was also investigated including sulfamethoxazole smx p chlorophenol 4 cp carbamazepine cbz bisphenol a bpa and tetracycline tc furthermore the effects of vivianite dosing ph pms concentration and the presence of different anions cl no3 and co3 2 and humic acid ha were explored and the details are shown in table s1 the effect of real water matrix was carried out by replacing deionized water with tap water or industrial wastewater from local pharmaceutical company hefei anhui respectively and their chemical compositions are shown in table s2 all experiments were conducted in triplicate to exclude the influence of structural phosphate on cip degradation in the vivianite pms system vivianite was replaced by an equal mass concentration of zn3 po4 2 under the same experimental conditions on the other hand to assess the continuous removal of cip by vivianite activated pms in practical applications column experiments in continuous flow systems with a fixed bed column filled with vivianite were performed the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 and the experimental details are displayed in text s3 2 3 vivianite regeneration assessment since fe ii in vivianite would be oxidized to fe iii during pms activation the feasibility of vivianite regeneration using either chemical or biological reduction was investigated hydroxylamine was chosen for chemical vivianite regeneration li et al 2020 first after 5 cycles vivianite was added to the hydroxylamine solution 0 3 mm under an anaerobic atmosphere for 30 min then the precipitate was washed three times with oxygen free water and dried in a vacuum drying oven overnight at 60 c li et al 2019 shewanella onidensis mr 1 as a representative dissimilatory iron reduction bacterium dirb was selected for biological vivianite regeneration wu et al 2021 initially 25 mg vivianite after 5 cycles was added to 100 ml s onidensis mr 1 suspension od600 2 0 0 1 in shocking incubation for 3 days then the precipitate was washed three times with oxygen free water and inactivated using uv irradiation for 30 min finally the precipitate was dried in a vacuum drying oven overnight at 60 c and more details about biological regeneration experiments are displayed in text s4 after regeneration the dried solids were used for cip degradation in which the experimental conditions were the same as those of fresh vivianite 2 4 analytical methods the morphology and structure of the obtained vivianite were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem sirion 200 fei ltd usa high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem talos f200x fei ltd usa and x ray diffraction xrd ttr iii rigaku japan respectively xps analysis escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific usa was conducted to analyze the surface compositions of vivianite the zeta potential of the suspended vivianite particles was measured by a potential analyzer zeta sizer nano series malvern uk at different time intervals in the degradation experiments a 1 ml aliquot of the reaction suspension was withdrawn and added to methanol 1 ml to quench the reaction and extract the remaining pollutant the resulting suspension was filtered through a 0 22 Œºm mixed cellulose ester mce syringe filter and the first 1 ml was discarded to reduce the error caused by membrane adsorption the pollutant concentration in the filtrate was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa with a uv dad detector and more details about the wavelength and mobile phases are displayed in table s3 the intermediates of cip degradation were identified by tripletof 5600 high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms applied biosystems sciex u s a and the detailed analysis procedures are shown in text s5 total organic carbon toc was evaluated by a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany the generation of active species during the reaction was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker china with dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide and temp 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine as a trapping agent sr ftir was used to identify pms intermediates during its activation by vivianite and the test details are shown in text s5 additionally the analysis procedure of pms concentration is shown in text s6 electrochemical measurements were carried out via an electrochemical workstation bio logic france and the details procedures are described in text s7 2 5 dft calculations the dft calculations included structural optimization and energetic predictions of the interaction between pms and vivianite the interactions between pms and magnetite or siderite were also calculated for comparison dft calculations were performed by employing the cambridge sequential total energy package castep implemented in materials studio using the periodic supercell approach the projector augmented wave paw method and the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe function were adopted to describe electron ion interactions electron electron exchange and correlation energies respectively bl√∂chl 1994 spin polarized calculations were taken into account to accurately obtain the magnetic properties of modules due to the presence of magnetic iron species for geometry optimization the plane wave energy cutoff was set as 600 ev and the k point was determined to be gamma with a self consistent field scf convergence of 1 0 10 6 ev per atom the adsorption energy eads of pms onto different substrates vivianite magnetite and siderite can be defined as 1 e a d s e t o t a l e s u b s t r a t e e m o l e c u l e where etotal esubstrate and emolecule denote the total energy of the substrate with pms substrate and free pms molecule respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 vivianite properties and pollutant degradation performance the sem image showed that vivianite was flower like and composed of platy shaped crystals with an overall size of approximately 10 Œºm fig 1 a the structures of vivianite were inspected by xrd fig 1b the xrd peaks at 2Œ∏ values of 11 9 13 16 18 14 21 8 27 76 and 29 85 matched well with the standard jcpds data pdf 75 1186 for vivianite and moreover no other peaks were observed indicating that pure vivianite was successfully fabricated hrtem was performed to determine the main exposed crystalline surfaces of vivianite no significant lattice stripes were observed in the image since the structure of vivianite had difficulty withstanding the bombardment of high energy electron beams fig 1c as shown in fig 1d selected area electron diffraction saed analysis of the hrtem showed that the main exposed crystal surface of vivianite was 020 which was consistent with a previous study bae et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 a only 9 or 6 2 of cip was removed in the presence of vivianite or pms individually suggesting that both the direct degradation of cip with vivianite or pms were insignificant notably cip was completely removed within three minutes in the presence of 0 5 g l vivianite and 0 84 mm pms the kinetics for cip degradation were well fitted to the pseudo first order reaction with an estimated reaction rate constant k obs value of 1 600 0 072 min 1 fig 2b in addition the toc removal efficiency reached to 42 9 and 81 2 after 10 and 30 min reaction respectively fig s2 noticeably the performance of vivianite exceeded that of almost all reported iron based minerals and many catalysts listed in table s4 zhang et al 2022 for a fairer comparison the performance of two common iron based minerals magnetite and siderite in degrading cip was tested under the same reaction conditions fig s3 and the corresponding k obs values were 0 034 0 004 and 0 050 0 008 min 1 respectively in contrast the k obs value of vivianite was 47 06 and 32 fold higher than those of magnetite and siderite respectively additionally the vivianite activated pms process could effectively remove various pharmaceutical pollutants both smx and tc were selected as representatives of antibiotic compounds cbz and bpa as endocrine disrupting ones and 4 cp as phenolic one as shown in fig 2c and 2d 100 of smx cbz bpa tc and 79 of 4 cp were degraded within 10 min in the vivianite pms system in which the corresponding kobs values were 0 512 0 011 0 261 0 002 0 371 0 01 0 481 0 007 and 0 206 0 002 min 1 respectively complete degradation of 4 cp was also achieved by extending the reaction time to 20 min in addition the toc removal efficiencies corresponding to these pollutants reached to 52 1 36 4 47 2 49 2 and 46 1 within 1 h respectively fig s4 as shown in fig 3 a the k obs value of cip degradation remarkably improved from 0 311 to 1 600 min 1 as the vivianite loading increased from 0 25 to 0 5 g l while a limited increase in k obs from 1 600 to 1 751 min 1 was observed when the vivianite loading further increased to 1 g l this might be due to the limited pms restricted free radical production and contaminant removal at a high vivianite dosing the k obs value of cip degradation increased from 0 303 to 1 600 min 1 with increasing pms concentration from 0 42 to 0 84 mm while it was reduced to 0 582 min 1 when further increasing the pms concentration to 1 68 mm fig 3b as shown in fig 3c and s5a although the k obs value of cip degradation decreased from 1 600 min 1 to 0 673 and 0 521 min 1 under acidic ph 3 0 and alkaline ph 9 0 conditions respectively cip was still completely removed within 5 min in addition the solution ph decreased from initial value of 3 06 6 05 and 9 02 to 2 67 4 16 and 8 69 after 10 min of reaction respectively fig s5b this might be attributed to not only organic acids produced by cip degradation but also proton generation during the oxidation of water molecules by sulfate radicals du et al 2016 duan et al 2016 the zeta potential values of the vivianite at different phs were measured as shown in fig s6 the surface of vivianite was positively charged when ph was less than 4 0 and changed to negative when ph was higher than 5 0 in which the phpzc of the vivianite surface was calculated as 4 3 since pms is negatively charged at ph less than 9 4 the adsorption of pms on the surface of vivianite would be unfavorable at ph 6 0 and 9 0 additionally the hydrogen bond formed between h and the oo group of hso5 would play an important role at ph 3 0 attaching a positive charge to hso5 and eventually hindering its interaction with the positively charged vivianite surface li et al 2019 nevertheless cip is positively charged at ph 3 0 and 6 0 while negative charged at ph 9 0 suggesting that ph at 6 0 would be favorable for cip adsorption on the surface of vivianite this may be one of major reasons that cip degradation was not conducive to either over acid or over base conditions in the vivianite pms system patel et al 2021 as shown in figs 3d and s7a the corresponding k obs value of cip degradation decreased from 1 600 min 1 in the absence of ha to 0 663 and 0 282 min 1 in the presence of 1 and 10 mg l ha respectively both the reduction of dissolved organic carbon doc and hrtem images of vivianite after the reaction suggested the adsorption of ha onto the surface of vivianite figs s7b and s7c the adsorbed ha could bind with fe ii on the surface of vivianite resulting in the inhibition of pms activation fig s7d and consequently reduction of free radical formation yang et al 2021 which confirmed by epr spectra fig s7e additionally ha contains a large number of electron sites that can react rapidly with attracting electrophilic so4 and oh with the result that the competition for reactive oxygen species in solution led to a decrease in pollutant degradation efficiency xie et al 2015 furthermore the effects of different anions cl no3 and co3 2 on cip degradation in the vivianite pms system were evaluated as shown in fig s8a s8c the presence of both cl and no3 had slightly effects on cip degradation in the vivianite pms system however the corresponding k obs value of cip degradation decreased from 1 600 min 1 in the absence of co3 2 to 1 000 and 0 609 min 1 in the presence of 1 and 10 mm co3 2 respectively which might be due to the strong competition between co3 2 and cip for oh sasi et al 2015 nevertheless it should be noted that the vivianite pms system was able to completely degrade 10 mg l cip within 5 min even in the presence of 10 mm co3 2 additionally the cip degradation performance of vivianite pms system in real waters was also evaluated as shown in fig s8d the corresponding k obs value of cip degradation slightly decreased from 1 600 to 1 515 min 1 when deionized water control was replaced with tap water however the k obs value of cip degradation reduced to 0 748 min 1 for an industrial wastewater which might be due to high concentrations of co3 2 and toc in the industrial wastewater table s2 3 2 reactive species and possible cip degradation pathways to explore the mechanism of pms activation by vivianite for cip degradation under dark conditions epr spectroscopy was initially adopted to identify the dominant radicals as shown in fig 4 a and 4b obvious signals of the dmpo so4 and dmpo oh adducts were detected in the epr spectrum suggesting that both so4 and oh were generated in the vivianite pms system fang et al 2013 in addition the intensity of the dmpo so4 adduct signal was much lower than that of the dmpo oh signal which can be attributed to the unstable dmpo so4 transforming to dmpo oh feng et al 2018a the intensity of the signals increased significantly as the reaction time was extended from 1 to 10 min and gradually stabilized after 10 min which indicated that so4 and oh could be produced rapidly and exist stably in the vivianite pms system meanwhile the peak intensities of the epr signals increased approximately 3 4 fold as the pms concentration increased from 0 42 to 1 68 mm suggesting that increasing the pms concentration favored so4 and oh formation however although the intensity of the signal peaks in the epr spectra increased with increasing pms concentration from 0 84 to 1 68 mm the corresponding k obs of cip degradation decreased interestingly a similar phenomenon was also observed in the fese2 pms system fang et al 2020 this might attribute to the attack of excess radicals on the iron based heterogeneous catalyst surface which in turn passivates the catalyst surface and then hinders the adsorption of contaminants and further activation of pms thus reducing the kobs value of cip degradation on the other hand self scavenging between excess radicals could also lead to a decrease in the rate of cip degradation lai et al 2021 free radical quenching studies were used to distinguish the contribution of different free radicals to the degradation of cip in the vivianite pms system tba for oh and meoh for both oh and so4 were added as effective quenching reagents zhou et al 2018 fig 4c shows that the degradation efficiency of cip decreased from 100 to 86 7 and 26 5 with the addition of tba and meoh respectively implying that so4 might be the more important radical compared to oh accounting for cip degradation in the vivianite pms system in addition although a weak dmpoo2 signal was observed in the epr spectra fig s9a the addition of p benzoquinone p bq a quencher for o2 had a slight effect on the degradation of cip in the vivianite pms system fig s9c suggesting that o2 did not majorly contribute to cip degradation in the vivianite pms system which might be due to its weaker oxidative properties zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that electron transfer processes etp singlet oxygenation and high valent metal induced oxidation were mainstream non radical pathways for the persulfate based system additionally high valent species such as fe iv could be generated during the activation of pms by fe ii according to eq 2 for pollutant degradation via electron transfer dong et al 2020 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso is considered a probe compound for fe iv because it can be oxidized by fe iv to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 and the yield of pmso2 pmso2 pmso can reflect the contribution of fe iv wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 4d the yield of pmso2 was only 9 after reacting for 10 min indicating a low contribution of fe iv to pollutant degradation in the vivianite pms system 2 fe ii hso 5 fe iv o so 4 2 h singlet oxygen 1o2 is another common active species as shown in fig s9b there was an insignificant enhancement of the signal of temp 1o2 in the vivianite pms system compared to temp alone in the epr spectra moreover the addition of l histidine had a negligible impact on cip degradation fig s9c above results clearly implied that the generation of 1o2 was negligible in the vivianite pms system indeed electron transfer processes etp is another common nonradical pathway in the persulfate based system chronoamperometry can provide a direct evidence to confirm the etp mechanism ren et al 2022 as shown in fig s9d upon the addition of pms and cip a negative and a positive current signal could be instantly aroused respectively justifying the electron transfer pathway between cip electron supplier and activated pms electron withdrawer when they were co existed on the catalyst surface yang et al 2020 however the contribution of etp to cip degradation was limited since quenching experiments showed that both oh and so4 contributed more than 75 to cip degradation in the vivianite pms system fig 4c for comparison the active species of cip degradation in magnetite pms and siderite pms systems were identified fig s10 similar with that in the vivianite pms system oh so4 and o2 were found for cip degradation in the magnetite pms and siderite pms systems with so4 being the major contributor in addition the generation of 1o2 was negligible in three systems however we did not find fe iv and etp for cip degradation in the magnetite pms and siderite pms systems while both of them had impacts to a certain extent for cip degradation in the vivianite pms system to explore the possible reaction pathways of cip degradation in the vivianite pms system the oxidation intermediates and products were analyzed by using lc ms ms as shown in fig s11 a 11 l eleven main intermediates of cip degradation were detected and are summarized in table s5 since radicals were the main reactive species intermediates might be formed via hydroxylation and cleavage of the piperazine ring cn bonds cyclopropyl and carboxyl groups and possible cip degradation pathways in the vivianite pms system were proposed fig 5 in the p1 pathway the amine n on the piperazine ring is likely be attacked by so4 via electron transfer mechanism neta et al 1977 initially the piperazine ring attacked by so4 opened and produced dialdehyde derivative a m z 361 11 an m z 361 11 was gradually converted to b m z 333 11 by the removal of one formaldehyde in the open piperazine ring and then transformed into c m z 305 12 through the loss of the second formaldehyde c m z 305 12 could be further oxidized to d m z 262 08 by the loss of secondary amine nitrogen this route agrees with a previous study showing that the piperazine ring of cip was the most reactive site toward so4 attack jiang et al 2016 pathway p2 was initiated by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring oxidation of the cyclopropane moiety of cip led to ring opening resulting in the form e m z 335 09 both d m z 262 08 and e m z 335 09 could be further attacked by so4 and oh to generate f m z 206 03 in pathway p3 oxidization of the core quinolone structure by oh forms g m z 337 13 followed by stepwise oxidation to form h m z 363 12 and i m z 307 13 pathway p4 was called kolbe decarboxylation where the electron was transferred from the carboxyl group in j m z 314 13 to an so4 then converted into k m z 288 15 by loss of coo structure hori et al 2004 finally radicals continuously attack the intermediate products to form small molecular products and ultimately inorganic products co2 and h2o as supported by the reduction in toc concentration fig s4 meanwhile the cip degradation pathways in magnetite pms and siderite pms systems were analyzed while eleven intermediates a to k of cip degradation were found in the vivianite pms system only five intermediates were identified in the magnetite pms system a b c d g fig s12 and siderite pms system a b c e and g fig s13 respectively according to these intermediates we proposed two p1 and p3 in fig s14 and three pathways p1 p2 and p3 in fig s15 for cip degradation in the magnetite pms and siderite pms systems figs s14 and s15 respectively the acute toxicity lc50 fathead minnow 96 h daphnia magna lc50 48 h and developmental toxicity of cip and their degradation intermediates in the three systems were assessed by toxicity estimation software t e s t based on quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction yin et al 2020 as shown in fig s16 the solution toxicity of all three systems reduced while more intermediates of cip degradation with reduced toxicity or even not harmful were observed in the vivianite pms system additionally the mineralization rate of cip in vivianite pms system was remarkably faster than those in magnetite pms and siderite pms ones fig s17 which may facilitate the reduction of environmental risks for vivianite pms system 3 3 intrinsic mechanisms of pms activation by vivianite as shown in table s6 the dissolved fe concentration was only 0 185 mg l within 10 min in the presence of 0 5 g l vivianite at this fe2 concentration only 7 3 of the cip was removed after 10 min reaction in the fe2 pms system fig s18 indicating an insignificant role of homogeneous activation process for pollutant degradation in the vivianite pms system additionally dissolved phosphate was also undetectable in the solution suggesting its negligible role in pms activation in the vivianite pms system as dissolved phosphate was shown to be able to accelerate the generation of so4 and the degradation of contaminants in the pms activation system duan et al 2021 to further determine whether the structural phosphate in vivianite can activate pms zn3 po4 2 was selected as the source of structural phosphate since zn ii cannot activate pms to produce free radicals fig 6 a shows that the degradation efficiency of cip in the zn3 po4 2 pms system was only marginally enhanced by 2 compared to physical adsorption suggesting that the structural phosphate was unable to activate pms to promote the degradation of cip furthermore due to the strong coordination ligand effect between fe and certain ligands both kscn and a 1 10 phenanthroline quencher were used to evaluate the activation of pms by structural fe ii on vivianite hu et al 2021 as shown in fig 6b the degradation efficiency of cip decreased from 100 to 7 2 and 5 7 in the presence of 50 mm kscn and 1 10 phenanthroline respectively additionally the proportions of fe ii and fe iii on the surface of fresh vivianite were 62 8 and 37 2 while they changed to 40 1 and 59 9 after the reaction with pms fig 6c and 6d these results suggested that structural fe ii in vivianite would primarily contribute to the activation of pms for cip degradation to explore why vivianite had a better ability for pms activation than siderite and magnetite in situ sr ftir was carried out in this study according to the previous literature the peaks centered at 1100 and 1250 cm 1 can be associated with the symmetric stretching vibration mode of s o bonds in so4 2 and adsorbed pms hso5 respectively fan et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 a 7c the signal of hso5 rapidly emerged and maintained a stronger signal at a long time in the vivianite pms system compared to the siderite pms and magnetite pms systems indicating the fast balance between consumption and adsorption of pms on the vivianite surface meanwhile the simultaneous appearance and continuous accumulation of so4 2 implied that vivianite could more rapidly activate the adsorbed pms than siderite and magnetite this conclusion was further supported by the variation in pms concentration in the three systems as shown in fig s19 71 9 of pms was decomposed within 10 min while only 11 3 and 9 3 were decomposed for siderite and magnetite respectively we subsequently gain insight into the internal causes of the excellent performance of vivianite based on the results of dft calculations figs 7d e and s7a e shows the optimized geometries of pms vivianite magnetite and siderite respectively first the work function as a descriptor was calculated to describe the electron donating ability of vivianite magnetite and siderite as shown in fig 7f the work function value of vivianite 2 26 ev was lower than those of magnetite 5 00 ev and siderite 3 97 ev suggesting the stronger electron donating ability of vivianite which would be beneficial for pms activation he et al 2022a furthermore the interactions between pms and vivianite magnetite and siderite were also investigated as indicated in figs 7g i s20b d and table s7 pms molecules were more inclined to bind to the surface of vivianite and magnetite in the form of bridge configuration and siderite in the form of top configuration with corresponding eads of 5 307 2 563 and 1 807 ev respectively demonstrating that vivianite possessed the best pms adsorption specialty as a result at the optimal adsorption conformation the farthest oo bond length 3 747 √• inside pms was realized at the vivianite interface compared to magnetite 1 461 √• and siderite 1 47 √• confirming its superior pms activation ability overall vivianite tends to adsorb pms rapidly in the form of a bridge configuration while elongating its oo bond to break exhibiting a strong ability of pms activation 3 4 regeneration of vivianite for pms activation as shown in fig 8 a the removal efficiency of cip decreased from 100 to 19 42 after five cycles in the vivianite pms system meanwhile the proportion of fe ii on the surface of vivianite decreased from 62 8 to 27 5 after 5 cycle experiments fig s21 furthermore as depicted in fig s22 the concentration of dissolved fe ions was in a range of 0 185 to 0 092 mg l in each cycle during the reusability tests only accounting for 0 05 0 12 of the total fe in the vivianite 0 5 g l further confirming an insignificant role of homogeneous activation process in the vivianite pms system the sem images of vivianite after 1 and 5 cycles were similar to the fresh ones suggesting that vivianite had a good structural stability fig s23 additionally as seen in fig 8b 20 mg l cip was almost completely removed at the first bv and maintained more than 95 removal for the next 108 bv with the further extension of the reaction time the cip concentration of the effluent gradually recovered in the effluent of the columns full breakthrough occurred at 300 bv and finally the cip concentration of the effluent stabilized at approximately 18 mg l the above results are understandable due to the consumption of fe ii in vivianite as well as the accumulation of cip degradation intermediates on the vivianite surface as a consequence the regeneration of used vivianite should be taken into account for its practical application it has been reported that the catalytic activity of iron based heterogeneous fenton like catalysts have a positive correlation with the surface fe ii content li et al 2019 therefore the inhibition of the production of reactive oxygen species by fe iii accumulation is an inherent defect of the fe ii pms system to solve this problem the regeneration of surface fe ii is an important way to enhance iron based heterogeneous fenton like catalyst performance as shown in fig 8c the regenerated vivianite after 30 min of hydroxylamine reduction exhibited good catalytic properties to activate pms for cip degradation close to the fresh one in addition the proportion of fe ii on the surface of chemically regenerated vivianite increased from 27 5 to 56 7 fig s24a hydroxylamine nh2oh a common chemical reducing agent was used as the electron donor to rapidly reduce the fe iii in the vivianite to fe ii thereby regenerating the activated pms properties of vivianite li et al 2020 in fe based heterogeneous fenton like systems the reaction of hydroxylamine reduction of fe iii usually follows eq 3 as follows 3 fe iii n h 2 oh fe ii n h 2 o h on the other hand vivianite regenerated using the biological method was able to degrade 73 2 of cip within 10 min while the physical mixing of s onidensis mr 1 and vivianite as well as s onidensis mr 1 alone only resulted in 23 3 and 5 8 cip removal respectively fig s25 meanwhile the proportion of fe ii on the surface of biologically regenerated vivianite increased from 27 5 to 56 7 fig s24b s onidensis mr 1 a representative dissimilatory metal reduction bacterium dmrb widely distributed in anaerobic environments can reduce high valence metals such as fe iii mn iv and cr vi as electron acceptors via oxidation of organic materials fu et al 2016 in fact the biological reduction of fe iii is more widespread compared to the chemical reduction of fe iii under anaerobic conditions in nature meanwhile since vivianite in nature is the bio induced product of the activity of dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria dirb by reducing the fe3 or fe iii minerals it might be more realistic to use s onidensis mr 1 for vivianite regeneration he et al 2022b wu et al 2021 although regenerated vivianite with hydroxylamine reduction had a better performance the biological method with s onidensis mr 1 might be more compatible with the concept of green chemistry 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that vivianite was able to effectively activate pms and degrade pollutants under dark conditions in which the corresponding reaction rate constant of cip degradation was 47 06 and 32 fold higher than that of magnetite and siderite respectively it was found that so4 was the major response for cip degradation in the vivianite pms system although so4 oh fe iv and electron transfer processes were all found moreover theoretical calculation results showed that pms preferred to bind to the fe sites on the surface of vivianite in a bridge position and then was rapidly activated by vivianite in addition the used vivianite could be efficiently regenerated using either hydroxylamine reduction or biological methods with s onidensis mr 1 this study may provide a new potential

14966,the performance and intrinsic mechanism of vivianite a natural mineral containing structural fe ii for peroxymonosulfate pms activation and pollutant degradation under dark conditions were comprehensively explored in this study it was found that vivianite was able to efficiently activate pms to degrade various pharmaceutical pollutants under dark conditions in which the corresponding reaction rate constant of ciprofloxacin cip degradation was 47 and 32 fold higher than that of magnetite and siderite respectively so4 oh fe iv and electron transfer processes were found in the vivianite pms system while so4 was the main contributor to cip degradation moreover mechanistic explorations revealed that the fe site on the surface of vivianite could bind pms in the form of a bridge position and thus vivianite could rapidly activate absorbed pms due to its strong electron donating ability additionally it was illustrated that the used vivianite could be efficiently regenerated by either chemical or biological reduction this study may provide an alternative application of vivianite in addition to phosphorus recovery from wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vivianite peroxymonosulfate pollutant degradation regeneration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as global phosphorus resources become increasingly tight combining nutrient removal from wastewater with phosphorus recovery is considered one of the most promising options egle et al 2015 vivianite an iron ii phosphate mineral is the main form of bound ferrous iron in wastewater wilfert et al 2016 meanwhile it was demonstrated that the efficiency of phosphorus recovery by vivianite crystallization technology was much higher than that of the conventional crystallization process egle et al 2015 in addition the products of phosphorus recovery by vivianite crystallization technology are used in a wide range of applications such as fertilizers pigments and industrial raw materials zhang et al 2021 due to its excellent performance in phosphorus resource recovery efficiency and economic value it has gradually replaced traditional struvite and hydroxyapatite crystalline products and has become a hot spot of attention wu et al 2019 it is worth noting that vivianite as a natural mineral also contains structural fe ii in addition to phosphorus wilfert et al 2015 numerous studies have shown that iron based materials can activate different oxidizing agents such as peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade contaminants in the presence or absence of light for example magnetic co fe nanocomposites derived from ferric sludge was demonstrated as an efficient peroxymonosulfate catalyst for ciprofloxacin degradation under dark conditions zhu et al 2022 while iron doped mos2 was able to enhance pms activation for tetracycline degradation in the presence of visible light li et al 2022 in particular several studies have shown that various fe ii based minerals including fes2 fese2 siderite feco3 and magnetite fe3o4 could activate pms for pollutant degradation in the absence of light chen et al 2020 wang et al 2020 interestingly previous studies demonstrated that the ability to activate pms for the degradation of pollutants with various fe ii based minerals was quite different both fes2 and fese2 were able to effectively activate pms to rapidly remove the pollutants chloramphenicol and bisphenol a from water fang et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 while this ability was much weaker for siderite and magnetite in terms of pollutant degradation feng et al 2018b unfortunately the ability of vivianite for pms activation and pollutant degradation as well as the underlying mechanisms particularly under dark conditions have not been clearly explored only recently vivianite was found to activate peroxodisulfate under the excitation of light to produce active species and degrade antibiotics yi et al 2022 additionally it should be worthwhile to pay attention to how to realize the regeneration of vivianite since the continuous consumption of fe ii would lead to the reduction of the catalytic performance of vivianite for pms activation therefore this study aimed to investigate the ability of vivianite to activate pms and correspondingly degrade various pharmaceutical pollutants including the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin cip under dark conditions elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms by adopting various technologies including synchrotron radiation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy sr ftir and density functional theory dft calculations and finally assess the regeneration feasibility of vivianite using chemical and biological reduction methods in addition the cip degradation performances in terms of active species transformation pathways and toxicity for vivianite pms magnetite pms and siderite pms systems were systemically compared in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals used in this study were analytical reagent grade and their details can be viewed in text s1 of the supporting information si details of the vivianite synthesis method are shown in text s2 2 2 pollutant degradation experiments batch pollutant degradation experiments were conducted using 50 ml reaction suspensions in a 150 ml glass conical bottle sealed with tin foil for cip degradation vivianite was added to each bottle and mixed thoroughly and subsequently pms solution was added to initiate the reaction the initial concentrations of cip pms and vivianite were 10 mg l 0 84 mm and 0 5 g l respectively the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 6 0 and then the reaction bottles were stirred magnetically at 300 rpm under ambient temperatures 25 c for comparison the control experiments were also conducted under similar conditions by adding either vivianite or pms alone additionally the feasibility of the vivianite activated pms process for degrading other pharmaceutical pollutants was also investigated including sulfamethoxazole smx p chlorophenol 4 cp carbamazepine cbz bisphenol a bpa and tetracycline tc furthermore the effects of vivianite dosing ph pms concentration and the presence of different anions cl no3 and co3 2 and humic acid ha were explored and the details are shown in table s1 the effect of real water matrix was carried out by replacing deionized water with tap water or industrial wastewater from local pharmaceutical company hefei anhui respectively and their chemical compositions are shown in table s2 all experiments were conducted in triplicate to exclude the influence of structural phosphate on cip degradation in the vivianite pms system vivianite was replaced by an equal mass concentration of zn3 po4 2 under the same experimental conditions on the other hand to assess the continuous removal of cip by vivianite activated pms in practical applications column experiments in continuous flow systems with a fixed bed column filled with vivianite were performed the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 and the experimental details are displayed in text s3 2 3 vivianite regeneration assessment since fe ii in vivianite would be oxidized to fe iii during pms activation the feasibility of vivianite regeneration using either chemical or biological reduction was investigated hydroxylamine was chosen for chemical vivianite regeneration li et al 2020 first after 5 cycles vivianite was added to the hydroxylamine solution 0 3 mm under an anaerobic atmosphere for 30 min then the precipitate was washed three times with oxygen free water and dried in a vacuum drying oven overnight at 60 c li et al 2019 shewanella onidensis mr 1 as a representative dissimilatory iron reduction bacterium dirb was selected for biological vivianite regeneration wu et al 2021 initially 25 mg vivianite after 5 cycles was added to 100 ml s onidensis mr 1 suspension od600 2 0 0 1 in shocking incubation for 3 days then the precipitate was washed three times with oxygen free water and inactivated using uv irradiation for 30 min finally the precipitate was dried in a vacuum drying oven overnight at 60 c and more details about biological regeneration experiments are displayed in text s4 after regeneration the dried solids were used for cip degradation in which the experimental conditions were the same as those of fresh vivianite 2 4 analytical methods the morphology and structure of the obtained vivianite were characterized using scanning electron microscopy sem sirion 200 fei ltd usa high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem talos f200x fei ltd usa and x ray diffraction xrd ttr iii rigaku japan respectively xps analysis escalab 250 thermo fisher scientific usa was conducted to analyze the surface compositions of vivianite the zeta potential of the suspended vivianite particles was measured by a potential analyzer zeta sizer nano series malvern uk at different time intervals in the degradation experiments a 1 ml aliquot of the reaction suspension was withdrawn and added to methanol 1 ml to quench the reaction and extract the remaining pollutant the resulting suspension was filtered through a 0 22 Œºm mixed cellulose ester mce syringe filter and the first 1 ml was discarded to reduce the error caused by membrane adsorption the pollutant concentration in the filtrate was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 usa with a uv dad detector and more details about the wavelength and mobile phases are displayed in table s3 the intermediates of cip degradation were identified by tripletof 5600 high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms applied biosystems sciex u s a and the detailed analysis procedures are shown in text s5 total organic carbon toc was evaluated by a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany the generation of active species during the reaction was determined by electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker china with dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide and temp 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine as a trapping agent sr ftir was used to identify pms intermediates during its activation by vivianite and the test details are shown in text s5 additionally the analysis procedure of pms concentration is shown in text s6 electrochemical measurements were carried out via an electrochemical workstation bio logic france and the details procedures are described in text s7 2 5 dft calculations the dft calculations included structural optimization and energetic predictions of the interaction between pms and vivianite the interactions between pms and magnetite or siderite were also calculated for comparison dft calculations were performed by employing the cambridge sequential total energy package castep implemented in materials studio using the periodic supercell approach the projector augmented wave paw method and the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe function were adopted to describe electron ion interactions electron electron exchange and correlation energies respectively bl√∂chl 1994 spin polarized calculations were taken into account to accurately obtain the magnetic properties of modules due to the presence of magnetic iron species for geometry optimization the plane wave energy cutoff was set as 600 ev and the k point was determined to be gamma with a self consistent field scf convergence of 1 0 10 6 ev per atom the adsorption energy eads of pms onto different substrates vivianite magnetite and siderite can be defined as 1 e a d s e t o t a l e s u b s t r a t e e m o l e c u l e where etotal esubstrate and emolecule denote the total energy of the substrate with pms substrate and free pms molecule respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 vivianite properties and pollutant degradation performance the sem image showed that vivianite was flower like and composed of platy shaped crystals with an overall size of approximately 10 Œºm fig 1 a the structures of vivianite were inspected by xrd fig 1b the xrd peaks at 2Œ∏ values of 11 9 13 16 18 14 21 8 27 76 and 29 85 matched well with the standard jcpds data pdf 75 1186 for vivianite and moreover no other peaks were observed indicating that pure vivianite was successfully fabricated hrtem was performed to determine the main exposed crystalline surfaces of vivianite no significant lattice stripes were observed in the image since the structure of vivianite had difficulty withstanding the bombardment of high energy electron beams fig 1c as shown in fig 1d selected area electron diffraction saed analysis of the hrtem showed that the main exposed crystal surface of vivianite was 020 which was consistent with a previous study bae et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 a only 9 or 6 2 of cip was removed in the presence of vivianite or pms individually suggesting that both the direct degradation of cip with vivianite or pms were insignificant notably cip was completely removed within three minutes in the presence of 0 5 g l vivianite and 0 84 mm pms the kinetics for cip degradation were well fitted to the pseudo first order reaction with an estimated reaction rate constant k obs value of 1 600 0 072 min 1 fig 2b in addition the toc removal efficiency reached to 42 9 and 81 2 after 10 and 30 min reaction respectively fig s2 noticeably the performance of vivianite exceeded that of almost all reported iron based minerals and many catalysts listed in table s4 zhang et al 2022 for a fairer comparison the performance of two common iron based minerals magnetite and siderite in degrading cip was tested under the same reaction conditions fig s3 and the corresponding k obs values were 0 034 0 004 and 0 050 0 008 min 1 respectively in contrast the k obs value of vivianite was 47 06 and 32 fold higher than those of magnetite and siderite respectively additionally the vivianite activated pms process could effectively remove various pharmaceutical pollutants both smx and tc were selected as representatives of antibiotic compounds cbz and bpa as endocrine disrupting ones and 4 cp as phenolic one as shown in fig 2c and 2d 100 of smx cbz bpa tc and 79 of 4 cp were degraded within 10 min in the vivianite pms system in which the corresponding kobs values were 0 512 0 011 0 261 0 002 0 371 0 01 0 481 0 007 and 0 206 0 002 min 1 respectively complete degradation of 4 cp was also achieved by extending the reaction time to 20 min in addition the toc removal efficiencies corresponding to these pollutants reached to 52 1 36 4 47 2 49 2 and 46 1 within 1 h respectively fig s4 as shown in fig 3 a the k obs value of cip degradation remarkably improved from 0 311 to 1 600 min 1 as the vivianite loading increased from 0 25 to 0 5 g l while a limited increase in k obs from 1 600 to 1 751 min 1 was observed when the vivianite loading further increased to 1 g l this might be due to the limited pms restricted free radical production and contaminant removal at a high vivianite dosing the k obs value of cip degradation increased from 0 303 to 1 600 min 1 with increasing pms concentration from 0 42 to 0 84 mm while it was reduced to 0 582 min 1 when further increasing the pms concentration to 1 68 mm fig 3b as shown in fig 3c and s5a although the k obs value of cip degradation decreased from 1 600 min 1 to 0 673 and 0 521 min 1 under acidic ph 3 0 and alkaline ph 9 0 conditions respectively cip was still completely removed within 5 min in addition the solution ph decreased from initial value of 3 06 6 05 and 9 02 to 2 67 4 16 and 8 69 after 10 min of reaction respectively fig s5b this might be attributed to not only organic acids produced by cip degradation but also proton generation during the oxidation of water molecules by sulfate radicals du et al 2016 duan et al 2016 the zeta potential values of the vivianite at different phs were measured as shown in fig s6 the surface of vivianite was positively charged when ph was less than 4 0 and changed to negative when ph was higher than 5 0 in which the phpzc of the vivianite surface was calculated as 4 3 since pms is negatively charged at ph less than 9 4 the adsorption of pms on the surface of vivianite would be unfavorable at ph 6 0 and 9 0 additionally the hydrogen bond formed between h and the oo group of hso5 would play an important role at ph 3 0 attaching a positive charge to hso5 and eventually hindering its interaction with the positively charged vivianite surface li et al 2019 nevertheless cip is positively charged at ph 3 0 and 6 0 while negative charged at ph 9 0 suggesting that ph at 6 0 would be favorable for cip adsorption on the surface of vivianite this may be one of major reasons that cip degradation was not conducive to either over acid or over base conditions in the vivianite pms system patel et al 2021 as shown in figs 3d and s7a the corresponding k obs value of cip degradation decreased from 1 600 min 1 in the absence of ha to 0 663 and 0 282 min 1 in the presence of 1 and 10 mg l ha respectively both the reduction of dissolved organic carbon doc and hrtem images of vivianite after the reaction suggested the adsorption of ha onto the surface of vivianite figs s7b and s7c the adsorbed ha could bind with fe ii on the surface of vivianite resulting in the inhibition of pms activation fig s7d and consequently reduction of free radical formation yang et al 2021 which confirmed by epr spectra fig s7e additionally ha contains a large number of electron sites that can react rapidly with attracting electrophilic so4 and oh with the result that the competition for reactive oxygen species in solution led to a decrease in pollutant degradation efficiency xie et al 2015 furthermore the effects of different anions cl no3 and co3 2 on cip degradation in the vivianite pms system were evaluated as shown in fig s8a s8c the presence of both cl and no3 had slightly effects on cip degradation in the vivianite pms system however the corresponding k obs value of cip degradation decreased from 1 600 min 1 in the absence of co3 2 to 1 000 and 0 609 min 1 in the presence of 1 and 10 mm co3 2 respectively which might be due to the strong competition between co3 2 and cip for oh sasi et al 2015 nevertheless it should be noted that the vivianite pms system was able to completely degrade 10 mg l cip within 5 min even in the presence of 10 mm co3 2 additionally the cip degradation performance of vivianite pms system in real waters was also evaluated as shown in fig s8d the corresponding k obs value of cip degradation slightly decreased from 1 600 to 1 515 min 1 when deionized water control was replaced with tap water however the k obs value of cip degradation reduced to 0 748 min 1 for an industrial wastewater which might be due to high concentrations of co3 2 and toc in the industrial wastewater table s2 3 2 reactive species and possible cip degradation pathways to explore the mechanism of pms activation by vivianite for cip degradation under dark conditions epr spectroscopy was initially adopted to identify the dominant radicals as shown in fig 4 a and 4b obvious signals of the dmpo so4 and dmpo oh adducts were detected in the epr spectrum suggesting that both so4 and oh were generated in the vivianite pms system fang et al 2013 in addition the intensity of the dmpo so4 adduct signal was much lower than that of the dmpo oh signal which can be attributed to the unstable dmpo so4 transforming to dmpo oh feng et al 2018a the intensity of the signals increased significantly as the reaction time was extended from 1 to 10 min and gradually stabilized after 10 min which indicated that so4 and oh could be produced rapidly and exist stably in the vivianite pms system meanwhile the peak intensities of the epr signals increased approximately 3 4 fold as the pms concentration increased from 0 42 to 1 68 mm suggesting that increasing the pms concentration favored so4 and oh formation however although the intensity of the signal peaks in the epr spectra increased with increasing pms concentration from 0 84 to 1 68 mm the corresponding k obs of cip degradation decreased interestingly a similar phenomenon was also observed in the fese2 pms system fang et al 2020 this might attribute to the attack of excess radicals on the iron based heterogeneous catalyst surface which in turn passivates the catalyst surface and then hinders the adsorption of contaminants and further activation of pms thus reducing the kobs value of cip degradation on the other hand self scavenging between excess radicals could also lead to a decrease in the rate of cip degradation lai et al 2021 free radical quenching studies were used to distinguish the contribution of different free radicals to the degradation of cip in the vivianite pms system tba for oh and meoh for both oh and so4 were added as effective quenching reagents zhou et al 2018 fig 4c shows that the degradation efficiency of cip decreased from 100 to 86 7 and 26 5 with the addition of tba and meoh respectively implying that so4 might be the more important radical compared to oh accounting for cip degradation in the vivianite pms system in addition although a weak dmpoo2 signal was observed in the epr spectra fig s9a the addition of p benzoquinone p bq a quencher for o2 had a slight effect on the degradation of cip in the vivianite pms system fig s9c suggesting that o2 did not majorly contribute to cip degradation in the vivianite pms system which might be due to its weaker oxidative properties zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that electron transfer processes etp singlet oxygenation and high valent metal induced oxidation were mainstream non radical pathways for the persulfate based system additionally high valent species such as fe iv could be generated during the activation of pms by fe ii according to eq 2 for pollutant degradation via electron transfer dong et al 2020 methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso is considered a probe compound for fe iv because it can be oxidized by fe iv to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 and the yield of pmso2 pmso2 pmso can reflect the contribution of fe iv wang et al 2018 as shown in fig 4d the yield of pmso2 was only 9 after reacting for 10 min indicating a low contribution of fe iv to pollutant degradation in the vivianite pms system 2 fe ii hso 5 fe iv o so 4 2 h singlet oxygen 1o2 is another common active species as shown in fig s9b there was an insignificant enhancement of the signal of temp 1o2 in the vivianite pms system compared to temp alone in the epr spectra moreover the addition of l histidine had a negligible impact on cip degradation fig s9c above results clearly implied that the generation of 1o2 was negligible in the vivianite pms system indeed electron transfer processes etp is another common nonradical pathway in the persulfate based system chronoamperometry can provide a direct evidence to confirm the etp mechanism ren et al 2022 as shown in fig s9d upon the addition of pms and cip a negative and a positive current signal could be instantly aroused respectively justifying the electron transfer pathway between cip electron supplier and activated pms electron withdrawer when they were co existed on the catalyst surface yang et al 2020 however the contribution of etp to cip degradation was limited since quenching experiments showed that both oh and so4 contributed more than 75 to cip degradation in the vivianite pms system fig 4c for comparison the active species of cip degradation in magnetite pms and siderite pms systems were identified fig s10 similar with that in the vivianite pms system oh so4 and o2 were found for cip degradation in the magnetite pms and siderite pms systems with so4 being the major contributor in addition the generation of 1o2 was negligible in three systems however we did not find fe iv and etp for cip degradation in the magnetite pms and siderite pms systems while both of them had impacts to a certain extent for cip degradation in the vivianite pms system to explore the possible reaction pathways of cip degradation in the vivianite pms system the oxidation intermediates and products were analyzed by using lc ms ms as shown in fig s11 a 11 l eleven main intermediates of cip degradation were detected and are summarized in table s5 since radicals were the main reactive species intermediates might be formed via hydroxylation and cleavage of the piperazine ring cn bonds cyclopropyl and carboxyl groups and possible cip degradation pathways in the vivianite pms system were proposed fig 5 in the p1 pathway the amine n on the piperazine ring is likely be attacked by so4 via electron transfer mechanism neta et al 1977 initially the piperazine ring attacked by so4 opened and produced dialdehyde derivative a m z 361 11 an m z 361 11 was gradually converted to b m z 333 11 by the removal of one formaldehyde in the open piperazine ring and then transformed into c m z 305 12 through the loss of the second formaldehyde c m z 305 12 could be further oxidized to d m z 262 08 by the loss of secondary amine nitrogen this route agrees with a previous study showing that the piperazine ring of cip was the most reactive site toward so4 attack jiang et al 2016 pathway p2 was initiated by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring oxidation of the cyclopropane moiety of cip led to ring opening resulting in the form e m z 335 09 both d m z 262 08 and e m z 335 09 could be further attacked by so4 and oh to generate f m z 206 03 in pathway p3 oxidization of the core quinolone structure by oh forms g m z 337 13 followed by stepwise oxidation to form h m z 363 12 and i m z 307 13 pathway p4 was called kolbe decarboxylation where the electron was transferred from the carboxyl group in j m z 314 13 to an so4 then converted into k m z 288 15 by loss of coo structure hori et al 2004 finally radicals continuously attack the intermediate products to form small molecular products and ultimately inorganic products co2 and h2o as supported by the reduction in toc concentration fig s4 meanwhile the cip degradation pathways in magnetite pms and siderite pms systems were analyzed while eleven intermediates a to k of cip degradation were found in the vivianite pms system only five intermediates were identified in the magnetite pms system a b c d g fig s12 and siderite pms system a b c e and g fig s13 respectively according to these intermediates we proposed two p1 and p3 in fig s14 and three pathways p1 p2 and p3 in fig s15 for cip degradation in the magnetite pms and siderite pms systems figs s14 and s15 respectively the acute toxicity lc50 fathead minnow 96 h daphnia magna lc50 48 h and developmental toxicity of cip and their degradation intermediates in the three systems were assessed by toxicity estimation software t e s t based on quantitative structure activity relationship qsar prediction yin et al 2020 as shown in fig s16 the solution toxicity of all three systems reduced while more intermediates of cip degradation with reduced toxicity or even not harmful were observed in the vivianite pms system additionally the mineralization rate of cip in vivianite pms system was remarkably faster than those in magnetite pms and siderite pms ones fig s17 which may facilitate the reduction of environmental risks for vivianite pms system 3 3 intrinsic mechanisms of pms activation by vivianite as shown in table s6 the dissolved fe concentration was only 0 185 mg l within 10 min in the presence of 0 5 g l vivianite at this fe2 concentration only 7 3 of the cip was removed after 10 min reaction in the fe2 pms system fig s18 indicating an insignificant role of homogeneous activation process for pollutant degradation in the vivianite pms system additionally dissolved phosphate was also undetectable in the solution suggesting its negligible role in pms activation in the vivianite pms system as dissolved phosphate was shown to be able to accelerate the generation of so4 and the degradation of contaminants in the pms activation system duan et al 2021 to further determine whether the structural phosphate in vivianite can activate pms zn3 po4 2 was selected as the source of structural phosphate since zn ii cannot activate pms to produce free radicals fig 6 a shows that the degradation efficiency of cip in the zn3 po4 2 pms system was only marginally enhanced by 2 compared to physical adsorption suggesting that the structural phosphate was unable to activate pms to promote the degradation of cip furthermore due to the strong coordination ligand effect between fe and certain ligands both kscn and a 1 10 phenanthroline quencher were used to evaluate the activation of pms by structural fe ii on vivianite hu et al 2021 as shown in fig 6b the degradation efficiency of cip decreased from 100 to 7 2 and 5 7 in the presence of 50 mm kscn and 1 10 phenanthroline respectively additionally the proportions of fe ii and fe iii on the surface of fresh vivianite were 62 8 and 37 2 while they changed to 40 1 and 59 9 after the reaction with pms fig 6c and 6d these results suggested that structural fe ii in vivianite would primarily contribute to the activation of pms for cip degradation to explore why vivianite had a better ability for pms activation than siderite and magnetite in situ sr ftir was carried out in this study according to the previous literature the peaks centered at 1100 and 1250 cm 1 can be associated with the symmetric stretching vibration mode of s o bonds in so4 2 and adsorbed pms hso5 respectively fan et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 a 7c the signal of hso5 rapidly emerged and maintained a stronger signal at a long time in the vivianite pms system compared to the siderite pms and magnetite pms systems indicating the fast balance between consumption and adsorption of pms on the vivianite surface meanwhile the simultaneous appearance and continuous accumulation of so4 2 implied that vivianite could more rapidly activate the adsorbed pms than siderite and magnetite this conclusion was further supported by the variation in pms concentration in the three systems as shown in fig s19 71 9 of pms was decomposed within 10 min while only 11 3 and 9 3 were decomposed for siderite and magnetite respectively we subsequently gain insight into the internal causes of the excellent performance of vivianite based on the results of dft calculations figs 7d e and s7a e shows the optimized geometries of pms vivianite magnetite and siderite respectively first the work function as a descriptor was calculated to describe the electron donating ability of vivianite magnetite and siderite as shown in fig 7f the work function value of vivianite 2 26 ev was lower than those of magnetite 5 00 ev and siderite 3 97 ev suggesting the stronger electron donating ability of vivianite which would be beneficial for pms activation he et al 2022a furthermore the interactions between pms and vivianite magnetite and siderite were also investigated as indicated in figs 7g i s20b d and table s7 pms molecules were more inclined to bind to the surface of vivianite and magnetite in the form of bridge configuration and siderite in the form of top configuration with corresponding eads of 5 307 2 563 and 1 807 ev respectively demonstrating that vivianite possessed the best pms adsorption specialty as a result at the optimal adsorption conformation the farthest oo bond length 3 747 √• inside pms was realized at the vivianite interface compared to magnetite 1 461 √• and siderite 1 47 √• confirming its superior pms activation ability overall vivianite tends to adsorb pms rapidly in the form of a bridge configuration while elongating its oo bond to break exhibiting a strong ability of pms activation 3 4 regeneration of vivianite for pms activation as shown in fig 8 a the removal efficiency of cip decreased from 100 to 19 42 after five cycles in the vivianite pms system meanwhile the proportion of fe ii on the surface of vivianite decreased from 62 8 to 27 5 after 5 cycle experiments fig s21 furthermore as depicted in fig s22 the concentration of dissolved fe ions was in a range of 0 185 to 0 092 mg l in each cycle during the reusability tests only accounting for 0 05 0 12 of the total fe in the vivianite 0 5 g l further confirming an insignificant role of homogeneous activation process in the vivianite pms system the sem images of vivianite after 1 and 5 cycles were similar to the fresh ones suggesting that vivianite had a good structural stability fig s23 additionally as seen in fig 8b 20 mg l cip was almost completely removed at the first bv and maintained more than 95 removal for the next 108 bv with the further extension of the reaction time the cip concentration of the effluent gradually recovered in the effluent of the columns full breakthrough occurred at 300 bv and finally the cip concentration of the effluent stabilized at approximately 18 mg l the above results are understandable due to the consumption of fe ii in vivianite as well as the accumulation of cip degradation intermediates on the vivianite surface as a consequence the regeneration of used vivianite should be taken into account for its practical application it has been reported that the catalytic activity of iron based heterogeneous fenton like catalysts have a positive correlation with the surface fe ii content li et al 2019 therefore the inhibition of the production of reactive oxygen species by fe iii accumulation is an inherent defect of the fe ii pms system to solve this problem the regeneration of surface fe ii is an important way to enhance iron based heterogeneous fenton like catalyst performance as shown in fig 8c the regenerated vivianite after 30 min of hydroxylamine reduction exhibited good catalytic properties to activate pms for cip degradation close to the fresh one in addition the proportion of fe ii on the surface of chemically regenerated vivianite increased from 27 5 to 56 7 fig s24a hydroxylamine nh2oh a common chemical reducing agent was used as the electron donor to rapidly reduce the fe iii in the vivianite to fe ii thereby regenerating the activated pms properties of vivianite li et al 2020 in fe based heterogeneous fenton like systems the reaction of hydroxylamine reduction of fe iii usually follows eq 3 as follows 3 fe iii n h 2 oh fe ii n h 2 o h on the other hand vivianite regenerated using the biological method was able to degrade 73 2 of cip within 10 min while the physical mixing of s onidensis mr 1 and vivianite as well as s onidensis mr 1 alone only resulted in 23 3 and 5 8 cip removal respectively fig s25 meanwhile the proportion of fe ii on the surface of biologically regenerated vivianite increased from 27 5 to 56 7 fig s24b s onidensis mr 1 a representative dissimilatory metal reduction bacterium dmrb widely distributed in anaerobic environments can reduce high valence metals such as fe iii mn iv and cr vi as electron acceptors via oxidation of organic materials fu et al 2016 in fact the biological reduction of fe iii is more widespread compared to the chemical reduction of fe iii under anaerobic conditions in nature meanwhile since vivianite in nature is the bio induced product of the activity of dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria dirb by reducing the fe3 or fe iii minerals it might be more realistic to use s onidensis mr 1 for vivianite regeneration he et al 2022b wu et al 2021 although regenerated vivianite with hydroxylamine reduction had a better performance the biological method with s onidensis mr 1 might be more compatible with the concept of green chemistry 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that vivianite was able to effectively activate pms and degrade pollutants under dark conditions in which the corresponding reaction rate constant of cip degradation was 47 06 and 32 fold higher than that of magnetite and siderite respectively it was found that so4 was the major response for cip degradation in the vivianite pms system although so4 oh fe iv and electron transfer processes were all found moreover theoretical calculation results showed that pms preferred to bind to the fe sites on the surface of vivianite in a bridge position and then was rapidly activated by vivianite in addition the used vivianite could be efficiently regenerated using either hydroxylamine reduction or biological methods with s onidensis mr 1 this study may provide a new potential

water is more difficult to treat for reinjection compared with normal produced water because of the presence of residual hydrolyzed polyacrylamide hpam a novel cathode membrane integrated electro hybrid ozonation coagulation cm e hoc process was proposed for the treatment of polymer flooding produced water this process achieved in situ self cleaning by generated microbubbles in the cathode membrane the cm e hoc process achieved a higher suspended solid ss turbidity and pam removal efficiency than the cm ec process the ss in the cm e hoc effluent was 20 mg l ss which met the reinjection requirements of longdong changqing oilfield china q sycq 08 011 2019 at different current densities 3 5 and 10 ma cm2 the cm e hoc process greatly mitigated both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling therefore excellent flux recovery was obtained at different in situ self cleaning intervals during the cm e hoc process furthermore alternating filtration achieved continuous water production during the cm e hoc process on one hand the effective removal of aromatic protein like substances and an increase in oxygen containing functional groups were achieved due to the enhanced oxidation ability of the cm e hoc process which decreased membrane fouling on the other hand the cm e hoc process showed improved coagulation performance because of the increased oxygen containing functional groups and polymeric fe species therefore larger flocs with higher fractal dimensions were generated and a looser and more porous cake layer was formed on the membrane surface during the cm e hoc process consequently the cm e hoc process exhibited better in situ self cleaning performance and lower filtration resistance than the cm ec process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cathode membrane in situ self cleaning membrane fouling polymer flooding produced water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is injected during the secondary oil recovery second stage of oil exploitation to maintain reservoir pressure this results in enormous amounts of produced water after oil water separation which is a combination of formation water injected water organic and inorganic compounds wu et al 2019 many oilfields have entered the middle and late stage of exploitation and multiple technologies for tertiary oil recovery third stage of oil exploitation using chemicals have been developed to improve oil production li et al 2015 polymer flooding is a tertiary oil recovery method in which the polymer is added to injected water to increase the fluid viscosity and sweep efficiency the most popular polymers for this process is hydrolyzed polyacrylamide hpam al sabahi et al 2018 as a result the polymer flooding produced water contains not only crude oil minerals and bacteria but also residual hpam which is more difficult to treat for reinjection compared with normal produced water zhang et al 2015 for produced water reinjection suspended solids ss are strictly regulated to avoid clogging the reinjection well ghafoori et al 2022 coagulation based processes are widely used for the treatment of produced water such as chemical coagulation electro coagulation ec and flotation ghafoori et al 2022 ec is one of the best alternatives for produced water treatment due to its low cost simple operation minimal chemical usage high degree of integration and favorable separation performance madhavan and antony 2021 additionally favorable oil organic matter turbidity and suspended solid removal efficiency of produced water can be achieved using ec processes ammar and akbar 2018 sardari et al 2018 nevertheless much higher stability of polymer flooding produced water can be obtained because of the existence of residual pam li et al 2021 a negatively charged surface can be formed due to the charged carboxyl group coo on the hpam molecular chain dissociation in solution in addition an organic coating around the negatively charged particles can be formed because of the solvation of coo groups which significantly enhanced the stability of polymer flooding produced water he et al 2016 therefore the commonly used ec process was inefficient for polymer flooding produced water treatment ricceri et al 2022 ozonation processes are widely used to promote the removal efficiency of subsequent coagulation xie et al 2016 pre ozonation can cleave the bonds between particles and adsorbed organics and reduces the molecular weight of organics which results in the desorption of stabilized organic coatings and the reduction of steric effects and electrostatic barrier xie et al 2013 to improve the organic removal performance and convenience of operation our previous studies proposed the electro hybrid ozonation coagulation e hoc process in which ozonation and electrocoagulation simultaneously occurred in one reactor jin et al 2020 jin et al 2021a both the oxidation and coagulation ability were improved due to the enhanced generation of oh and polymeric hydrolyzed coagulant species jin et al 2021a nevertheless most of the oil and gas fields in northern china are ultra low or low permeability oil and gas fields which have very strict requirements for the reinjection water quality low pressure membrane processes such as microfiltration and ultrafiltration can remove particulate substances and some fraction of organic compounds making them suitable for the treatment of produced water liu et al 2022 xiong et al 2016 membrane fouling is a major challenge during the produced water treatment liu et al 2022 both ozonation and ec are effective ways to alleviate membrane fouling hua et al 2015 tang et al 2018 therefore the e hoc and membrane filtration can be integrated to form a compact system to enhance the treatment performance of polymer flooding produced water previous studies applied a conductive membrane as the cathode to achieve self cleaning using generated microbubbles on the membrane surface during electrolysis abid et al 2017 hashaikeh et al 2014 xu et al 2021 this provided a non destructive energy efficient and affordable membrane fouling alleviation method therefore the e hoc and cathodic conductive membrane filtration can be combined to explore the removal and membrane fouling mitigation performance during polymer flooding produced water treatment in this study to enhance the reinjected water quality for the treatment of polymer flooding produced water a novel cathode membrane integrated e hoc cm e hoc process was proposed the removal performance of the cm e hoc process was tested at different operational conditions in addition the self cleaning and membrane fouling mitigation performance were also investigated under different operational conditions the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism was analyzed in terms of organic transformations in the cm e hoc reactor and fouling layer characterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water the polymer flooding produced water was collected from the longdong changqing oilfield china the pam suspended solid ss petroleum chemical oxygen demand cod ph and turbidity were 30 2 58 mg l 120 15 mg l 25 1 62 mg l 1256 53 mg l 7 78 0 20 and 85 5 26 ntu respectively 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup of cm e hoc reactor with treatment capacity of 1 44 l h is illustrated in fig 1 there were two identical self made cathode membrane modules in one cm e hoc reactor alternate operation of the two membrane modules was achieved and continuous filtrated water production can be obtained in the cm e hoc reactor a detailed description of the reactor is provided in text s1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analysis suspended solid ss chemical oxygen demand cod and turbidity were measured according to the standard method nepa 2002 pam concentration was measured using the iodine starch method zhang et al 2022 2 3 2 fe concentration and species detection the total fe concentration was measured using the phenanthroline colorimetric method nepa 2002 ferron colorimetric method was used to analyze fe species distributions based on our previous studies jin et al 2020 jin et al 2021a 2 3 3 zeta potential analysis a laser zeta potential analyzer malvern zetasizer nano zs90 uk was applied for zeta potential analysis the samples were collected 3 cm below the top of the reactor and measured immediately to avoid zeta potential variations 2 3 4 particle size distribution analysis the particle size distribution of the fouling layer was analyzed according to our previous study jin et al 2019 using a particle size distribution analyzer sync microtrac mrb usa 2 3 5 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the samples were obtained by freeze drying the effluent and insoluble flocs by air drying the samples were analyzed using a k alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo fisher scientific uk and an ft ir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific uk 2 3 6 excitation emission matrix eem analysis the water sample was filtrated through a membrane with a pore size of 0 45 Œºm before detection eem spectra were obtained using a spectrofluorometer f 7000 hitachi japan 2 3 7 membrane fouling resistance the resistance distribution of membrane fouling was determined according to a previous study sun et al 2020 firstly pure water was filtered by the membrane to obtain the initial flux j 0 then the flux of the membrane filtering treated water for 20 min was determined to be j 1 finally after 20 min of self cleaning another pure water flux was obtained as j 2 the obtained flux data were calculated as follows eqs 1 3 1 total fouling ratio r t j 0 j 1 j 0 100 2 reversible fouling ratio r r j 2 j 1 j 0 100 3 irreversible fouling ratio r ir r t r r 2 3 8 two dimensional fraction dimension and oh detection the two dimension fractal dimension of the flocs generated in the reactor was calculated according to chen et al 2022 a bruker emxmicro spectrometer germany was used to conduct the electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr experiments at room temperature for the oh detection according to a previous study jin et al 2021b 2 3 9 scanning electric microscopy sem analysis the membrane after drying was used to observe the morphology specially the membrane surface was pretreated by spraying gold owing to the poor conductivity of ptfe membrane the result was obtained through a field emission scanning electron microscopy gemini sem 300 zeiss germany 2 4 statistical analysis the cm e hoc experiments were performed in triplicate for averaged results and the results are presented as the mean values with standard deviations 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance the removal performance of the cm e hoc process for the treatment of polymer flooding produced water is shown in fig 2 cod removal efficiency at different current densities and ozone dosages is shown in fig 2a cod removal efficiency increased with the increasing current densities from 0 to 5 ma cm2 the cm ec process the cm e hoc process without ozone achieved 63 8 cod removal efficiency at a current density of 5 ma cm2 furthermore favorable pam removal was also obtained at a current density of 5 ma cm2 in the cm ec process fig 2b previous studies also reported that 60 cod removal efficiency could be achieved by using the ec process with either al or fe anodes al malack and al nowaiser 2018 zhao et al 2014 however a lower ss and turbidity removal efficiency were obtained upon increasing current density fig 2c and d which can be attributed to the higher residual fe in the permeate fig 3 only around 50 8 ss and 85 0 turbidity removal efficiency were achieved at current density 5 ma cm2 even after membrane filtration it cannot meet the reinjection requirements of ss 30 mg l q sycq 08011 2019 because the ph of the permeate was higher than 7 5 fig s1 the residual dissolved fe in the permeate can generate fe oh 3 sediments that deteriorated the effluent water quality previous studies have reported that a high current density produced more concentration of fe2 ions than needed and directly impacted the residual fe concentration in ec treated water das and nandi 2019 mohora et al 2018 which cannot be easily removed by microfiltration or ultrafiltration yu et al 2013 the ss and turbidity removal efficiency increased significantly using the cm e hoc process which indicated that ozonation greatly improved the separation performance even at the lowest ozone dosage the effluent can meet the requirement of ss 30 mg l fig 2c the pam ss and turbidity removal efficiency increased with the increasing ozone dosages from 0 1 to 0 2 mg o3 mg cod correspondingly the residual fe decreased upon increasing ozone dosages according to fig 3 this in turn proved that the increase in ss and turbidity with the increasing current density in the permeate of the cm ec process was caused by excessive residual fe the favorable residual fe reduction performance was ascribed to the enhanced coagulation ability of the cm e hoc process for the generation of larger flocs which can be more easily removed by membrane filtration in addition fig s2 exhibits that the floc size in the cm e hoc process was larger than that in the cm ec process previous studies have also indicated that in situ ozonation with coagulation using ferric metal coagulants can facilitate the floc size increase asif et al 2021 tang et al 2018 liu et al 2007 reported that floc formation was assisted by ozonation because organic matter adsorbed on aquatic particles was desorbed or decomposed by ozone yin et al 2021 also achieved lower residual fe during the treatment of bsa when using ozonation as pretreatment to enhance the coagulation compared with coagulation only it was also found that the coagulation mechanism exhibited an important effect on residual coagulant control and residual coagulant in the microfiltration permeate can be well controlled by charge neutralization but it increased significantly under sweep floc conditions lee et al 2000 fig s3 shows that the zeta potential was always higher in the cm e hoc process than that in the cm ec process at different current densities oxidation can increase the opportunity for particle collisions and coagulation due to the decreased negative charge density of organic matter xie et al 2016 therefore charge neutralization was more likely to occur in the cm e hoc process and a lower residual fe in the permeate can be expected 3 2 flux developments and in situ self cleaning performance fig 4 shows the flux curves during the operation of the cm e hoc process at different current densities and ozone dosages a very low normalized flux was obtained for the cm e hoc process without an applied current indicating severe membrane fouling fig 4a it can be implied that adsorption or clogging of particles may played an important role in the severe membrane fouling because small particular contaminants cannot be removed by ozonation only the normalized flux increased significantly even for the cm ec process at the lowest current density of 3 ma cm2 fig 4b this was ascribed to the removal of particles or colloidal organic foulants and the generation of a cake layer with a lower hydraulic resistance on the membrane surface using the ec process ben sasson and adin 2010 hua et al 2015 however upon increasing the current density the flux exhibited only slight variations for the cm ec process in general a much higher flux was obtained at current densities of 3 5 and 10 ma cm2 in the cm e hoc reactor the lower tendency of the hydrophilic reaction products to adsorb on membrane surfaces is a crucial reason for the higher the membrane flux after ozone oxidation van geluwe et al 2011 in addition a similar flux was obtained at ozone dosages of 0 2 and 0 4 mg o3 mg cod which were both higher than that obtained at an ozone dosage of 0 1 mg o3 mg cod with different current densities using the cm e hoc process the normalized flux was much higher in the cm e hoc process at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 fig 4c and d than that at a current density of 3 ma cm2 fig 4b furthermore a limited flux difference was found between current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 for the cm e hoc proces the higher current density led to the more rapid deposition of a floc layer which prevented foulants from blocking the inner pores of the membrane resulting in a reduction in membrane fouling xu et al 2021 yang et al 2015 however as the current density further increased the deposition rate of the floc layer changed slightly which led to little difference in the final steady state flux yang et al 2015 therefore an ozone dosage of 0 2 mg o3 mg cod and a current density of 5 ma cm2 were selected as the optimal operating conditions for the cm e hoc process in the following sections the effect of self cleaning time intervals on the backwash performance was analyzed in this study and the results can be seen in fig 5 except for the self cleaning time interval of 180 min excellent backwashing performance was obtained at different self cleaning time intervals this may be attributed to the synergistic effects between ozonation and electrocoagulation soe which simultaneously enhanced the oh generation and polymeric hydrolyzed coagulant species jin et al 2020 jin et al 2021a however a slightly lower flux recovery was observed at the self cleaning time interval of 180 min in contrast deteriorative in situ self cleaning performance was obtained during the cm ec process fig s4 during the self cleaning of the cathode membrane gas bubbles formed on the membrane surface and began to escape the surface by moving up and sweep away the foulant layer anis et al 2021 lalia et al 2015 the bubbles generated at the surface of conductive membrane also acted as a physical barrier that could mitigate foulant deposition at the membrane surface during filtration wu et al 2008 electrical repulsion could force negatively charged foulants away from the cathode membrane which also assisted with fouling mitigation during fouling layer formation sun et al 2020 other studies have implied that ozone and generated reactive oxygen species can react with the large organic foulants that block pores into small molecules helping recover water flux li et al 2022 sun et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 the gradually deteriorating flux after self cleaning at 180 min interval was probably attributed to a dense foulant layer on the surface during pro longed filtration therefore it was more difficult to remove from the membrane surface than the loose deposited fouling layers abid et al 2017 hashaikeh et al 2014 fig 6 shows the membrane resistance distribution at different current densities during the cm ec and cm e hoc process the fouling resistance can be divided into reversible and irreversible fouling resistance based on the cleaning procedure sun et al 2020 reversible fouling was mostly caused by external fouling because of the accumulation of foulants on the membrane i e complete blocking and intermediate blocking and the cake gel layer i e cake fouling formed on the membrane surface that can be easily eliminated by hydraulic cleaning chang et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 irreversible fouling can be ascribed to the blockage by foulants inside membrane pores and the strong adsorption of foulants on the membrane pores and surface lu et al 2016 according to fig 6 reversible fouling played the main role in membrane fouling both for the cm ec and cm e hoc processes in contrast to membrane fouling due to the infiltration of colloidal particles into the pores of the membrane without coagulation membrane fouling proceeded according to the classical cake filtration model which is mainly reversible fouling al malack et al 2004 in addition a much lower reversible and irreversible fouling ratio was obtained for the cm e hoc process than for the cm ec process at different current densities in general the cm e hoc processes exhibited much lower reversible fouling ratio 29 9 than the cm ec process 68 5 at a current density of 5 ma cm2 in addition the irreversible fouling ratio further decreased to 6 1 for the cm e hoc process fig 6b which can explain the excellent in situ self cleaning performance by generated gas bubbles fig 5 for the cm e hoc process it was reported that all reversible fouling can be removed by self cleaning via bubble generation at cathode lee et al 2022 a previous study also indicated that both hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling resistance exhibited significant decrease when integrating in situ ozonation with fe coagulation for membrane fouling mitigation tang et al 2018 according to xing et al 2019 significant reduction of irreversible resistance of uf membrane was achieved by fe ii uv chlorine pre treatment due to the coupled role between oxidation and coagulation therefore for the cm e hoc process the soe effects may have played an important role in alleviating membrane fouling our previous studies found that enhanced oh generation was achieved because ozone was catalyzed by electro generated hydrolyzed metal coagulants due to the interactions between ozone and surface hydroxyl groups of the coagulants jin et al 2020 2021a fig s5 indicates a higher oh generation for the cm e hoc process than the cm ec process and ozonation alone compared with a current density of 3 ma cm2 the total fouling ratio of the cm e hoc process decreased significantly at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 which indicated an improved oxidation ability and was consistent with the results in fig 5 at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 little difference can be observed between the total fouling ratio of the cm e hoc process 3 3 characterization of dissolved organic matters within the cm e hoc reactor to analyze the different fouling behaviors between cm ec and cm e hoc processes eems were applied to characterize dom according to fig 7 three notable fluorescent peaks ex em 220 300 nm ex em 230 340 nm and ex em 280 340 nm were observed in the polymer flooding produced water i e the cm ec without an applied current fig 7a the fluorescent peak at ex em 220 300 nm represented tyrosine like substances and the peaks ex em 230 340 nm and ex em 280 340 nm represented tryptophan like substances coble 1996 liu et al 2011 these peaks indicated that the fluorescent organic matter in the polymer flooding produced water mainly consisted of aromatic protein like substances song et al 2020 indicated that protein like substances were the main component responsible for reversible membrane fouling and humic like substances were the main components for irreversible membrane fouling this also proves that reversible fouling played a major role in membrane fouling both for the cm ec and cm e hoc processes the cm ec process can effectively remove tryptophan like substances at current densities higher than 5 ma cm2 however there was still serious membrane fouling for the cm ec process at current densities of 5 ma cm2 and 10 ma cm2 according to figs 4 and 6 which indicated that residual tyrosine like substances may be responsible for membrane fouling previous study also suggested that tyrosine containing proteins had significant fouling potential henderson et al 2011 however for the cm e hoc process the aromatic protein like substances including tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances were effectively removed due to the addition of ozone which helped alleviate the membrane fouling figs 5 and 7 xps was also applied to analyze the dissolved organic matter changes during the cm ec and cm e hoc processes at different current densities fig 8 the c1s high resolution spectra with gaussian fitting are shown in fig s6 four types of chemical binding signals were observed in fig s6 which were ascribed to carboxylic carbon oco ketonic carbon co aliphatic carbon cc and aromatic carbon cc jin et al 2016 lin et al 2014 the raw water i e the permeate of the cm ec process without an applied current density had a high ratio of aromatic and aliphatic carbon which is consistent with previous studies beyer et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the aromatic carbon species decreased with the increasing current density for the cm ec process according to previous studies jin et al 2018 wang et al 2021 aromatic structures are more amenable to coagulation than aliphatic structures in addition aromatic carbon species further decreased during the cm e hoc process and the ratios of aliphatic and oxygen containing groups were higher in the cm e hoc process than that in the cm ec process at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 the content of oxygen containing ketonic and carboxylic groups increased observably compared with a current density of 3 ma cm2 and ozonation alone this further proved an enhanced oxidation ability due to the synergistic effects between ozone and hydrolyzed coagulant species jin et al 2020 2021a zhang et al 2008 showed that catalytic ozonation produced more aldehydes and oxalic acid which contain ketonic and carboxyl groups than ozonation alone it was also reported that reduction of the aromatic compounds to generate organics with more oxygenated functional groups that had a lower tendency to adsorb on membrane surfaces helped decrease membrane fouling van geluwe et al 2011 and this was consistent with the results in figs 4 and 6 3 4 hydrolyzed coagulant species and floc properties in the cm e hoc process excellent residual fe control performance was also obtained and more generated fe aggregated and formed larger flocs in addition more polymeric feb was generated in the cm e hoc process than the cm ec process according to fig 9 feb represented medium polymeric hydrolyzed species which are the most active component of ferric salt coagulants wei et al 2009 the enhanced generation of polymeric coagulant species was favorable for generating larger flocs lin et al 2008 as a result coagulation using polymeric fe coagulants led to a lower residual ferric concentration than using monomeric fe salts wei et al 2009 therefore the higher feb contents in the cm e hoc process implied higher coagulation ability than the cm ec process the interactions between ozone and surface protonated hydroxyl groups released reactive oxygen species and formed surface hydroxyl groups jin et al 2020 2021b the oh bridges finally formed after binding between generated surface oh groups and surface protonated oh2 groups which underwent polymerization according to eq 4 yu et al 2016 furthermore the content of oxygen containing groups increased in the cm e hoc process which also facilitated the generation of larger aggregates fig 8 consequently an improved coagulation ability resulted in excellent fouling mitigation performance 4 m oh m o h 2 m h 3 o 2 m m oh m h 2 o in addition the flocs in the cm e hoc process exhibited a higher fractal dimension df than those in the cm ec process fig s7 a higher value of df implies that the flocs were more compact with fewer branches while a lower value of df implies that the flocs were looser with more branches chen et al 2022 the higher df of flocs in the cm e hoc process can be attributed to the enhanced generation of polymerized hydrolyzed coagulant species and organic matter with oxygen containing groups jiao et al 2016 xu et al 2011 it was indicated that flocs with a lower df increased the compressibility in the cake layer at a given transmembrane pressure which eventually reduced its the porosity wang et al 2013 therefore the cake layer on the membrane surface became more compact which increased the filtration resistance during the cm ec process fig 6 in contrast a loose and porous cake layer on the membrane surface can be expected during the cm e hoc process which was beneficial for in situ self cleaning by generated bubbles 3 5 characterization of the fouling layer to characterize the cake layers the virgin and fouled membranes were analyzed by atr ftir fig 10 the peaks around 3300 cm 1 and 2930 cm 1 were assigned as aliphatic ch and oh stretching vibrations respectively sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 the peak at 1460 cm 1 was related to the stretching and deformation vibration of ch2 zahirifar et al 2018 around 1380 cm 1 there was a peak representing ch deformation of ch3 groups qi et al 2018 the peaks around 1065 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 were associated with co bonds and aromatic ch structures respectively bosch et al 2006 chang et al 2002 in general with the increasing current densities in the cm ec process more foulants accumulated on the surface of the membrane due to the increased generation of flocs with more coagulated organics however a much lower peak intensity was obtained in the cm e hoc process which verified that this process mitigated membrane fouling on one hand the soe effects in the reactor enhanced the oh generation fig s5 and resulted in improved organic matter removal and the reduction of ft ir peak intensity of the cake layer which was consistent with the results in fig 7 on the other hand the organic matter in the cake layer was also in situ oxidized which decreased the peak intensity song et al 2020 also found that in situ ozonation removed organic matter on the membrane surface and inhibited the deposition of extracellular polymeric substances and microorganisms on the membrane surface the particle size distribution was also obtained to characterize the fouling layer formed during the cm ec and cm e hoc processes fig 11 according to yu et al 2013 and asif et al 2021 large particles with large size did not tend to cause rapid membrane fouling because they formed a porous fouling layer as shown in fig 11 the particle size d50 in the fouling layer during the cm e hoc process was larger than that in the cm ec process especially at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 fig 11b and c this verified the higher flux and lower fouling performance of the cm e hoc process the ratio of oxygen containing groups increased in the cm e hoc process due to the enhanced oxidation ability according to fig 8 the formed fe coagulant can easily complex with oxygen containing groups such as carboxyl groups on organic matter and form aggregates jin et al 2019 this resulted in larger particle sizes in the cake layer and a higher flux in the cm e hoc process the sem images show the morphology of fouled membranes under different operational conditions fig 12 in which the virgin ptfe membrane presented a porous structure fig 12a after direct filtration or filtration with ozonation but without electrolysis severe membrane fouling occurred and a compact and thick cake layer formed on the membrane surface fig 12b and c during the cm ec process a relatively loose and thin cake layer formed fig 12d thin and fragile cake layers with many shrinkage cracks were observed on the membrane at higher current densities during the cm ec process fig 12e and f which formed as the sample air dried the more shrinkage cracks can be attributed to the increased generation of fe flocs during the cm ec process yang et al 2022 however during the cm e hoc process larger shrinkage cracks formed on the surface of membranes indicating looser and more porous cake layers which was consistent with the larger particle size observed during the cm e hoc process fig 11 fig s8 showed the cross sections of fouled membrane before and after in situ self cleaning after in situ self cleaning both the thickness of fouling layer for the cm ec and cm e hoc process decreased however the remaining fouling layer was more compact in the cm ec process than that in the cm e hoc process therefore favorable flux recovery performance can be achieved after in situ self cleaning of the cm e hoc process fig 5 in contrast the cm ec process exhibited deteriorative in situ self cleaning performance fig s4 3 6 fouling mitigation mechanism of the cm e hoc process on one hand the oxidation ability was improved during the cm e hoc process because of the enhanced generation of oh due to the soe effects fig s5 the better organic matter removal and transformation decreased the fouling potential of the cm e hoc process figs 7 and 8 in addition organic matter in the cake layer was also in situ oxidized to alleviate membrane fouling which facilitated the in situ self cleaning of the cm e hoc process fig 10 on the other hand the soe effects enhanced the polymeric fe species in the cm e hoc process which led to improved coagulation performance and mitigated membrane fouling fig 9 in addition the flocs generated in the cm e hoc process exhibited higher fractal dimension with looser and more branches which resulted in looser and more porous cake layer on the membrane surface therefore more efficient in situ self cleaning performance by generated bubbles in the cm e hoc process can be expected fig 12 based on the above results the proposed fouling mitigation mechanism of the cm e hoc process is shown in fig 13 4 conclusions the proposed cm e hoc process achieved in situ self cleaning by generated microbubbles in the cathode membrane which exhibited significantly higher ss and turbidity removal efficiency than the cm ec process for the treatment of polymer flooding produced water because of the alternating filtration during the cm e hoc process continuous water production was also achieved the effluent of the cm e hoc process can meet the reinjection requirements of the longdong changqing oilfield china q sycq 08 011 2019 at the tested current densities of 3 5 and 10 ma cm2 a much lower reversible and irreversible fouling ratio can be obtained for the cm e hoc process than the cm ec process at different current densities therefore excellent flux recovery was obtained in the cm e hoc process at different in situ self cleaning intervals the enhanced oxidation ability of the cm e hoc process led to effective removal of aromatic protein like substances and an increase in oxygen containing groups which was beneficial for membrane fouling mitigation in addition the improved coagulation ability during the cm e hoc process due to increased oxygen containing groups and polymeric fe species resulted in larger flocs with higher fractal dimensions this resulted in the formation of a loose and porous cake layer on the membrane surface consequently a higher flux and alleviated membrane fouling were achieved in the cm e hoc process compared with the cm ec process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

water is more difficult to treat for reinjection compared with normal produced water because of the presence of residual hydrolyzed polyacrylamide hpam a novel cathode membrane integrated electro hybrid ozonation coagulation cm e hoc process was proposed for the treatment of polymer flooding produced water this process achieved in situ self cleaning by generated microbubbles in the cathode membrane the cm e hoc process achieved a higher suspended solid ss turbidity and pam removal efficiency than the cm ec process the ss in the cm e hoc effluent was 20 mg l ss which met the reinjection requirements of longdong changqing oilfield china q sycq 08 011 2019 at different current densities 3 5 and 10 ma cm2 the cm e hoc process greatly mitigated both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling therefore excellent flux recovery was obtained at different in situ self cleaning intervals during the cm e hoc process furthermore alternating filtration achieved continuous water production during the cm e hoc process on one hand the effective removal of aromatic protein like substances and an increase in oxygen containing functional groups were achieved due to the enhanced oxidation ability of the cm e hoc process which decreased membrane fouling on the other hand the cm e hoc process showed improved coagulation performance because of the increased oxygen containing functional groups and polymeric fe species therefore larger flocs with higher fractal dimensions were generated and a looser and more porous cake layer was formed on the membrane surface during the cm e hoc process consequently the cm e hoc process exhibited better in situ self cleaning performance and lower filtration resistance than the cm ec process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cathode membrane in situ self cleaning membrane fouling polymer flooding produced water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is injected during the secondary oil recovery second stage of oil exploitation to maintain reservoir pressure this results in enormous amounts of produced water after oil water separation which is a combination of formation water injected water organic and inorganic compounds wu et al 2019 many oilfields have entered the middle and late stage of exploitation and multiple technologies for tertiary oil recovery third stage of oil exploitation using chemicals have been developed to improve oil production li et al 2015 polymer flooding is a tertiary oil recovery method in which the polymer is added to injected water to increase the fluid viscosity and sweep efficiency the most popular polymers for this process is hydrolyzed polyacrylamide hpam al sabahi et al 2018 as a result the polymer flooding produced water contains not only crude oil minerals and bacteria but also residual hpam which is more difficult to treat for reinjection compared with normal produced water zhang et al 2015 for produced water reinjection suspended solids ss are strictly regulated to avoid clogging the reinjection well ghafoori et al 2022 coagulation based processes are widely used for the treatment of produced water such as chemical coagulation electro coagulation ec and flotation ghafoori et al 2022 ec is one of the best alternatives for produced water treatment due to its low cost simple operation minimal chemical usage high degree of integration and favorable separation performance madhavan and antony 2021 additionally favorable oil organic matter turbidity and suspended solid removal efficiency of produced water can be achieved using ec processes ammar and akbar 2018 sardari et al 2018 nevertheless much higher stability of polymer flooding produced water can be obtained because of the existence of residual pam li et al 2021 a negatively charged surface can be formed due to the charged carboxyl group coo on the hpam molecular chain dissociation in solution in addition an organic coating around the negatively charged particles can be formed because of the solvation of coo groups which significantly enhanced the stability of polymer flooding produced water he et al 2016 therefore the commonly used ec process was inefficient for polymer flooding produced water treatment ricceri et al 2022 ozonation processes are widely used to promote the removal efficiency of subsequent coagulation xie et al 2016 pre ozonation can cleave the bonds between particles and adsorbed organics and reduces the molecular weight of organics which results in the desorption of stabilized organic coatings and the reduction of steric effects and electrostatic barrier xie et al 2013 to improve the organic removal performance and convenience of operation our previous studies proposed the electro hybrid ozonation coagulation e hoc process in which ozonation and electrocoagulation simultaneously occurred in one reactor jin et al 2020 jin et al 2021a both the oxidation and coagulation ability were improved due to the enhanced generation of oh and polymeric hydrolyzed coagulant species jin et al 2021a nevertheless most of the oil and gas fields in northern china are ultra low or low permeability oil and gas fields which have very strict requirements for the reinjection water quality low pressure membrane processes such as microfiltration and ultrafiltration can remove particulate substances and some fraction of organic compounds making them suitable for the treatment of produced water liu et al 2022 xiong et al 2016 membrane fouling is a major challenge during the produced water treatment liu et al 2022 both ozonation and ec are effective ways to alleviate membrane fouling hua et al 2015 tang et al 2018 therefore the e hoc and membrane filtration can be integrated to form a compact system to enhance the treatment performance of polymer flooding produced water previous studies applied a conductive membrane as the cathode to achieve self cleaning using generated microbubbles on the membrane surface during electrolysis abid et al 2017 hashaikeh et al 2014 xu et al 2021 this provided a non destructive energy efficient and affordable membrane fouling alleviation method therefore the e hoc and cathodic conductive membrane filtration can be combined to explore the removal and membrane fouling mitigation performance during polymer flooding produced water treatment in this study to enhance the reinjected water quality for the treatment of polymer flooding produced water a novel cathode membrane integrated e hoc cm e hoc process was proposed the removal performance of the cm e hoc process was tested at different operational conditions in addition the self cleaning and membrane fouling mitigation performance were also investigated under different operational conditions the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism was analyzed in terms of organic transformations in the cm e hoc reactor and fouling layer characterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water the polymer flooding produced water was collected from the longdong changqing oilfield china the pam suspended solid ss petroleum chemical oxygen demand cod ph and turbidity were 30 2 58 mg l 120 15 mg l 25 1 62 mg l 1256 53 mg l 7 78 0 20 and 85 5 26 ntu respectively 2 2 experimental setup the experimental setup of cm e hoc reactor with treatment capacity of 1 44 l h is illustrated in fig 1 there were two identical self made cathode membrane modules in one cm e hoc reactor alternate operation of the two membrane modules was achieved and continuous filtrated water production can be obtained in the cm e hoc reactor a detailed description of the reactor is provided in text s1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analysis suspended solid ss chemical oxygen demand cod and turbidity were measured according to the standard method nepa 2002 pam concentration was measured using the iodine starch method zhang et al 2022 2 3 2 fe concentration and species detection the total fe concentration was measured using the phenanthroline colorimetric method nepa 2002 ferron colorimetric method was used to analyze fe species distributions based on our previous studies jin et al 2020 jin et al 2021a 2 3 3 zeta potential analysis a laser zeta potential analyzer malvern zetasizer nano zs90 uk was applied for zeta potential analysis the samples were collected 3 cm below the top of the reactor and measured immediately to avoid zeta potential variations 2 3 4 particle size distribution analysis the particle size distribution of the fouling layer was analyzed according to our previous study jin et al 2019 using a particle size distribution analyzer sync microtrac mrb usa 2 3 5 fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis the samples were obtained by freeze drying the effluent and insoluble flocs by air drying the samples were analyzed using a k alpha x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo fisher scientific uk and an ft ir spectrometer nicolet 6700 thermo fisher scientific uk 2 3 6 excitation emission matrix eem analysis the water sample was filtrated through a membrane with a pore size of 0 45 Œºm before detection eem spectra were obtained using a spectrofluorometer f 7000 hitachi japan 2 3 7 membrane fouling resistance the resistance distribution of membrane fouling was determined according to a previous study sun et al 2020 firstly pure water was filtered by the membrane to obtain the initial flux j 0 then the flux of the membrane filtering treated water for 20 min was determined to be j 1 finally after 20 min of self cleaning another pure water flux was obtained as j 2 the obtained flux data were calculated as follows eqs 1 3 1 total fouling ratio r t j 0 j 1 j 0 100 2 reversible fouling ratio r r j 2 j 1 j 0 100 3 irreversible fouling ratio r ir r t r r 2 3 8 two dimensional fraction dimension and oh detection the two dimension fractal dimension of the flocs generated in the reactor was calculated according to chen et al 2022 a bruker emxmicro spectrometer germany was used to conduct the electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr experiments at room temperature for the oh detection according to a previous study jin et al 2021b 2 3 9 scanning electric microscopy sem analysis the membrane after drying was used to observe the morphology specially the membrane surface was pretreated by spraying gold owing to the poor conductivity of ptfe membrane the result was obtained through a field emission scanning electron microscopy gemini sem 300 zeiss germany 2 4 statistical analysis the cm e hoc experiments were performed in triplicate for averaged results and the results are presented as the mean values with standard deviations 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance the removal performance of the cm e hoc process for the treatment of polymer flooding produced water is shown in fig 2 cod removal efficiency at different current densities and ozone dosages is shown in fig 2a cod removal efficiency increased with the increasing current densities from 0 to 5 ma cm2 the cm ec process the cm e hoc process without ozone achieved 63 8 cod removal efficiency at a current density of 5 ma cm2 furthermore favorable pam removal was also obtained at a current density of 5 ma cm2 in the cm ec process fig 2b previous studies also reported that 60 cod removal efficiency could be achieved by using the ec process with either al or fe anodes al malack and al nowaiser 2018 zhao et al 2014 however a lower ss and turbidity removal efficiency were obtained upon increasing current density fig 2c and d which can be attributed to the higher residual fe in the permeate fig 3 only around 50 8 ss and 85 0 turbidity removal efficiency were achieved at current density 5 ma cm2 even after membrane filtration it cannot meet the reinjection requirements of ss 30 mg l q sycq 08011 2019 because the ph of the permeate was higher than 7 5 fig s1 the residual dissolved fe in the permeate can generate fe oh 3 sediments that deteriorated the effluent water quality previous studies have reported that a high current density produced more concentration of fe2 ions than needed and directly impacted the residual fe concentration in ec treated water das and nandi 2019 mohora et al 2018 which cannot be easily removed by microfiltration or ultrafiltration yu et al 2013 the ss and turbidity removal efficiency increased significantly using the cm e hoc process which indicated that ozonation greatly improved the separation performance even at the lowest ozone dosage the effluent can meet the requirement of ss 30 mg l fig 2c the pam ss and turbidity removal efficiency increased with the increasing ozone dosages from 0 1 to 0 2 mg o3 mg cod correspondingly the residual fe decreased upon increasing ozone dosages according to fig 3 this in turn proved that the increase in ss and turbidity with the increasing current density in the permeate of the cm ec process was caused by excessive residual fe the favorable residual fe reduction performance was ascribed to the enhanced coagulation ability of the cm e hoc process for the generation of larger flocs which can be more easily removed by membrane filtration in addition fig s2 exhibits that the floc size in the cm e hoc process was larger than that in the cm ec process previous studies have also indicated that in situ ozonation with coagulation using ferric metal coagulants can facilitate the floc size increase asif et al 2021 tang et al 2018 liu et al 2007 reported that floc formation was assisted by ozonation because organic matter adsorbed on aquatic particles was desorbed or decomposed by ozone yin et al 2021 also achieved lower residual fe during the treatment of bsa when using ozonation as pretreatment to enhance the coagulation compared with coagulation only it was also found that the coagulation mechanism exhibited an important effect on residual coagulant control and residual coagulant in the microfiltration permeate can be well controlled by charge neutralization but it increased significantly under sweep floc conditions lee et al 2000 fig s3 shows that the zeta potential was always higher in the cm e hoc process than that in the cm ec process at different current densities oxidation can increase the opportunity for particle collisions and coagulation due to the decreased negative charge density of organic matter xie et al 2016 therefore charge neutralization was more likely to occur in the cm e hoc process and a lower residual fe in the permeate can be expected 3 2 flux developments and in situ self cleaning performance fig 4 shows the flux curves during the operation of the cm e hoc process at different current densities and ozone dosages a very low normalized flux was obtained for the cm e hoc process without an applied current indicating severe membrane fouling fig 4a it can be implied that adsorption or clogging of particles may played an important role in the severe membrane fouling because small particular contaminants cannot be removed by ozonation only the normalized flux increased significantly even for the cm ec process at the lowest current density of 3 ma cm2 fig 4b this was ascribed to the removal of particles or colloidal organic foulants and the generation of a cake layer with a lower hydraulic resistance on the membrane surface using the ec process ben sasson and adin 2010 hua et al 2015 however upon increasing the current density the flux exhibited only slight variations for the cm ec process in general a much higher flux was obtained at current densities of 3 5 and 10 ma cm2 in the cm e hoc reactor the lower tendency of the hydrophilic reaction products to adsorb on membrane surfaces is a crucial reason for the higher the membrane flux after ozone oxidation van geluwe et al 2011 in addition a similar flux was obtained at ozone dosages of 0 2 and 0 4 mg o3 mg cod which were both higher than that obtained at an ozone dosage of 0 1 mg o3 mg cod with different current densities using the cm e hoc process the normalized flux was much higher in the cm e hoc process at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 fig 4c and d than that at a current density of 3 ma cm2 fig 4b furthermore a limited flux difference was found between current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 for the cm e hoc proces the higher current density led to the more rapid deposition of a floc layer which prevented foulants from blocking the inner pores of the membrane resulting in a reduction in membrane fouling xu et al 2021 yang et al 2015 however as the current density further increased the deposition rate of the floc layer changed slightly which led to little difference in the final steady state flux yang et al 2015 therefore an ozone dosage of 0 2 mg o3 mg cod and a current density of 5 ma cm2 were selected as the optimal operating conditions for the cm e hoc process in the following sections the effect of self cleaning time intervals on the backwash performance was analyzed in this study and the results can be seen in fig 5 except for the self cleaning time interval of 180 min excellent backwashing performance was obtained at different self cleaning time intervals this may be attributed to the synergistic effects between ozonation and electrocoagulation soe which simultaneously enhanced the oh generation and polymeric hydrolyzed coagulant species jin et al 2020 jin et al 2021a however a slightly lower flux recovery was observed at the self cleaning time interval of 180 min in contrast deteriorative in situ self cleaning performance was obtained during the cm ec process fig s4 during the self cleaning of the cathode membrane gas bubbles formed on the membrane surface and began to escape the surface by moving up and sweep away the foulant layer anis et al 2021 lalia et al 2015 the bubbles generated at the surface of conductive membrane also acted as a physical barrier that could mitigate foulant deposition at the membrane surface during filtration wu et al 2008 electrical repulsion could force negatively charged foulants away from the cathode membrane which also assisted with fouling mitigation during fouling layer formation sun et al 2020 other studies have implied that ozone and generated reactive oxygen species can react with the large organic foulants that block pores into small molecules helping recover water flux li et al 2022 sun et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 the gradually deteriorating flux after self cleaning at 180 min interval was probably attributed to a dense foulant layer on the surface during pro longed filtration therefore it was more difficult to remove from the membrane surface than the loose deposited fouling layers abid et al 2017 hashaikeh et al 2014 fig 6 shows the membrane resistance distribution at different current densities during the cm ec and cm e hoc process the fouling resistance can be divided into reversible and irreversible fouling resistance based on the cleaning procedure sun et al 2020 reversible fouling was mostly caused by external fouling because of the accumulation of foulants on the membrane i e complete blocking and intermediate blocking and the cake gel layer i e cake fouling formed on the membrane surface that can be easily eliminated by hydraulic cleaning chang et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 irreversible fouling can be ascribed to the blockage by foulants inside membrane pores and the strong adsorption of foulants on the membrane pores and surface lu et al 2016 according to fig 6 reversible fouling played the main role in membrane fouling both for the cm ec and cm e hoc processes in contrast to membrane fouling due to the infiltration of colloidal particles into the pores of the membrane without coagulation membrane fouling proceeded according to the classical cake filtration model which is mainly reversible fouling al malack et al 2004 in addition a much lower reversible and irreversible fouling ratio was obtained for the cm e hoc process than for the cm ec process at different current densities in general the cm e hoc processes exhibited much lower reversible fouling ratio 29 9 than the cm ec process 68 5 at a current density of 5 ma cm2 in addition the irreversible fouling ratio further decreased to 6 1 for the cm e hoc process fig 6b which can explain the excellent in situ self cleaning performance by generated gas bubbles fig 5 for the cm e hoc process it was reported that all reversible fouling can be removed by self cleaning via bubble generation at cathode lee et al 2022 a previous study also indicated that both hydraulically reversible and irreversible fouling resistance exhibited significant decrease when integrating in situ ozonation with fe coagulation for membrane fouling mitigation tang et al 2018 according to xing et al 2019 significant reduction of irreversible resistance of uf membrane was achieved by fe ii uv chlorine pre treatment due to the coupled role between oxidation and coagulation therefore for the cm e hoc process the soe effects may have played an important role in alleviating membrane fouling our previous studies found that enhanced oh generation was achieved because ozone was catalyzed by electro generated hydrolyzed metal coagulants due to the interactions between ozone and surface hydroxyl groups of the coagulants jin et al 2020 2021a fig s5 indicates a higher oh generation for the cm e hoc process than the cm ec process and ozonation alone compared with a current density of 3 ma cm2 the total fouling ratio of the cm e hoc process decreased significantly at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 which indicated an improved oxidation ability and was consistent with the results in fig 5 at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 little difference can be observed between the total fouling ratio of the cm e hoc process 3 3 characterization of dissolved organic matters within the cm e hoc reactor to analyze the different fouling behaviors between cm ec and cm e hoc processes eems were applied to characterize dom according to fig 7 three notable fluorescent peaks ex em 220 300 nm ex em 230 340 nm and ex em 280 340 nm were observed in the polymer flooding produced water i e the cm ec without an applied current fig 7a the fluorescent peak at ex em 220 300 nm represented tyrosine like substances and the peaks ex em 230 340 nm and ex em 280 340 nm represented tryptophan like substances coble 1996 liu et al 2011 these peaks indicated that the fluorescent organic matter in the polymer flooding produced water mainly consisted of aromatic protein like substances song et al 2020 indicated that protein like substances were the main component responsible for reversible membrane fouling and humic like substances were the main components for irreversible membrane fouling this also proves that reversible fouling played a major role in membrane fouling both for the cm ec and cm e hoc processes the cm ec process can effectively remove tryptophan like substances at current densities higher than 5 ma cm2 however there was still serious membrane fouling for the cm ec process at current densities of 5 ma cm2 and 10 ma cm2 according to figs 4 and 6 which indicated that residual tyrosine like substances may be responsible for membrane fouling previous study also suggested that tyrosine containing proteins had significant fouling potential henderson et al 2011 however for the cm e hoc process the aromatic protein like substances including tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances were effectively removed due to the addition of ozone which helped alleviate the membrane fouling figs 5 and 7 xps was also applied to analyze the dissolved organic matter changes during the cm ec and cm e hoc processes at different current densities fig 8 the c1s high resolution spectra with gaussian fitting are shown in fig s6 four types of chemical binding signals were observed in fig s6 which were ascribed to carboxylic carbon oco ketonic carbon co aliphatic carbon cc and aromatic carbon cc jin et al 2016 lin et al 2014 the raw water i e the permeate of the cm ec process without an applied current density had a high ratio of aromatic and aliphatic carbon which is consistent with previous studies beyer et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the aromatic carbon species decreased with the increasing current density for the cm ec process according to previous studies jin et al 2018 wang et al 2021 aromatic structures are more amenable to coagulation than aliphatic structures in addition aromatic carbon species further decreased during the cm e hoc process and the ratios of aliphatic and oxygen containing groups were higher in the cm e hoc process than that in the cm ec process at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 the content of oxygen containing ketonic and carboxylic groups increased observably compared with a current density of 3 ma cm2 and ozonation alone this further proved an enhanced oxidation ability due to the synergistic effects between ozone and hydrolyzed coagulant species jin et al 2020 2021a zhang et al 2008 showed that catalytic ozonation produced more aldehydes and oxalic acid which contain ketonic and carboxyl groups than ozonation alone it was also reported that reduction of the aromatic compounds to generate organics with more oxygenated functional groups that had a lower tendency to adsorb on membrane surfaces helped decrease membrane fouling van geluwe et al 2011 and this was consistent with the results in figs 4 and 6 3 4 hydrolyzed coagulant species and floc properties in the cm e hoc process excellent residual fe control performance was also obtained and more generated fe aggregated and formed larger flocs in addition more polymeric feb was generated in the cm e hoc process than the cm ec process according to fig 9 feb represented medium polymeric hydrolyzed species which are the most active component of ferric salt coagulants wei et al 2009 the enhanced generation of polymeric coagulant species was favorable for generating larger flocs lin et al 2008 as a result coagulation using polymeric fe coagulants led to a lower residual ferric concentration than using monomeric fe salts wei et al 2009 therefore the higher feb contents in the cm e hoc process implied higher coagulation ability than the cm ec process the interactions between ozone and surface protonated hydroxyl groups released reactive oxygen species and formed surface hydroxyl groups jin et al 2020 2021b the oh bridges finally formed after binding between generated surface oh groups and surface protonated oh2 groups which underwent polymerization according to eq 4 yu et al 2016 furthermore the content of oxygen containing groups increased in the cm e hoc process which also facilitated the generation of larger aggregates fig 8 consequently an improved coagulation ability resulted in excellent fouling mitigation performance 4 m oh m o h 2 m h 3 o 2 m m oh m h 2 o in addition the flocs in the cm e hoc process exhibited a higher fractal dimension df than those in the cm ec process fig s7 a higher value of df implies that the flocs were more compact with fewer branches while a lower value of df implies that the flocs were looser with more branches chen et al 2022 the higher df of flocs in the cm e hoc process can be attributed to the enhanced generation of polymerized hydrolyzed coagulant species and organic matter with oxygen containing groups jiao et al 2016 xu et al 2011 it was indicated that flocs with a lower df increased the compressibility in the cake layer at a given transmembrane pressure which eventually reduced its the porosity wang et al 2013 therefore the cake layer on the membrane surface became more compact which increased the filtration resistance during the cm ec process fig 6 in contrast a loose and porous cake layer on the membrane surface can be expected during the cm e hoc process which was beneficial for in situ self cleaning by generated bubbles 3 5 characterization of the fouling layer to characterize the cake layers the virgin and fouled membranes were analyzed by atr ftir fig 10 the peaks around 3300 cm 1 and 2930 cm 1 were assigned as aliphatic ch and oh stretching vibrations respectively sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 the peak at 1460 cm 1 was related to the stretching and deformation vibration of ch2 zahirifar et al 2018 around 1380 cm 1 there was a peak representing ch deformation of ch3 groups qi et al 2018 the peaks around 1065 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 were associated with co bonds and aromatic ch structures respectively bosch et al 2006 chang et al 2002 in general with the increasing current densities in the cm ec process more foulants accumulated on the surface of the membrane due to the increased generation of flocs with more coagulated organics however a much lower peak intensity was obtained in the cm e hoc process which verified that this process mitigated membrane fouling on one hand the soe effects in the reactor enhanced the oh generation fig s5 and resulted in improved organic matter removal and the reduction of ft ir peak intensity of the cake layer which was consistent with the results in fig 7 on the other hand the organic matter in the cake layer was also in situ oxidized which decreased the peak intensity song et al 2020 also found that in situ ozonation removed organic matter on the membrane surface and inhibited the deposition of extracellular polymeric substances and microorganisms on the membrane surface the particle size distribution was also obtained to characterize the fouling layer formed during the cm ec and cm e hoc processes fig 11 according to yu et al 2013 and asif et al 2021 large particles with large size did not tend to cause rapid membrane fouling because they formed a porous fouling layer as shown in fig 11 the particle size d50 in the fouling layer during the cm e hoc process was larger than that in the cm ec process especially at current densities of 5 and 10 ma cm2 fig 11b and c this verified the higher flux and lower fouling performance of the cm e hoc process the ratio of oxygen containing groups increased in the cm e hoc process due to the enhanced oxidation ability according to fig 8 the formed fe coagulant can easily complex with oxygen containing groups such as carboxyl groups on organic matter and form aggregates jin et al 2019 this resulted in larger particle sizes in the cake layer and a higher flux in the cm e hoc process the sem images show the morphology of fouled membranes under different operational conditions fig 12 in which the virgin ptfe membrane presented a porous structure fig 12a after direct filtration or filtration with ozonation but without electrolysis severe membrane fouling occurred and a compact and thick cake layer formed on the membrane surface fig 12b and c during the cm ec process a relatively loose and thin cake layer formed fig 12d thin and fragile cake layers with many shrinkage cracks were observed on the membrane at higher current densities during the cm ec process fig 12e and f which formed as the sample air dried the more shrinkage cracks can be attributed to the increased generation of fe flocs during the cm ec process yang et al 2022 however during the cm e hoc process larger shrinkage cracks formed on the surface of membranes indicating looser and more porous cake layers which was consistent with the larger particle size observed during the cm e hoc process fig 11 fig s8 showed the cross sections of fouled membrane before and after in situ self cleaning after in situ self cleaning both the thickness of fouling layer for the cm ec and cm e hoc process decreased however the remaining fouling layer was more compact in the cm ec process than that in the cm e hoc process therefore favorable flux recovery performance can be achieved after in situ self cleaning of the cm e hoc process fig 5 in contrast the cm ec process exhibited deteriorative in situ self cleaning performance fig s4 3 6 fouling mitigation mechanism of the cm e hoc process on one hand the oxidation ability was improved during the cm e hoc process because of the enhanced generation of oh due to the soe effects fig s5 the better organic matter removal and transformation decreased the fouling potential of the cm e hoc process figs 7 and 8 in addition organic matter in the cake layer was also in situ oxidized to alleviate membrane fouling which facilitated the in situ self cleaning of the cm e hoc process fig 10 on the other hand the soe effects enhanced the polymeric fe species in the cm e hoc process which led to improved coagulation performance and mitigated membrane fouling fig 9 in addition the flocs generated in the cm e hoc process exhibited higher fractal dimension with looser and more branches which resulted in looser and more porous cake layer on the membrane surface therefore more efficient in situ self cleaning performance by generated bubbles in the cm e hoc process can be expected fig 12 based on the above results the proposed fouling mitigation mechanism of the cm e hoc process is shown in fig 13 4 conclusions the proposed cm e hoc process achieved in situ self cleaning by generated microbubbles in the cathode membrane which exhibited significantly higher ss and turbidity removal efficiency than the cm ec process for the treatment of polymer flooding produced water because of the alternating filtration during the cm e hoc process continuous water production was also achieved the effluent of the cm e hoc process can meet the reinjection requirements of the longdong changqing oilfield china q sycq 08 011 2019 at the tested current densities of 3 5 and 10 ma cm2 a much lower reversible and irreversible fouling ratio can be obtained for the cm e hoc process than the cm ec process at different current densities therefore excellent flux recovery was obtained in the cm e hoc process at different in situ self cleaning intervals the enhanced oxidation ability of the cm e hoc process led to effective removal of aromatic protein like substances and an increase in oxygen containing groups which was beneficial for membrane fouling mitigation in addition the improved coagulation ability during the cm e hoc process due to increased oxygen containing groups and polymeric fe species resulted in larger flocs with higher fractal dimensions this resulted in the formation of a loose and porous cake layer on the membrane surface consequently a higher flux and alleviated membrane fouling were achieved in the cm e hoc process compared with the cm ec process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

beneficial uses of water the impact of harmful algal blooms can range from massive fish kills due to severe do depletion to toxins that contaminate the food chain there is a host of interacting physical and biological factors that determine the formation of algal blooms harrison et al 2008 in recent years global climate change and human activities have exacerbated algal blooms anderson et al 2008 paerl and huisman 2008 paerl et al 2016 ralston and moore 2020 in hong kong a total of 956 red tide incidents have been reported during 1975 2019 in particular a severe algal bloom event caused by toxic karenia mikimotoi started in tolo harbour in december 2015 causing massive fish kills due to severe oxygen depletion and possible food poisoning afcd 2020 despite extensive theoretical and field studies over the past decades the prediction of algal blooms remains a challenging problem partly due to the complex spatial and temporal variability of algal dynamics about 300 species can cause a high concentration of red tides worldwide one fourth of this amount is known to be harmful or toxic jessup et al 2009 some species of algae are susceptible to environmental change providing an early warning signal of worsening ecological conditions thus the real time monitoring of the algae population is of great importance for environmental and fisheries management guo et al 2020 2021 currently conventional approaches for algal species monitoring mostly rely on routine monthly field sampling and laboratory analysis of chl a and manual species classification and cell counting li and smayda 2000 such a labor intensive approach is time consuming expensive and requires the availability of experienced taxonomists furthermore such data is typically sparse in time and space and highly inadequate to capture the dynamic changes that accompany algal blooms which can take off and subside over a matter of weeks in sub tropical coastal waters with the increasing availability of real time water quality sensors mainly for physical parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence the real time monitoring and forecast system have been increasingly developed craig et al 2006 guo et al 2020 among them remote sensing based methods provide the state of the art ex situ algae monitoring solution advances in remote sensing technologies have enabled fast and high throughput observations of oceans and lakes trapp et al 2021 from sky or space the satellite based bloom detection is mainly based on the use of ocean color to quantify chl a biomass and organic carbon in the upper water column hill

e g diatoms cyanobacteria chrysophytes from reflectance measurements vander woude et al 2019 however the application of satellite remote sensing to water quality monitoring is limited by overcast skies and poor spatial resolution of satellite images e g in hong kong a cloud amount of over 70 prevails for around 50 of the days cheng et al 2020 more importantly the above ex situ remote sensing methods are not able to provide real time species classification or meet the needs of emergency response fernandez figueroa et al 2022 advances in in situ observation techniques such as ifcb and flowcam provide high resolution high throughput and cytometric image data containing morphology information for algae species classification they offer opportunities in real time algae classification and analysis via morphology approach benfield et al 2007 precise real time image processing is the key to real time algae monitoring system culverhouse et al 2006 although both ifcb and flowcam are configured with software that can be used to identify algae sosik and olson 2007 these research purpose instruments are costly and the use for practical management has yet to be demonstrated over the past decade various classic machine learning ml methods have been used along with analysis of the algal images acquired by the ifcb or flowcam instruments to achieve species identification e g artificial neural network ann to classify algae images based on the extracted features mosleh et al 2012 support vector machines svm and random forest rf ellen et al 2015 grosjean et al 2004 with rapid advances in deep learning dl methods and computing power algal classifiers based on deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks cnn have been shown to perform better than classical ml models baek et al 2022 orenstein and beijbom 2017 pyo et al 2020 2021 gonz√°lez et al 2019 guo et al 2021 correa et al 2017 ot√°lora et al 2021 sonmez et al 2022 park et al 2022 abdullah et al 2022 in 2017 i correa et al demonstrated algae classification using deep learning for the first time correa et al 2017 they choose a standard deep convolutional network with 5 convolutional and 3 fully connected layers by systematic network architecture search such a convolutional network achieves 88 59 accuracy on low resolution flowcam images of 19 common algae species p ot√°lora et al compares the performance of descriptive features and images as input to ann for the classification of two freshwater algae chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus almeriensis ot√°lora et al 2021 in 2022 sonmez m e et al captured lab based microalgae images and applied cnn and support vector machine to classify cyanobacteria and chlorophyta algae groups sonmez et al 2022 park et al 2022 and abdullah et al 2022 deployed you only look once yolo method for object detection of multiple algae on freshwater algae collected in the laboratory as an example of practical field deployment in subtropical waters guo et al 2021 deployed ifcb in a tidal inlet and developed real time algae image classifiers with rf and cnn the system requires a 4g cellular terminal to transfer the high throughput high resolution data from the ifcb in the field to an off site workstation for data processing however all the off site lab based algae monitoring systems suffer from the following limitations i in terms of hardware the separation between the high throughput imaging device nearly 2 4 million algae images daily with high resolution in the field and the off site image analysis can introduce significant transfer latency and instability due to limited network bandwidth and a large amount of data transfer during data transmission unstable situations frequently occur due to limited bandwidth and environmental disturbance e g typhoons and bad weather the situation is worse with radio vs wireless communication over long distances say up to 40 km for real time algal species detection it is desirable to have an on site classification system adjacent to or an imaging device in the field ii an effective and accurate algae classification model for the real world remains a challenge and often still requires human assistance harred and campbell 2014 luo et al 2018 existing classification methods work well for high quality sharp balanced and labeled datasets but in the real world we often face low quality blurry unbalanced and unlabeled real world data the less than ideal classification performance on real world data the need for specialist expertise and prohibitive cost present significant obstacles to applying ai based methods in practical settings to overcome the above mentioned challenges we develop an on site edge ai chip based algae monitoring system that achieves on site real time algal species identification with an imaging device the small compact cost effective system is built on a new explainable amdnn model in the following the motivation for developing amdnn and ai chip based methods is first presented the key differences between on site and off site systems are explained second based on a comprehensive analysis of field data of algal images various data augmentation methods including rap are developed to pre condition the images for species detection third the proposed amdnn model is tested for training and validation datasets and shown to outperform all competitive rf based models finally the model is tested on a one month long field data february 2020 to demonstrate its applicability to achieve real time monitoring of total and targeted hab species counts during a red tide in the yim tin tsai marine fish culture zone in tolo harbour hong kong 2 material and methods 2 1 edge ai algae monitoring system deployment traditionally powerful ai apps require data center class systems in a shore based laboratory to operate such as a workstation with gpu such an off site lab based algae monitoring system installed in many places has limitations regarding timely hab detection and data integrity given a large amount of data to transfer limited bandwidth and occasionally unstable connections in the field we design an edge ai computing system to reduce latency and improve bandwidth utilization for faster and more accurate hab monitoring edge computing devices capable of intensive inference can be deployed next to an in situ observation device and the data can be processed on site ai at the edge offers many opportunities that can help to achieve real time intelligent environmental management fig 1 shows an edge ai chip connected to ifcb by wire on a fishfarm raft the continuously captured raw data from ifcb are transferred through the high bandwidth connection with nearly zero delays then the edge ai chip performs on site real time algae classification and analysis the analyzed result is broadcast through a 4g cellular terminal to users per day per hour or concurrently with water quality sampling according to the user s subscribing mode more importantly it can automatically broadcast an alert once an abnormal situation is monitored for example a sudden increase in the concentration of a toxic hab species to dangerous levels our system gets raw data from ifcb the ifcb generates sixty 5 ml samples a day raw data from ifcb contains images sampling time and water volume thousands of images are generated in every sample cycle run and transferred to an edge ai chip for classification and analysis the state of the art deep learning models are not friendly to standard hardware implementation liao et al 2021 recent advances in ai accelerator and deep learning methods have effectively reduced computing resource requirements here the nvidia jetson tx1 is used as the edge ai chip in our deployment tx1 is a state of art low power embedded platform 7 5 15 w 256 core graphics processing units gpus architecture with 256 cuda cores enables server class ai computing performance for deployment with minimal latency gpus have increased the performance by 317 times from 2012 2020 outperforming the predictions of moore s law the jetpack 4 6 1 of the tx1 is loaded with 4 gb of memory four usb 3 0 ports for peripherals hdmi and displayport connectors a micro usb port to supply power or allow remote operation an ethernet port two ribbon connectors for attaching raspberry pi compatible camera modules and a barrel jack socket for providing the additional power needed for intensive computations the ai chip is equipped with a linux operating system the installed environment for our well trained amdnn model and it should be noted that in the algae monitoring task the edge ai chip only performs inference of the neural network model whereas the training of the neural network model is carried out in our lab workstation see later discussion in 2 3 2 1 1 comparison of edge ai algae monitoring and conventional off site lab based analysis fig 2 illustrates the basic idea of our proposed edge ai algae monitoring system fig 2 shows the edge ai algae monitoring system and an off site lab based algae monitoring system respectively for the proposed edge ai chip based system fig 2 a a large bandwidth wire connection is accessible as the ai chip is deployed next to ifcb thus the data transfer delay is near zero thanks to the high computing power and high energy efficiency of the edge ai chip it is easy to deploy without additional power supply requirements while providing the inference result and performing species identification in real time thereby the analyzed result and alert are of low data volume and enable real time broadcasting to users for the conventional off site lab based system fig 2 b the high throughput high resolution raw data from ifcb have to be sent through a wireless connection to a remote shore based laboratory say 40 km away which inevitably involves a large delay because the wireless connection across the sea surface may be unstable and has low bandwidth it becomes a bottleneck in the conventional ai algae monitoring system which leads to delays in hab detection and hab alerts in emergency situations particularly 2 2 study site and data description the yim tin tsai fish culture zone ytt fcz 22 4on 114 2oe is located in the inner part of tolo harbour in the northeastern waters of hong kong fig 3 guo et al 2021 the fcz has a mean depth of around 6 m 3d model computations and field observations have shown that the tidal inlet is weakly flushed with mean tidal velocities in the order of 1 cm s the average flushing time can be estimated to be 14 and 38 days in the wet and dry seasons respectively choi and lee 2004 fish farming is practiced on a number of family operated fish raft platforms located 100 200 m from the shoreline ifcb is on a fish raft equipped with onshore 220 v line electric power supplied via underwater cables the ifcb is mounted securely to the raft platform and positioned to around 1 m depth guo et al 2021 since the deployment of ifcb in march 2019 real world algal morphology data has been continuously generated every day with the help of algae taxonomists the fifteen most common harmful algae species and ten most common harmless algae species in hong kong are picked including diatoms dinoflagellates non diatoms and non dinoflagellates a real world balanced dataset is selected and labeled by three taxonomy experts in hong kong agriculture fisheries and conservation department afcd based on ifcb raw data from march 2019 to june 2020 in ytt covering the 25 most common algae species in hong kong law 2018 examples of the 25 algae species with full names and abbreviations in brackets if applicable are shown in fig 4 in addition a real world unbalanced dataset containing 2759 images is manually labeled by an experienced researcher from the hong kong university of science and technology hkust and afcd guo et al 2021 the dataset is obtained from sampling on 1st february 2020 during the period of a typical algae bloom event reported by hong kong agriculture the dataset is used for testing and showing the effectiveness of amdnn on algal bloom warning in the unbalanced field data 2 3 algal morphology deep neural network amdnn model for species classification deploying a well trained amdnn with demanding generalization ability for real world data requires good sample distribution proper model structure and optimization here we introduce the amdnn in three stages i explainable dataset augmentation fig 5 a ii in lab training of amdnn fig 5 b iii on chip deployment inference and analysis fig 5 c 2 3 1 explainable dataset augmentation the training set consists of labeled algae images selected by taxonomists under top grade microscopes in the laboratory these images are of high quality with well focused images of algae cells the right orientation and representative shape the corresponding images contain sharp edges clear textures and representative shape and size information however the ifcb images may be of much lower quality in a field setting so we analyze the differences between the selected training set and real world data and migrate this data domain difference through the following explainable dataset augmentation methods the first observation is that compared to the training set real world images come with orientations that vary in a wide range so we add a rotation operation during dataset augmentation considering the size of the microchannel and the cropping of the ifcb it is not suitable to add a large angle based on statistics on real data we add rotation operation the second observation is the non chirality in the algal morphology which allows us to do symmetric mirror transformations without changing the image s label information so we add the vertical and horizontal flipping operation during dataset augmentation third the ifcb images in the field are often out of focus or overexposed so we add the blurring operation specifically a low pass filtering gaussian blur operation on the standard training dataset is used to generalize the system to real world datasets we combine rotation flipping and blurring operations so that each of the images gives rise to 20 images after data augmentation direct rotation fig 6 a e horizontally flipping then rotation fig 6 f j vertically flipping then rotation fig 6 k o and blurring then rotation fig 6 p t fourthly the size and aspect ratio distribution of the 25 classes vary in a wide range fig 7 a shows the height and width of images in a labeled dataset of 11 250 images ranging from 10 1000 pixels and 50 1400 pixels respectively the aspect ratio and the image length are also distributed in a wide range the aspect ratio ranges from 0 2 to 25 and the length of the long side ranges from 30 to 1400 such a big variance in image size and ratio leads to a ratio change problem for large aspect ratio images if we resize all the images to the same input size here we notice that for classes with large size which means that one edge of the image is larger than 100 pixels some of them tend to have a large aspect ratio as shown in the yellow circle in fig 7 b thus keeping the aspect ratio information when reducing their size is important while other large algae are in a low aspect ratio as shown in the green circle in fig 7 b they are distinct in size for small algae all less than 100 100 pixels with low aspect ratio as shown in the black circle in fig 7 b in the real world dataset more than 75 of algae are less than 10 um therefore accurate classification of small algae enables early detection of hab in previous work images were resized to 256 256 using a perspective preserving transform along the longest axis of the rois orenstein and beijbom 2017 it will cause the mis classification of such small algae species to preserve the relative size of the small algae reduction of these small algae images black circles by the same factor as that for large algae images green circle should be avoided considering the above information we propose the resizing with aspect ratio preserved rap method to keep the relative size and ratio information in the algal morphology as shown in fig 8 specifically we first compare the raw algae image s height and width with 100 pixels to judge if the image is small we will reduce height and width by two times if it is small otherwise the larger edge of the image is reduced to 100 pixels while keeping the aspect ratio then all the other cells besides the reduced size image within the 100 100 pixels area are filled padded with zero value pixels to illustrate the advantage of the proposed rap method we select a representative algae specie in each circle to illustrate the distribution of algae aspect ratio and size and the result of rap method and the traditional resizing method directly resize raw image into 224 224 as shown in fig 9 the black circle indicates the algae species featuring small size which means the small size is an important feature for classification as shown in fig 9 a representative specie is othercell s10um whose maximum value of width and height has an average value of 76 thus we scale down these images by two times compared with the traditional resizing method rap operation keeps small size features while preserving the aspect ratio well the green circle indicates the algae species whose aspect ratios are narrowly distributed a representative specie is a sanguinea whose aspect ratio has an average value of 1 32 and a standard deviation of 0 17 as shown in fig 9 the rap operation can preserve the aspect ratio precisely the yellow circle indicates the algae with a large aspect ratio whose aspect ratio should be preserved during data processing long chain diatom is a representative algae specie whose aspect ratio ranges from 1 08 to 16 8 as shown in fig 9 the traditional resizing method would cause a deformation while the rap operation preserves the aspect ratio 2 3 2 in lab training of amdnn since the information path from the input layer to the output layer becomes very long with the deepening of the dnn layers the weight gradient becomes very small and even the gradient vanishes the proposed amdnn takes densenet as the backbone to solve the problem of ensuring maximum information and gradient flow by dense block huang et al 2017 densenet is a dnn model with solid generalization ability and it exploits the network by feature reuse more importantly we only use a limited number of layers and parameters with small memory to extract the rich features of algae based on densenet here the selected real world balanced algae dataset with 25 algae species 450 images per class is used for in lab training and test among the real world balanced dataset 315 images per class 70 are used for training after data augmentation the total training dataset consists of 157 500 images from 25 classes among the real world balanced dataset another 45 images per class 10 are split into the validation dataset after data augmentation the total validation dataset consists of 22 500 images from 25 classes among the real world balanced dataset the rest 90 images per class the rest 20 are split into the testing datasets the total testing dataset consists of 2 250 images from 25 classes the input is fed into a convolutional layer with a filter size of 7 7 and 2 2 step size the convolutional layer is followed by a 3 3 maximum pooling layer then two dense blocks and a transition layer are connected at the end of the last dense block a global maximum pool is executed then a fully connected layer with a softmax classifier is connected the number of total parameters of amdnn is 1 044 265 where trainable parameters take account 1 026 169 and non trainable parameters 18 096 relu rectification linear unit keeping only positive values is used as the activation function and the categorical cross entropy loss function is used when adjusting amdnn weights during training it consists of a softmax and a cross entropy loss each predicted class probability is compared to the actual class desired output of zero or one and a loss is calculated that penalizes the probability based on how far it is from the actual expected value the aim is to minimize the loss the smaller the loss the better the model it is worth mentioning that stochastic gradient descent is used as the optimizer considering the limited number of samples and the large intra class variance orenstein and beijbom 2017 2 3 3 on chip deployment and analysis the in lab well trained amdnn model contains the model structure and weight parameters we try to keep the on chip lightness so we perform data and model compression and the model structure and weight parameters are sealed and saved in a file with a volume of 13 8 mb the amdnn model is then transferred to the edge ai chip the inference time is less than 0 01 s for each image on both rtx3090 in lab and jetson nano edge ai chip the classification time is even shorter than the sampling interval 5 ml sample over 15 min which is fast enough to classify ifcb images in real time leveraging the linux operation system the chip can easily communicate with the ifcb for real world raw images the installed python and tensorflow packages enable convenient inference the real world raw images are rap resized into 100 100 input images and then are input to amdnn for inference and to achieve real time classification and analysis currently the main statistical indicators include the total number of algae counts and the total number of harmful algae 2 4 model performance evaluation c l a s s a c c u r a c y p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l and f 1 score are evaluation indicators that are frequently used in classification c l a s s a c c u r a c y summarizes the performance of a classification model as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions 1 c l a s s a c c u r a c y t p t n t p t n f p f n where t p is the number of true positives classified by the model t n is the number of true negatives classified by the model f n is the number of false negatives classified by the model and f p is the number of false positives classified by the model p r e c i s i o n represents the probability for a prediction to be true true

c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l 3 results 3 1 classification results on balanced real world dataset 3 1 1 training process fig 10 shows the learning process of dynamically adjusting the learning rate as the stochastic gradient descent iteration progresses the gradient descent algorithm needs to be assigned a learning rate as the control factor of the weight update step commonly used learning rates are 0 01 0 001 and 0 0001 in general the learning rate is more significant at the beginning of training for rapid convergence and tapers off to small values to avoid overshoots as the solutions approach the optimum fig 10 a and 10 b show the accuracy and computed loss function of the training and validation datasets during training respectively the horizontal coordinates are epochs an epoch denotes training the neural network with all the training data for one cycle in an epoch we use all of the data exactly once a forward pass and a backward pass together are counted as one pass in the training process we used the model checkpoints to save the model with performance improvement in epochs 1 50 the learning rate is 0 1 and the rapid oscillation of the loss function indicates the rapid convergence to an optimal answer by the amdnn model in epochs 50 75 the learning rate is 0 01 and from fig 10 b the loss is close to convergence and it is easy to jump to a better local minimum in epochs 75 100 the learning rate is 0 001 the training accuracy converges to 0 999 and the validation accuracy converges to 0 989 at 85 epochs meanwhile the loss function converges to 0 1 for both the training and validation datasets thus we use the model saved at 85 epochs for later model transfer and test training takes around 100 s per epoch on rtx3090 a training time of 2 h and 43 min is taken to reach 0 999 training accuracy and 0 989 validation accuracy at 85 epochs 3 1 2 model visualization model and weight visualization help interpret black box type deep neural networks dnn they help reveal the features and areas considered important by the dnn in the training processes e g the relative important area in deciding whether an image is algae and the specific species the attention mechanism or the important regions in the algal classification by amdnn can be studied by outputting gradient based heat maps for the labeled algal images it can be beneficial to visualize what the convolutional neural network values when it makes a prediction in this paper we use gradient class activation map grad cam to visualize the heatmap selvaraju et al 2017 the grad cam technique utilizes the gradients of the classification score for the final convolutional feature map to identify the parts of an input image that most impact the classification score the places where this gradient is large are exactly the places where the final score depends mostly on the data the red area represents the pixels that have the greatest impact on the classification result and the blue area represents the pixels that have the least impact on the classification result grad cam is class specific here we output a heatmap of the resized algae image corresponding to the predicted label there are k feature maps each of height v and width u for each gray algae image the first step is to compute the gradient with the shape of k v u the weight applied to the feature map a k is the weight w k in the final fully connected layer we do pooling over the height v and the width u and get the alpha value for class c and feature map k with shape k 1 1 based on the gradients thirdly we use each alpha value as the weight of the corresponding feature map and calculate a weighted sum of feature maps as the final grad cam heatmap and we use the relu to emphasize only the positive values and turn all the negative values into 0 for a conventional real world image with complex background or multiple objects the heatmaps generated by grad cam are used to check that the network has paid attention to the target object for the corresponding label selvaraju et al 2017 here for the algae image with 100 100 pixels that contains only a single cell and clean background grad cam is used for checking the area that the network pays attention to fig 11 a shows the heatmaps of images for a few representative algal species with relatively regular shapes it is seen that for algae species with relatively regular shapes e g othercell s10um and vicicitus amdnn is more concerned with the pixels in central area of the algae shown in red on one hand the pixels along the boundary which form the shape of the algal have little effect on getting the classification result on the other hand the pixels in the central area which form the color and texture of the algae heavily affect the classification result for the algal with relatively regular shapes it is good evidence that amdnn has learned without the manually designed features to focus on the color and texture information of these regular shaped algae furthermore according to the accurate classification result we infer that amdnn not only learns to focus on color and texture for the regular shaped algae but also succeeds in distinguishing their species through their unique color and texture information from fig 11 b we can conclude that for algae species with relatively complex shapes such as a sanguinea and long chain diatom amdnn is more concerned with the pixels near the boundary shown as red which carry the shape information of algal and heavily affect the classification result for complex shaped algae from the heat map and the good classification result it can be inferred that amdnn has learned to focus on the shape information for complex shaped algae and succeeded in distinguishing their species through the shape information amdnn has learned to pay attention to the color and texture information for the regular shaped algae and pay attention to the shape information for the complex shaped algae achieving automatically feature selection 3 1 3 classification performance fig 12 illustrates the confusion matrix of amdnn on both training and test dataset the diagonal element is the highlight indicating excellent classification performance table 1 shows the performance of our proposed amdnn on the test set of 25 harmful algae the ai chip with amdnn performs well on all harmful algae species in terms of p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l and f 1 s c o r e the overall accuracy oa for the train set is 99 90 and the overall accuracy for the test set is 99 87 f 1 s c o r e ranges from 0 957 to 1 the precision ranges from 0 956 to 1 except for s k e l e t o n e m a with a precision of 0 9271 table 2 shows the results of our proposed amdnn and other representative models for the test set of 15 harmful algae vggnet is a cnn architecture that has been used frequently in various fields in the last five years simonyan and zisserman 2014 densenet is the baseline network we selected random forest rf and cnn classifier are the models currently being used at our study site the data in the field is passed back to the lab and the matlab calculates the results on the computer in the lab guo et al 2021 we train and evaluate the model on a workstation when the model is well trained we directly deploy the model on an ai chip thus the results on the ai chip are the same as that on the workstation the amdnn performance on all harmful algae species is superior to the other methods with over 99 accuracy for all species the 99 87 average accuracy of amdnn exceeds 3 84 than that of rf it is noteworthy that the algal morphology retaining resizing and augmentation method improves the performance of densenet by 2 69 by simply resizing the improvement is more significant for those species with a large aspect ratio e g long chain diatom and skeletonema receiver operating characteristic roc curve for amdnn on balanced real world dataset is shown in fig 13 a the closer the roc curve is to the 0 1 point the better the model classification performance all roc curves are close to 0 1 showing the good performance of amdnn at all classification thresholds with true positive rate and positive rate the area under the curve auc indicates the area under the roc curve which measures the entire two dimensional area underneath the entire roc curve from 0 0 to 1 1 the closer the auc is to 1 the better the model classification performance the calculated auc for each roc curve is labeled in the figure legend where both micro macro auc is larger than 0 9998 indicating a good in lab classification performance of amdnn 3 2 classification results on unbalanced real world dataset in addition to the real world balanced real world algae dataset the model performance on the real world unbalanced dataset is of utmost importance table 3 shows the model performance on the real world dataset for a sampling period on 1st february 2020 the applicable roc and auc are shown in fig 13 b where the high auc shows a good in the field performance of amdnn it takes our on chip amdnn model less than 5 min to classify a task that would have taken a taxonomist 10 h notably the amdnn considering the domain adaptation outperforms the rf based methods provided by ifcb software as the classification time is even shorter than the sampling interval 5 ml sample over 15 min on site real time classification has become a reality 3 3 hab prediction demonstration and system evaluation since the ifcb deployment in the yim tin tsai marine fish culture zone in 2019 several red tide events have occurred here we choose a typical officially recorded event for the hab prediction demonstration we use our amdnn model to process all the daily raw data in a real time manner in a month from 1st to 28th february 2020 detailed statistical data for all 25 species of algae and for 15 species of harmful algae are shown in fig 14 a and 14 b the real time trend analysis identifies the notable increase in algal counts algal blooms and certain target hab algal species possible toxic event before a red tide event algae species statistics based on continuous on site ai chip based algal classification february 2020 8 00 16 00 with the pink transparent block indicating the officially recorded red tide event from 2 february to 16 february for the 25 target hab classes the othercell s10um has a dominant number among 25 classes and an abnormal increase before red tide occurs for the 15 target hab classes the tendency of scrippsiella and mesodinium are notable and call for further investigation all the data highly agree with the officially recorded red tide event and the number of algae raised abnormally before the red tide happened demonstrating the prediction ability of our edge ai algae monitoring system a hab prediction pseudocode is given to explain better how classification and prediction work with on site data as shown in algorithm 1 table 4 demonstrates the evaluation of the on site edge ai algae monitoring system in comparison with other off site system in terms of hardware and software requirements computing power and efficiency and bandwidth requirements our amdnn on jetson nano developer kit deployment shows the least resources requirement with 0 01s computing time and wireless bandwidth of less than 2 kbps the system even supports satellite communication the video recording of the experimental test results of the selected labeled dataset https drive google com drive folders 1hvg2bktuana16ngf5hkbi1a3mu34q mt usp sharing 4 concluding remarks we have developed an edge ai chip based algae monitoring system for real time algae species classification and hab prediction the amdnn performs on site image processing and classification using a low power edge ai device the power and bandwidth requirements are minimal as compared with off site systems moreover it is much more cost effective and affordable for users who may not have specialist research expertise including environmental managers and fish farmers the edge ai platform is also compatible with traditional models morphology based classification tree type methods and typical deep learning models cnn based classification methods in operational form as illustrated by fig 15 the edge device can output simply the total number of algal species counts indicative of algal blooms and the total number of target harmful hab species in real time this will significantly assist with environmental and fisheries management the regulatory authorities will then be able to assess the situation and decide whether and to what extent field sampling would be required and when to send alerts to the public this provides a robust scientific basis for risk

14968,harmful algal blooms hab are damaging to ecosystem functions and pose challenges to environmental and fisheries management the key to hab management and understanding the complex algal growth dynamics is the development of robust systems for real time monitoring of algae populations and species previous algae classification studies mainly rely on the combination of an in situ imaging flow cytometer and an off site lab based algae classification model such as random forest rf for the analysis of high throughput images an on site ai algae monitoring system on top of an edge ai chip embedded with the proposed algal morphology deep neural network amdnn model is developed to achieve real time algae species classification and hab prediction based on a detailed examination of real world algae images dataset augmentation is first performed consisting of orientation flipping blurring and resizing with aspect ratio preserved rap the dataset augmentation is shown to significantly improve classification performance which is superior to that of the competitive rf model and the attention heatmaps show that for relatively regular shaped algal species e g vicicitus the model weights the color and texture information heavily while the shape related features are more important for complex shaped algae e g chaetoceros the amdnn is tested on a dataset of 11 250 algae images containing the 25 most common hab classes in hong kong subtropical waters with 99 87 test accuracy based on the fast and accurate algae classification the ai chip based on site system is applied to a one month dataset in february 2020 the predicted trends of total cell counts and targeted hab species counts are in good agreement with observations the proposed edge ai algae monitoring system

algae are basic components of aquatic life and play integral roles in the cycling of carbon and other elements food web production and broader ecosystem functions algae are the primary producers that account for almost 50 of the world s carbon biogenic fixation arenas and vas pinto 2014 algal growth dynamics is complex and involves photosynthetic production which depends on nutrient supply e g inorganic nitrogen or phosphorus abiotic factors and hydro meteorological conditions such as solar radiation water temperature vertical water column stability and tides and currents key water quality indicators such as dissolved oxygen do are also closely linked to algae under certain environmental conditions algae can grow to enormously high concentrations algal blooms and interfere with many beneficial uses of water the impact of harmful algal blooms can range from massive fish kills due to severe do depletion to toxins that contaminate the food chain there is a host of interacting physical and biological factors that determine the formation of algal blooms harrison et al 2008 in recent years global climate change and human activities have exacerbated algal blooms anderson et al 2008 paerl and huisman 2008 paerl et al 2016 ralston and moore 2020 in hong kong a total of 956 red tide incidents have been reported during 1975 2019 in particular a severe algal bloom event caused by toxic karenia mikimotoi started in tolo harbour in december 2015 causing massive fish kills due to severe oxygen depletion and possible food poisoning afcd 2020 despite extensive theoretical and field studies over the past decades the prediction of algal blooms remains a challenging problem partly due to the complex spatial and temporal variability of algal dynamics about 300 species can cause a high concentration of red tides worldwide one fourth of this amount is known to be harmful or toxic jessup et al 2009 some species of algae are susceptible to environmental change providing an early warning signal of worsening ecological conditions thus the real time monitoring of the algae population is of great importance for environmental and fisheries management guo et al 2020 2021 currently conventional approaches for algal species monitoring mostly rely on routine monthly field sampling and laboratory analysis of chl a and manual species classification and cell counting li and smayda 2000 such a labor intensive approach is time consuming expensive and requires the availability of experienced taxonomists furthermore such data is typically sparse in time and space and highly inadequate to capture the dynamic changes that accompany algal blooms which can take off and subside over a matter of weeks in sub tropical coastal waters with the increasing availability of real time water quality sensors mainly for physical parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence the real time monitoring and forecast system have been increasingly developed craig et al 2006 guo et al 2020 among them remote sensing based methods provide the state of the art ex situ algae monitoring solution advances in remote sensing technologies have enabled fast and high throughput observations of oceans and lakes trapp et al 2021 from sky or space the satellite based bloom detection is mainly based on the use of ocean color to quantify chl a biomass and organic carbon in the upper water column hill

e g diatoms cyanobacteria chrysophytes from reflectance measurements vander woude et al 2019 however the application of satellite remote sensing to water quality monitoring is limited by overcast skies and poor spatial resolution of satellite images e g in hong kong a cloud amount of over 70 prevails for around 50 of the days cheng et al 2020 more importantly the above ex situ remote sensing methods are not able to provide real time species classification or meet the needs of emergency response fernandez figueroa et al 2022 advances in in situ observation techniques such as ifcb and flowcam provide high resolution high throughput and cytometric image data containing morphology information for algae species classification they offer opportunities in real time algae classification and analysis via morphology approach benfield et al 2007 precise real time image processing is the key to real time algae monitoring system culverhouse et al 2006 although both ifcb and flowcam are configured with software that can be used to identify algae sosik and olson 2007 these research purpose instruments are costly and the use for practical management has yet to be demonstrated over the past decade various classic machine learning ml methods have been used along with analysis of the algal images acquired by the ifcb or flowcam instruments to achieve species identification e g artificial neural network ann to classify algae images based on the extracted features mosleh et al 2012 support vector machines svm and random forest rf ellen et al 2015 grosjean et al 2004 with rapid advances in deep learning dl methods and computing power algal classifiers based on deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks cnn have been shown to perform better than classical ml models baek et al 2022 orenstein and beijbom 2017 pyo et al 2020 2021 gonz√°lez et al 2019 guo et al 2021 correa et al 2017 ot√°lora et al 2021 sonmez et al 2022 park et al 2022 abdullah

3 fully connected layers by systematic network architecture search such a convolutional network achieves 88 59 accuracy on low resolution flowcam images of 19 common algae species p ot√°lora et al compares the performance of descriptive features and images as input to ann for the classification of two freshwater algae chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus almeriensis ot√°lora et al 2021 in 2022 sonmez m e et al captured lab based microalgae images and applied cnn and support vector machine to classify cyanobacteria and chlorophyta algae groups sonmez et al 2022 park et al 2022 and abdullah et al 2022 deployed you only look once yolo method for object detection of multiple algae on freshwater algae collected in the laboratory as an example of practical field deployment in subtropical waters guo et al 2021 deployed ifcb in a tidal inlet and developed real time algae image classifiers with rf and cnn the system requires a 4g cellular terminal to transfer the high throughput high resolution data from the ifcb in the field to an off site workstation for data processing however all the off site lab based algae monitoring systems suffer from the following limitations i in terms of hardware the separation between the high throughput imaging device nearly 2 4 million algae images daily with high resolution in the field and the off site image analysis can introduce significant transfer latency and instability due to limited network bandwidth and a large amount of data transfer during data transmission unstable situations frequently occur due to limited bandwidth and environmental disturbance e g typhoons and bad weather the situation is worse with radio vs wireless communication over long distances say up to 40 km for real time algal species detection it is desirable to have an on site classification system adjacent to or an imaging device in the field ii an effective and accurate algae classification model for the real world remains a challenge and often still requires human assistance harred and campbell 2014 luo et al 2018 existing classification methods work well for high quality sharp balanced and labeled datasets but in the real world we often face low quality blurry unbalanced and unlabeled real world data the less than ideal classification performance on real world data the need for specialist expertise and prohibitive cost present significant obstacles to applying ai based methods in practical settings to overcome the above mentioned challenges we develop an on site edge ai chip based algae monitoring system that achieves on site real time algal species identification with an imaging device the small compact cost effective system is built on a new explainable amdnn model in the following the motivation for developing amdnn and ai chip based methods is first presented the key differences between on site and off site systems are explained second based on a comprehensive analysis of field data of algal images various data augmentation methods including rap are developed to pre condition the images for species detection third the proposed amdnn model is tested for training and validation datasets and shown to outperform all competitive rf based models finally the model is tested on a one month long field data february 2020 to demonstrate its applicability to achieve real time monitoring of total and targeted hab species counts during a red tide in the yim tin tsai marine fish culture zone in tolo harbour hong kong 2 material and methods 2 1 edge ai algae monitoring system deployment traditionally powerful ai apps require data center class systems in a shore based laboratory to operate such as a workstation with gpu such an off site lab based algae monitoring system installed in many places has limitations regarding timely hab detection and data integrity given a large amount of data to transfer limited bandwidth and occasionally unstable connections in the field we design an edge ai computing system to reduce latency and improve bandwidth utilization for faster and more accurate hab monitoring edge computing devices capable of intensive inference can be deployed next to an in situ observation device and the data can be processed on site ai at the edge offers many opportunities that can help to achieve real time intelligent environmental management fig 1 shows an edge ai chip connected to ifcb by wire on a fishfarm raft the continuously captured raw data from ifcb are transferred through the high bandwidth connection with nearly zero delays then the edge ai chip performs on site real time algae classification and analysis the analyzed result is broadcast through a 4g cellular terminal to users per day per hour or concurrently with water quality sampling according to the user s subscribing mode more importantly it can automatically broadcast an alert once an abnormal situation is monitored for example a sudden increase in the concentration of a toxic hab species to dangerous levels our system gets raw data from ifcb the ifcb generates sixty 5 ml samples a day raw data from ifcb contains images sampling time and water volume thousands of images are generated in every sample cycle run and transferred to an edge ai chip for classification and analysis the state of the art deep learning models are not friendly to standard hardware implementation liao et al 2021 recent advances in ai accelerator and deep learning methods have effectively reduced computing resource requirements here the nvidia jetson tx1 is used as the edge ai chip in our deployment tx1 is a state of art low power embedded platform 7 5 15 w 256 core graphics processing units gpus architecture with 256 cuda cores enables server class ai computing performance for deployment with minimal latency gpus have increased the performance by 317 times from 2012 2020 outperforming the predictions of moore s law the jetpack 4 6 1 of the tx1 is loaded with 4 gb of memory four usb 3 0 ports for peripherals hdmi and displayport connectors a micro usb port to supply power or allow remote operation an ethernet port two ribbon connectors for attaching raspberry pi compatible camera modules and a barrel jack socket for providing the additional power needed for intensive computations the ai chip is equipped with a linux operating system the installed environment for our well trained amdnn model and it should be noted that in the algae monitoring task the edge ai chip only performs inference of the neural network model whereas the training of the neural network model is carried out in our lab workstation see later discussion in 2 3 2 1 1 comparison of edge ai algae monitoring and conventional off site lab based analysis fig 2 illustrates the basic idea of our proposed edge ai algae monitoring system fig 2 shows the edge ai algae monitoring system and an off site lab based algae monitoring system respectively for the proposed edge ai chip based system fig 2 a a large bandwidth wire connection is accessible as the ai chip is deployed next to ifcb thus the data transfer delay is near zero thanks to the high computing power and high energy efficiency of the edge ai chip it is easy to deploy without additional power supply requirements while providing the inference result and performing species identification in real time thereby the analyzed result and alert are of low data volume and enable real time broadcasting to users for the conventional off site lab based system fig 2 b the high throughput high resolution raw data from ifcb have to be sent through a wireless connection to a remote shore based laboratory say 40 km away which inevitably involves a large delay because the wireless connection across the sea surface may be unstable and has low bandwidth it becomes a bottleneck in the conventional ai algae monitoring system which leads to delays in hab detection and hab alerts in emergency situations particularly 2 2 study site and data description the yim tin tsai fish culture zone ytt fcz 22 4on 114 2oe is located in the inner part of tolo harbour in the northeastern waters of hong kong fig 3 guo et al 2021 the fcz has a mean depth of around 6 m 3d model computations and field observations have shown that the tidal inlet is weakly flushed with mean tidal velocities in the order of 1 cm s the average flushing time can be estimated to be 14 and 38 days in the wet and dry seasons respectively choi and lee 2004 fish farming is practiced on a number of family operated fish raft platforms located 100 200 m from the shoreline ifcb is on a fish raft equipped with onshore 220 v line electric power supplied via underwater cables the ifcb is mounted securely to the raft platform and positioned to around 1 m depth guo et al 2021 since the deployment of ifcb in march 2019 real world algal morphology data has been continuously generated every day with the help of algae taxonomists the fifteen most common harmful algae species and ten most common harmless algae species in hong kong are picked including diatoms dinoflagellates non diatoms and non dinoflagellates a real world balanced dataset is selected and labeled by three taxonomy experts in hong kong agriculture fisheries and conservation department afcd based on ifcb raw data from march 2019 to june 2020 in ytt covering the 25 most common algae species in hong kong law 2018 examples of the 25 algae species with full names and abbreviations in brackets if applicable are shown in fig 4 in addition a real world unbalanced dataset containing 2759 images is manually labeled by an experienced researcher from the hong kong university of science and technology hkust and afcd guo et al 2021 the dataset is obtained from sampling on 1st february 2020 during the period of a typical algae bloom event reported by hong kong agriculture the dataset is used for testing and showing the effectiveness of amdnn on algal bloom warning in the unbalanced field data 2 3 algal morphology deep neural network amdnn model for species classification deploying a well trained amdnn with demanding generalization ability for real world data requires good sample distribution proper model structure and optimization here we introduce the amdnn in three stages i explainable dataset augmentation fig 5 a ii in lab training of amdnn fig 5 b iii on chip deployment inference and analysis fig 5 c 2 3 1 explainable dataset augmentation the training set consists of labeled algae images selected by taxonomists under top grade microscopes in the laboratory these images are of high quality with well focused images of algae cells the right orientation and representative shape the corresponding images contain sharp edges clear textures and representative shape and size information however the ifcb images may be of much lower quality in a field setting so we analyze the differences between the selected training set and real world data and migrate this data domain difference through the following explainable dataset augmentation methods the first observation is that compared to the training set real world images come with orientations that vary in a wide range so we add a rotation operation during dataset augmentation considering the size of the microchannel and the cropping of the ifcb it is not suitable to add a large angle based on statistics on real data we add rotation operation the second observation is the non chirality in the algal morphology which allows us to do symmetric mirror transformations without changing the image s label information so we add the vertical and horizontal flipping operation during dataset augmentation third the ifcb images in the field are often out of focus or overexposed so we add the blurring operation specifically a low pass filtering gaussian blur operation on the standard training dataset is used to generalize the system to real world datasets we combine rotation flipping and blurring operations so that each of the images gives rise to 20 images after data augmentation direct rotation fig 6 a e horizontally flipping then rotation fig 6 f j vertically flipping then rotation fig 6 k o and blurring then rotation fig 6 p t fourthly the size and aspect ratio distribution of the 25 classes vary in a wide range fig 7 a shows the height and width of images in a labeled dataset of 11 250 images ranging from 10 1000 pixels and 50 1400 pixels respectively the aspect ratio and the image length are also distributed in a wide range the aspect ratio ranges from 0 2 to 25 and the length of the long side ranges from 30 to 1400 such a big variance in image size and ratio leads to a ratio change problem for large aspect ratio images if we resize all the images to the same input size here we notice that for classes with large size which means that one edge of the image is larger than 100 pixels some of them tend to have a large aspect ratio as shown in the yellow circle in fig 7 b thus keeping the aspect ratio information when reducing their size is important while other large algae are in a low aspect ratio as shown in the green circle in fig 7 b they are distinct in size for small algae all less than 100 100 pixels with low aspect ratio as shown in the black circle in fig 7 b in the real world dataset more than 75 of algae are less than 10 um therefore accurate classification of small algae enables early detection of hab in previous work images were resized to 256 256 using a perspective preserving transform along the longest axis of the rois orenstein and beijbom 2017 it will cause the mis classification of such small algae species to preserve the relative size of the small algae reduction of these small algae images black circles by the same factor as that for large algae images green circle should be avoided considering the above information we propose the resizing with aspect ratio preserved rap method to keep the relative size and ratio information in the algal morphology as shown in fig 8 specifically we first compare the raw algae image s height and width with 100 pixels to judge if the image is small we will reduce height and width by two times if it is small otherwise the larger edge of the image is reduced to 100 pixels while keeping the aspect ratio then all the other cells besides the reduced size image within the 100 100 pixels area are filled padded with zero value pixels to illustrate the advantage of the proposed rap method we select a representative algae specie in each circle to illustrate the distribution of algae aspect ratio and size and the result of rap method and the traditional resizing method directly resize raw image into 224 224 as shown in fig 9 the black circle indicates the algae species featuring small size which means the small size is an important feature for classification as shown in fig 9 a representative specie is othercell s10um whose maximum value of width and height has an average value of 76 thus we scale down these images by two times compared with the traditional resizing method rap operation keeps small size features while preserving the aspect ratio well the green circle indicates the algae species whose aspect ratios are narrowly distributed a representative specie is a sanguinea whose aspect ratio has an average value of 1 32 and a standard deviation of 0 17 as shown in fig 9 the rap operation can preserve the aspect ratio precisely the yellow circle indicates the algae with a large aspect ratio whose aspect ratio should be preserved during data processing long chain diatom is a representative algae specie whose aspect ratio ranges from 1 08 to 16 8 as shown in fig 9 the traditional resizing method would cause a deformation while the rap operation preserves the aspect ratio 2 3 2 in lab training of amdnn since the information path from the input layer to the output layer becomes very long with the deepening of the dnn layers the weight gradient becomes very small and even the gradient vanishes the proposed amdnn takes densenet as the backbone to solve the problem of ensuring maximum information and gradient flow by dense block huang et al 2017 densenet is a dnn model with solid generalization ability and it exploits the network by feature reuse more importantly we only use a limited number of layers and parameters with small memory to extract the rich features of algae based on densenet here the selected real world balanced algae dataset with 25 algae species 450 images per class is used for in lab training and test among the real world balanced dataset 315 images per class 70 are used for training after data augmentation the total training dataset consists of 157 500 images from 25 classes among the real world balanced dataset another 45 images per class 10 are split into the validation dataset after data augmentation the total validation dataset consists of 22 500 images from 25 classes among the real world balanced dataset the rest 90 images per class the rest 20 are split into the testing datasets the total testing dataset consists of 2 250 images from 25 classes the input is fed into a convolutional layer with a filter size of 7 7 and 2 2 step size the convolutional layer is followed by a 3 3 maximum pooling layer then two dense blocks and a transition layer are connected at the end of the last dense block a global maximum pool is executed then a fully connected layer with a softmax classifier is connected the number of total parameters of amdnn is 1 044 265 where trainable parameters take account 1 026 169 and non trainable parameters 18 096 relu rectification linear unit keeping only positive values is used as the activation function and the categorical cross entropy loss function is used when adjusting amdnn weights during training it consists of a softmax and a cross entropy loss each predicted class probability is compared to the actual class desired output of zero or one and a loss is calculated that penalizes the probability based on how far it is from the actual expected value the aim is to minimize the loss the smaller the loss the better the model it is worth mentioning that stochastic gradient descent is used as the optimizer considering the limited number of samples and the large intra class variance orenstein and beijbom 2017 2 3 3 on chip deployment and analysis the in lab well trained amdnn model contains the model structure and weight parameters we try to keep the on chip lightness so we perform data and model compression and the model structure and weight parameters are sealed and saved in a file with a volume of 13 8 mb the amdnn model is then transferred to the edge ai chip the inference time is less than 0 01 s for each image on both rtx3090 in lab and jetson nano edge ai chip the classification time is even shorter than the sampling interval 5 ml sample over 15 min which is fast enough to classify ifcb images in real time leveraging the linux operation system the chip can easily communicate with the ifcb for real world raw images the installed python and tensorflow packages enable convenient inference the real world raw images are rap resized into 100 100 input images and then are input to amdnn for inference and to achieve real time classification and analysis currently the main statistical indicators include the total number of algae counts and the total number of harmful algae 2 4 model performance evaluation c l a s s a c c u r a c y p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l and f 1 score are evaluation indicators that are frequently used in classification c l a s s a c c u r a c y summarizes the performance of a classification model as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of

rate as the stochastic gradient descent iteration progresses the gradient descent algorithm needs to be assigned a learning rate as the control factor of the weight update step commonly used learning rates are 0 01 0 001 and 0 0001 in general the learning rate is more significant at the beginning of training for rapid convergence and tapers off to small values to avoid overshoots as the solutions approach the optimum fig 10 a and 10 b show the accuracy and computed loss function of the training and validation datasets during training respectively the horizontal coordinates are epochs an epoch denotes training the neural network with all the training data for one cycle in an epoch we use all of the data exactly once a forward pass and a backward pass together are counted as one pass in the training process we used the model checkpoints to save the model with performance improvement in epochs 1 50 the learning rate is 0 1 and the rapid oscillation of the loss function indicates the rapid convergence to an optimal answer by the amdnn model in epochs 50 75 the learning rate is 0 01 and from fig 10 b the loss is close to convergence and it is easy to jump to a better local minimum in epochs 75 100 the learning rate is 0 001 the training accuracy converges to 0 999 and the validation accuracy converges to 0 989 at 85 epochs meanwhile the loss function converges to 0 1 for both the training and validation datasets thus we use the model saved at 85 epochs for later model transfer and test training takes around 100 s per epoch on rtx3090 a training time of 2 h and 43 min is taken to reach 0 999 training accuracy and 0 989 validation accuracy at 85 epochs 3 1 2 model visualization model and weight visualization help interpret black box type deep neural networks dnn they help reveal the features and areas considered important by the dnn in the training processes e g the relative important area in deciding whether an image is algae and the specific species the attention mechanism or the important regions in the algal classification by amdnn can be studied by outputting gradient based heat maps for the labeled algal images it can be beneficial to visualize what the convolutional neural network values when it makes a prediction in this paper we use gradient class activation map grad cam to visualize the heatmap selvaraju et al 2017 the grad cam technique utilizes the gradients of the classification score for the final convolutional feature map to identify the parts of an input image that most impact the classification score the places where this gradient is large are exactly the places where the final score depends mostly on the data the red area represents the pixels that have the greatest impact on the classification result and the blue area represents the pixels that have the least impact on the classification result grad cam is class specific here we output a heatmap of the resized algae image corresponding to the predicted label there are k feature maps each of height v and width u for each gray algae image the first step is to compute the gradient with the shape of k v u the weight applied to the feature map a k is the weight w k in the final fully connected layer we do pooling over the height v and the width u and get the alpha value for class c and feature map k with shape k 1 1 based on the gradients thirdly we use each alpha value as the weight of the corresponding feature map and calculate a weighted sum of feature maps as the final grad cam heatmap and we use the relu to emphasize only the positive values and turn all the negative values into 0 for a conventional real world image with complex background or multiple objects the heatmaps generated by grad cam are used to check that the network has paid attention to the target object for the corresponding label selvaraju et al 2017 here for the algae image with 100 100 pixels that contains only a single cell and clean background grad cam is used for checking the area that the network pays attention to fig 11 a shows the heatmaps of images for a few representative algal species with relatively regular shapes it is seen that for algae species with relatively regular shapes e g othercell s10um and vicicitus amdnn is more concerned with the pixels in central area of the algae shown in red on one hand the pixels along the boundary which form the shape of the algal have little effect on getting the classification result on the other hand the pixels in the central area which form the color and texture of the algae heavily affect the classification result for the algal with relatively regular shapes it is good evidence that amdnn has learned without the manually designed features to focus on the color and texture information of these regular shaped algae furthermore according to the accurate classification result we infer that amdnn not only learns to focus on color and texture for the regular shaped algae but also succeeds in distinguishing their species through their unique color and texture information from fig 11 b we can conclude that for algae species with relatively complex shapes such as a sanguinea and long chain diatom amdnn is more concerned with the pixels near the boundary shown as red which carry the shape information of algal and heavily affect the classification result for complex shaped algae from the heat map and the good classification result it can be inferred that amdnn has learned to focus on the shape information for complex shaped algae and succeeded in distinguishing their species through the shape information amdnn has learned to pay attention to the color and texture information for the regular shaped algae and pay attention to the shape information for the complex shaped algae achieving automatically feature selection 3 1 3 classification performance fig 12 illustrates the confusion matrix of amdnn on both training and test dataset the diagonal element is the highlight indicating excellent classification performance table 1 shows the performance of our proposed amdnn on the test set of 25 harmful algae the ai chip with amdnn performs well on all harmful algae species in terms of p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l and f 1 s c o r e the overall accuracy oa for the train set is 99 90 and the overall accuracy for the test set is 99 87 f 1 s c o r e ranges from 0 957 to 1 the precision ranges from 0 956 to 1 except for s k e l e t o n e m a with a precision of 0 9271 table 2 shows the results of our proposed amdnn and other representative models for the test set of 15 harmful algae vggnet is a cnn architecture that has been used frequently in various fields in the last five years simonyan and zisserman 2014 densenet is the baseline network we selected random forest rf and cnn classifier are the models currently being used at our study site the data in the field is passed back to the lab and the matlab calculates the results on the computer in the lab guo et al 2021 we train and evaluate the model on a workstation when the model is well trained we directly deploy the model on an ai chip thus the results on the ai chip are the same as that on the workstation the amdnn performance on all harmful algae species is superior to the other methods with over 99 accuracy for all species the 99 87 average accuracy of amdnn exceeds 3 84 than that of rf it is noteworthy that the algal morphology retaining resizing and augmentation method improves the performance of densenet by 2 69 by simply resizing the improvement is more significant for those species with a large aspect ratio e g long chain diatom and skeletonema receiver operating characteristic roc curve for amdnn on balanced real world dataset is shown in fig 13 a the closer the roc curve is to the 0 1 point the better the model classification performance all roc curves are close to 0 1 showing the good performance of amdnn at all classification thresholds with true positive rate and

14969,the versatile reaction possibilities arising from the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions naturally contained in electrocatalytic membrane filtration emf systems are of great valuable in meeting the current complex water treatment requirements but currently most studies only focus on half cell reactions with a single electrocatalytic membrane which limits the research progress of the emf technology here we report a coupling strategy that utilizes the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions to actuate ultra efficient degradation performance with regulable reaction mechanisms an electrocatalytic dual membrane filtration edmf system was established six typical configurations of the edmf system were set up and systematically investigated by adjusting the electrode distance and filtration sequence based on the obtained results of degradation performance and mechanisms a regulation strategy which enabled flexible tuning of direct nonradical oxidation e g h and indirect oxidation e g 1o2 oh ho2 o2 etc was proposed in particular cathodic reactions were found to adversely affect the anodic reactions at the relatively short electrode distance of 0 9 mm anodic reactions could inhibit the generation of 1o2 at short distance of 0 9 mm but promote its generation at long distances of 9 and 17 mm the a c 0 9 configuration achieved the highest degradation performance while the c a 9 configuration was revealed to be much more conducive to 1o2 production overall our findings demonstrate the versatility and tunability of the reaction mechanism and performance of the edmf system due to the flexible coupling of the anodic and cathodic reactions which potentially lays a foundation for future development of ultra efficient mechanism adjustable electrocatalysis technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocatalytic degradation electrocatalytic membrane dual membrane system coupling reactions reaction interaction tuning mechanism data availability all data is included in the manuscript and or supplementary information the source data of this study are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request 1 introduction electrocatalytic membrane filtration emf has been increasingly recognized as one of the most promising candidates for next generation water purification technologies li et al 2022 liu et al 2020c pei et al 2022 sun et al 2021 it enables efficient removal of pollutants at high flux under low trans membrane pressure thereby promisingly outperforming traditional membrane filtration technologies that solely rely on physical retention mechanisms while the electrocatalysis endows membrane filtration with multiple functions e g electrocatalytic degradation wang et al 2019 antifouling song et al 2022 wei et al 2020 electro disinfection ni et al 2020 etc the membrane filtration process also promotes the efficiency of electrocatalysis through enhanced mass transfer gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 and confinement effect guo et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 such an integration of electrocatalysis and membrane filtration brings forth a superior water treatment efficiency li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b wang et al 2022 currently one of the most important research frontiers in tackling the global water crisis is the degradation of ubiquitous emerging pollutants e g per fluorinated compounds endocrine disruptors etc as these pollutants possess diverse chemistry their efficient degradation paths are often varied some pollutants are sensitive to universal oxidation reactions but some pollutants are only sensitive to certain oxidation reactions for example aromatic organic compounds can be more easily degraded by 1o2 than by other ross owing to the specific role of 1o2 in chain initiation and propagation yi et al 2019 consequently advanced electrocatalytic membrane technologies that enable broad oxidation mechanisms can ensure a more reliable treatment of wastewater that commonly comprises complex pollutants in addition on demand adjustment of the oxidation mechanism is also of great significance considering that the influent wastewater quality often changes these require the next generation water purification technologies to be mechanism adjustable and performance efficient which are quite challenging in the development of advanced oxidation technologies naturally electrochemical systems contain two classes of reactions anodic reactions and cathodic reactions liu et al 2020b wang et al 2021 xie et al 2021 schematic 1a what is particularly valuable is the versatile reaction possibilities that arise from the interaction between these reactions primarily based on produced intermediate radicals mo et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 which can be exploited to regulate reaction efficiency and mechanisms but currently most related studies only focus on half cell reactions with a single electrocatalytic membrane used as the anode or cathode paired with a relatively inert counter electrode e g titanium mesh liu et al 2020a 2015 mameda et al 2017 which limits the further development of the emf technology besides the research conclusions of the few existing studies li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b pei et al 2022 based on electrocatalytic dual membrane filtration edmf systems i e utilizing coupled electrocatalytic membranes are relatively preliminary even inconsistent for example peng et al peng et al 2020 reported that the anode cathode a c configuration i e influent flows first through anode and then cathode 0 15 mm for electrode distance exhibited better degradation performance than the c a configuration due to inhibited occurrence of parasitic reactions and higher anode potentials but paradoxically pei et al pei et al 2022 revealed that the electrocatalytic kinetic constant of the c a configuration of a tubular concentric electrode system electrode distance estimated to be 0 79 mm was one order of magnitude higher than that of a c configuration such inconsistence shows the complexity of the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions in the edmf systems the overall reaction behaviors of which may depend on various factors such as filtration sequence electrode distance and so forth to date such edmf systems have not been well studied and the corresponding mechanisms remain ambiguous furthermore the low electrocatalytic efficiency of the prevailing membrane materials also limits the development of the edmf technology in view of the short lifespan of free radicals i e oh ho2 o2 etc liu et al 2021 the ultra efficient production of free radicals is a necessary prerequisite for expanding their range of activities thereby supporting the effective and conspicuous interaction between the anodic and cathodic free radicals but the membrane materials that can achieve such high efficiency are still rarely reported therefore employing high performance electrocatalytic membranes might further enrich the functionalities of edmf systems with enhanced treatment efficiency for example 1o2 which possesses selective degradation capability can be produced via the interactions among the free radicals scheme 1 a but although the edmf technology contains rich development possibilities systematic research reports are still rare in view of the above the current study proposes an edmf based coupling strategy that utilizes the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions to actuate ultra efficient degradation performance with a tunable reaction mechanism an ultra efficient electrocatalytic membrane material tio2 x cn was employed to establish the edmf system for maximized electrocatalytic activity by adjusting the electrode distance and filtration sequence six typical system configurations schematic 1b were set up and systematically investigated based on the obtained results of degradation mechanisms and performance a regulation strategy which enables flexible tuning of direct nonradical oxidation and indirect oxidation by reactive oxygen species ros in a confined space is proposed this study demonstrates the versatility and tunability of coupling anodic and cathodic reactions which potentially lays a foundation for future development of multi membrane based electrocatalysis technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of electrocatalytic tio2 x cn membrane the tio2 x cn membrane used in this study was prepared with a simultaneous electrospinning electrospraying method as demonstrated in the supporting information si figure s1 briefly a polyacrylonitrile solution 10 in n n dimethylformamide w v and a titanium butoxide solution 8 3 in acetic acid v v were separately electrospun electrosprayed to a rotating collector 2500 rpm in a laboratory electrospinning system et 3556h ucalery co ltd china as nanofibers and nanoparticles respectively the obtained membrane precursor was then pre oxidized in air at 280 c for 2 h and then carbonized in ar at 900 c for 1 h the resulted tio2 x cn membrane achieves an ultra efficient electrocatalytic performance due to its topological nanostructures and is also able to excite multiple degradation mechanisms including direct electron transfer oxidation and indirect oxidation 2 2 edmf system as illustrated in the si figure s2 the edmf system mainly comprises an electrocatalytic filtration reactor an external power ss l303spd abf china a reservoir beaker and a peristaltic pump the filtration reactor contains two identical tio2 x cn membranes also serve as electrodes each possesses an effective filtration area of 7 cm2 placed parallel at adjustable spacing three typical distances of 0 9 9 and 17 mm were investigated in this study the influent flows vertically through each membrane in an anode cathode or a cathode anode sequence designated as a c and c a respectively scheme 1b for mechanism investigations the edmf system was operated in a batch mode si figure s2a which allowed cumulative collection of the generated trace and short lived radicals for evaluation of degradation performance the system was operated in a continuous mode si figure s2a which only allowed one run contact for reaction thus resembling practical treatment scenarios an electrocatalytic single membrane filtration esmf system si figure s3a was also set up by replacing one electrocatalytic membrane with an inert titanium mesh as a counter electrode for comparative investigation to demonstrate the unique features and advantages of the edmf system eight representative esmf configurations si figure s3b including a ti 0 9 a ti 0 9 ti a 0 9 ti a 9 c ti 0 9 c ti 0 9 ti c 0 9 and ti c 9 were investigated 2 3 assessment of electrocatalytic degradation efficiency propranolol pro shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china was selected as a model foulant of trace organic pollutants for degradation tests fan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 a synthetic solution comprising 20 mg l 1 of pro and 10 mm of na2so4 was prepared as feed solution a 3 v dc voltage was applied to initiate the electrocatalytic degradation process during filtration the pro concentration was determined using a high performance liquid chromatograph instrument agilent 1200 equipped with a c 18 column agilent eclipse xdb c18 the adopted eluent was a mixture of 7 3 v v 0 1 phosphoric acid solution acetonitrile the corresponding detection wavelength was 218 nm the flow rate and column temperature were set to 1 0 ml min 1 and 30 c respectively the removal rate of pro was calculated as 1 r c 0 c c 0 100 where the c mg l 1 and c 0 mg l 1 are the timely measured associated with t min which indicates the time length since voltage applied and original pro concentrations respectively the apparent pro removal kinetic rate constant k was calculated as 2 ln c c 0 kt the electrical energy per order eeo kwh m 3 order 1 was calculated as 3 eeo ui t 60 10 3 v lo g 10 c 0 c where the u v indicates applied voltage i a indicates measured current and v m3 indicates the total influent volume involved in the reactions 2 4 determination of reactive radical species three types of strategies were employed to detect the production of reactive species electron spin resonance esr tests were first performed to detect 1o2 and oh with an x band esr spectrometer jes fa200 jeol japan the adopted trapping agents for 1o2 and oh were 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp meryer co ltd china and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo meryer co ltd china respectively a solution comprising 100 mm trapping agent temp or dmpo and 10 mm na2so4 was used as the feed solution the adopted parameters for esr spectra recording were 1 mw for microwave power 15 mt for sweep width 0 1 mt for modulation amplitude 100 khz modulation frequency and 120 s for sweep time a series of quenching tests were also conducted to explore the generation of different reactive species including h 1o2 oh and o2 different quenchers were separately added to the influent pro solution during the electrocatalytic filtration tests the adopted quenchers for h 1o2 oh and o2 were ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta 2na 100 mm sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china furfuryl alcohol ffa 100 mm shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china tert butanol tbu 100 mm shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china and p benzoquinone pbq 2 mm shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china respectively for the esmf c ti 0 9 configuration si figure s3b investigated as a control the adopted pro concentration of the influent is 2 mg l 1 because its degradation efficiency at 20 mg l 1 is not high enough to ensure a convincing difference of degradation efficiency when a quencher is added for all the other configurations the adopted pro concentration is 20 mg l 1 based on the data obtained in the quenching tests si figure s4 the contribution ratios of different oxidation mechanisms i e h 1o2 oh and o2 to the degradation of pro were calculated each calculation was based on the data measured at the 10 min of the degradation process besides a potassium titanium oxalate spectrophotometry method wei et al 2019 was employed to determine the concentration of h2o2 3 results and discussion 3 1 coupling anodic and cathodic reactions activates regulable electrocatalytic mechanisms in a typical emf process organic pollutants generally get degraded through two paths direct oxidation primarily by hole h on the membrane and indirect oxidation by generated ros e g oh 1o2 o2 h2o2 etc chaplin 2019 ren et al 2022 yang et al 2011 theoretically the h oxidation only occurs on the anode while the indirect ros oxidation is less spatially restricted owing to the mobility of the ros although the oh is primarily generated on the anode side and the o2 ho2 and h2o2 are mainly produced on the cathode side the filtration inherent in emf can promote the interactions among these ros algurainy and call 2020 gao et al 2020 as well as between the ros and electrodes such filtration enhanced interactions not only expand the spatial range of reactions but also bring forth more opportunities for the evolution of ros therefore compared with the esmf system si figure s3 the edmf system supports more reaction possibilities as its two membrane electrodes are both highly reactive fig 1 summarizes the varied degradation mechanisms in different configurations revealed on the bases of the systematic quenching tests see more detailed data in si figure s4 and h2o2 production measurements see more detailed data in si figure s5 the dotted open boxes in fig 1 indicate the proportions degraded by the corresponding oxidants i e h 1o2 oh and o2 in the quenching tests which were calculated based on the data measured at the 10 min of the electrocatalytic process therefore the length of the open box symbol reflects the amount of generated ros the dotted solid columns in shadow indicate the generated h2o2 concentrations a hypothetical diagram illustrating the electrocatalytic degradation mechanism is also included for each configuration in fig 1 3 1 1 electrocatalytic reactions of control esmf configurations generally different anode cathode coupling patterns lead to different degradation efficiencies with different mechanisms as demonstrated by the comparison between the c ti 0 9 fig 1a and 1b and a ti 0 9 fig 1c and 1d esmf configurations the degradation behavior of the same electrocatalytic membrane is different when used as anode and cathode the anode dominated degradation in a ti 0 9 is primarily owing to the direct h oxidation and indirect 1o2 oxidation while the cathode dominated degradation in c ti 0 9 is mainly ascribed to the indirect oxidation by 1o2 o2 and oh besides as we discuss later fig 2 a c the efficiency of anodic degradation is much higher than that of the cathodic degradation 3 1 2 electrocatalytic reactions of edmf configurations at short electrode distance for the edmf system which includes two electrocatalytic membranes a mutual influence between the cathodic and anodic reactions can be expected the comparison between the c ti 0 9 fig 1a and 1b and c a 0 9 fig 1e and 1f configurations demonstrates that the addition of the anodic membrane activates the direct h oxidation but inhibits the generation of 1o2 a decrease of the o2 contribution ratio is also observed the comparison between the a ti 0 9 fig 1c and 1d and a c 0 9 fig 1g and 1h configurations demonstrates that the addition of the cathodic membrane significantly promotes the oh and h2o2 production but hinders the 1o2 production si figure s6 besides the comparison between the c a 0 9 fig 1e and 1f and a c 0 9 fig 1g and 1h configurations reveals that the filtration sequence can also dramatically influence the degradation efficiency and reaction mechanisms apparently the a c 0 9 significantly outperforms the c a 0 9 in terms of degradation efficiency with a dramatically higher h contribution proportion this suggests that the cathodic reactions can adversely affect the anodic reactions at the relatively short electrode distance of 0 9 mm this adverse effect can be ascribed to the decreased anodic potential due to the increase of local alkalinity and the competitive reaction with pro at anode duo to the presence of h2o2 see more discussion in si appendix section i and figure s7 3 1 3 electrocatalytic reactions of edmf configurations at longer electrode distances when the electrode distance is increased to 9 mm and 17 mm where the anodic and cathodic reactions can be expected to be more independent the degradation mechanisms become quite different especially for the c a scenarios i e c a 9 fig 1i and 1 j c a 17 fig 1m and 1n first of all at the longer distances the overall degradation efficiencies of the c a configurations increase to the same level with those of the a c configurations secondly from the mechanism perspective the direct h oxidation becomes much more significant and a longer electrode distance brings about larger contribution ratios of 1o2 and o2 degradation but less h2o2 production for the c a 9 configuration the degradation is mainly attributed to the h 1o2 o2 and h2o2 oxidation compared with c a 0 9 both the c a 9 and c a 17 configurations activate 1o2 oxidation with also increased contribution of o2 such increases of the 1o2 and o2 contributions due to increased electrode distance can also be observed in the a c configurations fig 1g 1k and 1p these results imply that the generation of 1o2 can be inhibited at short distances e g 0 9 mm but promoted at long distances e g 9 and 17 mm the mechanism behind this will be further discussed in section 3 1 4 besides the oh oxidation becomes negligible when the electrode distance increases for both the c a and a c configurations this reversely implies that the confined space at close electrode distances e g 0 9 mm favors the generation of oh 3 1 4 mechanism of 1o2 production in the edmf system a possible mechanism of 1o2 production is the further oxidation of the precursors o2 on the anode koppenol et al 2010 4 o 2 1 o 2 e while the o2 and its precursors ho2 and h2o2 are mainly produced by the cathodic oxygen reduction reactions g√≥mez mar√≠n et al 2018 sawyer and seo 1977 yeager 1984 5 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 o 2 2 o h 6 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h e 7 o 2 h e h o 2 8 h o 2 o 2 h the o2 in those reactions comes from the dissolved o2 in the solution which plays an important role for the ros production therefore the larger electrode distances in c a 9 and c a 17 offers better opportunities for the occurrence of the reaction 4 resulting in increased 1o2 production at the same time according to the reactions 5 8 1o2 is generated from h2o2 and o2 which leads to the decrease of h2o2 production in c a 9 and c a 17 fig 1i and 1m however a close electrode distance like 0 9 mm may cause the o2 generated on the cathode side to be over oxidized to 3o2 on the anode side due to the higher anodic potential and electric field strength xiao et al 2018 9 o 2 e 3 o 2 thereby reducing the production of 1o2 furthermore the formulae 4 8 indicate a reaction sequence for the formation of 1o2 that is first cathodic then anodic reactions this suggests in principle that the c a configurations are more conducive to the 1o2 production than the a c configurations it corresponds well with the measured data comparing c a 9 with a c 9 and c a 17 with a c 17 fig 1 3 2 coupling anodic and cathodic reactions enables tunable degradation performance as discussed above the changes in electrode distance and filtration sequence can lead to different degradation mechanisms see a summary in si figure s8 which naturally result in different degradation performance 3 2 1 degradation performance of control esmf configurations fig 2a presents the pro degradation curves of a series of esmf configurations with the 0 9 mm electrode distance the calculated degradation efficiencies in terms of k follow an order of a ti 0 9 ti a 0 9 c ti 0 9 ti c 0 9 fig 2c apparently for the esmf system the electrocatalytic membrane performs better as an anode than as a cathode e g the k for a ti 0 9 is 10 times higher than that for c ti 0 9 the corresponding current density in the anode scenario e g a ti 0 9 is also higher than that in the cathode scenario e g c ti 0 9 si figure s9 in addition whether the membrane is used as anode or cathode the configuration in which the influent flows first through the membrane i e a ti 0 9 or c ti 0 9 exhibits better performance than the configuration in which the influent flows first through the ti counter electrode i e ti a 0 9 or ti c 0 9 specifically the removal kinetic rate k for a ti 0 9 is 4 times higher than that for ti a 0 9 but when the distance is increased to 9 mm fig 2b the performance difference caused by such filtration sequence difference becomes insignificant this may be due to the fact that the reactions on the ti electrode side are too weak to span the long distance to affect the reactions on the membrane side nonetheless the electrocatalytic membrane still performs better as an anode than as a cathode in the 9 mm scenarios fig 2c 8 times higher 3 2 2 degradation performance of edmf configurations as the electrocatalytic activity of the employed tio2 x cn membrane is much higher than that of the ti mesh si figure s10 an increased degradation performance can be expected when replacing the ti mesh in the esmf system with the tio2 x cn membrane thus forming the edmf system this is verified by a direct comparison in terms of k between the esmf and edmf systems si figure s11 the edmf system achieved a higher k than the esmf system at the same filtration sequence and electrode distance but it is noteworthy that the edmf system does not always perform better than the esmf system for example the k value in c a 0 9 is much smaller than those in ti a 9 a ti 9 and a ti 0 9 it demonstrates that the degradation performance of the edmf system is also significantly influenced by the electrode distance and filtration sequence in the a c configurations fig 2d the higher distance resulted in a slower decline of pro concentration c c 0 thus a smaller k fig 2f decreased by 47 for 9 mm and 54 for 17 mm the measured average current density also increased as the electrode distance decreased fig 3 a si figure s12 and si figure s13 indicating enhanced electron transfers in addition higher anode potentials were also detected during the degradation process at the smaller distance fig 3b a higher anode potential could also enhance the oxidation capacity of h thus improving the degradation efficiency considering the primary degradation mechanism in the a c configurations is h oxidation achieved by direct electron transfer fig 1 a smaller electrode distance is beneficial to the efficiency improvement for a c configurations but in the c a scenarios the electrocatalytic efficiency improves by 4 times while increasing the spacing from 0 9 mm to 9 mm but the difference is very insignificant between the c a 9 and c a 17 fig 2e this efficiency increase should be due to the gradually enhanced direct h oxidation and indirect 1o2 and o2 oxidation at the 0 9 mm distance where the two membranes are fairly close the production of 1o2 can be inhibited due to excessive oxidation on the anode side in addition as the h oxidation is also an important degradation mechanism the measured anodic potential at a larger distance e g 9 mm is higher than that at a smaller distance e g 0 9 mm fig 3c which is different from the a c scenario however the impact of further increasing the spacing from 9 mm to 17 mm seems to be very limited therefore a moderate electrode distance i e 9 mm is beneficial to the efficiency improvement for c a configurations as for the filtration sequence in the edmf system at the distance of 0 9 mm the a c configuration achieved a much higher degradation efficiency 33 5 higher in terms of k than the c a configuration fig 2f by comparison the anodic potentials of the a c configurations are higher than those of the c a configurations fig 3d considering the membrane performs better as an anode than as a cathode and also functions better as the upstream electrode the a c 0 9 configuration can be determined as the optimal configuration with the highest degradation performance it is noteworthy that at the long distances e g 9 and 17 mm the c a configurations in return achieve 1 5 times higher degradation efficiencies than the a c configurations fig 2f but the difference between a ti and ti a or between c ti and ti c is insignificant fig 2c at 9 mm this demonstrates that when both the anode and cathode possess high electrocatalytic activities they can maintain their interactions even at a long distance apparently the anode cathode coupling strategy based on the edmf system actuates a great flexibility for regulating the mechanisms and performance of electrocatalytic reactions as shown in fig 1i and 1k the difference in degradation performance between c a 9 and a c 9 is mainly due to the generation efficiency of 1o2 fig 3e further showed the difference in the contributed percentage of 1o2 oxidation mechanisms over time for c a 9 and a c 9 configuration it is worth a further study to develop a system that can stimulate a higher percentage of contribution to the 1o2 based degradation mechanism at the distances of 9 mm the contribution of anode and cathode membranes to pro removal in c a 9 and a c 9 can be analyzed respectively see fig 3f and si appendix section ‚Ö± pro removal in a c 9 almost occurred at the anode side while in c a 9 the cathode also contributed to pro removal this indicates that c a 9 configuration can give full play to the dual membrane electrodes and realize the improvement of pollutant degradation efficiency through coupling anodic and cathodic electrocatalytic reactions 3 3 coupling anodic and cathodic reactions enables tunable and selective production of ros the above sections demonstrate that the edmf system enables broad and tunable oxidation mechanisms which allows selective production of ros for different degradation requirements for example for aromatic organic compounds which can be more easily degraded by 1o2 the edmf system can be adjusted to a configuration that facilitates the efficient generation of 1o2 as revealed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the contribution ratio of 1o2 in the c a 9 configuration was significantly higher than those in the a c 0 9 and c a 0 9 configurations suggesting that the generation of 1o2 can be controlled by deliberately modifying the cathode anode coupling mode the productions of 1o2 in different configurations were directly measured by esr tests fig 4 under the same ordinate scale an obvious temp 1o2 signal was detected in the c a 9 configuration after the voltage was applied by contrast only a small temp 1o2 signal was detected in the a c 9 configuration and no temp 1o2 signal was detected in the a c 0 9 and c a 0 9 configurations further an increased degradation rate of pro in a deuterium oxide d2o solvent environment was observed see si figure s14 which should be generally ascribed to the 1o2 specific kinetic solvent isotope effect and confirms the existence of 1o2 zhao et al 2022 these results demonstrate that the specific c a 9 configuration is much more conducive to the production of 1o2 si figure s15 presents another example showing the controlled generation of oh an obvious triplet peak signal of the dimer product generated by excessive oxidation of dmpo by oh fontmorin et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a is observed only in the c a 0 9 configuration it is noteworthy that the oh captured by dmpo is mainly the proportion dissolved in the solution ohdis it is difficult for dmpo to capture the oh adsorbed on the catalyst surface ohads according to the quenching tests fig 1e and 1g and esr dmpo tests si figure s15 results more ohdis was produced in the c a while more ohads was produced in the a c 3 4 appropriately coupling anodic cathodic reaction enables ultra efficient electrocatalysis the above analyses also reveal that the electrocatalytic degradation performance of the edmf system are significantly dominated by the electrode material and operating configuration a proper optimization can give rise to a great increase of degradation efficiency the a c 0 9 configuration using two tio2 x cn membranes can be considered as the optimal configuration with the goal of maximum degradation efficiency consequently the electrocatalytic performance in terms of pro degradation was further evaluated under the continuous mode si figure s2a and 2 5 v voltage see detailed optimization in si figure s16 as shown in fig 5 a the a c 0 9 system successfully maintains a 90 pro removal in both the filtration flux of 947 l m 2 h 1 1 25 s contact time and 429 l m 2 h 1 2 5 s contact time the corresponding energy consumptions in terms of eeo for both fluxes are very low fig 5a and si appendix section ‚Ö≤ these performance data were further compared with those in previously published related studies listed in si table s2 the apparent kinetic rate constant k and 1 eeo were selected as the indexes to represent degradation performance and energy consumption respectively as presented in fig 5b the a c 0 9 system tested in the current study achieved a superior electrocatalytic degradation efficiency at a very low energy consumption suggesting great advantages for practical applications in recent years the studies in the membrane based electrocatalysis field focus more on developing novel membrane materials but neglect the great potential of utilizing the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions in this work we found that even using the same membrane material different system configurations by adjusting electrode

14969,the versatile reaction possibilities arising from the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions naturally contained in electrocatalytic membrane filtration emf systems are of great valuable in meeting the current complex water treatment requirements but currently most studies only focus on half cell reactions with a single electrocatalytic membrane which limits the research progress of the emf technology here we report a coupling strategy that utilizes the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions to actuate ultra efficient degradation performance with regulable reaction mechanisms an electrocatalytic dual membrane filtration edmf system was established six typical configurations of the edmf system were set up and systematically investigated by

corresponding authors upon reasonable request 1 introduction electrocatalytic membrane filtration emf has been increasingly recognized as one of the most promising candidates for next generation water purification technologies li et al 2022 liu et al 2020c pei et al 2022 sun et al 2021 it enables efficient removal of pollutants at high flux under low trans membrane pressure thereby promisingly outperforming traditional membrane filtration technologies that solely rely on physical retention mechanisms while the electrocatalysis endows membrane filtration with multiple functions e g electrocatalytic degradation wang et al 2019 antifouling song et al 2022 wei et al 2020 electro disinfection ni et al 2020 etc the membrane filtration process also promotes the efficiency of electrocatalysis through enhanced mass transfer gao et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 and confinement effect guo et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 such an integration of electrocatalysis and membrane filtration brings forth a superior water treatment efficiency li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b wang et al 2022 currently one of the most important research frontiers in tackling the global water crisis is the degradation of ubiquitous emerging pollutants e g per fluorinated compounds endocrine disruptors etc as these pollutants possess diverse chemistry their efficient degradation paths are often varied some pollutants are sensitive to universal oxidation reactions but some pollutants are only sensitive to certain oxidation reactions for example aromatic organic compounds can be more easily degraded by 1o2 than by other ross owing to the specific role of 1o2 in chain initiation and propagation yi et al 2019 consequently advanced electrocatalytic membrane technologies that enable broad oxidation mechanisms can ensure a more reliable treatment of wastewater that commonly comprises complex pollutants in addition on demand adjustment of the oxidation mechanism is also of great significance considering that the influent wastewater quality often changes these require the next generation water purification technologies to be mechanism adjustable and performance efficient which are quite challenging in the development of advanced oxidation technologies naturally electrochemical systems contain two classes of reactions anodic reactions and cathodic reactions liu et al 2020b wang et al 2021 xie et al 2021 schematic 1a what is particularly valuable is the versatile reaction possibilities that arise from the interaction between these reactions primarily based on produced intermediate radicals mo et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 which can be exploited to regulate reaction efficiency and mechanisms but currently most related studies only focus on half cell reactions with a single electrocatalytic membrane used as the anode or cathode paired with a relatively inert counter electrode e g titanium mesh liu et al 2020a 2015 mameda et al 2017 which limits the further development of the emf technology besides the research conclusions of the few existing studies li et al 2020 liu et al 2020b pei et al 2022 based on electrocatalytic dual membrane filtration edmf systems i e utilizing coupled electrocatalytic membranes are relatively preliminary even inconsistent for example peng et al peng et al 2020 reported that the anode cathode a c configuration i e influent flows first through anode and then cathode 0 15 mm for electrode distance exhibited better degradation performance than the c a configuration due to inhibited occurrence of parasitic reactions and higher anode potentials but paradoxically pei et al pei et al 2022 revealed that the electrocatalytic kinetic constant of the c a configuration of a tubular concentric electrode system electrode distance estimated to be 0 79 mm was one order of magnitude higher than that of a c configuration such inconsistence shows the complexity of the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions in the edmf systems the overall reaction behaviors of which may depend on various factors such as filtration sequence electrode distance and so forth to date such edmf systems have not been well studied and the corresponding mechanisms remain ambiguous furthermore the low electrocatalytic efficiency of the prevailing membrane materials also limits the development of the edmf technology in view of the short lifespan of free radicals i e oh ho2 o2 etc liu et al 2021 the ultra efficient production of free radicals is a necessary prerequisite for expanding their range of activities thereby supporting the effective and conspicuous interaction between the anodic and cathodic free radicals but the membrane materials that can achieve such high efficiency are still rarely reported therefore employing high performance electrocatalytic membranes might further enrich the functionalities of edmf systems with enhanced treatment efficiency for example 1o2 which possesses selective degradation capability can be produced via the interactions among the free radicals scheme 1 a but although the edmf technology contains rich development possibilities systematic research reports are still rare in view of the above the current study proposes an edmf based coupling strategy that utilizes the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions to actuate ultra efficient degradation performance with a tunable reaction mechanism an ultra efficient electrocatalytic membrane material tio2 x cn was employed to establish the edmf system for maximized electrocatalytic activity by adjusting the electrode distance and filtration sequence six typical system configurations schematic 1b were set up and systematically investigated based on the obtained results of degradation mechanisms and performance a regulation strategy which enables flexible tuning of direct nonradical oxidation and indirect oxidation by reactive oxygen species ros in a confined space is proposed this study demonstrates the versatility and tunability of coupling anodic and cathodic reactions which potentially lays a foundation for future development of multi membrane based electrocatalysis technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of electrocatalytic tio2 x cn membrane the tio2 x cn membrane used in this study was prepared with a simultaneous electrospinning electrospraying method as demonstrated in the supporting information si figure s1 briefly a polyacrylonitrile solution 10 in n n dimethylformamide w v and a titanium butoxide solution 8 3 in acetic acid v v were separately electrospun electrosprayed to a rotating collector 2500 rpm in a laboratory electrospinning system et 3556h ucalery co ltd china as nanofibers and nanoparticles respectively the obtained membrane precursor was then pre oxidized in air at 280 c for 2 h and then carbonized in ar at 900 c for 1 h the resulted tio2 x cn membrane achieves an ultra efficient electrocatalytic performance due to its topological nanostructures and is also able to excite multiple degradation mechanisms including direct electron transfer oxidation and indirect oxidation 2 2 edmf system as illustrated in the si figure s2 the edmf system mainly comprises an electrocatalytic filtration reactor an external power ss l303spd abf china a reservoir beaker and a peristaltic pump the filtration reactor contains two identical tio2 x cn membranes also serve as electrodes each possesses an effective filtration area of 7 cm2 placed parallel at adjustable spacing three typical distances of 0 9 9 and 17 mm were investigated in this study the influent flows vertically through each membrane in an anode cathode or a cathode anode sequence designated as a c and c a respectively scheme 1b for mechanism investigations the edmf system was operated in a batch mode si figure s2a which allowed cumulative collection of the generated trace and short lived radicals for evaluation of degradation performance the system was operated in a continuous mode si figure s2a which only allowed one run contact for reaction thus resembling practical treatment scenarios an electrocatalytic single membrane filtration esmf system si figure s3a was also set up by replacing one electrocatalytic membrane with an inert titanium mesh as a counter electrode for comparative investigation to demonstrate the unique features and advantages of the edmf system eight representative esmf configurations si figure s3b including a ti 0 9 a ti 0 9 ti a 0 9 ti a 9 c ti 0 9 c ti 0 9 ti c 0 9 and ti c 9 were investigated 2 3 assessment of electrocatalytic degradation efficiency propranolol pro shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china was selected as a model foulant of trace organic pollutants for degradation tests fan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 a synthetic solution comprising 20 mg l 1 of pro and 10 mm of na2so4 was prepared as feed solution a 3 v dc voltage was applied to initiate the electrocatalytic degradation process during filtration the pro concentration was determined using a high performance liquid chromatograph instrument agilent 1200 equipped with a c 18 column agilent eclipse xdb c18 the adopted eluent was a mixture of 7 3 v v 0 1 phosphoric acid solution acetonitrile the corresponding detection wavelength was 218 nm the flow rate and column temperature were set to 1 0 ml min 1 and 30 c respectively the removal rate of pro was calculated as 1 r c 0 c c 0 100 where the c mg l 1 and c 0 mg l 1 are the timely measured associated with t min which indicates the time length since voltage applied and original pro concentrations respectively the apparent pro removal kinetic rate constant k was calculated as 2 ln c c 0 kt the electrical energy per order eeo kwh m 3 order 1 was calculated as 3 eeo ui t 60 10 3 v lo g 10 c 0 c where the u v indicates applied voltage i a indicates measured current and v m3 indicates the total influent volume involved in the reactions 2 4 determination of reactive radical species three types of strategies were employed to detect the production of reactive species electron spin resonance esr tests were first performed to detect 1o2 and oh with an x band esr spectrometer jes fa200 jeol japan the adopted trapping agents for 1o2 and oh were 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidone temp meryer co ltd china and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo meryer co ltd china respectively a solution comprising 100 mm trapping agent temp or dmpo and 10 mm na2so4 was used as the feed solution the adopted parameters for esr spectra recording were 1 mw for microwave power 15 mt for sweep width 0 1 mt for modulation amplitude 100 khz modulation frequency and 120 s for sweep time a series of quenching tests were also conducted to explore the generation of different reactive species including h 1o2 oh and o2 different quenchers were separately added to the influent pro solution during the electrocatalytic filtration tests the adopted quenchers for h 1o2 oh and o2 were ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta 2na 100 mm sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china furfuryl alcohol ffa 100 mm shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china tert butanol tbu 100 mm shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china and p benzoquinone pbq 2 mm shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd china respectively for the esmf c ti 0 9 configuration si figure s3b investigated as a control the adopted pro concentration of the influent is 2 mg l 1 because its degradation efficiency at 20 mg l 1 is not high enough to ensure a convincing difference of degradation efficiency when a quencher is added for all the other configurations the adopted pro concentration is 20 mg l 1 based on the data obtained in the quenching tests si figure s4 the contribution ratios of different oxidation mechanisms i e h 1o2 oh and o2 to the degradation of pro were calculated each calculation was based on the data measured at the 10 min of the degradation process besides a potassium titanium oxalate spectrophotometry method wei et al 2019 was employed to determine the concentration of h2o2 3 results and discussion 3 1 coupling anodic and cathodic reactions activates regulable electrocatalytic mechanisms in a typical emf process organic pollutants generally get degraded through two paths direct oxidation primarily by hole h on the membrane and indirect oxidation by generated ros e g oh 1o2 o2 h2o2 etc chaplin 2019 ren et al 2022 yang et al 2011 theoretically the h oxidation only occurs on the anode while the indirect ros oxidation is less spatially restricted owing to the mobility of the ros although the oh is primarily generated on the anode side and the o2 ho2 and h2o2 are mainly produced on the cathode side the filtration inherent in emf can promote the interactions among these ros algurainy and call 2020 gao et al 2020 as well as between the ros and electrodes such filtration enhanced interactions not only expand the spatial range of reactions but also bring forth more opportunities for the evolution of ros therefore compared with the esmf system si figure s3 the edmf system supports more reaction possibilities as its two membrane electrodes are both highly reactive fig 1 summarizes the varied degradation mechanisms in different configurations revealed on the bases of the systematic quenching tests see more detailed data in si figure s4 and h2o2 production measurements see more detailed data in si figure s5 the dotted open boxes in fig 1 indicate the proportions degraded by the corresponding oxidants i e h 1o2 oh and o2 in the quenching tests which were calculated based on the data measured at the 10 min of the electrocatalytic process therefore the length of the open box symbol reflects the amount of generated ros the dotted solid columns in shadow indicate the generated h2o2 concentrations a hypothetical diagram illustrating the electrocatalytic degradation mechanism is also included for each configuration in fig 1 3 1 1 electrocatalytic reactions of control esmf configurations generally different anode cathode coupling patterns lead to different degradation efficiencies with different mechanisms as demonstrated by the comparison between the c ti 0 9 fig 1a and 1b and a ti 0 9 fig 1c and 1d esmf configurations the degradation behavior of the same electrocatalytic membrane is different when used as anode and cathode the anode dominated degradation in a ti 0 9 is primarily owing to the direct h oxidation and indirect 1o2 oxidation while the cathode dominated degradation in c ti 0 9 is mainly ascribed to the indirect oxidation by 1o2 o2 and oh besides as we discuss later fig 2 a c the efficiency of anodic degradation is much higher than that of the cathodic degradation 3 1 2 electrocatalytic reactions of edmf configurations at short electrode distance for the edmf system which includes two electrocatalytic membranes a mutual influence between the cathodic and anodic reactions can be expected the comparison between the c ti 0 9 fig 1a and 1b and c a 0 9 fig 1e and 1f configurations demonstrates that the addition of the anodic membrane activates the direct h oxidation but inhibits the generation of 1o2 a decrease of the o2 contribution ratio is also observed the comparison between the a ti 0 9 fig 1c and 1d and a c 0 9 fig 1g and 1h configurations demonstrates that the addition of the cathodic membrane significantly promotes the oh and h2o2 production but hinders the 1o2 production si figure s6 besides the comparison between the c a 0 9 fig 1e and 1f and a c 0 9 fig 1g and 1h configurations reveals that the filtration sequence can also dramatically influence the degradation efficiency and reaction mechanisms apparently the a c 0 9 significantly outperforms the c a 0 9 in terms of degradation efficiency with a dramatically higher h contribution proportion this suggests that the cathodic reactions can adversely affect the anodic reactions at the relatively short electrode distance of 0 9 mm this adverse effect can be ascribed to the decreased anodic potential due to the increase of local alkalinity and the competitive reaction with pro at anode duo to the presence of h2o2 see more discussion in si appendix section i and figure s7 3 1 3 electrocatalytic reactions of edmf configurations at longer electrode distances when the electrode distance is increased to 9 mm and 17 mm where the anodic and cathodic reactions can be expected to be more independent the degradation mechanisms become quite different especially for the c a scenarios i e c a 9 fig 1i and 1 j c a 17 fig 1m and 1n first of all at the longer distances the overall degradation efficiencies of the c a configurations increase to the same level with those of the a c configurations secondly from the mechanism perspective the direct h oxidation becomes much more significant and a longer electrode distance brings about larger contribution ratios of 1o2 and o2 degradation but less h2o2 production for the c a 9 configuration the degradation is mainly attributed to the h 1o2 o2 and h2o2 oxidation compared with c a 0 9 both the c a 9 and c a 17 configurations activate 1o2 oxidation with also increased contribution of o2 such increases of the 1o2 and o2 contributions due to increased electrode distance can also be observed in the a c configurations fig 1g 1k and 1p these results imply that the generation of 1o2 can be inhibited at short distances e g 0 9 mm but promoted at long distances e g 9 and 17 mm the mechanism behind this will be further discussed in section 3 1 4 besides the oh oxidation becomes negligible when the electrode distance increases for both the c a and a c configurations this reversely implies that the confined space at close electrode distances e g 0 9 mm favors the generation of oh 3 1 4 mechanism of 1o2 production in the edmf system a possible mechanism of 1o2 production is the further oxidation of the precursors o2 on the anode koppenol et al 2010 4 o 2 1 o 2 e while the o2 and its precursors ho2 and h2o2 are mainly produced by the cathodic oxygen reduction reactions g√≥mez mar√≠n et al 2018 sawyer and seo 1977 yeager 1984 5 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 o 2 2 o h 6 h 2 o 2 h o 2 h e 7 o 2 h e h o 2 8 h o 2 o 2 h the o2 in those reactions comes from the dissolved o2 in the solution which plays an important role for the ros production therefore the larger electrode distances in c a 9 and c a 17 offers better opportunities for the occurrence of the reaction 4 resulting in increased 1o2 production at the same time according to the reactions 5 8 1o2 is generated from h2o2 and o2 which leads to the decrease of h2o2 production in c a 9 and c a 17 fig 1i and 1m however a close electrode distance like 0 9 mm may cause the o2 generated on the cathode side to be over oxidized to 3o2 on the anode side due to the higher anodic potential and electric field strength xiao et al 2018 9 o 2 e 3 o 2 thereby reducing the production of 1o2 furthermore the formulae 4 8 indicate a reaction sequence for the formation of 1o2 that is first cathodic then anodic reactions this suggests in principle that the c a configurations are more conducive to the 1o2 production than the a c configurations it corresponds well with the measured data comparing c a 9 with a c 9 and c a 17 with a c 17 fig 1 3 2 coupling anodic and cathodic reactions enables tunable degradation performance as discussed above the changes in electrode distance and filtration sequence can lead to different degradation mechanisms see a summary in si figure s8 which naturally result in different degradation performance 3 2 1 degradation performance of control esmf configurations fig 2a presents the pro degradation curves of a series of esmf configurations with the 0 9 mm electrode distance the calculated degradation efficiencies in terms of k follow an order of a ti 0 9 ti a 0 9 c ti 0 9 ti c 0 9 fig 2c apparently for the esmf system the electrocatalytic membrane performs better as an anode than as a cathode e g the k for a ti 0 9 is 10 times higher than that for c ti 0 9 the corresponding current density in the anode scenario e g a ti 0 9 is also higher than that in the cathode scenario e g c ti 0 9 si figure s9 in addition whether the membrane is used as anode or cathode the configuration in which the influent flows first through the membrane i e a ti 0 9 or c ti 0 9 exhibits better performance than the configuration in which the influent flows first through the ti counter electrode i e ti a 0 9 or ti c 0 9 specifically the removal kinetic rate k for a ti 0 9 is 4 times higher than that for ti a 0 9 but when the distance is increased to 9 mm fig 2b the performance difference caused by such filtration sequence difference becomes insignificant this may be due to the fact that the reactions on the ti electrode side are too weak to span the long distance to affect the reactions on the membrane side nonetheless the electrocatalytic membrane still performs better as an anode than as a cathode in the 9 mm scenarios fig 2c 8 times higher 3 2 2 degradation performance of edmf configurations as the electrocatalytic activity of the employed tio2 x cn membrane is much higher than that of the ti mesh si figure s10 an increased degradation performance can be expected when replacing the ti mesh in the esmf system with the tio2 x cn membrane thus forming the edmf system this is verified by a direct comparison in terms of k between the esmf and edmf systems si figure s11 the edmf system achieved a higher k than the esmf system at the same filtration sequence and electrode distance but it is noteworthy that the edmf system does not always perform better than the esmf system for example the k value in c a 0 9 is much smaller than those in ti a 9 a ti 9 and a ti 0 9 it demonstrates that the degradation performance of the edmf system is also significantly influenced by the electrode distance and filtration sequence in the a c configurations fig 2d the higher distance resulted in a slower decline of pro concentration c c 0 thus a smaller k fig 2f decreased by 47 for 9 mm and 54 for 17 mm the measured average current density also increased as the electrode distance decreased fig 3 a si figure s12 and si figure s13 indicating enhanced electron transfers in addition higher anode potentials were also detected during the degradation process at the smaller distance fig 3b a higher anode potential could also enhance the oxidation capacity of h thus improving the degradation efficiency considering the primary degradation mechanism in the a c configurations is h oxidation achieved by direct electron transfer fig 1 a smaller electrode distance is beneficial to the efficiency improvement for a c configurations but in the c a scenarios the electrocatalytic efficiency improves by 4 times while increasing the spacing from 0 9 mm to 9 mm but the difference is very insignificant between the c a 9 and c a 17 fig 2e this efficiency increase should be due to the gradually enhanced direct h oxidation and indirect 1o2 and o2 oxidation at the 0 9 mm distance where the two membranes are fairly close the production of 1o2 can be inhibited due to excessive oxidation on the anode side in addition as the h oxidation is also an important degradation mechanism the measured anodic potential at a larger distance e g 9 mm is higher than that at a smaller distance e g 0 9 mm fig 3c which is different from the a c scenario however the impact of further increasing the spacing from 9 mm to 17 mm seems to be very limited therefore a moderate electrode distance i e 9 mm is beneficial to the efficiency improvement for c a configurations as for the filtration sequence in the edmf system at the distance of 0 9 mm the a c configuration achieved a much higher degradation efficiency 33 5 higher in terms of k than the c a configuration fig 2f by comparison the anodic potentials of the a c configurations are higher than those of the c a configurations fig 3d considering the membrane performs better as an anode than as a cathode and also functions better as the upstream electrode the a c 0 9 configuration can be determined as the optimal configuration with the highest degradation performance it is noteworthy that at the long distances e g 9 and 17 mm the c a configurations in return achieve 1 5 times higher degradation efficiencies than the a c configurations fig 2f but the difference between a ti and ti a or between c ti and ti c is insignificant fig 2c at 9 mm this demonstrates that when both the anode and cathode possess high electrocatalytic activities they can maintain their interactions even at a long distance apparently the anode cathode coupling strategy based on the edmf system actuates a great flexibility for regulating the mechanisms and performance of electrocatalytic reactions as shown in fig 1i and 1k the difference in degradation performance between c a 9 and a c 9 is mainly due to the generation efficiency of 1o2 fig 3e further showed the difference in the contributed percentage of 1o2 oxidation mechanisms over time for c a 9 and a c 9 configuration it is worth a further study to develop a system that can stimulate a higher percentage of contribution to the 1o2 based degradation mechanism at the distances of 9 mm the contribution of anode and cathode membranes to pro removal in c a 9 and a c 9 can be analyzed respectively see fig 3f and si appendix section ‚Ö± pro removal in a c 9 almost occurred at the anode side while in c a 9 the cathode also contributed to pro removal this indicates that c a 9 configuration can give full play to the dual membrane electrodes and realize the improvement of pollutant degradation efficiency through coupling anodic and cathodic electrocatalytic reactions 3 3 coupling anodic and cathodic reactions enables tunable and selective production of ros the above sections demonstrate that the edmf system enables broad and tunable oxidation mechanisms which allows selective production of ros for different degradation requirements for example for aromatic organic compounds which can be more easily degraded by 1o2 the edmf system can be adjusted to a configuration that facilitates the efficient generation of 1o2 as revealed in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the contribution ratio of 1o2 in the c a 9 configuration was significantly higher than those in the a c 0 9 and c a 0 9 configurations suggesting that the generation of 1o2 can be controlled by deliberately modifying the cathode anode coupling mode the productions of 1o2 in different configurations were directly measured by esr tests fig 4 under the same ordinate scale an obvious temp 1o2 signal was detected in the c a 9 configuration after the voltage was applied by contrast only a small temp 1o2 signal was detected in the a c 9 configuration and no temp 1o2 signal was detected in the a c 0 9 and c a 0 9 configurations further an increased degradation rate of pro in a deuterium oxide d2o solvent environment was observed see si figure s14 which should be generally ascribed to the 1o2 specific kinetic solvent isotope effect and confirms the existence of 1o2 zhao et al 2022 these results demonstrate that the specific c a 9 configuration is much more conducive to the production of 1o2 si figure s15 presents another example showing the controlled generation of oh an obvious triplet peak signal of the dimer product generated by excessive oxidation of dmpo by oh fontmorin et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a is observed only in the c a 0 9 configuration it is noteworthy that the oh captured by dmpo is mainly the proportion dissolved in the solution ohdis it is difficult for dmpo to capture the oh adsorbed on the catalyst surface ohads according to the quenching tests fig 1e and 1g and esr dmpo tests si figure s15 results more ohdis was produced in the c a while more ohads was produced in the a c 3 4 appropriately coupling anodic cathodic reaction enables ultra efficient electrocatalysis the above analyses also reveal that the electrocatalytic degradation performance of the edmf system are significantly dominated by the electrode material and operating configuration a proper optimization can give rise to a great increase of degradation efficiency the a c 0 9 configuration using two tio2 x cn membranes can be considered as the optimal configuration with the goal of maximum degradation efficiency consequently the electrocatalytic performance in terms of pro degradation was further evaluated under the continuous mode si figure s2a and 2 5 v voltage see detailed optimization in si figure s16 as shown in fig 5 a the a c 0 9 system successfully maintains a 90 pro removal in both the filtration flux of 947 l m 2 h 1 1 25 s contact time and 429 l m 2 h 1 2 5 s contact time the corresponding energy consumptions in terms of eeo for both fluxes are very low fig 5a and si appendix section ‚Ö≤ these performance data were further compared with those in previously published related studies listed in si table s2 the apparent kinetic rate constant k and 1 eeo were selected as the indexes to represent degradation performance and energy consumption respectively as presented in fig 5b the a c 0 9 system tested in the current study achieved a superior electrocatalytic degradation efficiency at a very low energy consumption suggesting great advantages for practical applications in recent years the studies in the membrane based electrocatalysis field focus more on developing novel membrane materials but neglect the great potential of utilizing the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions in this work we found that even using the same membrane material different system configurations by adjusting electrode distance and filtration sequence can result in significantly different electrocatalytic efficiencies and mechanism we believe that in the edmf system there are more interesting interaction mechanisms to be explored it is suggested that the specific configuration and operational condition of the electrochemical systems should also be carefully considered in addition to the development of new membrane materials 4 conclusion the current study presents a coupling strategy that utilizes the interaction between the anodic and cathodic reactions to actuate ultra efficient degradation performance with regulable reaction mechanisms an edmf system was established using an ultra efficient electrocatalytic membrane material for maximized electrocatalytic activity by adjusting the electrode distance and filtration sequence six typical system configurations were set up and systematically investigated based on the obtained results of degradation performance and mechanisms a regulation strategy which enabled flexible tuning of direct nonradical oxidation e g h and indirect oxidation e g 1o2 oh ho2 o2 etc was proposed particularly it was found that the cathodic reactions could adversely affect the anodic reactions at the relatively short electrode distance of 0 9 mm the anodic reactions could inhibit the generation of 1o2 at short distance of 0 9 mm but promote its generation at long distances of 9 and 17 mm the a c 0 9 configuration achieved the highest degradation performance while the c a 9 configuration was revealed to be much more conducive to 1o2 production our findings demonstrate the versatility i e both direct nonradical oxidation and versatile indirect oxidation and tunability i e can be readily achieved via system configuration adjustment of the reaction mechanism and performance of the edmf system due to the flexible coupling of the anodic and cathodic reactions which potentially lays a foundation for future development of ultra
