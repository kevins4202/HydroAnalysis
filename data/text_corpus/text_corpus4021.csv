20105,aquifers major source of fresh water are depleting in the several parts of the world and posing a threat for a long term water availability managed aquifer recharge is one of the potential options to meet the challenge of water security and comprehensive characterization of aquifer system is its essential prerequisite aquifer system from soil to the deep aquifers down to the depth of 200 m or more can be mapped now through advanced geophysical technologies specially by airborne transient electromagnetic method this paper presents a brief description of aquifer characterization through heliborne transient electromagnetic htem surveys in diverse hydrogeological settings comprising of crystalline hard rocks sediments basalts and alluvium in india the htem results from different geological terrains are compared with ground based observations as well as with drilling logs to evaluate the efficacy of htem surveys it is found that htem surveys rapidly provided 3d geometrical and electrical attributes of aquifers which compare well with in situ observations the high resolution 3d information of hydrogeological settings can be appropriately utilized for sustainable management of groundwater resources by the stake holders government departments and policy makers keywords htem aquifer groundwater managed aquifer recharge water security abbreviation htem heliborne transient electromagnetic 1 introduction water security is recognized as one of the most challenging global issues for ensured access to adequate quantities of acceptable water quality for healthy livelihoods ecosystem socio economic development protection against water borne pollution and water related disasters etc 1 3 and has been earning increasing attentions from local water authority to the highest level besides the hydrogeological stress caused by the growing water extractions the water security is also threatened by the flood drought and uncontrolled pollution 4 the fresh water withdrawal to meet water demands of agricultural practices industrial and domestic usages of growing global population have increased more than six fold since 1900 5 number of studies in recent past on hydrogeological modeling and earth observations have revealed worldwide groundwater depletions at alarming rates that are primarily linked to the water extraction for irrigation 6 10 around 11 of non renewable groundwater utilization for irrigation is embedded virtually in international food trade of which two thirds are exported by pakistan the usa and india 11 the increasing groundwater dependent irrigation practices are further accelerating the aquifer depletion and hence resultant environmental degradation viz land subsidence sea water intrusion drying of rivers and increase in surface temperature 12 13 india is one of the most affected countries from the water crisis the composite water management index prepared in 2018 indicates that around half of india s population face high to extreme water stress including about 0 2 million people die every year due to inadequate access to safe water 14 therefore there is a necessity to improve groundwater recharge to establish balance between groundwater extraction and recharge for their sustenance in contrary to the effective control on groundwater extraction rate in countries like usa and china 15 16 aquifer depletions in india despite large number of groundwater management programs for the past few decades have been growing parallel to the population growth 17 in addition to the uncontrolled population growth lack of adequate knowledge of complex hydrogeological settings is considered responsible for the management failure the traditional point scale borehole measurement of hydrogeological properties though very precise is costly and time consuming affair as well as it does not represent field scale heterogeneity especially in the horizontal direction the non invasive geophysical methods provide subsurface response with certain degree of spatial averaging thus integration of non invasive geophysical methods with borehole measurements holds promise for improved and minimally invasive characterization of the complex hydrogeological settings among all non invasive geophysical method electrical and electromagnetic methods are the most commonly applied method for groundwater exploration 18 23 because of the large variation of resistivity for different formations and the changes that occur due to the saturated conditions surface based electrical and electromagnetic characterization of near surface for groundwater studies are found very effective with large scale applications worldwide however the surface geophysical methods are quite often challenged by unapproachable terrains and space availability for electrode spreading at places over the past few decades airborne electromagnetics aem has been emerging as a potential tool with increasing worldwide applications for rapid and high resolution mapping of aquifers at regional scale 17 24 29 2 methodology the paper presents result of aem for aquifer mapping validated by ground based dc resistivity vertical electrical sounding electrical resistivity tomography measurements drilling and borehole geophysical short normal and long normal resistivity and gamma logging electrical resistivity is well established method for wide range of applications dealing with groundwater resources 19 22 30 32 the airborne tem method has been experimented as the main investigating tool to cover the entire area with flight line spacings varying from 145 m to 250 m whereas the ground based measurements are carried out places to validate the airborne electromagnetic method being relatively new is briefly described below for connectivity and better understanding the airborne electromagnetic has been initially used for mineral exploration and is currently gaining increasing applications for groundwater exploration especially for large scale groundwater surveys due to its ability of large amount of closely spaced data acquisition in reasonable time and at relatively low cost 33 the ground based electrical and electromagnetic methods e g 34 38 that were the obvious choice for groundwater applications are getting replaced by airborne transient electromagnetic surveys the aem measurement being sensitive to the clay content of the subsurface material and water mineralization 33 39 it qualifies as an efficient tool for providing information of aquifer structure and water quality the aem derived closely spaced resistivity values are used to construct 3d model of the subsurface that provide information on the structure of the geological and hydrogeological environment thus aem is used as mapping tool to provide spatial distribution of aquifer settings 40 42 and sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers e g 24 43 aquifers below the ice cover 44 network of bedrock fracture and groundwater pathways in crystalline hard rocks 45 buried valley and paleochannel 26 29 a stenmac mcphar fixed wing airborne electromagnetic aem system was first development in canada and successfully applied for mineral exploration in 1948 thereafter number of frequency and time domain aem systems were developed using either aircraft or helicopter platform 46 compared to the fixed wing helicopter borne electromagnetic hem system provides high near surface resolution 0 20 m due to smaller footprint and dense data acquisition due to relatively slow speed of helicopter the helicopter borne transient electromagnetic htem systems viz aerotem newtem hoistem vtem and heli geotem systems are modern development originally designed for mineral exploration the skytem is one of the recent helicopter borne time domain aem systems designed and developed for groundwater and environment investigation as a rapid mapping tool alternative to ground based measurement 33 the paper focusses on the results of skytem system applied for aquifer mapping in typological hydrogeological settings in india and their validations the htem system usually records the earth s response 10 times in a second for a normal flying speed of 60 to 100 km hr it corresponds to measurements every 2 5 to 3 m over ground along the flight line these measurements are processed for removal of noise stacking and averaging that finally provide individual model roughly at every 25 50 m distance along the flight line the dense data coverage when combined for several profiles helps in creating a 3d image 3d knowledge cube elucidating the electrical character of the subsurface very precisely basic theory about the time domain or transient electromagnetic tem is based on solving maxwell s equations given a set of conditions and assumptions 47 the mathematical formulation for the forward and inverse problem can be found in various literatures 33 48 however for the sake of completeness the general expression for the em field above the earth s surface over a homogeneous half space are described briefly the forward calculation of vertical magnetic field hz at the center of circular look with radius a and current i is 1 h z ia 2 0 e α 0 z h r te e α 0 z h λ α 0 2 j 1 λ a d λ where h and z are heights of the transmitter and receiver respectively j1 is the bessel function of first order λ is the wavenumber α0 λ in a quasi non conducting air layer rte is the reflection coefficient and equals to λ α λ α and α λ2 iwμ0 ρ 1 2 for quasi static condition solving the above equation considering the quasi static conditions the time t derivative or the impulse response db z dt of magnetic field can be approximated as 2 b z t m 20 σ π 3 2 μ 0 t 5 2 where m i π a 2 is the magnetic moment of the transmitter µ0 is the magnetic permeability of the free space and σ is formation conductivity the apparent resistivity ρa reciprocal of electrical conductivity σ of the formation can be derived from eq 2 using late time approximation as 3 ρ a 1 π m 20 b z t 2 3 μ 0 t 5 3 the above is the general equation for circular transmitter loop and equally applicable to the square loop the system uses hexagonal transmitter loop which is very close to the circular loop the apparent resistivity data is inverted using 1d layered half space model the data is processed using aarhus workbench that uses laterally constrained inversion lci and spatially constrained inversion sci using a smooth model description with 20 30 layers while inverting the htem data the depth of investigation doi is also calculated for each model based on the sensitivity matrix of the final output model of the inversion 49 the doi is a crucial information revealing whether model is data driven or effect of starting model or caused by the regularization of the inversion doi is used as essential quality parameter while building geological or hydrogeological models 3 case histories with results the htem experimental study for mapping of aquifer settings at pilot scale located in six divergent hydrogeological settings of india were carried out during 2013 15 as part of national initiative 50 the pilot areas are i desert terrains in jaisalmer district rajasthan ii alluvial covered hard rock areas of dausa district rajasthan ii basaltic traps underlain by gondwanas in nagpur district maharashtra iv crystalline rocks in tumkur district karnataka v alluvial plains of ganga basin in patna district bihar and vi coastal sediments of tamil nadu fig 1 the study areas can be categorized broadly into two dominant formations i e hard rocks and sedimentary alluvium hydrogeologically the soft rocks are defined by the presence of primary porosity developed during the rock formation in contrary the hard rock aquifer is governed dominantly by the secondary porosity developed due to weathering and fracturing of the rock after the formation the htem experiments were supported by combination of airborne magnetic surveys electric resistivity imaging borehole measurements and structural analysis the paper presents a brief review of the findings in six pilot areas and validation of htem results by ground geophysics and drilling results all the six pilot areas in india belong to diverse hydrogeological settings and were experimented with one of the common objectives of testing the integrated geophysical methodologies consists of ground based electrical and transient electromagnetic helicopter borne transient electromagnetic and magnetic methods with validation by drilling and logging the htem data were acquired at an average flying speed of 60 80 km h at 60 m height above the ground and transmitter towed below 30 m the paper mainly focuses on validation of the htem results by the ground based geophysical investigation drilling and borehole geophysical logging etc however for smooth flow and to provide holistic view the first case study of precambrian crystalline hard rock area is described in detail followed by mostly validation with typical terrain specific resistivity model the terrain specific salient features of the htem results are discussed below 3 1 precambrian crystalline hard rock the precambrian crystalline hard rock i e plutonic and metamorphic rocks that forms continental basement covers roughly 20 of the earth s surface 51 almost 30 of india s terrain the examined case is an over exploited aquifer in archaean crystalline hard rock consists of granite gneiss and schists fig 2 a the area mainly consists of rock types belonging to the peninsular gneissic complex schistose rocks of sargur group dharwar super group and younger intrusive basic dykes the gneiss that covers the major portion of the study area is divided by the ridge formed by the schistose rocks into two equal halves granite with almost negligible thickness of soil and saprolite covers a small portion of the study area the weathered layer of the hard rocks that use to be the principal aquifer is mostly remains dry and underlying fissures and bedrock fractures controls the groundwater dynamics in the region mapping of the aquifer controlled by the network of the fractures and associated weathering was the main hydrogeological challenge the htem data was acquired at 145 m flight line spacing the data was processing on aarhus workbench fig 2 b shows htem averaged raw db dt data of 22 min length where the data coupled with noise caused by electric power lines metallic installations road etc are removed trapezoidal filter is used to average the data with optimally minimum lateral averaging i e 5 s at 10 micro second μs i e early usable gate thereafter averaging time width increases to 8 and 24 s respectively at 100 μs and 1 milli second late gates the altitude data of transmitter above the ground records high undulation due to presence of tall trees power line hills radio towers etc the noise coupled data due to power lines metallic roads and other installations fences are removed and marks as data gap even the places of exposed hard and compact sheet rock with negligible soil and weathering cover also become insensitive to htem measurement due to high resistivity and hence db dt response falls below the noise and gets removed after average filter an exercise has been performed to create a resistivity section corresponding to the 22 min time length htem data record and translation into lithological models fig 2c shows resistivity section where the gridded and interpolated sci mean resistivity with depth are imported to the profile the depth to which it attains 90 of cumulative sensitivity of total sensitivity is taken as depth of investigation doi the resistivity model is taken only above the line of doi the profile shows thin 15 m layer of low resistivity i e 10 100 ωm running all along the profile except few small patches resistivity is dominantly found within 50 ωm with adequate lateral connectivity and hence is inferred as weathered or laminated layer the underlying resistivity increases significantly from 100 to 3000 ωm which coincides with the fissured layer of around 10 30 m thickness besides this there are number of sharp and deep doi peaks these deep doi anomalies or peaks indicate the presence of deep seated conductive features in case of granite and gneiss there is no other possibility of deep conductive body than the presence of water saturated bedrock fracture and associated weathering though the fracture thickness compared to host rock remains quite small but the presence of cluster of fractures and associated weathering increases the effective thickness of the conductive structure and hence become sensitive to the htem measurement in contrary the deep doi peaks in schist belt indicates mineralization the fig 2 d is the resistivity transformed lithological section pertaining to the 22 min htem data along the profile running across the gneiss and schist belt fig 3 shows three typical 1d htem resistivity sounding data picked up along resistivity profile as shown in fig 2 where one sounding sch1 is taken from schist zone and two soundings gns1 gns2 are picked up from granite gneiss located on either sides the schist belt the data is presented in three forms i e db dt raw data normalized db dt data with their magnetic moment and the smooth layered inverted model as explained in eq 2 the db dt 1d data decay with t 5 2 and the noise with t 1 2 the db dt response over sch1 is the strongest and gns2 is the weakest one the normalized db dt response is obtained after stacking and normalization of the lm and hm response by their magnetic moment where noisy data are removed there are significant overlapping gates between low and high moment data these two data sets are jointly inverted that provide seamless resistivity models with depth the gns1 and sch1 data are taken over the doi peaks where relatively low resistivity 1000 ωm can be seen extending till around 105 and 130 m depths in contrary data and model over gns2 is weak and more resistive and hence low doi i e 30 m the distribution of such deep doi patches were systematically analyzed spatial distribution of doi combined with knowledge of geology hydrogeology borehole data etc helped in constructing network of water saturated bedrock fracture at around 100 m depth which is termed as hydrolin in granite gneiss 45 these results were supported with not only with the drilling litholog but also validated by the age of the water measured at certain time interval while pumping as well as the nitrate contents the deep bedrock fracture horizon corroborates with associated deep htem doi higher the well yield and low the age of water 45 to further cross check the validity of hydrolin map couple of bore wells were drilled down to 200 m depth in may 2019 the post drillings also found very well corresponding with the htem results electrical resistivity tomography and drilling time log fig 4 the ert data was limited hardly down to 100 m deep information but found in corroboration the drill time log is plotted in terms of drill time in minutes for unit length of rod with depth the low and high drill time for unit length rod indicate presence of weak and strong strata respectively the weakening in the strata is primarily caused by alteration i e weathering and fracturing such alteration reduces the formation resistivity thus there is strong analogy between resistivity and drilling time log as expected the drill time start from 1 min at surface slowly increasing with depth except few intermediate abrupt drops and touches to 7 min m at 60 m depth however there is relative drop in drill time to 5 min m at 120 m depth followed by number of drops between 120 m and 160 m depths and thereafter sharp increase indicating touching the bedrock htem resistivity is found corroborating with drill time log except marginal shift of low resistivity peak reflected at 120 m depth compared to the clusters of drill time drops between 130 and 160 m depth such marginal difference is an obvious occurrence in highly heterogeneous terrain the htem derived depth resistivity distribution is average response over relatively larger scale than the borehole 3 2 thar desert jaisalmer district rajasthan this is a low rain fed 200 mm annual area and critically exploited terrain located in parts of thar desert in north west arid india geologically the area is underlain by mesozoic and tertiary formations consisting of sandstone shale conglomerate mesozoic consists of baisakhi bhadesar parewar and abur formations sanu sandstone and limestone of tertiary period are present in the area these formations are overlain at places by pleistocene to recent alluvium consisting mainly clay sand and silt fresh water aquifers are in the alluvium underlying the desert sand the thickness of desert sand and alluvium varies from 60 to 100 m the underlying sandstone and limestone hold thick potential aquifer groundwater is brackish to saline at places locating relatively fresh water aquifer below the saline bed was one of the main hydrogeological challenge in the terrain the heliborne field survey took place during september october 2013 wherein total 3525 line km of data were acquired in 600 sq km area keeping 200 m flight line and 2 km tie line spacings the htem data gave a new and comprehensive three dimensional resistivity model of the subsurface of the area that formed the best possible basis for the subsequent hydrogeological and geological modeling of the thar desert area fig 5 a a low resistivity 2 ωm with thickness varying from 20 to 50 m layer has been mapped as a prominent feature in the area this is inferred as saline bed exposed at south east part of the study area that dips towards north and north west the saline bed is primarily dominated by limestone and gypseous clay that acts as marker bed separating unconfined and confined aquifer the 3d resistivity model fig 5a also exhibits vertical dispositioning of the saline bed along a nw se plane and inferred as ramgarh fault as also mentioned in research paper 52 the dry surface sand is reflected as very high resistivity based on the htem results a borewell was drilled to validate the aquifer in the nw part of the area as marked in fig 5b the drilling was done down to 275 m depth below the ground in 2015 the well was logged using short normal sn16 and long normal ln64 resistivity probe fig 5c groundwater level near the drilling site is found around 60 m below ground surface which is reflected with noticeable reduction in order of borehole resistivity the drilling and logging have validated htem results by providing broadly similar pattern of resistivity with depth however compared to around 100 ωm or more resistivity measured by htem for dry aeolian sand and unconsolidated sediments close to the surface the order of resistivity measured in borehole logs are relatively low i e 30 ωm probable major reason responsible to such difference in order of resistivity could be i difference in inherent sensitivity of dc electrical and electromagnetic methods to resolve resistive body ii htem provides non invasive measure of the subsurface resistivity in natural conditions whereas the logging after drilling that may influence natural conditions to some extent iii presence of water mud may influence the borehole resistivity measurements iv the borehole log provide local scale measures compared to htem v formation anisotropy that influence measurement of resistivity in horizontal and vertical directions 53 resistivity of the sandy soil may increase exponentially with the decreasing soil moisture below 8 of saturation the shaly limestone forms aquifer at the site inferred as principal confined aquifer is encountered between 30 and 150 m elevation with respect to mean sea level for which both the htem and borehole resistivity record relatively high resistivity compared to overlying and underlying clayey layers 3 3 alluvial covered hard rock dausa district rajasthan the alluvial covered hard rock area is located in aravalli hill ranges consists of mainly proterozoic quartzite under 10 60 m thick cover of quaternary alluvium the area suffers from groundwater over exploitation and deteriorated water quality due to increased groundwater salinity in parts the stage of groundwater development sgwd in 2012 was 173 the uncontrolled groundwater over exploitation for the past few decades in the region has caused de saturation of the alluvial aquifers consists of sand and gravels and hence groundwater is mostly confined within the 10 15 m thick aquifer layer of underlying hard rock mostly consists of weathered fractured quartzite htem results are presented along a profile running from west to east with special reference to its validation by the ground based geophysical investigation drilling and borehole geophysical logging fig 6 a shows em resistivity profile where sci resistivity is imported to the profile as per elevation this profile touches two hill ranges in the west part fault plane in the center and a river in the east zone between 2 and 8 km is basically valley fill between the two hills a well was drilled around 150 m deep at noorpur village located at 30 km profile distance from the west borehole geophysical log electrical resistivity tomography image drilling time min and penetration rate min m and drilling log is compared with htem resistivity of the drilling site fig 6b the interface between upper alluvial deposits and underlying quartzite bedrock is prominently marked due to significant resistivity contrast resistivity of alluvium sediment is found 50 ωm dominantly ranging from 5 to 30 ωm the zone with resistivity below 10 ωm reveals clay dominant sediments and higher values indicate dominant occurrences of granular sand that forms aquifer in alluvium the aquifer in alluvium is mostly dry and hence inferred as de saturated aquifer which may be utilized for managed aquifer recharge to rejuvenate the aquifer system in the region the fresh hard rock quartzite and granite gneiss etc mostly found higher order of resistivity i e 500 ωm however the weathering fracturing and presence of water reduces the resistivity to 100 ωm or so the weathered hard rock forms present aquifer that currently supply water for irrigation and other domestic needs the resistivity measured by ert acquired at 10 m unit electrode spacing is found well in agreement with htem resistivity except marginal variation at shallow and deeper levels for intermediate range of resistivity i e 10 30 ωm ert and htem are almost same order though the pattern is same but there is noticeable variation close to the ground surface where ert observed relatively higher order of resistivity than the htem this could be due to scaling and lateral averaging besides this the first usable gate of htem data start around 10 μs where top soil resistivity may not be reflected very well as in ert resistivity variation between ert and htem for depth section at 60 m and below is probably due to difference in their sensitivity of the methodology the dc electrical method has inherent ability to resolves resistive body better than htem which sense better to conductive bodies the upper 6 15 m depth that has posed a strong sp anomaly i e 9 mv forms the shale baseline and low resistivity sn16 ln64 and lateral logs high natural gamma is marked as clay layer in the lithology in contrary the underlying low sp i e negative sp once corrected for shale base line zone between 15 and 29 m depth corresponds with resistive 30 ωm in lateral log and low natural gamma 80 cpm is attributed as medium to coarse grained sand these both the layers gave mixed response as single layer to the htem measurements the zone below 29 m is mostly occupied by clay layer with inclusions of kankar and thin lenses of sand down to a depth of 51 m there is abrupt thickening of the sediment strata viz near 13 km 23 km and 32 km profile distances where each right side block appeared to be displaced downward compared to their respective left side block these displacements represent a case of normal faulting where the plane dividing the dislocation of strata are marked as fault plane the area is well known for folding and faulting and its subsurface impact is revealed by the htem results 54 this section shows considerably thick semi confining layer from 14 km onward till the end of the profile fig 6a 3 4 alluvial plains of ganga basin in patna district bihar this is a part of the gangetic plains drained by the mighty river ganga and son forming the northern and western boundaries respectively the paleochannels of son river typically display moderate meanderings and migration at few stretches ganga alluvium is consisting of sand silt and clay and suffers from arsenic contamination in the phreatic aquifers within upper 30 m depth except the places of the power line and other associated noise htem provide almost continuous resistivity image with doi line almost flat more than 250 m deep information with strong signals were recorded revealing stratified sandy and clayey layers fig 7 a the aem resistivity is found very well corroborating with the drilling lithologs short normal sn16 and long normal ln64 resistivity logs the upper 30 m is mostly occupied by silt and or fine sand mixed with clay except patchy occurrences of sandy surface soil the first principal aquifer occurs roughly between 30 and 70 m depth below ground the second principal aquifer is encountered at 125 m depth below surface the borehole electrical logs provide additional information of thin sandy lenses within the intermediate clay layer separating two principal aquifers such thin sandy lenses located at great depth are in general beyond the measurement resolution due to its great depth compared to its thickness 3 5 basaltic traps underlain by gondwanas in nagpur district maharashtra the study area represents deccan traps with multiple basaltic flows underlain by gondwana sediments the basaltic flows are separated by thin sedimentary alluvial commonly termed as intertrappean and also as bole bed the weathered and vesicular basalts and its contact with underlying gondwana sandstones form principal aquifer deep aquifers in basaltic flows are poorly known and hence mostly shallow unconfined aquifer formed by weathered fractured and vesicular basalt are exploited through large dia dug wells fig 7b shows the plot of htem resistivity profile along with borehole electrical resistivity log i e ln64 as per the drilling log 5 basaltic flows exist at the site where top flow is identified as flow no 24 f24 followed with underlying f23 f22 f21 and f20 within upper 85 m depth the electrical log shows distinct resistivity distribution of each flow with alternate low and high resistivity bands the low resistivity layer indicates intertrappean i e sedimentary alluvium and associated weathered fractured vesicular basalt the high resistivity indicates fresh and compact basalt each basaltic flow in general can be sub characterized starting from the top as weathered and fractured basalt followed by vesicular basalt and compact basalt resistivity is observed 6 10 ωm against the weathered fractured and vesicular basalt and 20 100 ωm corresponding to the compact basalt since borehole logs directly probes the different strata order of resistivity is more precise however in case of htem measurement overlying layers influence the measurement that may sometime dominate if target layer is comparatively thinner than its depth as a result an average representative value is observed in such investigations both the results show the existence of around 15 m thick conductive bole bed and weathered fractured vesicular basalt this knowledge may be crucial input while planning for managed aquifer recharge mar in the region the vertical discontinuity in the resistivity measurement may indicate structural discontinuity and if adequately permeable and connected to surface may acts as groundwater pathways the basaltic flows 23 22 21 and 20 appear as single layer in htem resistivity because of having very thin intertrappean and associated weathering etc the basalt gondwana contact has contrast resistivity variation where 2 16 l per second well yield was recorded the b g contact is mostly proven to be potential zone for groundwater occurrences 3 6 coastal sediments of tamil nadu the pilot area represents coastal sedimentary alluvial aquifer located at sea coast in southern india the alluvial sediments of tertiary and cretaceous age rest over the crystalline basement target was to delineate fresh water aquifers in coastal environment in semi consolidated cuddalore sandstones and the overlying alluvium to compare the htem resolution with ground base geo electrical investigation htem mean resistivity section of 800 m length has been sliced corresponding to the ert profile fig 8 the htem profile shows a 5 to10 m thick resistive sandy layer at the right end of the profile that starts thinning towards left the ert also reveals similar resistive layer thinning from right margin to left margin of the profile but disappear prior to the centre of the profile though major resistivity distributions have shown almost similar pattern there are few small scale variations in degree of resistivity and distribution pattern such minute differences might also be caused due to applied lci and sci to the htem data that creates certain degree of lateral smoothening the ert data has been processed and inverted using res2dinv program there is another high resistivity confining layer encountered at 55 m and 70 m depth below ground at respectively right and left hand margins of the profile reveal principal aquifer sandy layer in both htem and ert profiles the above comparison made it clear that the htem which acquires the data from 30 m above the ground in air with a speed 80 km h still gives a resolution comparable to that of ert with additional depth coverage as well as measurements even in inaccessible areas the htem survey with dense and good quality data has added great value in mapping the subsurface that revealed several features of high significance in terms of groundwater occurrence and dynamics and hence effective for rapid tool for high resolution aquifer mapping 4 discussions an exercise has been performed for comparative analysis towards data acquisition vs time factor with predictive analysis for data acquisition at watershed scale the quantity and number of days consumed towards actual data acquisition in the field for different geophysical approaches are tabulated in table 1 there may be marginal variation in data acquisition table in different areas depending on local and terrain specific conditions however broadly it is expected the data acquisition rate to be on average of similar order the analysis revealed that htem data acquisition is thousand times faster than ground based data acquisition table 1 establishing it as a rapid mapping geophysical tool of course 10 and sometimes more htem data are removed towards decoupling the noisy data etc still it provides exceptionally large amount of data than the ground based investigations the demonstrative study in six different hydrogeological settings established that the htem is an effective tool in characterizing the near surface including the de saturated and saturated aquifers besides the poor response of htem over crystalline hard rock clusters of water saturated bedrock fractures and associated weathering creates conductive environment to the htem measurement and hence turned to be effective in mapping the hydro geologically conductive bedrock fracture that controls the groundwater occurrences in crystalline hard rock the htem surveys provide typical resistivity distributions i e i low resistivity 100 ωm layer with extensive lateral connectivity and continuity with moderate undulation following the topography and ii underlying high resistivity 100 ωm increase sharply with depth as well as highly undulating doi showing abrupt deep doi peaks at places the upper layers are porous and permeable weathered fractured layer and underlying fissured layers with bedrock fractures the resistive crystalline hard rock host material which is poorly sensed by htem acts as transparent host material and enabling it to sense strongly the deep conductive feature caused by bedrock fracture and associated weathering thus for probing deep conductive potential bedrock fracture below the resistive overburden at regional scale the htem become an effective tool for precise and rapid measurement however in case of ground based dc electrical which is the most applied tool may suffer due to resistive over burden and hence may not be able to provide adequate signal of fracture to be interpreted htem not only provided knowledge of the fracture but also the mineralization within schist belt the doi is one of the most important quality parameters in such hard rock while analyzing the htem data the htem results are validated by the drilling and logging results prior as well as post heliborne survey the desert where thick pile of dry sand overburden that creates poor contact of electrode with soil resulting into poor performance of ground based electrical resistivity investigations offers favourable condition for htem investigation to explore water saturated aquifer or other conductive features at deeper level the conductive target below resistive overburden is ideal environment for deep exploration besides the contact resistant problem transportation away from road is another challenge where htem provides better alternative for high resolution and large scale mapping of near surface the study has demonstrated precise mapping of saline bed including the structural dislocations of the strata along the ramgarh fault running se nw direction the fresh principal aquifer above and relatively fresh aquifer below the saline bed are mapped the silty sandstone and limestone provide the main aquifer in the region within 300 m depth the high degree of salinity restricts the depth of investigation sometime even to 100 m depth especially in south the results were validated by the drilling results the closely spaced htem data has been used to prepare 3d resistivity model of the area the water table in the area varies from 30 m in south west to even 100 m below surface this 3d resistivity model can be used to calculate the volume of unsaturated porous and permeable formation to develop mar strategy to rejuvenate the de saturated aquifer the impact of fault on aquifer disposition in alluvium as well as quartzite bedrock at dausa district rajasthan is also clearly seen by htem derived resistivity distribution the alluvial cover increases from negligible thickness in the west to 70 m in the east resting over quartzite hard rock a 10 30 m thick de saturated aquifer dry sandy layer in alluvium and 5 10 m thick aquifer in underlying hard rock weathered fractured quartzite were mapped structural discontinuity creates compartmentalization in the aquifer zone the htem results are validated by the drilling and logging and also found providing comparable resistivity distribution as ground based ert surveys the thin sandy lenses sandwiched between clay layer and under thick over burden are beyond the scope of htem exploration the htem results from ganga alluvium deccan basalt and coastal terrain that have stratified multi layering is effectively mapped and validated by the drilling and logging efficacy of htem mapping of basaltic flows especially separated by considerably thick intertrappean and associated weathered fractured vesicular basalt qualifies it as a potential tool to explore deep aquifers in such terrain spatial distribution of such features at considerably large area will help in assessing the overall groundwater potential of such aquifer comparable results of htem with ert investigation as demonstrated in alluvial covered quartzite hard rock coastal terrain and also in crystalline hard rocks strongly present the htem as an alternative tool to ground based electrical resistivity tomography 5 conclusion based on above discussions it can be concluded that htem surveys could offer a possibility of mapping of 3d geometrical and electrical attributes of aquifers with an accuracy of a few tens of meters even in the complex hydrogeological areas critical comparison of aem results with surface and borehole hydrogeophysical observations allows to evaluate and establish the efficacy of htem techniques despite the high complexity of different hydrogeological survey areas an overall good fit with in situ observations has been found the possibility of rapid and dense coverage by htem makes it a cost effective alternative to ground based geophysical systems or boreholes for aquifer mapping we have also discussed the possibility of mapping of de saturated aquifer which is equally important as saturated aquifer in order to plan for managed aquifer recharge to achieve the groundwater sustainability essential for water security and environmental protection increasing de saturation of aquifer reduces the base flow and hence restricted flow of water in the rivers the ensured water security demands effective managed aquifer recharge where comprehensive knowledge of hydrogeological settings from soil to deep aquifer connectivity and continuity of the features spatial volume pathways for recharge etc are crucial inputs for groundwater management and can be met from htem surveys the htem technology can be employed for rapid and high resolution mapping of aquifers at regional scale in divergent hydrogeological setting at varied flight line spacings depending on degree of heterogeneity and complexity of the terrain the derived aquifer properties can be used as input parameters for simulating groundwater resources and

20105,aquifers major source of fresh water are depleting in the several parts of the world and posing a threat for a long term water availability managed aquifer recharge is one of the potential options to meet the challenge of water security and comprehensive characterization of aquifer system is its essential prerequisite aquifer system from soil to the deep aquifers down to the depth of 200 m or more can be mapped now through advanced geophysical technologies specially by airborne transient electromagnetic method this paper presents a brief description of aquifer characterization through heliborne transient electromagnetic htem surveys in diverse hydrogeological settings comprising of crystalline hard rocks sediments basalts and alluvium in india the htem results from different geological terrains are compared with ground based observations as well as with drilling logs to evaluate the efficacy of htem surveys it is found that htem surveys rapidly provided 3d geometrical and electrical attributes of aquifers which compare well with in situ observations the high resolution 3d information of hydrogeological settings can be appropriately utilized for sustainable management of groundwater resources by the stake holders government departments and policy makers keywords htem aquifer groundwater managed aquifer recharge water security abbreviation htem heliborne transient electromagnetic 1 introduction water security is recognized as one of the most challenging global issues for ensured access to adequate quantities of acceptable water quality for healthy livelihoods ecosystem socio economic development protection against water borne pollution and water related disasters etc 1 3 and has been earning increasing attentions from local water authority to the highest level besides the hydrogeological stress caused by the growing water extractions the water security is also threatened by the flood drought and uncontrolled pollution 4 the fresh water withdrawal to meet water demands of agricultural practices industrial and domestic usages of growing global population have increased more than six fold since 1900 5 number of studies in recent past on hydrogeological modeling and earth observations have revealed worldwide groundwater depletions at alarming rates that are primarily linked to the water extraction for irrigation 6 10 around 11 of non renewable groundwater utilization for irrigation is embedded virtually in international food trade of which two thirds are exported by pakistan the usa and india 11 the increasing groundwater dependent irrigation practices are further accelerating the aquifer depletion and hence resultant environmental degradation viz land subsidence sea water intrusion drying of rivers and increase in surface temperature 12 13 india is one of the most affected countries from the water crisis the composite water management index prepared in 2018 indicates that around half of india s population face high to extreme water stress including about 0 2 million people die every year due to inadequate access to safe water 14 therefore there is a necessity to improve groundwater recharge to establish balance between groundwater extraction and recharge for their sustenance in contrary to the effective control on groundwater extraction rate in countries like usa and china 15 16 aquifer depletions in india despite large number of groundwater management programs for the past few decades have been growing parallel to the population growth 17 in addition to the uncontrolled population growth lack of adequate knowledge of complex hydrogeological settings is considered responsible for the management failure the traditional point scale borehole measurement of hydrogeological properties though very precise is costly and time consuming affair as well as it does not represent field scale heterogeneity especially in the horizontal direction the non invasive geophysical methods provide subsurface response with certain degree of spatial averaging thus integration of non invasive geophysical methods with borehole measurements holds promise for improved and minimally invasive characterization of the complex hydrogeological settings among all non invasive geophysical method electrical and electromagnetic methods are the most commonly applied method for groundwater exploration 18 23 because of the large variation of resistivity for different formations and the changes that occur due to the saturated conditions surface based electrical and electromagnetic characterization of near surface for groundwater studies are found very effective with large scale applications worldwide however the surface geophysical methods are quite often challenged by unapproachable terrains and space availability for electrode spreading at places over the past few decades airborne electromagnetics aem has been emerging as a potential tool with increasing worldwide applications for rapid and high resolution mapping of aquifers at regional scale 17 24 29 2 methodology the paper presents result of aem for aquifer mapping validated by ground based dc resistivity vertical electrical sounding electrical resistivity tomography measurements drilling and borehole geophysical short normal and long normal resistivity and gamma logging electrical resistivity is well established method for wide range of applications dealing with groundwater resources 19 22 30 32 the airborne tem method has been experimented as the main investigating tool to cover the entire area with flight line spacings varying from 145 m to 250 m whereas the ground based measurements are carried out places to validate the airborne electromagnetic method being relatively new is briefly described below for connectivity and better understanding the airborne electromagnetic has been initially used for mineral exploration and is currently gaining increasing applications for groundwater exploration especially for large scale groundwater surveys due to its ability of large amount of closely spaced data acquisition in reasonable time and at relatively low cost 33 the ground based electrical and electromagnetic methods e g 34 38 that were the obvious choice for groundwater applications are getting replaced by airborne transient electromagnetic surveys the aem measurement being sensitive to the clay content of the subsurface material and water mineralization 33 39 it qualifies as an efficient tool for providing information of aquifer structure and water quality the aem derived closely spaced resistivity values are used to construct 3d model of the subsurface that provide information on the structure of the geological and hydrogeological environment thus aem is used as mapping tool to provide spatial distribution of aquifer settings 40 42 and sea water intrusion in coastal aquifers e g 24 43 aquifers below the ice cover 44 network of bedrock fracture and groundwater pathways in crystalline hard rocks 45 buried valley and paleochannel 26 29 a stenmac mcphar fixed wing airborne electromagnetic aem system was first development in canada and successfully applied for mineral exploration in 1948 thereafter number of frequency and time domain aem systems were developed using either aircraft or helicopter platform 46 compared to the fixed wing helicopter borne electromagnetic hem system provides high near surface resolution 0 20 m due to smaller footprint and dense data acquisition due to relatively slow speed of helicopter the helicopter borne transient electromagnetic htem systems viz aerotem newtem hoistem vtem and heli geotem systems are modern development originally designed for mineral exploration the skytem is one of the recent helicopter borne time domain aem systems designed and developed for groundwater and environment investigation as a rapid mapping tool alternative to ground based measurement 33 the paper focusses on the results of skytem system applied for aquifer mapping in typological hydrogeological settings in india and their validations the htem system usually records the earth s response 10 times in a second for a normal flying speed of 60 to 100 km hr it corresponds to measurements every 2 5 to 3 m over ground along the flight line these measurements are processed for removal of noise stacking and averaging that finally provide individual model roughly at every 25 50 m distance along the flight line the dense data coverage when combined for several profiles helps in creating a 3d image 3d knowledge cube elucidating the electrical character of the subsurface very precisely basic theory about the time domain or transient electromagnetic tem is based on solving maxwell s equations given a set of conditions and assumptions 47 the mathematical formulation for the forward and inverse problem can be found in various literatures 33 48 however for the sake of completeness the general expression for the em field above the earth s surface over a homogeneous half space are described briefly the forward calculation of vertical magnetic field hz at the center of circular look with radius a and current i is 1 h z ia 2 0 e α 0 z h r te e α 0 z h λ α 0 2 j 1 λ a d λ where h and z are heights of the transmitter and receiver respectively j1 is the bessel function of first order λ is the wavenumber α0 λ in a quasi non conducting air layer rte is the reflection coefficient and equals to λ α λ α and α λ2 iwμ0 ρ 1 2 for quasi static condition solving the above equation considering the quasi static conditions the time t derivative or the impulse response db z dt of magnetic field can be approximated as 2 b z t m 20 σ π 3 2 μ 0 t 5 2 where m i π a 2 is the magnetic moment of the transmitter µ0 is the magnetic permeability of the free space and σ is formation conductivity the apparent resistivity ρa reciprocal of electrical conductivity σ of the formation can be derived from eq 2 using late time approximation as 3 ρ a 1 π m 20 b z t 2 3 μ 0 t 5 3 the above is the general equation for circular transmitter loop and equally applicable to the square loop the system uses hexagonal transmitter loop which is very close to the circular loop the apparent resistivity data is inverted using 1d layered half space model the data is processed using aarhus workbench that uses laterally constrained inversion lci and spatially constrained inversion sci using a smooth model description with 20 30 layers while inverting the htem data the depth of investigation doi is also calculated for each model based on the sensitivity matrix of the final output model of the inversion 49 the doi is a crucial information revealing whether model is data driven or effect of starting model or caused by the regularization of the inversion doi is used as essential quality parameter while building geological or hydrogeological models 3 case histories with results the htem experimental study for mapping of aquifer settings at pilot scale located in six divergent hydrogeological settings of india were carried out during 2013 15 as part of national initiative 50 the pilot areas are i desert terrains in jaisalmer district rajasthan ii alluvial covered hard rock areas of dausa district rajasthan ii basaltic traps underlain by gondwanas in nagpur district maharashtra iv crystalline rocks in tumkur district karnataka v alluvial plains of ganga basin in patna district bihar and vi coastal sediments of tamil nadu fig 1 the study areas can be categorized broadly into two dominant formations i e hard rocks and sedimentary alluvium hydrogeologically the soft rocks are defined by the presence of primary porosity developed during the rock formation in contrary the hard rock aquifer is governed dominantly by the secondary porosity developed due to weathering and fracturing of the rock after the formation the htem experiments were supported by combination of airborne magnetic surveys electric resistivity imaging borehole measurements and structural analysis the paper presents a brief review of the findings in six pilot areas and validation of htem results by ground geophysics and drilling results all the six pilot areas in india belong to diverse hydrogeological settings and were experimented with one of the common objectives of testing the integrated geophysical methodologies consists of ground based electrical and transient electromagnetic helicopter borne transient electromagnetic and magnetic methods with validation by drilling and logging the htem data were acquired at an average flying speed of 60 80 km h at 60 m height above the ground and transmitter towed below 30 m the paper mainly focuses on validation of the htem results by the ground based geophysical investigation drilling and borehole geophysical logging etc however for smooth flow and to provide holistic view the first case study of precambrian crystalline hard rock area is described in detail followed by mostly validation with typical terrain specific resistivity model the terrain specific salient features of the htem results are discussed below 3 1 precambrian crystalline hard rock the precambrian crystalline hard rock i e plutonic and metamorphic rocks that forms continental basement covers roughly 20 of the earth s surface 51 almost 30 of india s terrain the examined case is an over exploited aquifer in archaean crystalline hard rock consists of granite gneiss and schists fig 2 a the area mainly consists of rock types belonging to the peninsular gneissic complex schistose rocks of sargur group dharwar super group and younger intrusive basic dykes the gneiss that covers the major portion of the study area is divided by the ridge formed by the schistose rocks into two equal halves granite with almost negligible thickness of soil and saprolite covers a small portion of the study area the weathered layer of the hard rocks that use to be the principal aquifer is mostly remains dry and underlying fissures and bedrock fractures controls the groundwater dynamics in the region mapping of the aquifer controlled by the network of the fractures and associated weathering was the main hydrogeological challenge the htem data was acquired at 145 m flight line spacing the data was processing on aarhus workbench fig 2 b shows htem averaged raw db dt data of 22 min length where the data coupled with noise caused by electric power lines metallic installations road etc are removed trapezoidal filter is used to average the data with optimally minimum lateral averaging i e 5 s at 10 micro second μs i e early usable gate thereafter averaging time width increases to 8 and 24 s respectively at 100 μs and 1 milli second late gates the altitude data of transmitter above the ground records high undulation due to presence of tall trees power line hills radio towers etc the noise coupled data due to power lines metallic roads and other installations fences are removed and marks as data gap even the places of exposed hard and compact sheet rock with negligible soil and weathering cover also become insensitive to htem measurement due to high resistivity and hence db dt response falls below the noise and gets removed after average filter an exercise has been performed to create a resistivity section corresponding to the 22 min time length htem data record and translation into lithological models fig 2c shows resistivity section where the gridded and interpolated sci mean resistivity with depth are imported to the profile the depth to which it attains 90 of cumulative sensitivity of total sensitivity is taken as depth of investigation doi the resistivity model is taken only above the line of doi the profile shows thin 15 m layer of low resistivity i e 10 100 ωm running all along the profile except few small patches resistivity is dominantly found within 50 ωm with adequate lateral connectivity and hence is inferred as weathered or laminated layer the underlying resistivity increases significantly from 100 to 3000 ωm which coincides with the fissured layer of around 10 30 m thickness besides this there are number of sharp and deep doi peaks these deep doi anomalies or peaks indicate the presence of deep seated conductive features in case of granite and gneiss there is no other possibility of deep conductive body than the presence of water saturated bedrock fracture and associated weathering though the fracture thickness compared to host rock remains quite small but the presence of cluster of fractures and associated weathering increases the effective thickness of the conductive structure and hence become sensitive to the htem measurement in contrary the deep doi peaks in schist belt indicates mineralization the fig 2 d is the resistivity transformed lithological section pertaining to the 22 min htem data along the profile running across the gneiss and schist belt fig 3 shows three typical 1d htem resistivity sounding data picked up along resistivity profile as shown in fig 2 where one sounding sch1 is taken from schist zone and two soundings gns1 gns2 are picked up from granite gneiss located on either sides the schist belt the data is presented in three forms i e db dt raw data normalized db dt data with their magnetic moment and the smooth layered inverted model as explained in eq 2 the db dt 1d data decay with t 5 2 and the noise with t 1 2 the db dt response over sch1 is the strongest and gns2 is the weakest one the normalized db dt response is obtained after stacking and normalization of the lm and hm response by their magnetic moment where noisy data are removed there are significant overlapping gates between low and high moment data these two data sets are jointly inverted that provide seamless resistivity models with depth the gns1 and sch1 data are taken over the doi peaks where relatively low resistivity 1000 ωm can be seen extending till around 105 and 130 m depths in contrary data and model over gns2 is weak and more resistive and hence low doi i e 30 m the distribution of such deep doi patches were systematically analyzed spatial distribution of doi combined with knowledge of geology hydrogeology borehole data etc helped in constructing network of water saturated bedrock fracture at around 100 m depth which is termed as hydrolin in granite gneiss 45 these results were supported with not only with the drilling litholog but also validated by the age of the water measured at certain time interval while pumping as well as the nitrate contents the deep bedrock fracture horizon corroborates with associated deep htem doi higher the well yield and low the age of water 45 to further cross check the validity of hydrolin map couple of bore wells were drilled down to 200 m depth in may 2019 the post drillings also found very well corresponding with the htem results electrical resistivity tomography and drilling time log fig 4 the ert data was limited hardly down to 100 m deep information but found in corroboration the drill time log is plotted in terms of drill time in minutes for unit length of rod with depth the low and high drill time for unit length rod indicate presence of weak and strong strata respectively the weakening in the strata is primarily caused by alteration i e weathering and fracturing such alteration reduces the formation resistivity thus there is strong analogy between resistivity and drilling time log as expected the drill time start from 1 min at surface slowly increasing with depth except few intermediate abrupt drops and touches to 7 min m at 60 m depth however there is relative drop in drill time to 5 min m at 120 m depth followed by number of drops between 120 m and 160 m depths and thereafter sharp increase indicating touching the bedrock htem resistivity is found corroborating with drill time log except marginal shift of low resistivity peak reflected at 120 m depth compared to the clusters of drill time drops between 130 and 160 m depth such marginal difference is an obvious occurrence in highly heterogeneous terrain the htem derived depth resistivity distribution is average response over relatively larger scale than the borehole 3 2 thar desert jaisalmer district rajasthan this is a low rain fed 200 mm annual area and critically exploited terrain located in parts of thar desert in north west arid india geologically the area is underlain by mesozoic and tertiary formations consisting of sandstone shale conglomerate mesozoic consists of baisakhi bhadesar parewar and abur formations sanu sandstone and limestone of tertiary period are present in the area these formations are overlain at places by pleistocene to recent alluvium consisting mainly clay sand and silt fresh water aquifers are in the alluvium underlying the desert sand the thickness of desert sand and alluvium varies from 60 to 100 m the underlying sandstone and limestone hold thick potential aquifer groundwater is brackish to saline at places locating relatively fresh water aquifer below the saline bed was one of the main hydrogeological challenge in the terrain the heliborne field survey took place during september october 2013 wherein total 3525 line km of data were acquired in 600 sq km area keeping 200 m flight line and 2 km tie line spacings the htem data gave a new and comprehensive three dimensional resistivity model of the subsurface of the area that formed the best possible basis for the subsequent hydrogeological and geological modeling of the thar desert area fig 5 a a low resistivity 2 ωm with thickness varying from 20 to 50 m layer has been mapped as a prominent feature in the area this is inferred as saline bed exposed at south east part of the study area that dips towards north and north west the saline bed is primarily dominated by limestone and gypseous clay that acts as marker bed separating unconfined and confined aquifer the 3d resistivity model fig 5a also exhibits vertical dispositioning of the saline bed along a nw se plane and inferred as ramgarh fault as also mentioned in research paper 52 the dry surface sand is reflected as very high resistivity based on the htem results a borewell was drilled to validate the aquifer in the nw part of the area as marked in fig 5b the drilling was done down to 275 m depth below the ground in 2015 the well was logged using short normal sn16 and long normal ln64 resistivity probe fig 5c groundwater level near the drilling site is found around 60 m below ground surface which is reflected with noticeable reduction in order of borehole resistivity the drilling and logging have validated htem results by providing broadly similar pattern of resistivity with depth however compared to around 100 ωm or more resistivity measured by htem for dry aeolian sand and unconsolidated sediments close to the surface the order of resistivity measured in borehole logs are relatively low i e 30 ωm probable major reason responsible to such difference in order of resistivity could be i difference in inherent sensitivity of dc electrical and electromagnetic methods to resolve resistive body ii htem provides non invasive measure of the subsurface resistivity in natural conditions whereas the logging after drilling that may influence natural conditions to some extent iii presence of water mud may influence the borehole resistivity measurements iv the borehole log provide local scale measures compared to htem v formation anisotropy that influence measurement of resistivity in horizontal and vertical directions 53 resistivity of the sandy soil may increase exponentially with the decreasing soil moisture below 8 of saturation the shaly limestone forms aquifer at the site inferred as principal confined aquifer is encountered between 30 and 150 m elevation with respect to mean sea level for which both the htem and borehole resistivity record relatively high resistivity compared to overlying and underlying clayey layers 3 3 alluvial covered hard rock dausa district rajasthan the alluvial covered hard rock area is located in aravalli hill ranges consists of mainly proterozoic quartzite under 10 60 m thick cover of quaternary alluvium the area suffers from groundwater over exploitation and deteriorated water quality due to increased groundwater salinity in parts the stage of groundwater development sgwd in 2012 was 173 the uncontrolled groundwater over exploitation for the past few decades in the region has caused de saturation of the alluvial aquifers consists of sand and gravels and hence groundwater is mostly confined within the 10 15 m thick aquifer layer of underlying hard rock mostly consists of weathered fractured quartzite htem results are presented along a profile running from west to east with special reference to its validation by the ground based geophysical investigation drilling and borehole geophysical logging fig 6 a shows em resistivity profile where sci resistivity is imported to the profile as per elevation this profile touches two hill ranges in the west part fault plane in the center and a river in the east zone between 2 and 8 km is basically valley fill between the two hills a well was drilled around 150 m deep at noorpur village located at 30 km profile distance from the west borehole geophysical log electrical resistivity tomography image drilling time min and penetration rate min m and drilling log is compared with htem resistivity of the drilling site fig 6b the interface between upper alluvial deposits and underlying quartzite bedrock is prominently marked due to significant resistivity contrast resistivity of alluvium sediment is found 50 ωm dominantly ranging from 5 to 30 ωm the zone with resistivity below 10 ωm reveals clay dominant sediments and higher values indicate dominant occurrences of granular sand that forms aquifer in alluvium the aquifer in alluvium is mostly dry and hence inferred as de saturated aquifer which may be utilized for managed aquifer recharge to rejuvenate the aquifer system in the region the fresh hard rock quartzite and granite gneiss etc mostly found higher order of resistivity i e 500 ωm however the weathering fracturing and presence of water reduces the resistivity to 100 ωm or so the weathered hard rock forms present aquifer that currently supply water for irrigation and other domestic needs the resistivity measured by ert acquired at 10 m unit electrode spacing is found well in agreement with htem resistivity except marginal variation at shallow and deeper levels for intermediate range of resistivity i e 10 30 ωm ert and htem are almost same order though the pattern is same but there is noticeable variation close to the ground surface where ert observed relatively higher order of resistivity than the htem this could be due to scaling and lateral averaging besides this the first usable gate of htem data start around 10 μs where top soil resistivity may not be reflected very well as in ert resistivity variation between ert and htem for depth section at 60 m and below is probably due to difference in their sensitivity of the methodology the dc electrical method has inherent ability to resolves resistive body better than htem which sense better to conductive bodies the upper 6 15 m depth that has posed a strong sp anomaly i e 9 mv forms the shale baseline and low resistivity sn16 ln64 and lateral logs high natural gamma is marked as clay layer in the lithology in contrary the underlying low sp i e negative sp once corrected for shale base line zone between 15 and 29 m depth corresponds with resistive 30 ωm in lateral log and low natural gamma 80 cpm is attributed as medium to coarse grained sand these both the layers gave mixed response as single layer to the htem measurements the zone below 29 m is mostly occupied by clay layer with inclusions of kankar and thin lenses of sand down to a depth of 51 m there is abrupt thickening of the sediment strata viz near 13 km 23 km and 32 km profile distances where each right side block appeared to be displaced downward compared to their respective left side block these displacements represent a case of normal faulting where the plane dividing the dislocation of strata are marked as fault plane the area is well known for folding and faulting and its subsurface impact is revealed by the htem results 54 this section shows considerably thick semi confining layer from 14 km onward till the end of the profile fig 6a 3 4 alluvial plains of ganga basin in patna district bihar this is a part of the gangetic plains drained by the mighty river ganga and son forming the northern and western boundaries respectively the paleochannels of son river typically display moderate meanderings and migration at few stretches ganga alluvium is consisting of sand silt and clay and suffers from arsenic contamination in the phreatic aquifers within upper 30 m depth except the places of the power line and other associated noise htem provide almost continuous resistivity image with doi line almost flat more than 250 m deep information with strong signals were recorded revealing stratified sandy and clayey layers fig 7 a the aem resistivity is found very well corroborating with the drilling lithologs short normal sn16 and long normal ln64 resistivity logs the upper 30 m is mostly occupied by silt and or fine sand mixed with clay except patchy occurrences of sandy surface soil the first principal aquifer occurs roughly between 30 and 70 m depth below ground the second principal aquifer is encountered at 125 m depth below surface the borehole electrical logs provide additional information of thin sandy lenses within the intermediate clay layer separating two principal aquifers such thin sandy lenses located at great depth are in general beyond the measurement resolution due to its great depth compared to its thickness 3 5 basaltic traps underlain by gondwanas in nagpur district maharashtra the study area represents deccan traps with multiple basaltic flows underlain by gondwana sediments the basaltic flows are separated by thin sedimentary alluvial commonly termed as intertrappean and also as bole bed the weathered and vesicular basalts and its contact with underlying gondwana sandstones form principal aquifer deep aquifers in basaltic flows are poorly known and hence mostly shallow unconfined aquifer formed by weathered fractured and vesicular basalt are exploited through large dia dug wells fig 7b shows the plot of htem resistivity profile along with borehole electrical resistivity log i e ln64 as per the drilling log 5 basaltic flows exist at the site where top flow is identified as flow no 24 f24 followed with underlying f23 f22 f21 and f20 within upper 85 m depth the electrical log shows distinct resistivity distribution of each flow with alternate low and high resistivity bands the low resistivity layer indicates intertrappean i e sedimentary alluvium and associated weathered fractured vesicular basalt the high resistivity indicates fresh and compact basalt each basaltic flow in general can be sub characterized starting from the top as weathered and fractured basalt followed by vesicular basalt and compact basalt resistivity is observed 6 10 ωm against the weathered fractured and vesicular basalt and 20 100 ωm corresponding to the compact basalt since borehole logs directly probes the different strata order of resistivity is more precise however in case of htem measurement overlying layers influence the measurement that may sometime dominate if target layer is comparatively thinner than its depth as a result an average representative value is observed in such investigations both the results show the existence of around 15 m thick conductive bole bed and weathered fractured vesicular basalt this knowledge may be crucial input while planning for managed aquifer recharge mar in the region the vertical discontinuity in the resistivity measurement may indicate structural discontinuity and if adequately permeable and connected to surface may acts as groundwater pathways the basaltic flows 23 22 21 and 20 appear as single layer in htem resistivity because of having very thin intertrappean and associated weathering etc the basalt gondwana contact has contrast resistivity variation where 2 16 l per second well yield was recorded the b g contact is mostly proven to be potential zone for groundwater occurrences 3 6 coastal sediments of tamil nadu the pilot area represents coastal sedimentary alluvial aquifer located at sea coast in southern india the alluvial sediments of tertiary and cretaceous age rest over the crystalline basement target was to delineate fresh water aquifers in coastal environment in semi consolidated cuddalore sandstones and the overlying alluvium to compare the htem resolution with ground base geo electrical investigation htem mean resistivity section of 800 m length has been sliced corresponding to the ert profile fig 8 the htem profile shows a 5 to10 m thick resistive sandy layer at the right end of the profile that starts thinning towards left the ert also reveals similar resistive layer thinning from right margin to left margin of the profile but disappear prior to the centre of the profile though major resistivity distributions have shown almost similar pattern there are few small scale variations in degree of resistivity and distribution pattern such minute differences might also be caused due to applied lci and sci to the htem data that creates certain degree of lateral smoothening the ert data has been processed and inverted using res2dinv program there is another high resistivity confining layer encountered at 55 m and 70 m depth below ground at respectively right and left hand margins of the profile reveal principal aquifer sandy layer in both htem and ert profiles the above comparison made it clear that the htem which acquires the data from 30 m above the ground in air with a speed 80 km h still gives a resolution comparable to that of ert with additional depth coverage as well as measurements even in inaccessible areas the htem survey with dense and good quality data has added great value in mapping the subsurface that revealed several features of high significance in terms of groundwater occurrence and dynamics and hence effective for rapid tool for high resolution aquifer mapping 4 discussions an exercise has been performed for comparative analysis towards data acquisition vs time factor with predictive analysis for data acquisition at watershed scale the quantity and number of days consumed towards actual data acquisition in the field for different geophysical approaches are tabulated in table 1 there may be marginal variation in data acquisition table in different areas depending on local and terrain specific conditions however broadly it is expected the data acquisition rate to be on average of similar order the analysis revealed that htem data acquisition is thousand times faster than ground based data acquisition table 1 establishing it as a rapid mapping geophysical tool of course 10 and sometimes more htem data are removed towards decoupling the noisy data etc still it provides exceptionally large amount of data than the ground based investigations the demonstrative study in six different hydrogeological settings established that the htem is an effective tool in characterizing the near surface including the de saturated and saturated aquifers besides the poor response of htem over crystalline hard rock clusters of water saturated bedrock fractures and associated weathering creates conductive environment to the htem measurement and hence turned to be effective in mapping the hydro geologically conductive bedrock fracture that controls the groundwater occurrences in crystalline hard rock the htem surveys provide typical resistivity distributions i e i low resistivity 100 ωm layer with extensive lateral connectivity and continuity with moderate undulation following the topography and ii underlying high resistivity 100 ωm increase sharply with depth as well as highly undulating doi showing abrupt deep doi peaks at places the upper layers are porous and permeable weathered fractured layer and underlying fissured layers with bedrock fractures the resistive crystalline hard rock host material which is poorly sensed by htem acts as transparent host material and enabling it to sense strongly the deep conductive feature caused by bedrock fracture and associated weathering thus for probing deep conductive potential bedrock fracture below the resistive overburden at regional scale the htem become an effective tool for precise and rapid measurement however in case of ground based dc electrical which is the most applied tool may suffer due to resistive over burden and hence may not be able to provide adequate signal of fracture to be interpreted htem not only provided knowledge of the fracture but also the mineralization within schist belt the doi is one of the most important quality parameters in such hard rock while analyzing the htem data the htem results are validated by the drilling and logging results prior as well as post heliborne survey the desert where thick pile of dry sand overburden that creates poor contact of electrode with soil resulting into poor performance of ground based electrical resistivity investigations offers favourable condition for htem investigation to explore water saturated aquifer or other conductive features at deeper level the conductive target below resistive overburden is ideal environment for deep exploration besides the contact resistant problem transportation away from road is another challenge where htem provides better alternative for high resolution and large scale mapping of near surface the study has demonstrated precise mapping of saline bed including the structural dislocations of the strata along the ramgarh fault running se nw direction the fresh principal aquifer above and relatively fresh aquifer below the saline bed are mapped the silty sandstone and limestone provide the main aquifer in the region within 300 m depth the high degree of salinity restricts the depth of investigation sometime even to 100 m depth especially in south the results were validated by the drilling results the closely spaced htem data has been used to prepare 3d resistivity model of the area the water table in the area varies from 30 m in south west to even 100 m below surface this 3d resistivity model can be used to calculate the volume of unsaturated porous and permeable formation to develop mar strategy to rejuvenate the de saturated aquifer the impact of fault on aquifer disposition in alluvium as well as quartzite bedrock at dausa district rajasthan is also clearly seen by htem derived resistivity distribution the alluvial cover increases from negligible thickness in the west to 70 m in the east resting over quartzite hard rock a 10 30 m thick de saturated aquifer dry sandy layer in alluvium and 5 10 m thick aquifer in underlying hard rock weathered fractured quartzite were mapped structural discontinuity creates compartmentalization in the aquifer zone the htem results are validated by the drilling and logging and also found providing comparable resistivity distribution as ground based ert surveys the thin sandy lenses sandwiched between clay layer and under thick over burden are beyond the scope of htem exploration the htem results from ganga alluvium deccan basalt and coastal terrain that have stratified multi layering is effectively mapped and validated by the drilling and logging efficacy of htem mapping of basaltic flows especially separated by considerably thick intertrappean and associated weathered fractured vesicular basalt qualifies it as a potential tool to explore deep aquifers in such terrain spatial distribution of such features at considerably large area will help in assessing the overall groundwater potential of such aquifer comparable results of htem with ert investigation as demonstrated in alluvial covered quartzite hard rock coastal terrain and also in crystalline hard rocks strongly present the htem as an alternative tool to ground based electrical resistivity tomography 5 conclusion based on above discussions it can be concluded that htem surveys could offer a possibility of mapping of 3d geometrical and electrical attributes of aquifers with an accuracy of a few tens of meters even in the complex hydrogeological areas critical comparison of aem results with surface and borehole hydrogeophysical observations allows to evaluate and establish the efficacy of htem techniques despite the high complexity of different hydrogeological survey areas an overall good fit with in situ observations has been found the possibility of rapid and dense coverage by htem makes it a cost effective alternative to ground based geophysical systems or boreholes for aquifer mapping we have also discussed the possibility of mapping of de saturated aquifer which is equally important as saturated aquifer in order to plan for managed aquifer recharge to achieve the groundwater sustainability essential for water security and environmental protection increasing de saturation of aquifer reduces the base flow and hence restricted flow of water in the rivers the ensured water security demands effective managed aquifer recharge where comprehensive knowledge of hydrogeological settings from soil to deep aquifer connectivity and continuity of the features spatial volume pathways for recharge etc are crucial inputs for groundwater management and can be met from htem surveys the htem technology can be employed for rapid and high resolution mapping of aquifers at regional scale in divergent hydrogeological setting at varied flight line spacings depending on degree of heterogeneity and complexity of the terrain the derived aquifer properties can be used as input parameters for simulating groundwater resources and device a sustainable management plan in varying agro climatic conditions this provides useful baseline information for public policy makers and stake holders to plan judiciously managed aquifer recharge agricultural practices ensured water supply water security etc the state and central government agencies responsible for groundwater management can employ this technology for rapid and

20106,today india is the third largest dam building country in the world with over five thousand large dams however despite the significantly large expenditure the actual area irrigated by canal has shown an overall decline since 1991 today more than 60 of india s irrigation happens through groundwater evaluation reports by official agencies like comptroller and auditor general of india cag and independent evaluations by civil society organizations have pointed out to the poor performance of dams during construction operation and maintenance despite this the narrative that the dams play a vital role in providing overall water security to the country has not been validated with help of a closer look at the empirical evidence on performance of dams in the academia to address this we embark on a comprehensive socio hydrologic review of evaluation studies to understand if large dams have in fact improved water security defined broadly beyond just the canal command area we ask two questions i what types of studies have been conducted ii what do they collectively say about dams improving water security we find that while the engineers and experts have ex ante promised water security through dams the ex post studies have highlighted several pathways through which dams adversely affect water security they essentially highlight the tradeoffs between water security of different stakeholders and bring out the losers that go unnoticed growing empirical evidence shows that despite massive investments dams are unable to deliver on their promises we argue that this repeated under performance suggests that the inherent social technical nature of irrigation systems has not been internalized in the dam design process in the way forward we have discussed the need to design and implement dams as socio technical systems need for empirical field based ex post research to establish factual evidence further it must feed back into ex ante water planning structured processes like shared vision planning can be used to negotiate competing normative claims keywords dams post facto assessments india 1 introduction in the post colonial era dams were positioned as critical to feeding a growing population and pursuing the developmental agenda for independent india canal irrigation became deeply embedded in central as well as state water planning today india the third largest dam building country globally 46 has over five thousand large dams 25 proponents argue that dams improve food and water security they provide farmers with water in the dry season and boost food security water security is an evolving concept that in recent years has come to include water for both humans and ecosystems human water security encompasses sustainable access to adequate quantities and acceptable quality of water 105 it thus requires addressing not only physical water scarcity but also the underlying socio economic reasons for scarcity like power poverty and inequality dams are human interventions that allow storage of water at large scales bringing about large scale socio economic changes in the distribution control and access to water but they also fundamentally alter flow regimes and trigger long term bio physical changes in the river ecosystem dams thus deeply affect water security in terms of humans as well as ecosystems and assessments of their impact on water security must include both india has spent 400 000 crores usd 55 billion on major and medium dams since independence 68 even today nearly 40 of the budget of the water resources department of ministry of jal shakti goes to operation and maintenance major and medium dams 29 despite this massive expenditure the net area irrigated by canals has stagnated since 1991 36 47 49 101 public expenditure on major and medium dams increased from 10 billion us in 1980 to 42 billion us in 2005 during this period contribution of net canal irrigated area to net irrigated area dropped from 40 to 23 and contribution of net groundwater irrigated area increased from 48 to 60 today more than 60 of india s irrigation is through groundwater 68 independent evaluation reports by official agencies like comptroller and auditor general of india cag academicians and civil society organizations have shed light on the poor performance during construction operation and maintenance of major and medium dams in terms of technical financial environmental and social aspects 17 24 the reports indicate that technically and financially unviable irrigation schemes have become routine in recent decades for political economy reasons construction repair and extension of canals to improve water supply to the farms serves as both an electoral promise and a way of extracting financial resources to generate funds for the members of legislative assembly to secure re election 72 given the massive spending and uncertain returns it is imperative to assess how dams actually impact water security to assess the bureaucratic justification that dams play a vital role in providing overall water security to the country 25 we embark on a comprehensive socio hydrologic review of evaluation studies to understand if large dams in india have in fact improved water security broadly defined beyond just the canal command area we ask two questions i what types of studies have been conducted in india ii what do they collectively say about the impact of dams on water security because of the disparity in claims between the potential and actual performance we focus on empirical post facto studies rather than ex ante engineering analyses 2 review methodology as dams bring about large scale irreversible changes in land use landcover socio economic profile and hydrology post facto assessment of dams has been conducted by multiple stakeholders and from different value positions for academic as well as non academic purposes for this review paper we focus on indian studies as well as global studies where india features prominently although dam building receded after world commission on dams wcd report in 2000 with financial institutions pulling out the funding for the dam projects 59 india continued to build dams nearly 2000 more dams have been added post 2000 the volume of literature produced on the dams during the wcd proceedings was substantial although the wcd studies did bring about some changes in the sector the overall performance of the sector in tackling the social and environmental costs of dams remains dismal according to recent cag reports 17 24 given the heightened attention to the environment and climate change and expansion of groundwater in the last two decades a fresh review of studies post wcd is warranted thus in this review we focus on papers published post 2000 this review is not intended to understand whether dams improve water security in theory but whether they do so in practice accordingly the review focuses on dams as socio technical system rather than as engineering structures irrigation systems have long been conceptualised as combined physical and human socio technical systems an irrigation scheme alters the relationship between humans technologies and natural resources it transforms a technical project into a socio technical one as it brings together farmers their labour their land crops water and other resources like financial capital in some order 8 irrigation is also an inherently social process because of the interdependence among farmers and water managers as it requires a degree of co operation among water users and with any persons managing the irrigation system at higher levels 107 physically dams and the canals convey water but how and when they do is determined by social processes thus they are also social spaces where irrigators and government officials are one of many actors 106 cited by 74 therefore throughout the paper we build arguments based on this hybrid understanding 74 of dams we try to bring together in a single framework the different scales and dimensions of dams as embedded within larger hydro social cycle a concept elaborated by 74 we anchor our analysis in the concept of water security as defined by the un water to be the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities and acceptable quality of water for sustaining livelihoods human wellbeing and socio economic development for ensuring protection against waterborne pollution and water related disasters and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability 105 methodology we used search engine optimisation seo to find the relevant papers for different themes google scholar is known to find the largest percentage of citations including non journal sources such as books conference papers and unpublished materials etc 66 we included gray literature from well established agencies since there were very few peer reviewed publications overall moreover we found several comprehensive reports that were rich in insights particularly on the social and environmental impacts of dams we identified key thematic areas in post facto evaluation e g social impacts hydrological impacts etc and used combinations for search terms for each theme a total of 50 different search word combinations were used annexure i we also followed bibliographies of relevant papers we downloaded total of 175 journal articles and non academic reports of which we retained 67 papers that were robust in methodology with clear insights out of which 11 were non academic articles and reports we did not include studies that were commissioned by interest groups or those with obvious conflicts of interest in terms of funding additionally we cite 23 academic papers six non academic articles and eight government reports for supporting information because post facto assessments are largely critical of dams to ensure a balanced review we oversampled papers from authors known to favor dams as a solution and integrated their arguments to better summarize claims by dam proponents in the discussion section in this literature review we employ a benefit cost framework as an organizing principle we divided the literature assessed broadly into assessments of costs and assessments of benefits see fig 1 for each category we investigated studies that assessed or evaluated stakeholder specific benefits or costs as well as studies that took a broader systemic approach in general stakeholder wise assessments tended to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods and provide a worm s eye view of the projects systemic assessments on the other hand took an bird s eye view focusing on the systems and processes responsible for planning design construction of dams using a combination of field observations primary and secondary data dams follow the typical cycle of planning design construction operation deviations are widely observed at each stage which alter both the benefits as well as the costs associated with dams therefore throughout the review we note where the differences in benefit costs that emerge because the projects deviated from the design versus where they original claims themselves were flawed 3 stakeholder wise assessments of benefits and costs different benefits accrue to different stakeholders for this review we assessed two of the most important stakeholders viz farmers and hydropower affected population in case of farmers post facto assessments investigated the performance of the irrigation projects in terms of adequacy of the canal water timeliness ease of access and participatory decision making in case of hydropower projects post facto assessments focused on benefit sharing with affected populations 3 1 stakeholder wise assessment of benefits canal command farmers historically in india dams have been proposed and constructed to increase the food security of the country benefit to farmers in form of irrigation thus remains an important narrative while proposing dams the irrigation schemes tend to be viewed as an overall success story e g chandran and ambili 2016 15 using performance indicators developed by central water commission cwc or international water management institute iwmi these indicators however use the aggregated data at the command level thus concealing the disparities of the performance within the command the indicators also do not compare the performance with the level of irrigation promised in the original design thus for our review we have specifically chosen performance evaluation studies which focus on the granular picture within the command supported by primary data collected from the field these performance evaluation studies for irrigation projects can be classified in two categories i qualitative studies which include mollinga 2001 2014 73 74 narain 2008 76 kulkani 2018 60 celio 2010 12 nikku 2002 78 that have assessed how farmers or bureaucrats individually or collectively maneuvered project implementation to deviate from the project design to further their own interests ii quantitative studies which include gaur et al 2008 40 nikam et al 2020 77 ray et al 2002 85 that have assessed the on ground agricultural productivity using remote sensing rs geographical information systems gis the qualitative studies essentially focus on the social component while the quantitative studies focus on the bio physical impacts of the socio technical processes of irrigation despite fundamental differences in epistemology and methodology the central conclusion tying both the qualitative and quantitative studies was surprisingly similar that there was inequity in distribution of canal irrigation benefits interestingly even studies that started without any specific focus on equity issues ended up concluding that the distribution of benefits was inequitable 12 40 76 77 85 the irrigation schemes evaluated for their performance were all promoted as protective irrigation schemes designed for supplementary irrigation for low water consuming crops as mollinga 2001 2014 73 74 has discussed this scarcity by design aims to spread water thinly over large irrigated area to reach the largest possible number of beneficiaries in contrast with this objective of the greatest common good individual farmers prefer to maximise agricultural output on their land indeed upstream farmers are consistently able to exert their locational advantage to do so because of the inability to enforce the prescribed cropping patterns and allocations in most case studies kulkarni 2018 60 mollinga 2001 73 2014 74 narain 2008 76 the cropping pattern in the command area gradually shifted towards water intensive crops over time the irrigation pattern changed from thinly spread and equal to concentrated and unequal myriad social processes were driving this change e g policies and practices promoted during green revolution pre existing socio economic hierarchies coupled with technical design of the canals 60 73 74 76 the scarcity of canal water further aggravated when irrigation water was diverted for urban and industrial water use something that was rarely envisaged in the original project design the upstream abstractions further reduced the yield of reservoirs 12 60 98 the most common manifestation of inequity was the head reach farmers appropriating more water with the tail end farmers receiving significantly less share of their entitled water quantitative studies using rs gis techniques to assess the performance of irrigation projects observed similar patterns of inequity between the head and tail reach viz ray 2002 85 mahi right bank canal command gujarat gaur 2008 40 nagarjuna sagar irrigation project andhra pradesh and nikam et al 2018 77 upper wardha irrigation project maharashtra the qualitative studies explored the processes by which this inequity was perpetuated such as socio economic dependence of tail end farmers on the head reach farmers in form of credit or wage employment 73 or political interests capturing the water user associations wuas 60 78 etc e g canal water distribution rules that amplify the inequity by tying canal water rights to acreage of land ownership thereby reinforcing the existing patterns of inequality in land ownership 76 biophysical processes of canal losses to the tune of 20 30 76 that contribute to water not reaching the tail end kulkarni 2018 60 note that borewells are an important factor aggravating the inequity prosperous farmers from the head reach invest in private wells which are in turn recharged by canal leakage thus farmers are able to ensure water security for their fields by timing the control of flows even when the reservoir levels drop additionally they do not have to pay for the canal water 60 the emerging groundwater economy in canal command areas has severe equity implications in terms of direct access to water and decision making in its use and allocation 60 91 kulkarni 2018 60 argues that this is a conversion of public water resource into a private one which is ultimately forcing the small and marginal farmers to exit from the farming system altogether thus the process of canal water distribution which is essentially envisaged as a technical problem when unfolds as a sociotechnical system in tandem with larger hydro social cycle ends up negatively impacting water security of some canal farmers by limiting their access to adequate quantities of irrigation water hydropower affected communities hydropower projects have traditionally been considered climate friendly however as establishment of a hydropower project involves substantially large infrastructure development such as storage structures diversion tunnels powerhouse transmission lines etc 108 the claim that hydropower projects are environmentally benign is increasingly being questioned as a result the communities living in the vicinity of the project have to cope with several short term as well as long term environmental impacts during construction and operation of the hydropower projects 9 38 62 84 89 108 their relationship with the river and the social processes around it are fundamentally altered along with the changed flow of the river in context of hydropower the principal idea of benefit sharing is to share the benefits resulting from the development of hydropower projects in order to satisfy the needs of the concerned local communities benefit sharing mechanisms employed by the project proponents have evolved over time and present literature makes a clear distinction between compensation and mitigation measures and benefit sharing only those efforts that go beyond the obligatory requirements of compensation and mitigation measures adopted by the hydropower projects can be called as benefit sharing 45 typical benefit sharing agreements involve royalties to the state government and local communities rehabilitation and resettlement policies sustainable development policies to cater to ecosystem and livelihood impacts and corporate social responsibility policies 10 44 benefit sharing agreements typically focus only on possible benefits and not mitigation of negative externalities on the larger hydro social cycle that the hydropower projects are a part of several of these externalities particularly affect the water security of the community e g drying up of springs because of blasting 38 62 84 drying up of the river with the associated loss of ecosystem services 9 38 and flash floods caused by hydropower peaking 84 89 rao 2014 84 argue that in sikkim the benefit sharing mechanisms have remained delinked from the serious concerns of ecological damage expressed by the communities and in absence of monitoring and evaluation both public and private sector have failed to implement the benefit sharing mechanisms finally many benefit sharing agreements as drafted on paper during project design do not materalise in practice at all buechler et al 2016 10 highlight the need for more transparent institutional mechanisms and enforcement of rules mandated by the state and central governments through legal instruments that could be enforced by lower courts overall benefit sharing mechanisms are largely seen as unsuccessful in catering to the adverse effects on the water security of the local affected communities flood protected communities limited success of structural measures centered flood management protection from floods is an important aspect of the water security concept india has invested significantly in dams and reservoirs built as a structural measure for flood protection other measures include embankments drainage channels river training works etc despite massive investments have been put into the construction of structural measures along with institutional and legal set up to mitigate the impacts of floods the flood control efforts in india they have achieved limited success in controlling the socio economic damages 43 70 92 based on regressions for the three most vulnerable states viz bihar uttar pradesh and west bengal for the period of 1971 to 1996 gupta et al 2003 43 argue that even though the extent of protection has increased over time it has not kept pace with the demographic trends and has been inadequate in reducing the vulnerability to floods studies reviewing overall flood control efforts of india argue that ineffective implementation of non structural measures affects the performance of structural measures 70 92 overall neglect of timely construction maintenance and functioning of flood measures 92 absence of important non structural measures such as emergency action plans dam breach studies optimal operating procedures studies to reduce sediment deposits for most of the dams 70 and insufficient investment in non structural measures such as flood mapping zoning flood fighting abilities of people etc have reduced the overall effectiveness of the structural measures 92 while flood management in india is a very complex process with several socio hydro climatological factors 70 the importance of social processes in flood protection such as rescue relief rehabilitation has been realized very late in india 70 92 although flood control which is an important aspect of water security has been a promise while constructing dams whether dams control or contribute to floods can be debated several studies have demonstrated how improper management of high water level conditions in reservoirs and consequent sudden release of water especially during the periods of high intensity rainfall have routinely caused high intensity floods kerala floods of 2018 have been widely studied 64 69 99 102 and the cause has been identified as a combination of extreme rainfall and significant release of water from almost full reservoirs most recently study of krishna basin floods in maharashtra in 2019 33 104 2016 flood of bihar 28 and earlier studies of floods of lower krishna basin in 2009 58 mahanadi basin 50 all point out to the role of dams in worsening the flood situation a common feature of these floods has been a lack of early release of water from reservoirs with subsequent heavy discharges coinciding with a high catchment inflow due to extreme rainfall events such dam operation has been termed as un engineered 70 or un scientific 64 several studies have recommended modification of rule curves for releases from dams in extreme flood situations 99 69 33 50 singh and kumar 2017 92 have discussed occurrences of severe and devastating floods at different gauging and discharge sites on indian rivers from 1951 to 2003 majority of severe and devastating floods occurred in the month of september followed by august they are primarily attributed to good monsoon showers in september and subsequent release of already stored water from the reservoirs all in all although dams as a structure promise protection from floods dams when implemented as socio technical systems have failed to fulfill that objective the non structural measures which are essentially governed by a myriad of social processes have severely lagged behind thereby significantly reducing the effectiveness of the flood control dams cities with growing urban water demand as large reservoirs play a more and more role in meeting the growing urban water demand cities are emerging as new beneficiaries of benefits of dams analysing 302 urban centres mukharjee et al 2010 75 argue that cities with larger population size tend to depend more on surface water sources which in turn helps sustain higher levels of per capita water supply cities often destroy local water sources as they expand 71 and pose serious threat to the sustainability of the local water resource base such as wells ponds and tanks 75 thus the urban centers tend to depend on imported water from large reservoirs for ensuring sustainable water supplies 75 however ensuring water security to the cities is often in conflict with the water security of agriculture sector molle and berkoff 2006 71 have at length discussed the trade offs between agriculture and urban water supply the authors argue that cities are successful in increasing their water supply through varied ways such as by constructing new reservoirs on nearby streams bringing water from distant basins through inter basin transfers or tapping local or distant aquifers often in an unsustainable way the farmers on the other hand employ various coping mechanisms to adjust to the growing water scarcity e g improving irrigation efficiency at farm or scheme level changing cropping patterns exploiting groundwater diverting more surface water by using wastewater etc in absence of coping mechanisms many of them are being out pumped by depleting aquifers or driven out of farming system due to reduced supplies of surface water 3 2 stakeholder wise assessment of costs stakeholder wise assessments of costs have focused on social cost for displaced peoples as well as the riparian populations environmental costs have been assessed in terms of hydrological geo morphological and ecological impacts on the river ecosystem the central questions that these studies ask are how have the stakeholders been impacted and what costs have they borne project affected populations in a review of literature on social impact assessment sia conducted by kirchherr et al 59 more than 67 out of 217 the articles indicated negative impact on infrastructure in terms of irrigation drinking water access and livelihoods in india the overall living standard of the displaced population seems to worsen 90 as quality of r r process remains poor with non availability and poor maintenance of basic infrastructure in resettled villages 24 the water security of the displaced population thus seems adversely impacted in absence of irrigation and drinking water services deep adverse impacts on the livelihoods of downstream riparian populations are a less discussed but important component of the hydro social cycle that dams affect these impacts have been highlighted by richter et al 2010 87 the ecological changes induced because of the altered flow regime disrupt livelihoods dependent on fisheries flood recession agriculture and dry season grazing the authors estimate that globally 472 million river dependent people living along dry river stretches downstream of large dams have experienced a disruption of their livelihoods loss of food security and physical cultural and spiritual well being of these 123 million 26 are from india similar impacts in terms of sustenance fishing due to loss of access to river caused by small hydro projects shps have been highlighted by jumani et al 2016 54 lahiri dutt 2012 63 has studied gender dimension of altered river flows in damodar valley of kolkata after construction of series of flood control and hydropower dams by dvc floods in the valley have become highly unpredictable longer in duration and thus more destructive they are now a much greater physical burden on women in terms of gender assigned tasks such as fetching water fuel wood etc the changed nature of floods has jeopardized the water security of women folk of lower damodar valley aquatic ecosystems the socio ecological function of water in terms of supporting a river ecosystem and the livelihood of people dependent on the river eco hydrology takes a back seat when water is stored and diverted exclusively for productive purpose 74 water security however encompasses both human and environmental concerns so river ecosystems are an important stakeholder in dam assessments the costs borne by river ecosystems have been analysed in terms of alteration in the flow regime hydro morphic variability and ecological impact on aquatic diversity these costs would ultimately affect the water security in terms of fresh water availability and quality for the river dependent population post facto hydro geomorphic studies can be broadly divided into three categories 1 assessments of flow alteration 2 assessments of hydrogeomorphic changes in the fluvial eco system in response to the changed flow regime and 3 basin scale studies of cumulative impacts including both dams and other stressors such as land use and climate change flow alterations have been analysed using a well established method of indicators of hydrologic alteration iha and range of variability approach rva developed by richter et al 1997 86 for farakka barrage by gain giupponi 2014 39 for periyiar and muvattupuzha rivers by abe 2015 1 for ranganadi and dikrong by borgohain 2019 9 for krishna river basin by kumar and jayakumar 2020 61 all the studies report significant hydrologic alteration and changes in the hydrographs hydrogeomorphic studies for specific dams ghosh guchhait 2014 41 pal 2016 79 well as basin scale studies sinha ghosh 2012 93 sinha et al 2014a b 94 95 have used indices like sinosity index braiding index braid channel ratio patterns of fluvial aggradation and degradation etc to measure the changes in the plan form with an aim of minimizing or mitigating the flood hazards several hydrogeomorphic studies have highlighted the fact that dams have contributed in worsening the flood hazard in different ways 48 dams also have caused source sink disconnectivity in the river system due to blocking of the sediment fluxes 48 sediment supply from the rivers to oceans has decreased around 70 80 in most of the indian river basins 42 accelerating coastal erosion processes 80 study of ecological impacts of dams has been attempted globally with different approaches most extensively studied ecological impacts are in terms of altered flow regimes on the aquatic communities followed by impacts of altered geomorphic alterations on the aquatic communities 82 the broad taxonomic groups that were affected were macroinvertebrates fish riparian vegetation in terms of declined abundance diversity shifts in community composition and demographic parameters 82 in indian context choudhary et al 2012 16 have assessed the impact of flow regulation of gandak river on dolphins focusing on the habitat use by river dolphins in relation to river channel depth and morphology the study finds clustering of dolphins in deep pools and near absence of dolphins from intervening segments because of low flow rates the study has highlighted the importance of maintaining adequate dry season flows to ensure river habitat availability and connectivity for dolphins atkore et al 2017 3 have studied factors contributing to the recovery of fish communities downstream of dams the study highlights the role of undammed tributaries and their cumulative impacts on the recovery of fish species downstream of the dam kelkar 2014 56 has documented perceptions of traditional fishing communities about issues and problems in sustenance fishing in the gangetic basin 90 of the 372 fishers spread over 17 rivers in 5 north indian states highlighted low water availability and stoppage of fish migratory routes by large dams as the main cause for fish decline in past four decades fish passages have been found to be ineffective in mitigating the adverse impacts on fisheries production in gangetic plain dey et al 2020 30 have assessed the causes of decline of fish species from river floodplain fisheries of the gangetic plains where farakka barrage was cited by fishers as one of the major causes of fish decline along with over fishing and destructive fishing practices studies conducted by bhaumik et al 2017 5 for narmada river system jumani et al 2018 53 for gundia river in western ghats karnataka and karnataka and rumana et al 2015 88 for river giri in western himalaya find out that the species richness and diversity of freshwater species if significantly affected by the impoundment of flowing rivers the studies argue that these ecological impacts are attributed to changes in water chemistry stream geometry and habitat quality triggered post impoundment 4 systematic assessments systemic assessments of benefits have examined government agencies concerned with economic and developmental goals which propose and implement dams the central question asked is how has the project performed and tally the on ground performance against the project objectives systemic assessments of costs focus on government agencies responsible for environmental protection the central question that these studies ask is were the individual and cumulative impacts predicted and mitigated successfully and more fundamentally was environmental protection given sufficient attention in comparison with the economic benefits of the project both the developmental agencies and environmental agencies are important actors as they have great influence on the physical design of dams but these agencies aren t neutral machines they consist of human beings with their own interests and agendas and the choices they make deeply affects the outcomes 4 1 systemic assessment of benefits and costs the decision to build dams is taken by the economic agencies who must balance multiple goals on the basis of benefit to cost b c ratio systemic assessments thus largely revolve around this decision making process a project is deemed feasible if the b c ratio exceeds 1 5 for normal areas and 1 for drought prone areas however several studies show that the budgets of large hydropower and irrigation dams are systematically biased downward by excluding inflation debt servicing environmental and social costs 2 the decision is often based on an inside view i e focusing on the constituents of the proposed projects rather than on the outcomes of dam projects already completed 2 55 another focal point of systemic assessments is identification of environmental and social costs that the b c ratio excludes while the mainstream political discourse focuses on the benefits gained out of building a dam biophysical and socio economic processes that can reduce the benefits are often systematically excluded at project level some of these processes include the costs of lost irrigation 1 1 dharmadhikari argues that bhakra did not add any new areas under irrigation it only transferred the irrigation from one area to another from areas that were already irrigated through schemes built during pre british and british period which were cut off from the irrigation as the downstream river dried up to newly developed command areas downstream command losing out due to water diversions upstream lands becoming uncultivable due to water logging and salinity problem dam oustees not receiving adequate compensation or facilities etc 31 32 at basin level these processes include reduced yield of the reservoir due to upstream surface and ground water use 74 98 which can adversely affect the irrigation cycles and the irrigated area 74 and states focusing on storing more than their share of allocated in the inter state river basins 72 owing to over commitment of water many of the indian river basins have reached closure 26 72 systematic assessments also point to the failure of the state institutions to mitigate the adverse distributional impacts of dams the findings of the seminal study by duflo and pande 2007 37 suggest that weak institutions or social conflict could be the explanation for adverse distributional consequences in the developing countries these externalized costs result in losers taking the brunt of lost water security because these costs are scattered although impacting significantly to a large population they remain out of mainstream discussions about benefits 4 2 systemic assessment of environmental governance under the environment protection act 1986 obtaining prior environmental clearance ec from the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc which is the main environmental planning and regulatory institution of india has been mandated for irrigation projects with 10000ha for culturable command area cca and hydropower projects with 50 mw capacity elaborate procedures and protocols are prescribed by the moefcc through environmental impact assessment eia notification 2006 for holding public consultations prior clearances for forest wildlife tribal affairs techno economic aspects pollution labor and land acquisition despite this the effectiveness of the indian eia system to reduce and mitigate environmental impacts has been widely questioned 38 problems of compliance with the existing environmental governance framework include inadequate scoping of eia studies poor quality eia studies with insufficient baseline data generic impact prediction non compliance of the tor no analysis of alternatives violation of the protocols of public consultation opacity of the entire process and turning a blind eye towards on ground construction of dams violating the ec process etc 38 83 111 a major critique is that the eia reports are prepared by paid consultants hired by the project proponents the reports are inherently biased frequently downplaying the adverse impacts and remain silent on the cumulative effects of multiple projects being carried out in the same area 11 an important systemic limitation of the current ec process is exemption of shps up to 25 mw from the eia process the underlying assumption of the eia legislation that the impacts of shps are negligible has been sharply criticized particularly from civil society organizations 38 2 2 some of the possible impacts of ror schemes are drying up of long river stretches as the rivers disappear into diversion tunnels in the hydropower cascades alteration of fluvial ecosystem adverse impacts on aquatic diversity increased risk of landslides due blasting tunneling and muck disposal and changes in micro climate yet another important limitation is that cumulative impact assessment cia studies are not mandated by the law 38 the eias are conducted on project basis cumulative footprint is often much larger and complex which is not assessed in the current eia process pradhan and thakkar 2020 83 erlewein 38 and burrier and hultquist 11 have highlighted severe environmental implications of this systemic limitation of cia the exemption of domestic and industrial water supply projects from the ec process 27 poses a similar problem more fundamentally there is inadequate consideration of environmental aspects and lack of third party systematic assessment of the same at the level of policies plans and programs 38 burrier hultquist 2019 11 argue that at the core of the systemic issues lie a bureaucratic hierarchy in which development oriented ministries such as power planning industry irrigation and mining with large budgets greater enforcement mechanisms or higher prestige more easily impact the policy making process and influence critical decision makers on the other hand both central and state level agencies charged with environmental protection have few resources and weak capacity that reduces their ability to influence other ministries or industry 5 dams and water security unpacking the claims 5 1 summary of claims by proponents experts involved in planning design and construction of dams promise a multitude of benefits for water security several pre feasibility reports of dam projects start with the benefits 3 3 e g pfr of chintalapudi lift irrigation scheme on river godavari in andhra pradesh dpr of upper vansadhara irrigation project odhisha dpr of jamrani dam multipurpose project uttarakhand etc describing dams as indispensable for independent india 100 post independence it was argued that the solution to provide adequate food to growing population was to increase the area under cultivation by steadily extending irrigation facilities and large multi purpose dams were an effective way to achieve that dams would hold back enough of the rainfall thus would prevent floods provide water for irrigation during dry season and produce enough electricity for irrigation and industrialization in other words dams promised water security by providing sustainable access to adequate quantities of water for sustaining livelihood human well being and socio economic development dams could create political stability by designing protective irrigation schemes for supplementary irrigation for many as against full irrigation for few 73 in the more recent times the need for dams is also emphasized for providing water supply to domestic largely urban and industrial water use bolstered by the need to meet sdg 6 1 targets 52 5 2 summary of arguments by dam critics dam critics highlight the tradeoffs between water security of different stakeholders highlighting the plight of losers in terms of water security that go unnoticed water security of head reach farmer affects water security of tail end farmers hydropower generation happens at the cost of drinking water security livelihood security and increased flood hazard for the local communities certain communities e g displaced people river dependent population emerge as clear losers in terms of water and livelihood security changes in the fluvial system downstream of the dams further contribute to the flood hazard and loss of livelihood for these communities systemic limitations at planning design construction operation phases amplify these tradeoffs environmental impacts of dams go unchecked due to poor implementation and inherent limitations of the environmental legislature which may ultimately threaten the very sustainability of the river ecosystem services such as fresh water availability fisheries flood regulation climate regulation etc 5 3 reconciling the differences some of the differences between the arguments by dam opponents and proponents can only be understood if we recognize that there are different actors with different interests and world views e g proponents implicitly assume that water for productive purposes is more important than the use of that water for supporting river ecosystem services and people dependent on it it is a value judgement that other ecosystem services such as aquatic diversity flood plains riparian vegetation are less important than increasing food productivity in contrast dam opponents are concerned with the impacts of social and bio physical processes triggered by the way in which dams are implemented on ground in effect although both the parties are looking at the same phenomenon of implementation of dams they value different aspects of the process with differences in goals or interests the divergent claims can then only be adjudicated by first separating the descriptive factual claims from normative values concerns as dietz 35 points out decisions always involve both facts and values scientists often focus on facts overlooking differences in values differences in descriptive claims or facts can be settled by empirical studies but differences in normative concerns or values can only be settled by negotiation legal political or social often disciplinary studies reach seemingly different conclusions because they confuse normative and descriptive claims many studies are not explicit about their underlying normative concerns so these can be hard to identify 65 for instance a study on fish diversity is by definition assuming that fish are important in contrast engineers typically are concerned about technical financial efficiency agricultural productivity meeting domestic and industrial water supply demands etc normative concerns of the sociologists might be well being or marginalized communities and their livelihoods etc in short different disciplines have different frames of what is studied that are driven by what and who matters to their field and normative and descriptive claims and counter claims need to be settled and negotiated by different processes in table 1 we summarise the claims and counterclaims in normative and descriptive terms by different types of studies we make following observations first it is clear that the communities talk past each other 65 and don t directly address each other s concerns empirical studies that clearly show that despite massive investments dams are unable to deliver on their promises yet there is a pervasive sense in the civil engineering community that these concerns lie outside their purview i e that engineering designs are correct and dams have the potential to have multiplier benefits if the benefits of dams don t materialize is a social problem which must be tackled separately but the repeated under performance suggests that the inherent social technical nature of irrigation systems cannot be separated from the engineering aspect in any practical setting in other words social context is as fixed and inalienable as any biophysical law and so infrastructure must be embedded within a social context as uphoff 2019 107 has argued in context of irrigation while policymakers administrators and technicians are willing to invest heavily in the physical aspect of irrigation in design surveys research experimentation well trained staff etc they commonly make decisions about human organization and behavior that have little empirical basis and that lead to poor return on investment lele norgaard 2005 65 suggest looking at assumptions different disciplines make in this context assumptions made about the social component of the irrigation system by water resources planners are often too simplistic when dams are implemented in the real world the outcomes are emergent and deviate significantly from the original design in the process they impact water security in myriad ways that were not in the design fig 2 second the problem of trade offs has not been fully solved dams are a way of adding water to the landscape and trigger multiplier effects in terms of direct and indirect economic impacts bhatia 2007 4 estimates the multiplier effects of bhakra dam for punjab using a fixed price multiplier model based on a social accounting matrix however there are bound to be multipliers at the cost side of the equation which remain unaccounted for there are inherent trade offs between winners and losers but while water security is a composite lens combining the biophysical and socio economic lenses it does not clarify how to settle trade offs or weight human vs environmental concerns when they are in conflict often benefit cost analyses are used to make these comparable but valuing cultural ecological and regulating ecosystem services remains a challenge number of biases and blind spots exist in economic frameworks used to evaluate dams 51 especially in the absence of locally relevant evidence and data this is the primary reason why it is difficult to comment broadly on how dams affect water security third the post facto assessment of major and medium irrigation dams in terms of water security has to happen in comparison with small scale decentralized irrigation systems so far the performance of dams has been assessed against their own promise the assessment is however incomplete without comparing them with other decentralized irrigation options finally there is the issue of co evolution and multiplier effects one of the reasons dams are so hard to assess is that they fundamentally alter the trajectory of a region once new water is brought into the region the crops sown and industries they support change this brings in more investment spurring more economic activity which often results in the claimed multiplier effects sometimes this results in the so called reservoir effect where a shift to more water intensive crops and economic growth increases demand for water creating a perpetual cycle of escalating demand that must be met 57 34 so narrowly defined before and after studies fail to capture this type of co evolution 6 way forward integrating lessons from the past into future water planning based on our review four directions for the way forward emerge 6 1 we need to design and implement dams as socio technical systems the design of the dams and their operation has to be an interdisciplinary exercise researchers from disciplines like ecology social sciences need to be the part of the team and the very purpose of the dams has to accommodate normative concerns of these disciplines this will ensure that the concerns are addressed during the technical design process currently water planning is more or less equated with planning of the major and medium irrigation projects in the design of the physical infrastructure the river is treated exclusively as a hydrological entity groundwater and conjunctive water use don t get factored in other aspects such as cultural values for the river need to be integrated into the techno economic approach 100 there is clearly a need for an integrated approach to river basin planning 97 that goes beyond supply side interventions to demand side management also 6 2 socio hydrology is a promising discipline to bridge the disciplinary boundaries emerging interdisciplinary fields like socio hydrology are promising disciplines that can bridge disciplinary boundaries and help incorporate lessons from the past into future decisions because they can also bring in the larger spatial perspective and have the capacity to uncover the dynamic cross scale interactions and feedbacks between the natural and human processes by 1 analyzing multiscale space time patterns and dynamics of socio hydrologic processes 2 explaining socio hydrologic and discern possible future scenarios and 3 understanding the meaning and values of water to understand biophysical and human interactions 96 6 3 empirical field based ex post research is needed to establish factual evidence but it must feed back into ex ante water planning what is really surprising from the review is the dearth of post facto evaluation assessments considering the magnitude of investment that goes into large water resources projects hypotheses based analyses that explicitly address critiques are few and far between of the 67 articles excluding literature on r r there were only 23 academic papers published between 2000 and 2022 that involved field based impact evaluation studies of any kind there is a particular dearth of natural science studies that reflect on and conduct sensitivity analyses on assumptions used to design dams there is a need to account for the cumulative impacts of changes in the watershed including multiple dam projects or decline in inflows due to groundwater abstraction watershed development or climate change once evidence is generated it must actually get used the governance processes designed for proposing and implementing the dams are all ex ante or forward looking based on b c analysis rule curve eia without thresholds for ecosystem services e flows etc these processes essentially prescribe what should happen however once implemented social processes take over as human agents act in their own interest deviating from the prescribed rules of operation similarly ecological processes respond with their own feedback loops it is thus necessary to design the governance around irrigation planning in way that these feedbacks and deviations are anticipated this requires that learning from the ex post evaluation studies to feed back in the dam design process this requires creation of explicit processes for this to occur 6 4 structured processes like shared vision planning can be used to negotiate competing normative claims while differences in factual claims can be settled by doing more science differences in trade offs between upstream and downstream villages humans and the environment can only be settled through negotiation formal integration of the social and technical aspects has been mainstreamed in places across the world through processes like shared vision planning which is a collaborative approach to formulating water management solutions that combines 1 traditional water resources planning 2 structured public participation and 3 collaborative computer modeling 109 110 if dams are to be solution to boost water security they must be designed and implemented accounting for current and anticipated changes to the river basin and their costs and benefits must be considered along side a range of other integrated water management solutions 7 annexure 1 search terms sr no category search words 1 social impacts social impacts dams indiasocial impacts case study indiarehabilitation and

20106,today india is the third largest dam building country in the world with over five thousand large dams however despite the significantly large expenditure the actual area irrigated by canal has shown an overall decline since 1991 today more than 60 of india s irrigation happens through groundwater evaluation reports by official agencies like comptroller and auditor general of india cag and independent evaluations by civil society organizations have pointed out to the poor performance of dams during construction operation and maintenance despite this the narrative that the dams play a vital role in providing overall water security to the country has not been validated with help of a closer look at the empirical evidence on performance of dams in the academia to address this we embark on a comprehensive socio hydrologic review of evaluation studies to understand if large dams have in fact improved water security defined broadly beyond just the canal command area we ask two questions i what types of studies have been conducted ii what do they collectively say about dams improving water security we find that while the engineers and experts have ex ante promised water security through dams the ex post studies have highlighted several pathways through which dams adversely affect water security they essentially highlight the tradeoffs between water security of different stakeholders and bring out the losers that go unnoticed growing empirical evidence shows that despite massive investments dams are unable to deliver on their promises we argue that this repeated under performance suggests that the inherent social technical nature of irrigation systems has not been internalized in the dam design process in the way forward we have discussed the need to design and implement dams as socio technical systems need for empirical field based ex post research to establish factual evidence further it must feed back into ex ante water planning structured processes like shared vision planning can be used to negotiate competing normative claims keywords dams post facto assessments india 1 introduction in the post colonial era dams were positioned as critical to feeding a growing population and pursuing the developmental agenda for independent india canal irrigation became deeply embedded in central as well as state water planning today india the third largest dam building country globally 46 has over five thousand large dams 25 proponents argue that dams improve food and water security they provide farmers with water in the dry season and boost food security water security is an evolving concept that in recent years has come to include water for both humans and ecosystems human water security encompasses sustainable access to adequate quantities and acceptable quality of water 105 it thus requires addressing not only physical water scarcity but also the underlying socio economic reasons for scarcity like power poverty and inequality dams are human interventions that allow storage of water at large scales bringing about large scale socio economic changes in the distribution control and access to water but they also fundamentally alter flow regimes and trigger long term bio physical changes in the river ecosystem dams thus deeply affect water security in terms of humans as well as ecosystems and assessments of their impact on water security must include both india has spent 400 000 crores usd 55 billion on major and medium dams since independence 68 even today nearly 40 of the budget of the water resources department of ministry of jal shakti goes to operation and maintenance major and medium dams 29 despite this massive expenditure the net area irrigated by canals has stagnated since 1991 36 47 49 101 public expenditure on major and medium dams increased from 10 billion us in 1980 to 42 billion us in 2005 during this period contribution of net canal irrigated area to net irrigated area dropped from 40 to 23 and contribution of net groundwater irrigated area increased from 48 to 60 today more than 60 of india s irrigation is through groundwater 68 independent evaluation reports by official agencies like comptroller and auditor general of india cag academicians and civil society organizations have shed light on the poor performance during construction operation and maintenance of major and medium dams in terms of technical financial environmental and social aspects 17 24 the reports indicate that technically and financially unviable irrigation schemes have become routine in recent decades for political economy reasons construction repair and extension of canals to improve water supply to the farms serves as both an electoral promise and a way of extracting financial resources to generate funds for the members of legislative assembly to secure re election 72 given the massive spending and uncertain returns it is imperative to assess how dams actually impact water security to assess the bureaucratic justification that dams play a vital role in providing overall water security to the country 25 we embark on a comprehensive socio hydrologic review of evaluation studies to understand if large dams in india have in fact improved water security broadly defined beyond just the canal command area we ask two questions i what types of studies have been conducted in india ii what do they collectively say about the impact of dams on water security because of the disparity in claims between the potential and actual performance we focus on empirical post facto studies rather than ex ante engineering analyses 2 review methodology as dams bring about large scale irreversible changes in land use landcover socio economic profile and hydrology post facto assessment of dams has been conducted by multiple stakeholders and from different value positions for academic as well as non academic purposes for this review paper we focus on indian studies as well as global studies where india features prominently although dam building receded after world commission on dams wcd report in 2000 with financial institutions pulling out the funding for the dam projects 59 india continued to build dams nearly 2000 more dams have been added post 2000 the volume of literature produced on the dams during the wcd proceedings was substantial although the wcd studies did bring about some changes in the sector the overall performance of the sector in tackling the social and environmental costs of dams remains dismal according to recent cag reports 17 24 given the heightened attention to the environment and climate change and expansion of groundwater in the last two decades a fresh review of studies post wcd is warranted thus in this review we focus on papers published post 2000 this review is not intended to understand whether dams improve water security in theory but whether they do so in practice accordingly the review focuses on dams as socio technical system rather than as engineering structures irrigation systems have long been conceptualised as combined physical and human socio technical systems an irrigation scheme alters the relationship between humans technologies and natural resources it transforms a technical project into a socio technical one as it brings together farmers their labour their land crops water and other resources like financial capital in some order 8 irrigation is also an inherently social process because of the interdependence among farmers and water managers as it requires a degree of co operation among water users and with any persons managing the irrigation system at higher levels 107 physically dams and the canals convey water but how and when they do is determined by social processes thus they are also social spaces where irrigators and government officials are one of many actors 106 cited by 74 therefore throughout the paper we build arguments based on this hybrid understanding 74 of dams we try to bring together in a single framework the different scales and dimensions of dams as embedded within larger hydro social cycle a concept elaborated by 74 we anchor our analysis in the concept of water security as defined by the un water to be the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities and acceptable quality of water for sustaining livelihoods human wellbeing and socio economic development for ensuring protection against waterborne pollution and water related disasters and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability 105 methodology we used search engine optimisation seo to find the relevant papers for different themes google scholar is known to find the largest percentage of citations including non journal sources such as books conference papers and unpublished materials etc 66 we included gray literature from well established agencies since there were very few peer reviewed publications overall moreover we found several comprehensive reports that were rich in insights particularly on the social and environmental impacts of dams we identified key thematic areas in post facto evaluation e g social impacts hydrological impacts etc and used combinations for search terms for each theme a total of 50 different search word combinations were used annexure i we also followed bibliographies of relevant papers we downloaded total of 175 journal articles and non academic reports of which we retained 67 papers that were robust in methodology with clear insights out of which 11 were non academic articles and reports we did not include studies that were commissioned by interest groups or those with obvious conflicts of interest in terms of funding additionally we cite 23 academic papers six non academic articles and eight government reports for supporting information because post facto assessments are largely critical of dams to ensure a balanced review we oversampled papers from authors known to favor dams as a solution and integrated their arguments to better summarize claims by dam proponents in the discussion section in this literature review we employ a benefit cost framework as an organizing principle we divided the literature assessed broadly into assessments of costs and assessments of benefits see fig 1 for each category we investigated studies that assessed or evaluated stakeholder specific benefits or costs as well as studies that took a broader systemic approach in general stakeholder wise assessments tended to use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods and provide a worm s eye view of the projects systemic assessments on the other hand took an bird s eye view focusing on the systems and processes responsible for planning design construction of dams using a combination of field observations primary and secondary data dams follow the typical cycle of planning design construction operation deviations are widely observed at each stage which alter both the benefits as well as the costs associated with dams therefore throughout the review we note where the differences in benefit costs that emerge because the projects deviated from the design versus where they original claims themselves were flawed 3 stakeholder wise assessments of benefits and costs different benefits accrue to different stakeholders for this review we assessed two of the most important stakeholders viz farmers and hydropower affected population in case of farmers post facto assessments investigated the performance of the irrigation projects in terms of adequacy of the canal water timeliness ease of access and participatory decision making in case of hydropower projects post facto assessments focused on benefit sharing with affected populations 3 1 stakeholder wise assessment of benefits canal command farmers historically in india dams have been proposed and constructed to increase the food security of the country benefit to farmers in form of irrigation thus remains an important narrative while proposing dams the irrigation schemes tend to be viewed as an overall success story e g chandran and ambili 2016 15 using performance indicators developed by central water commission cwc or international water management institute iwmi these indicators however use the aggregated data at the command level thus concealing the disparities of the performance within the command the indicators also do not compare the performance with the level of irrigation promised in the original design thus for our review we have specifically chosen performance evaluation studies which focus on the granular picture within the command supported by primary data collected from the field these performance evaluation studies for irrigation projects can be classified in two categories i qualitative studies which include mollinga 2001 2014 73 74 narain 2008 76 kulkani 2018 60 celio 2010 12 nikku 2002 78 that have assessed how farmers or bureaucrats individually or collectively maneuvered project implementation to deviate from the project design to further their own interests ii quantitative studies which include gaur et al 2008 40 nikam et al 2020 77 ray et al 2002 85 that have assessed the on ground agricultural productivity using remote sensing rs geographical information systems gis the qualitative studies essentially focus on the social component while the quantitative studies focus on the bio physical impacts of the socio technical processes of irrigation despite fundamental differences in epistemology and methodology the central conclusion tying both the qualitative and quantitative studies was surprisingly similar that there was inequity in distribution of canal irrigation benefits interestingly even studies that started without any specific focus on equity issues ended up concluding that the distribution of benefits was inequitable 12 40 76 77 85 the irrigation schemes evaluated for their performance were all promoted as protective irrigation schemes designed for supplementary irrigation for low water consuming crops as mollinga 2001 2014 73 74 has discussed this scarcity by design aims to spread water thinly over large irrigated area to reach the largest possible number of beneficiaries in contrast with this objective of the greatest common good individual farmers prefer to maximise agricultural output on their land indeed upstream farmers are consistently able to exert their locational advantage to do so because of the inability to enforce the prescribed cropping patterns and allocations in most case studies kulkarni 2018 60 mollinga 2001 73 2014 74 narain 2008 76 the cropping pattern in the command area gradually shifted towards water intensive crops over time the irrigation pattern changed from thinly spread and equal to concentrated and unequal myriad social processes were driving this change e g policies and practices promoted during green revolution pre existing socio economic hierarchies coupled with technical design of the canals 60 73 74 76 the scarcity of canal water further aggravated when irrigation water was diverted for urban and industrial water use something that was rarely envisaged in the original project design the upstream abstractions further reduced the yield of reservoirs 12 60 98 the most common manifestation of inequity was the head reach farmers appropriating more water with the tail end farmers receiving significantly less share of their entitled water quantitative studies using rs gis techniques to assess the performance of irrigation projects observed similar patterns of inequity between the head and tail reach viz ray 2002 85 mahi right bank canal command gujarat gaur 2008 40 nagarjuna sagar irrigation project andhra pradesh and nikam et al 2018 77 upper wardha irrigation project maharashtra the qualitative studies explored the processes by which this inequity was perpetuated such as socio economic dependence of tail end farmers on the head reach farmers in form of credit or wage employment 73 or political interests capturing the water user associations wuas 60 78 etc e g canal water distribution rules that amplify the inequity by tying canal water rights to acreage of land ownership thereby reinforcing the existing patterns of inequality in land ownership 76 biophysical processes of canal losses to the tune of 20 30 76 that contribute to water not reaching the tail end kulkarni 2018 60 note that borewells are an important factor aggravating the inequity prosperous farmers from the head reach invest in private wells which are in turn recharged by canal leakage thus farmers are able to ensure water security for their fields by timing the control of flows even when the reservoir levels drop additionally they do not have to pay for the canal water 60 the emerging groundwater economy in canal command areas has severe equity implications in terms of direct access to water and decision making in its use and allocation 60 91 kulkarni 2018 60 argues that this is a conversion of public water resource into a private one which is ultimately forcing the small and marginal farmers to exit from the farming system altogether thus the process of canal water distribution which is essentially envisaged as a technical problem when unfolds as a sociotechnical system in tandem with larger hydro social cycle ends up negatively impacting water security of some canal farmers by limiting their access to adequate quantities of irrigation water hydropower affected communities hydropower projects have traditionally been considered climate friendly however as establishment of a hydropower project involves substantially large infrastructure development such as storage structures diversion tunnels powerhouse transmission lines etc 108 the claim that hydropower projects are environmentally benign is increasingly being questioned as a result the communities living in the vicinity of the project have to cope with several short term as well as long term environmental impacts during construction and operation of the hydropower projects 9 38 62 84 89 108 their relationship with the river and the social processes around it are fundamentally altered along with the changed flow of the river in context of hydropower the principal idea of benefit sharing is to share the benefits resulting from the development of hydropower projects in order to satisfy the needs of the concerned local communities benefit sharing mechanisms employed by the project proponents have evolved over time and present literature makes a clear distinction between compensation and mitigation measures and benefit sharing only those efforts that go beyond the obligatory requirements of compensation and mitigation measures adopted by the hydropower projects can be called as benefit sharing 45 typical benefit sharing agreements involve royalties to the state government and local communities rehabilitation and resettlement policies sustainable development policies to cater to ecosystem and livelihood impacts and corporate social responsibility policies 10 44 benefit sharing agreements typically focus only on possible benefits and not mitigation of negative externalities on the larger hydro social cycle that the hydropower projects are a part of several of these externalities particularly affect the water security of the community e g drying up of springs because of blasting 38 62 84 drying up of the river with the associated loss of ecosystem services 9 38 and flash floods caused by hydropower peaking 84 89 rao 2014 84 argue that in sikkim the benefit sharing mechanisms have remained delinked from the serious concerns of ecological damage expressed by the communities and in absence of monitoring and evaluation both public and private sector have failed to implement the benefit sharing mechanisms finally many benefit sharing agreements as drafted on paper during project design do not materalise in practice at all buechler et al 2016 10 highlight the need for more transparent institutional mechanisms and enforcement of rules mandated by the state and central governments through legal instruments that could be enforced by lower courts overall benefit sharing mechanisms are largely seen as unsuccessful in catering to the adverse effects on the water security of the local affected communities flood protected communities limited success of structural measures centered flood management protection from floods is an important aspect of the water security concept india has invested significantly in dams and reservoirs built as a structural measure for flood protection other measures include embankments drainage channels river training works etc despite massive investments have been put into the construction of structural measures along with institutional and legal set up to mitigate the impacts of floods the flood control efforts in india they have achieved limited success in controlling the socio economic damages 43 70 92 based on regressions for the three most vulnerable states viz bihar uttar pradesh and west bengal for the period of 1971 to 1996 gupta et al 2003 43 argue that even though the extent of protection has increased over time it has not kept pace with the demographic trends and has been inadequate in reducing the vulnerability to floods studies reviewing overall flood control efforts of india argue that ineffective implementation of non structural measures affects the performance of structural measures 70 92 overall neglect of timely construction maintenance and functioning of flood measures 92 absence of important non structural measures such as emergency action plans dam breach studies optimal operating procedures studies to reduce sediment deposits for most of the dams 70 and insufficient investment in non structural measures such as flood mapping zoning flood fighting abilities of people etc have reduced the overall effectiveness of the structural measures 92 while flood management in india is a very complex process with several socio hydro climatological factors 70 the importance of social processes in flood protection such as rescue relief rehabilitation has been realized very late in india 70 92 although flood control which is an important aspect of water security has been a promise while constructing dams whether dams control or contribute to floods can be debated several studies have demonstrated how improper management of high water level conditions in reservoirs and consequent sudden release of water especially during the periods of high intensity rainfall have routinely caused high intensity floods kerala floods of 2018 have been widely studied 64 69 99 102 and the cause has been identified as a combination of extreme rainfall and significant release of water from almost full reservoirs most recently study of krishna basin floods in maharashtra in 2019 33 104 2016 flood of bihar 28 and earlier studies of floods of lower krishna basin in 2009 58 mahanadi basin 50 all point out to the role of dams in worsening the flood situation a common feature of these floods has been a lack of early release of water from reservoirs with subsequent heavy discharges coinciding with a high catchment inflow due to extreme rainfall events such dam operation has been termed as un engineered 70 or un scientific 64 several studies have recommended modification of rule curves for releases from dams in extreme flood situations 99 69 33 50 singh and kumar 2017 92 have discussed occurrences of severe and devastating floods at different gauging and discharge sites on indian rivers from 1951 to 2003 majority of severe and devastating floods occurred in the month of september followed by august they are primarily attributed to good monsoon showers in september and subsequent release of already stored water from the reservoirs all in all although dams as a structure promise protection from floods dams when implemented as socio technical systems have failed to fulfill that objective the non structural measures which are essentially governed by a myriad of social processes have severely lagged behind thereby significantly reducing the effectiveness of the flood control dams cities with growing urban water demand as large reservoirs play a more and more role in meeting the growing urban water demand cities are emerging as new beneficiaries of benefits of dams analysing 302 urban centres mukharjee et al 2010 75 argue that cities with larger population size tend to depend more on surface water sources which in turn helps sustain higher levels of per capita water supply cities often destroy local water sources as they expand 71 and pose serious threat to the sustainability of the local water resource base such as wells ponds and tanks 75 thus the urban centers tend to depend on imported water from large reservoirs for ensuring sustainable water supplies 75 however ensuring water security to the cities is often in conflict with the water security of agriculture sector molle and berkoff 2006 71 have at length discussed the trade offs between agriculture and urban water supply the authors argue that cities are successful in increasing their water supply through varied ways such as by constructing new reservoirs on nearby streams bringing water from distant basins through inter basin transfers or tapping local or distant aquifers often in an unsustainable way the farmers on the other hand employ various coping mechanisms to adjust to the growing water scarcity e g improving irrigation efficiency at farm or scheme level changing cropping patterns exploiting groundwater diverting more surface water by using wastewater etc in absence of coping mechanisms many of them are being out pumped by depleting aquifers or driven out of farming system due to reduced supplies of surface water 3 2 stakeholder wise assessment of costs stakeholder wise assessments of costs have focused on social cost for displaced peoples as well as the riparian populations environmental costs have been assessed in terms of hydrological geo morphological and ecological impacts on the river ecosystem the central questions that these studies ask are how have the stakeholders been impacted and what costs have they borne project affected populations in a review of literature on social impact assessment sia conducted by kirchherr et al 59 more than 67 out of 217 the articles indicated negative impact on infrastructure in terms of irrigation drinking water access and livelihoods in india the overall living standard of the displaced population seems to worsen 90 as quality of r r process remains poor with non availability and poor maintenance of basic infrastructure in resettled villages 24 the water security of the displaced population thus seems adversely impacted in absence of irrigation and drinking water services deep adverse impacts on the livelihoods of downstream riparian populations are a less discussed but important component of the hydro social cycle that dams affect these impacts have been highlighted by richter et al 2010 87 the ecological changes induced because of the altered flow regime disrupt livelihoods dependent on fisheries flood recession agriculture and dry season grazing the authors estimate that globally 472 million river dependent people living along dry river stretches downstream of large dams have experienced a disruption of their livelihoods loss of food security and physical cultural and spiritual well being of these 123 million 26 are from india similar impacts in terms of sustenance fishing due to loss of access to river caused by small hydro projects shps have been highlighted by jumani et al 2016 54 lahiri dutt 2012 63 has studied gender dimension of altered river flows in damodar valley of kolkata after construction of series of flood control and hydropower dams by dvc floods in the valley have become highly unpredictable longer in duration and thus more destructive they are now a much greater physical burden on women in terms of gender assigned tasks such as fetching water fuel wood etc the changed nature of floods has jeopardized the water security of women folk of lower damodar valley aquatic ecosystems the socio ecological function of water in terms of supporting a river ecosystem and the livelihood of people dependent on the river eco hydrology takes a back seat when water is stored and diverted exclusively for productive purpose 74 water security however encompasses both human and environmental concerns so river ecosystems are an important stakeholder in dam assessments the costs borne by river ecosystems have been analysed in terms of alteration in the flow regime hydro morphic variability and ecological impact on aquatic diversity these costs would ultimately affect the water security in terms of fresh water availability and quality for the river dependent population post facto hydro geomorphic studies can be broadly divided into three categories 1 assessments of flow alteration 2 assessments of hydrogeomorphic changes in the fluvial eco system in response to the changed flow regime and 3 basin scale studies of cumulative impacts including both dams and other stressors such as land use and climate change flow alterations have been analysed using a well established method of indicators of hydrologic alteration iha and range of variability approach rva developed by richter et al 1997 86 for farakka barrage by gain giupponi 2014 39 for periyiar and muvattupuzha rivers by abe 2015 1 for ranganadi and dikrong by borgohain 2019 9 for krishna river basin by kumar and jayakumar 2020 61 all the studies report significant hydrologic alteration and changes in the hydrographs hydrogeomorphic studies for specific dams ghosh guchhait 2014 41 pal 2016 79 well as basin scale studies sinha ghosh 2012 93 sinha et al 2014a b 94 95 have used indices like sinosity index braiding index braid channel ratio patterns of fluvial aggradation and degradation etc to measure the changes in the plan form with an aim of minimizing or mitigating the flood hazards several hydrogeomorphic studies have highlighted the fact that dams have contributed in worsening the flood hazard in different ways 48 dams also have caused source sink disconnectivity in the river system due to blocking of the sediment fluxes 48 sediment supply from the rivers to oceans has decreased around 70 80 in most of the indian river basins 42 accelerating coastal erosion processes 80 study of ecological impacts of dams has been attempted globally with different approaches most extensively studied ecological impacts are in terms of altered flow regimes on the aquatic communities followed by impacts of altered geomorphic alterations on the aquatic communities 82 the broad taxonomic groups that were affected were macroinvertebrates fish riparian vegetation in terms of declined abundance diversity shifts in community composition and demographic parameters 82 in indian context choudhary et al 2012 16 have assessed the impact of flow regulation of gandak river on dolphins focusing on the habitat use by river dolphins in relation to river channel depth and morphology the study finds clustering of dolphins in deep pools and near absence of dolphins from intervening segments because of low flow rates the study has highlighted the importance of maintaining adequate dry season flows to ensure river habitat availability and connectivity for dolphins atkore et al 2017 3 have studied factors contributing to the recovery of fish communities downstream of dams the study highlights the role of undammed tributaries and their cumulative impacts on the recovery of fish species downstream of the dam kelkar 2014 56 has documented perceptions of traditional fishing communities about issues and problems in sustenance fishing in the gangetic basin 90 of the 372 fishers spread over 17 rivers in 5 north indian states highlighted low water availability and stoppage of fish migratory routes by large dams as the main cause for fish decline in past four decades fish passages have been found to be ineffective in mitigating the adverse impacts on fisheries production in gangetic plain dey et al 2020 30 have assessed the causes of decline of fish species from river floodplain fisheries of the gangetic plains where farakka barrage was cited by fishers as one of the major causes of fish decline along with over fishing and destructive fishing practices studies conducted by bhaumik et al 2017 5 for narmada river system jumani et al 2018 53 for gundia river in western ghats karnataka and karnataka and rumana et al 2015 88 for river giri in western himalaya find out that the species richness and diversity of freshwater species if significantly affected by the impoundment of flowing rivers the studies argue that these ecological impacts are attributed to changes in water chemistry stream geometry and habitat quality triggered post impoundment 4 systematic assessments systemic assessments of benefits have examined government agencies concerned with economic and developmental goals which propose and implement dams the central question asked is how has the project performed and tally the on ground performance against the project objectives systemic assessments of costs focus on government agencies responsible for environmental protection the central question that these studies ask is were the individual and cumulative impacts predicted and mitigated successfully and more fundamentally was environmental protection given sufficient attention in comparison with the economic benefits of the project both the developmental agencies and environmental agencies are important actors as they have great influence on the physical design of dams but these agencies aren t neutral machines they consist of human beings with their own interests and agendas and the choices they make deeply affects the outcomes 4 1 systemic assessment of benefits and costs the decision to build dams is taken by the economic agencies who must balance multiple goals on the basis of benefit to cost b c ratio systemic assessments thus largely revolve around this decision making process a project is deemed feasible if the b c ratio exceeds 1 5 for normal areas and 1 for drought prone areas however several studies show that the budgets of large hydropower and irrigation dams are systematically biased downward by excluding inflation debt servicing environmental and social costs 2 the decision is often based on an inside view i e focusing on the constituents of the proposed projects rather than on the outcomes of dam projects already completed 2 55 another focal point of systemic assessments is identification of environmental and social costs that the b c ratio excludes while the mainstream political discourse focuses on the benefits gained out of building a dam biophysical and socio economic processes that can reduce the benefits are often systematically excluded at project level some of these processes include the costs of lost irrigation 1 1 dharmadhikari argues that bhakra did not add any new areas under irrigation it only transferred the irrigation from one area to another from areas that were already irrigated through schemes built during pre british and british period which were cut off from the irrigation as the downstream river dried up to newly developed command areas downstream command losing out due to water diversions upstream lands becoming uncultivable due to water logging and salinity problem dam oustees not receiving adequate compensation or facilities etc 31 32 at basin level these processes include reduced yield of the reservoir due to upstream surface and ground water use 74 98 which can adversely affect the irrigation cycles and the irrigated area 74 and states focusing on storing more than their share of allocated in the inter state river basins 72 owing to over commitment of water many of the indian river basins have reached closure 26 72 systematic assessments also point to the failure of the state institutions to mitigate the adverse distributional impacts of dams the findings of the seminal study by duflo and pande 2007 37 suggest that weak institutions or social conflict could be the explanation for adverse distributional consequences in the developing countries these externalized costs result in losers taking the brunt of lost water security because these costs are scattered although impacting significantly to a large population they remain out of mainstream discussions about benefits 4 2 systemic assessment of environmental governance under the environment protection act 1986 obtaining prior environmental clearance ec from the ministry of environment forest and climate change moefcc which is the main environmental planning and regulatory institution of india has been mandated for irrigation projects with 10000ha for culturable command area cca and hydropower projects with 50 mw capacity elaborate procedures and protocols are prescribed by the moefcc through environmental impact assessment eia notification 2006 for holding public consultations prior clearances for forest wildlife tribal affairs techno economic aspects pollution labor and land acquisition despite this the effectiveness of the indian eia system to reduce and mitigate environmental impacts has been widely questioned 38 problems of compliance with the existing environmental governance framework include inadequate scoping of eia studies poor quality eia studies with insufficient baseline data generic impact prediction non compliance of the tor no analysis of alternatives violation of the protocols of public consultation opacity of the entire process and turning a blind eye towards on ground construction of dams violating the ec process etc 38 83 111 a major critique is that the eia reports are prepared by paid consultants hired by the project proponents the reports are inherently biased frequently downplaying the adverse impacts and remain silent on the cumulative effects of multiple projects being carried out in the same area 11 an important systemic limitation of the current ec process is exemption of shps up to 25 mw from the eia process the underlying assumption of the eia legislation that the impacts of shps are negligible has been sharply criticized particularly from civil society organizations 38 2 2 some of the possible impacts of ror schemes are drying up of long river stretches as the rivers disappear into diversion tunnels in the hydropower cascades alteration of fluvial ecosystem adverse impacts on aquatic diversity increased risk of landslides due blasting tunneling and muck disposal and changes in micro climate yet another important limitation is that cumulative impact assessment cia studies are not mandated by the law 38 the eias are conducted on project basis cumulative footprint is often much larger and complex which is not assessed in the current eia process pradhan and thakkar 2020 83 erlewein 38 and burrier and hultquist 11 have highlighted severe environmental implications of this systemic limitation of cia the exemption of domestic and industrial water supply projects from the ec process 27 poses a similar problem more fundamentally there is inadequate consideration of environmental aspects and lack of third party systematic assessment of the same at the level of policies plans and programs 38 burrier hultquist 2019 11 argue that at the core of the systemic issues lie a bureaucratic hierarchy in which development oriented ministries such as power planning industry irrigation and mining with large budgets greater enforcement mechanisms or higher prestige more easily impact the policy making process and influence critical decision makers on the other hand both central and state level agencies charged with environmental protection have few resources and weak capacity that reduces their ability to influence other ministries or industry 5 dams and water security unpacking the claims 5 1 summary of claims by proponents experts involved in planning design and construction of dams promise a multitude of benefits for water security several pre feasibility reports of dam projects start with the benefits 3 3 e g pfr of chintalapudi lift irrigation scheme on river godavari in andhra pradesh dpr of upper vansadhara irrigation project odhisha dpr of jamrani dam multipurpose project uttarakhand etc describing dams as indispensable for independent india 100 post independence it was argued that the solution to provide adequate food to growing population was to increase the area under cultivation by steadily extending irrigation facilities and large multi purpose dams were an effective way to achieve that dams would hold back enough of the rainfall thus would prevent floods provide water for irrigation during dry season and produce enough electricity for irrigation and industrialization in other words dams promised water security by providing sustainable access to adequate quantities of water for sustaining livelihood human well being and socio economic development dams could create political stability by designing protective irrigation schemes for supplementary irrigation for many as against full irrigation for few 73 in the more recent times the need for dams is also emphasized for providing water supply to domestic largely urban and industrial water use bolstered by the need to meet sdg 6 1 targets 52 5 2 summary of arguments by dam critics dam critics highlight the tradeoffs between water security of different stakeholders highlighting the plight of losers in terms of water security that go unnoticed water security of head reach farmer affects water security of tail end farmers hydropower generation happens at the cost of drinking water security livelihood security and increased flood hazard for the local communities certain communities e g displaced people river dependent population emerge as clear losers in terms of water and livelihood security changes in the fluvial system downstream of the dams further contribute to the flood hazard and loss of livelihood for these communities systemic limitations at planning design construction operation phases amplify these tradeoffs environmental impacts of dams go unchecked due to poor implementation and inherent limitations of the environmental legislature which may ultimately threaten the very sustainability of the river ecosystem services such as fresh water availability fisheries flood regulation climate regulation etc 5 3 reconciling the differences some of the differences between the arguments by dam opponents and proponents can only be understood if we recognize that there are different actors with different interests and world views e g proponents implicitly assume that water for productive purposes is more important than the use of that water for supporting river ecosystem services and people dependent on it it is a value judgement that other ecosystem services such as aquatic diversity flood plains riparian vegetation are less important than increasing food productivity in contrast dam opponents are concerned with the impacts of social and bio physical processes triggered by the way in which dams are implemented on ground in effect although both the parties are looking at the same phenomenon of implementation of dams they value different aspects of the process with differences in goals or interests the divergent claims can then only be adjudicated by first separating the descriptive factual claims from normative values concerns as dietz 35 points out decisions always involve both facts and values scientists often focus on facts overlooking differences in values differences in descriptive claims or facts can be settled by empirical studies but differences in normative concerns or values can only be settled by negotiation legal political or social often disciplinary studies reach seemingly different conclusions because they confuse normative and descriptive claims many studies are not explicit about their underlying normative concerns so these can be hard to identify 65 for instance a study on fish diversity is by definition assuming that fish are important in contrast engineers typically are concerned about technical financial efficiency agricultural productivity meeting domestic and industrial water supply demands etc normative concerns of the sociologists might be well being or marginalized communities and their livelihoods etc in short different disciplines have different frames of what is studied that are driven by what and who matters to their field and normative and descriptive claims and counter claims need to be settled and negotiated by different processes in table 1 we summarise the claims and counterclaims in normative and descriptive terms by different types of studies we make following observations first it is clear that the communities talk past each other 65 and don t directly address each other s concerns empirical studies that clearly show that despite massive investments dams are unable to deliver on their promises yet there is a pervasive sense in the civil engineering community that these concerns lie outside their purview i e that engineering designs are correct and dams have the potential to have multiplier benefits if the benefits of dams don t materialize is a social problem which must be tackled separately but the repeated under performance suggests that the inherent social technical nature of irrigation systems cannot be separated from the engineering aspect in any practical setting in other words social context is as fixed and inalienable as any biophysical law and so infrastructure must be embedded within a social context as uphoff 2019 107 has argued in context of irrigation while policymakers administrators and technicians are willing to invest heavily in the physical aspect of irrigation in design surveys research experimentation well trained staff etc they commonly make decisions about human organization and behavior that have little empirical basis and that lead to poor return on investment lele norgaard 2005 65 suggest looking at assumptions different disciplines make in this context assumptions made about the social component of the irrigation system by water resources planners are often too simplistic when dams are implemented in the real world the outcomes are emergent and deviate significantly from the original design in the process they impact water security in myriad ways that were not in the design fig 2 second the problem of trade offs has not been fully solved dams are a way of adding water to the landscape and trigger multiplier effects in terms of direct and indirect economic impacts bhatia 2007 4 estimates the multiplier effects of bhakra dam for punjab using a fixed price multiplier model based on a social accounting matrix however there are bound to be multipliers at the cost side of the equation which remain unaccounted for there are inherent trade offs between winners and losers but while water security is a composite lens combining the biophysical and socio economic lenses it does not clarify how to settle trade offs or weight human vs environmental concerns when they are in conflict often benefit cost analyses are used to make these comparable but valuing cultural ecological and regulating ecosystem services remains a challenge number of biases and blind spots exist in economic frameworks used to evaluate dams 51 especially in the absence of locally relevant evidence and data this is the primary reason why it is difficult to comment broadly on how dams affect water security third the post facto assessment of major and medium irrigation dams in terms of water security has to happen in comparison with small scale decentralized irrigation systems so far the performance of dams has been assessed against their own promise the assessment is however incomplete without comparing them with other decentralized irrigation options finally there is the issue of co evolution and multiplier effects one of the reasons dams are so hard to assess is that they fundamentally alter the trajectory of a region once new water is brought into the region the crops sown and industries they support change this brings in more investment spurring more economic activity which often results in the claimed multiplier effects sometimes this results in the so called reservoir effect where a shift to more water intensive crops and economic growth increases demand for water creating a perpetual cycle of escalating demand that must be met 57 34 so narrowly defined before and after studies fail to capture this type of co evolution 6 way forward integrating lessons from the past into future water planning based on our review four directions for the way forward emerge 6 1 we need to design and implement dams as socio technical systems the design of the dams and their operation has to be an interdisciplinary exercise researchers from disciplines like ecology social sciences need to be the part of the team and the very purpose of the dams has to accommodate normative concerns of these disciplines this will ensure that the concerns are addressed during the technical design process currently water planning is more or less equated with planning of the major and medium irrigation projects in the design of the physical infrastructure the river is treated exclusively as a hydrological entity groundwater and conjunctive water use don t get factored in other aspects such as cultural values for the river need to be integrated into the techno economic approach 100 there is clearly a need for an integrated approach to river basin planning 97 that goes beyond supply side interventions to demand side management also 6 2 socio hydrology is a promising discipline to bridge the disciplinary boundaries emerging interdisciplinary fields like socio hydrology are promising disciplines that can bridge disciplinary boundaries and help incorporate lessons from the past into future decisions because they can also bring in the larger spatial perspective and have the capacity to uncover the dynamic cross scale interactions and feedbacks between the natural and human processes by 1 analyzing multiscale space time patterns and dynamics of socio hydrologic processes 2 explaining socio hydrologic and discern possible future scenarios and 3 understanding the meaning and values of water to understand biophysical and human interactions 96 6 3 empirical field based ex post research is needed to establish factual evidence but it must feed back into ex ante water planning what is really surprising from the review is the dearth of post facto evaluation assessments considering the magnitude of investment that goes into large water resources projects hypotheses based analyses that explicitly address critiques are few and far between of the 67 articles excluding literature on r r there were only 23 academic papers published between 2000 and 2022 that involved field based impact evaluation studies of any kind there is a particular dearth of natural science studies that reflect on and conduct sensitivity analyses on assumptions used to design dams there is a need to account for the cumulative impacts of changes in the watershed including multiple dam projects or decline in inflows due to groundwater abstraction watershed development or climate change once evidence is generated it must actually get used the governance processes designed for proposing and implementing the dams are all ex ante or forward looking based on b c analysis rule curve eia without thresholds for ecosystem services e flows etc these processes essentially prescribe what should happen however once implemented social processes take over as human agents act in their own interest deviating from the prescribed rules of operation similarly ecological processes respond with their own feedback loops it is thus necessary to design the governance around irrigation planning in way that these feedbacks and deviations are anticipated this requires that learning from the ex post evaluation studies to feed back in the dam design process this requires creation of explicit processes for this to occur 6 4 structured processes like shared vision planning can be used to negotiate competing normative claims while differences in factual claims can be settled by doing more science differences in trade offs between upstream and downstream villages humans and the environment can only be settled through negotiation formal integration of the social and technical aspects has been mainstreamed in places across the world through processes like shared vision planning which is a collaborative approach to formulating water management solutions that combines 1 traditional water resources planning 2 structured public participation and 3 collaborative computer modeling 109 110 if dams are to be solution to boost water security they must be designed and implemented accounting for current and anticipated changes to the river basin and their costs and benefits must be considered along side a range of other integrated water management solutions 7 annexure 1 search terms sr no category search words 1 social impacts social impacts dams indiasocial impacts case study indiarehabilitation and

20107,the right to water and sanitation is recognized as fundamental to attaining all other rights despite the progress in access to water and sanitation in low and middle income countries lmic women and girls are vulnerable to various forms of violence when meeting their water sanitation and hygiene wash needs the findings on wash related gender based violence gbv in lmics are fragmented and thus may not be able to inform policies and interventions aimed at addressing vulnerabilities to wash related violence this scoping review characterizes forms of wash related violence against women in lmics a review of 29 peer reviewed papers emerging from a search in scopus medline embase and web of science reveals four dimensions of wash gbv structural physical psychological and sexual we observed that gender norms reproduce power relations that intersect with drivers of inequities social exclusion and marginalization to shape patterns of violence based on these findings we propose a conceptual framework showcasing how contextual factors produce and reinforce wash related gender based violence we reflect on the implications of these findings for policy and suggest the need for wash practitioners and researchers to evaluate and measure wash access beyond the joint monitoring program jmp service ladder further research on wash gbv is essential to facilitate global efforts on achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs for gender equality sdg 5 and ensuring access to water and sanitation for all sdg 6 keywords gender based violence water sanitation and hygiene wash health and wellbeing lmics 1 introduction the right to water and sanitation is integral to the human rights based approach to development and a prerequisite to attaining all other human rights 78 however globally about 2 2 billion people still lack safely managed drinking water 4 2 billion people are without safely managed sanitation while 3 billon lack basic handwashing facilities at home 77 despite the progress made in water and sanitation access between 2000 and 2017 only about 27 of the population in sub saharan africa ssa had access to safely managed water and 18 had access to safely managed sanitation services as in 2017 77 the impacts of water insecurity and inadequate sanitation have mainly been approached within the biomedical model focusing mainly on infectious diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water and food see 13 85 3 80 66 consequently water sanitation and hygiene wash interventions are designed to break the fecal oral route transmission of diseases with less consideration for wash related violence and psychosocial health outcomes 31 yet who defines health not as the absence of disease but as the complete physical social emotional and mental wellbeing 87 the ottawa charter for health promotion 89 also viewed health as a resource for everyday living and identified the underlying conditions and prerequisites for health as education peace shelter food income equity sustainable resources social justice and a stable ecosystem these definitions draw attention to the multiple determinants of health and the increasing role of the social cultural economic political and environmental conditions within which human health is shaped 36 interestingly a stream of research has documented the impacts of wash on health beyond infectious diseases particularly for women and girls in low and middle income countries lmics 64 10 38 19 18 globally about 1 in 3 women have experienced some form of violence 88 and there is a greater risk for women to experience violence when access to wash infrastructure and services is inadequate 59 38 29 30 84 21 studies have also linked inadequate wash access to women and girls disempowerment and negative wellbeing 37 wellbeing in this paper refers to all things that are good for a person and society that make for a good life 22 the time spent searching for water constrains women s engagement in income earning opportunities and other skills development programs 90 10 14 18 with regard to the impact of menstrual hygiene and women empowerment krenz and strulik 37 found that access to appropriate menstrual hygiene management reduced women s work absenteeism by 21 in burkina faso research shows how the absence of adequate wash inhibits females from safely managing their menstruation which subsequently affects their educational engagement and attainment 69 33 70 20 40 garn et al 25 in a cluster randomized trial on the impact of school wash on pupil enrollment and gender parity in enrollment found that the provision of wash in schools increased girls enrollment by 4 in kenya while the absence of wash infrastructure and services heightens risks of gender based violence gbv their presence does not completely eliminate violence 16 59 74 recent evidence suggests that household wash practices are predominantly shaped by existing social processes social norms social networks and social capital 54 53 81 28 48 68 24 even when wash infrastructure is available access and use are determined by gender social class and power relations 62 74 for example a recent study by pommells et al 59 showed that women and girls are vulnerable to sexual violence in east africa because water sources are controlled by men despite the continuing documentation of gender based violence in wash less attention is paid to how we can conceptualize violence to inform wash policy and interventions several studies have provided mounting evidence that wash research should give greater consideration to the characterization of gender based violence 70 38 59 furthermore a recent commentary by sinharoy and caruso 67 on the 2019 world water calls for a broader consideration of embedded gender vulnerabilities in wash to leave no one behind this scoping review characterized gender based violence in wash and shifts attention from interpersonal violence to the varied ways in which structural processes produce and reinforce violence gender based violence in this sense is institutionalized and manifests in various forms of social suffering such as unequal access and discrimination in wash provision the paper also presents the coping strategies employed by individuals and communities to reduce vulnerabilities to wash gbv in this review the term wash security is not merely the availability of wash infrastructure and services but rather a sufficient and reliable access to socio political and cultural environments that guarantee safety dignity and adequate access to wash services in ways that support health and wellbeing 2 space place and wash gender based violence wash access use and control are embedded in a complex web of socio cultural and political networks that impose social relations at different scales as 79 noted water is a relational resource because of its materiality and complex social networks institutions and patterns of cooperation that revolve around it jepson et al 32 supported this perspective by arguing that water should not be treated as a material object to which individuals have rights they conceptualized water security as a relational and dynamic process linked to human capability and broader political and social structures studies have also linked individual sanitation access to contextual factors such as socio cultural relationships social identity power and gender identity 62 28 27 53 in this sense gender is viewed as a social outcome with unequal power relations between men and women supported and maintained by social and cultural structures therefore understanding gbv is closely tied to understanding how individuals and groups envision both space and place and how fundamentally their meaning of place and space are maintained 76 gbv is relational and a social and spatial phenomenon it has a spatio temporal form since the social relations out of which it emerges are themselves dynamic since social norms define and govern acceptable behaviours a number of researchers have discussed their role in gbv in feminist literature gbv is examined in relation to patriarchy and masculine subjectivity 42 76 23 this stream of research suggests that when gender norms support the dominant position of men and relegate women to subordinate positions they turn to perpetuate gbv 42 76 23 also the feminisation of household labour further confines women to relatively isolated positions where they are subject to the power of their husbands 23 59 relatedly several studies have established a direct relationship between controlling behaviours of men and physical and psychological violence against women 65 23 59 thus gender norms weaken power relations between men and women putting women in vulnerable positions violence in this sense becomes a means of role enforcement and crisis of masculinity 34 in relation to the societal connection between masculinity and power 23 related to the role of gender is broader social identity defined here as ways in which particular groups interact and interrelate which governs social behaviour and thus shapes individual behaviour and relations 27 53 12 social segregation promotes vulnerability and gender inequality and allows for the re emergence of values that might conflict existing cherished societal norms 76 42 65 in this regard increased social segregation may rationalize and legitimize violence and weaken social capital within and between communities and social groups specific examples are cited from india where caste intersects with gender to shape wash access and use 35 social capital social structures and relations norms of reciprocity interpersonal trust and mutual aid that facilitates collective action promotes the diffusion of wash behavioural interventions and also facilitates collective actions in terms of management and maintenance of wash infrastructure and services in kenya women overcame wash vulnerabilities through collective resource sharing 11 similarly in exploring the relationship between social segregation and intimate partner violence in peru benavides et al 9 noted that women who received support from related social networks were less likely to experience violence thus even when women are exposed to violence the social space and networks within which they live and work determine their capability to cope with their lived situation institutional processes and policy frameworks at the international scale tend to transform wash spaces globally particularly in lmics international policies and organizations exert powerful forces and also act as the foci of socio political relations stretched over space and extend down to the national and local scales of wash governance the promotion of neoliberal policies such as full cost recovery for services prioritizing efficiency in wash policy decisions and the privatization of water services has created several invisible spaces of violence in most lmics 41 44 43 45 according to bakker 6 water governance is a form of biopolitics based on the categorization quantification and knowledge power formation of urban residents in an attempt to govern their behaviour this means the materiality of water connects individual bodies to the collective body politics 7 that creates a situation in which their fundamental right to water is dependent on their ability to negotiate access in south africa marcatelli and buscher 41 using the term liquid violence illustrate how neoliberal water policies coupled with unequal power relations dispossessed marginalized populations of water causing systemic harm to their bodies mehta et al 44 noted that public water supply in delhi india targeted elite and middle class settlements leaving marginalized populations in informal settlements to depend on contaminated water which consequently exposed them to health complications here violence is an outcome of institutional processes and arrangements thus to fully comprehend gbv in wash this paper employed a scoping review methodology to characterize the dimensions of wash gbv in lmics we see this as a critical step to support the larger global drive on reducing gendered vulnerabilities in wash and efforts to improve the wellbeing of marginalized populations 3 methods this review was guided by arksey and o malley s 5 methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews and peters et al 57 guide for systematic scoping reviews a scoping review was chosen for a number of reasons first scoping reviews provide a critical lens for mapping existing literature in a given area of research and identifying knowledge gaps and directions for future research 49 second scoping reviews are an ideal tool for examining how research is conducted on a topic in a given field 49 57 as they facilitate the synthesis of research from different methodologies 5 third scoping reviews are particularly useful when literature on a given research area has not yet been comprehensively reviewed 58 finally scoping reviews allow for the clarification of concepts in the literature to capture and disseminate a wider scope of research evidence 57 3 1 search strategy the review was conducted through systematic searches of four main electronic databases two multidisciplinary databases scopus and web of science and two biomedical databases embase and medline see table 1 these data bases were selected to cover a broad range of research works the electronic search was limited to published peer reviewed articles from 2000 to 2020 this time frame witnessed the implementation of the millennium development goals mdgs and the adoption of the sustainable development goals sdgs which established an ambitious research and policy agenda for wash in 2010 the united nations general assembly recognised access to water and sanitation as a human right and called on development organisations and states to pay particular attention to groups suffering likely to be suffering or at risk of discrimination in meeting their wash needs 43 78 four main concepts were used to develop the search strategy water sanitation hygiene and violence detailed search items are provided in table 1 the search strategy was developed by the first author in collaboration with a librarian subject areas for searches in scopus were limited to social science and medicine while searches in web of science were restricted to social science multidisciplinary geography and environmental studies the language of publication was restricted to english reference lists of included studies were manually searched for additional relevant papers all searches and screening were conducted between june 20 and july 30 2020 3 2 eligibility criteria and screening from the search peer reviewed articles that reported issues of gender violence in relation to wash access in lmics based on the world bank 86 classification of countries by their gross national income gni were selected some dimensions of gbv particularly those related to sexual abuse are often under reported because of the sensitivity and the associated stigma 38 70 keeping this in mind we included all studies presenting primary research without any restrictions based on methodologies this decision was made in order to identify a wide range of evidence related to wash gbv for qualitative studies we aimed to document the everyday embodied lived experiences of violence as a result of wash insecurity in quantitative studies our interest was on the reported pattern and established relationship between wash insecurity and gbv eligible studies explicitly reported a connection between water and or sanitation access and the embedded gender dimensions of violence articles that documented women and girls vulnerability to and experiences of violence during menstruation were also included studies that broadly explored the impacts of wash insecurity on population health were excluded no restrictions were placed on the age group of respondents in the studies screened in instances where the gender dimension of violence was unclear after title review abstract and full text reviews the second author sje was consulted the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses extension for scoping reviews prisma scr was employed to ensure methodological rigor and transparency 46 73 the first author amn screened all titles and abstracts after the removal of duplicates to determine the eligibility of studies for review full text assessment was conducted for 256 studies and 29 of these were included in the study fig 1 amn screened the full text articles and uncertainties were resolved by consulting the second author 3 3 data extraction and analysis mendeley software was used to manage the set of articles resulting from the review and excel was used to organize the data stemming from the application of a data charting exercise 5 the analysis of the literature occurred in two stages first a summary of the study characteristics including the study location study purpose and objective s study context study population study design methodology theory used and key findings was prepared this information was then synthesized into a descriptive summary second we employed the thematic approach 26 to undertake a narrative synthesis of the findings which included characterising the dimensions of wash gbv as well as identifying the various coping strategies employed by individuals and communities to reduce vulnerabilities to wash gbv 4 results the search results yielded 10 712 articles 8998 were maintained after removing duplicates after an initial screening of abstracts and titles 256 full text articles were examined and from which 29 were eligible for inclusion 13 qualitative studies five quantitative and 11 mixed methods see fig 1 a summary of the charted data of each study is presented in appendix i 4 1 the setting population and timing of included studies all the 29 studies selected were conducted in lmics fourteen 48 3 of the articles included in the review were conducted in africa twelve 41 4 in asia and one 3 4 in south america two 6 9 of the studies were conducted across continents one in asia south america and africa and the other in south america and africa studies conducted in africa were set across three sub regions including west africa n 1 east africa n 11 and southern africa n 2 all studies included from asia were set in south asia n 12 the majority of these studies n 11 were conducted in india only one study was set in central south america west africa and central south america were found to have the smallest proportion 6 9 of the literature reporting wash gbv although we recognize that limiting the search to english may have missed sources conducted in other languages a greater proportion of the studies 78 6 conducted in africa were set in east africa a majority of the studies n 13 45 included were conducted in rural settings seven 24 were conducted in urban areas with only two 7 examining the everyday water struggles among populations in informal settlements nine studies 31 were conducted in both urban and rural settings and two 7 of these examined national level datasets one in kenya and the other in india we found that 20 n 6 of the studies took place in school settings highlighting the wash experiences and practices among students a greater percentage of the studies n 19 65 focused solely on the wash experiences of women n 12 41 and girls n 7 24 specifically five studies 17 explored the ways menstrual hygiene practices exposed women and girls to various forms of violence 10 31 examined women and girls sanitation experiences and the associated violence three 10 highlighted the violence encountered by women and girls when accessing water none of the studies focused exclusively on the wash experiences of men and boys the remaining 34 n 10 of the studies examined a range of water and sanitation related violence across gender the publication trend on violence in wash over the past 20 years 2000 2020 is presented in fig 2 we observed a gradual increase in the number of studies over time with a spike in the number of publications in 2015 2016 and 2017 which marked the end and the start of the mdgs and sdgs respectively the largest drop in publication was recorded in 2019 although this stabilized in 2020 with 5 articles published so far 4 2 characterizing wash gender based violence from the results we identified four inter related dimensions of gbv comprising structural psychological sexual and physical violence table 2 psychological violence was the dimension of violence most reported in the studies n 21 72 and the majority of these studies n 14 48 related to sanitation and hygiene sexual violence was the least reported form of violence documented by only 28 of the studies 4 2 1 structural violence socio cultural economic political and institutional structures and processes sometimes influence people s access to water and sanitation services 12 21 4 these processes interrelate to create an exclusive and discriminatory pattern of water access who gets water at what time and price 21 10 90 in pakistan a study by anwar et al 4 revealed that politics and power shape water rationing and allocation in informal settlements and access is usually mediated through institutions similarly tutu and stoler 75 noted that government sponsored piped water services in ghana are generally directed to rich and middle class neighbourhoods while households in poor settlements are left to secure water by informal means these procedural injustices reinforce and expose women to a series of violence for instance bisung and elliott 10 noted that water insecurity in usoma kenya created perceptions of marginalization and neglect by the government also wutich 90 reported that structural inequities regarding water provision and access caused anger frustration and sentiments of marginalization in bolivia the absence of reliable water adds to the financial burden of women the opportunity cost of fetching water such as less time to engage in income generating activities 90 10 14 18 and paying higher prices for water 10 75 18 depleted women savings although gender mainstreaming has gained attention in water resource management financial support for gender equity initiatives in lmics is largely dependent on non governmental organizations ngos 51 however these ngos sometimes coerced women to participate in water development projects 14 the inadequacy of sanitation infrastructure also reinforces power relations within the household and community and compounds women and girls vulnerability to multiple forms of violence and health risks for example datta and ahmed 21 noted that the disconnections and absence of sanitation infrastructure in kerala india created violent spaces where women were physically and sexually abused women bear the burden of excavating pits for waste disposal alongside the continued physical and verbal assaults from spouses who enforce these duties studies have also documented the ways structural inequities interlinked with social segregations to deprive marginalized households and women of latrines 56 35 with regard to hygiene the design and structural deficiencies of public sanitation facilities do not provide privacy for safe menstrual hygiene practices 17 33 70 morgan et al 47 noted in a multi national cross sectional wash study in 2270 rural schools randomly selected from ethiopia kenya mozambique rwanda uganda and zambia that there were fewer than 20 of the schools with four of the five recommended menstrual hygiene services separate sex latrines with doors and locks water for use waste bin other instances of inadequate sanitation infrastructure for menstrual hygiene including damaged or missing toilet doors doors without locks insufficient segregation of male and female toilets and lack of changing rooms for menstrual hygiene were also reported 70 33 40 20 menstrual hygiene education was also reported to be limited at schools 40 70 and negative encounters from some male teachers created discomforts 40 female students expressed concerns about safety and lack of privacy for menstrual hygiene management 1 70 40 33 20 this gap in service reduced school attendance academic performance and sometimes caused dropouts among female students 1 33 40 4 2 2 psychological violence psychological violence includes any act that causes emotional harm anxiety and depression frustration feelings of negative identity and marginalization research has increasingly documented the psychosocial health risk of women and girls in relation to inadequate wash access regarding water reported stressors included long walking distance to water sources queuing to fetch water unsafe water sources and insufficient supplies for daily need 19 18 10 these stressors often resulted in psychological outcomes such as depression anxiety and frustration and feeling of negative identity cooper vince et al 19 observed that in rural uganda women in water insecurity hotspots are at 70 greater risk of depression than men water insecurity resulted in feelings of embarrassment frustration and negative identity and marginalization among women in usoma kenya 10 also psychosocial outcomes such as shame for not being able to keep oneself or one s children clean due to lack of water have been reported 10 18 women s inability to offer visitors clean water as a sign of hospitality accusations of water theft by neighbours fighting each other in water queues and fear of spousal violence contributed to social shaming worry anger frustration and negative self identity 18 59 19 10 71 in contrast mushavi et al 50 found that depressive symptoms associated with water insecurity were higher among men compared to women in rural uganda research has also established the association between poor sanitation and psychological wellbeing for instance hirve et al 29 found that 64 of women who practiced open defecation reported some level of stress due to perceived lack of personal safety as compared to 6 of latrine users also 44 of open defecators reported some levels of stress due to lack of privacy compared to 3 of latrine users 29 other studies have reported on the anxiety and stress women and girls experience when going for open defecation due to fear of being abused and the associated embarrassment and shame 10 62 38 52 35 women and girls also reported fear and experience of verbal assaults and ridicule when defecating in public latrines 21 15 62 relatedly a cross sectional study in 60 rural communities in odisha india found that women experience high levels of anxiety depression and distress when urinating or defecating even when they are using latrines 16 women have also reported withholding food and water intake in order to limit defecation and urination holding in shit and urine when they are pressed in public 35 38 furthermore the literature showcases how wash insecurity inhibits women and girls from practicing safe menstrual hygiene which influences their social engagement and psychological wellbeing 52 35 17 1 70 40 20 33 in a cross sectional study in odisha india caruso et al 17 found women with no functional household latrine had higher menstrual insecurity scores than women who own latrines the lack of sanitary towels and safe spaces for changing menstrual towels appropriate means of disposing sanitary pads and unavailability of soap and water for menstrual hygiene practices caused shame embarrassment and anxiety among women and girls 1 70 40 33 62 in the school environment female students reported living in fear of humiliation and ridicule by male classmates when menstrual fluid accidentally stains their uniforms or when seen changing menstrual pads in school urinals or latrines 40 20 33 social restrictions for menstruating girls resulted in emotional distress and discomfort 33 70 4 2 3 sexual violence wash insecurity also puts women and girls in overtly vulnerable positions including exposing them to sexual violence pommells et al 59 documented cases of women and girls being raped when fetching water offering sex for water when they could not pay water fees or for favors when in water queues a range of studies has also associated sexual violence with sanitation for example jadhav et al 30 analyzed the 2005 2006 indian national family health survey iii and found that indian women who practice open defecation are twice likely to experience non partner sexual violence within the past year compared to women who had household toilets simirlarly winter and barchi 84 analysis of the 2008 2009 kenyan demographic health survey dhs data revealed that women who primarily practiced open defecation had 40 more likely of experiencing non partner sexual and or physical violence in the past year compared to women who did not primarily practice open defecation these findings align with other studies which reported the sexual violence women and girls encounter when accessing their sanitation needs 62 35 38 52 for example women and girls reported being watched peeping through broken doors and walls and being harassed by men boys loitering around latrines and open defecation sites 62 35 52 38 further khanna and das 35 documented women s stories and accounts on rape and sexual harassment during open defecation in rural india including the incident where a 14 year old girl was raped and killed by a group of men 35 other forms of reported sexual assaults reported included men staring and masturbating in front of women and taking photographs of women at defecation sites 38 overall adolescent girls were at greater risk of experiencing sexual harassment 35 moreover girls inability to purchase sanitary pads also exposed them to sexual violence for example drawing on the lived experiences of schoolgirls in kenya jewittt and ryley 33 noted that girls from poor households engaged in transactional sex with fishermen and taxi drivers in order to obtain money for sanitary pads and other basic items such as soap or food 4 2 4 physical violence women and girls also experience physical violence in negotiating their daily wash access 38 62 59 35 52 18 women are not only vulnerable to attacks by non partners on their way to water sources they are also at risk of spousal abuse when water insecurity affects their normative roles 59 18 women are also susceptible to spousal abuse if participation in water management projects provides access to opportunities or enhances their social standing 14 water insecurity also creates spaces for interpersonal violence among women and girls especially during periods of water shortages when queuing causes anxiety frustration and anger 59 mothers in turn exert their anger and frustrations on their girls when they spend too much time fetching water and when water is insufficient 59 50 studies have also documented accounts of women and girls being subjected to physical violence when practicing open defecation 38 35 52 62 for example 52 p 79 reported an incident in bengaluru india where a pregnant woman was snatched and dragged off by a group of men during defecation women are also shouted at stoned and chased away with sticks at open defecation sites 35 29 4 3 individual and collective wash gender violence coping strategies despite the vulnerability of females to gender based violence around access to wash service our analysis revealed individuals women in particular and communities pragmatic strategies employed to reduce vulnerabilities to violence at the individual and household levels women and girls employed several behavioural strategies to safeguard their safety and privacy when meeting their sanitation needs some strategies identified include women and girls defecating early in the morning or late in the night to protect their privacy 52 62 29 35 38 walking long distances to find hidden spaces for defecation 35 38 going out in groups in pairs and under the guard of husbands or male household members to defecate 62 52 38 and carrying stones with them so they can defend themselves against attacks 38 women also reported withholding food and water intake and taking anti diarrheal medicines when necessary in order to avoid defecating 38 35 kulkarni et al 38 found that some women construct household latrines to enhance their safety during defecation whilst others fought with their husbands and in laws for household latrines however the lack of land tenure security and low income constrained households decisions to construct latrines 38 35 women also employ strategies to cope with water insecurity these include conserving water for multiple uses water reuse prioritization of water uses e g drinking and bathing over other uses and treating surface water for domestic uses 18 10 71 90 during periods of water scarcity some women reallocate water use to ensure their husbands had enough water to bath and drink in order to avoid their wrath 18 whilst others serve themselves food last when they are unable to cook enough food for the household because of the time spent searching for water 59 at the community level collective initiatives taken to address water challenges include sharing water with neighbours resource mobilization towards the maintenance of water facilities and the establishment of social networks for water loaning and borrowing 90 10 with respect to sanitation latrine sharing among households is a dominant coping mechanism in resource poor settings 52 10 5 discussion this review synthesizes evidence on the various forms of violence associated with the lack and inadequacy of wash services in lmics four main dimensions of violence were identified including structural social suffering and inequities resulting from institutional processes psychological emotional and mental distress sexual rape coerced transactional sex and physical our conceptualization of wash gbv extends beyond interpersonal rape and physical assaults violence to show how violence related to wash could be psychological gbv could also be structural resulting from institutional processes socio economic inequalities and discrimination in water and sanitation provision 74 75 structural violence is systemic and tends to be hegemonized since it sustains the very zero level standard against which we perceive something as subjectively violent 91 p2 as datta ahmed 21 illuminated lack of access to wash infrastructure is a form of violence that is mutually constitutive with gendered violence in marginalized settings as outlined in the results all the selected studies from asia were set in south asia and about 78 of those in africa were conducted in east africa this synthesized evidence presents a trend of spatial disparity in wash gbv research and the possibility of leaving some populations behind in the global drive to clean water and sanitation for all and gender equality a special focus is therefore needed on the areas where research on wash gbv is limited these efforts could be a catalyst for not only promoting population health but also gender equality most of the studies reviewed were conducted in settings where socio cultural norms and expectations placed the responsibility of water collection storage and domestic hygiene maintenance on women and girls in addition to these socially assigned roles unequal social relations including gender inequality intersecting with social class and caste create spaces of discrimination and inequality leading to negative experiences of sanitation among women and girls wash gbv in this regard is an outcome of unequal social relations with gender intersecting with other dimensions of inequality this highlights the need for a broader understanding of wash beyond the joint monitoring programme jmp service ladder which focuses on the availability design and quality of infrastructure with little attention to the environmental and social factors that shape wash experiences 5 1 framing wash gender based violence drawing insights from the synthesis we proposed a conceptual model which highlights how socio cultural structural and environmental interactions produce and shape violence in wash across time and space fig 3 this model is partly informed by sclar et al 64 preliminary model on the influence of sanitation on mental wellbeing the review showed that contextual factors such as social norms intersectionality inequality gender roles environmental proximity location season in the year and neigbourhood and structural policies power relations infrastructure design expose individuals especially women and girls to various vulnerabilities of violence which are embodied through lack of access to adequate water sanitation and hygiene wash gender based violence is situated and shaped by social relations across multiple scales i e household community national and international we found that women and girls are exposed to various forms of violence such as structural psychological physical and sexual violence which negatively affect their wellbeing these dimensions of violence are not mutually exclusive for instance structural violence produces and reinforces multiple forms of wash gbv the absence of infrastructure such as water and toilet facilities exposes women and girls to physical psychological and sexual violence 21 38 psychological violence on one hand is an outcome of the other three dimensions of violence see 10 62 however individuals and communities employed certain coping mechanisms agency to buffer their exposure to violence social support such as water sharing lending money to buy water and sharing of toilets drive the buffering effect against violence therefore the wellbeing of women and girls largely depended on their ability to cope and overcome their everydayness of violence however the success of the agency social support services is dependent on the availability of social support from members of the household and community personal constraints or individual factors are also reported to influence the pattern of violence such that individuals with fewer social and economic resources are at greater risk of experiencing violence for example girls who cannot afford sanitary towels are coerced into transactional sex 33 55 5 2 theoretical challenges and considerations in wash gbv studies the studies reviewed are premised on the fact that wash services are unevenly distributed and some people are denied access to wash because of who they are and where they live 21 38 35 56 14 10 however only five 17 of these studies were grounded in explicit theoretical perspectives including political ecology 14 feminist political ecology 33 4 environmental stress and ecosocial theories 10 and the theory of informality 75 the majority of the studies 83 were developed without explicit theoretical guidance although various conceptual frameworks were sometimes cited as guiding the research the theories used informed researchers understanding of the inequalities and gendered violence associated with wash access and guided their observation and framing of violence though these theories originated from different disciplinary backgrounds they share some common perspectives first the theories affirm that social economic political and environmental conditions shape the lives of individuals and their agency second they recognize that the benefits and consequences of these complex socio political economic and environmental interactions are not evenly distributed across space and among populations thirdly the theories acknowledge that wash gbv is a byproduct of these complex interactions and should be analyzed as embedded in and intersecting with various socio economic and socio cultural regimes of power and political context however each of these theories has some limitations in offering a robust theoretical lens for understanding gbv in the context of wash for example although environmental stress theory is useful in understanding how individuals and communities perceive experience and cope with the risk associated with wash insecurity it gives less attention to the drivers of these risks and their distribution among geographic areas and populations the embodiment literature helps our understanding of how environmental stressors related to wash are shaped by socio economic inequalities and become embodied to generate gendered patterns of health and wellbeing further feminist political ecology fpe uses gender as a central social category that informs societal nature relations resource access i e water and sanitation as well as politics related to the environment 61 60 in so doing it reveals how power structures shaping wash provision and access disempower bodies i e exposure to violence embedded in social and cultural contexts however fpe does not extend the analysis to explore the health implications of social inequalities and violence resulting from uneven wash resource access and use the dualism between theories has made certain inequalities hidden particularly in relation to water insecurity and gbv since each theory alone is incapable of capturing all the complexities moving forward a theoretical integration particularly incorporating insights from epidemiological theories into social science theories will aid health geographers to conceptualize violence in the context of wash and the multiple ways it is embodied 53 explicit engagement with theory will also prove useful for understanding the spatial temporality of violence as well as how community s development trajectory social processes and local meanings shape gendered violence in wash 5 3 methodological challenges and consideration in wash gbv in terms of methodology we found that the majority of the studies n 13 45 included in the review were conducted using qualitative methods and only five studies 17 were quantitative qualitative research tends to be more common especially in gbv studies 82 however quantitative investigation of the phenomenon is important in order to gain a broader contextual understanding of violence another theme that emerged from the review was that studies on sexual violence were limited this limitation has been attributed to the sensitivity of the issue and under reporting by women and girls due to the associated stigma 38 70 this requires researchers to consider adopting research designs that allow for the expansion and reframing of research questions to uncover the invisible voices of victims further many of the studies reviewed n 21 72 reported psychological violence which is the dominant dimension of violence reported some of these studies have developed tools to measure psychological distress related to sanitation insecurity for example caruso et al 15 developed a novel sanitation insecurity measure to capture the negative sanitation experiences of women in odisha india the proposed measure reflected women s sanitation concerns in three broad domains including the physical environment the social environment and personal constraints caruso et al 17 again developed and validated a measure of menstrual insecurity to assess women s menstruation insecurity in odisha though these measures have some limitations i e contextual grounding they provide an innovative research direction thus we recommend their application in different socio ecological contexts for further validation and application in wash research in addition the studies in the review showcased a comprehensive range of methodological designs for wash research cooper vince et al 15 17 stevenson et al 71 for example cooper vince et al 19 employed geographic information system analysis to identify the spatial clustering of water insecurity and depression symptom severity in rural uganda in terms of sampling majority of the studies n 16 55 were conducted with only women and girls there were no studies in the review that looked exclusively at the vulnerability of men and boys to violence while this highlights that women and girls are more likely to experience violence when meeting their wash needs an explicit understanding of men and boys vulnerability to violence would inform policy for instance women most often internalized their distress frustrations and anger regarding the lack of adequate water and sanitation while men externalized their emotional distress in the form of spousal abuse and assaults 18 5 4 gaps and directions for future research although the articles reviewed provided some important insights on violence in the context of wash some questions and gaps were identified for wash research and practice first our conceptualization of violence in wash showcases the need for a broader framing of violence in order to illuminate certain hidden inequalities integrating a structural dimension of violence will enable us to understand how institutional processes produce and reinforce violence and how we can leverage these structures for solutions second the review showed how socio cultural norms and practices created spaces of violence in the study settings however the extent to which these cultural practices and norms provided safe spaces for wash or facilitated the reduction in vulnerability to violence remained a major research gap third many of the studies identified gender inequalities and men as perpetrators of violence however none of the studies explicitly discussed the vulnerable experiences of men and boys though women and girls disproportionately bear a significant burden of wash insecurity more research is needed on the experiences of men and boys fourth several questions remained unanswered regarding the health implications of wash gbv in lmics for example how has wash gbv shaped health and wellbeing differently among men and women how do the health system and socio political institutions respond to wash gbv and what are the challenges fifth we found that none of the studies highlighted the sanitation needs of people with disability and their experiences of violence sixth the narratives that emerged from the review did not significantly address the temporalities of violence how has the landscape of wash violence changed over time with regards to sanitation oftentimes studies focused on latrine access and use without considering the possibilities of gender violence in the process of latrine construction individuals experiences of violence intensify when communities adopt shaming and social stigma as tools for promoting latrine construction 8 finally ecological change i e climate change has exacerbated the vulnerabilities to wash gbv in some lmics 72 39 63 although our model acknowledges the impacts of environmental factors on wash gbv future research should rigorously examine vulnerabilities to wash gbv linked to seasonality and climate change further research is needed to address the identified research gaps and build on the proposed conceptual framework fig 3 for research and policy interventions 6 conclusion this review demonstrates that gender based violence in wash is beyond physical sexual and psychological harm we emphasized the need for research attention on the way in which institutions and social interactions processes produce violence with violence understood as a relational outcome incorporating a structural dimension of violence may shine a spotlight on institutional weaknesses in wash provisions at the community level and the importance of collective actions at multi levels to effect change wash gbv will be exacerbated in lmics because of the covid 19 pandemic 2 understanding wash gbv as a social outcome will provide a robust platform for research and facilitate global efforts on achieving sdgs 5 achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls and 6 ensure water and sanitation for all further the findings of the review demonstrate the need for a broader evaluation of wash beyond the physical presence and quality of infrastructure and service recognizing the heterogeneity of social norms and relations that gives power to violence will significantly deconstruct the structures that reinforce gender vulnerabilities to violence beyond the home e g at the school setting our proposal for a theoretical integration would provide a platform for reflexive methodologies in research focusing on wash related violence in lmics while this scoping review significantly contributes to knowledge it has limitations firstly the search strategy was limited to peer reviewed articles published in english this may have excluded other important articles second the quality of the selected studies was not assessed however since the search was limited to peer reviewed articles there is less likelihood of using studies of low quality third as stated above explicit studies on the vulnerability and experiences of men and boys were missing consequently the findings largely represent the experiences of women and girls in the study settings we therefore recommended research attention on the experiences of men and boys fourth cases of wash related gender based violence particularly sexual violence were under reported as a result it is possible that other experiences of sexual violence were not captured finally the review is limited in terms of the generalization of the findings due to our focus on lmics however the findings are still relevant for global policy and research since lmics are the most challenged in terms of wash insecurity 83

adolescent girls miss schools lessons due to lack of access to sanitary towels and the required infrastructure to practice safe menstrual hygiene at school fears of being teased by male students and embarrassment associated with menstrual fluid leakages were also identified as reasons for missing school further it was reported that some adolescent girls usually from poor households are compelled

violence module in kenyan demographic and health survey 2008 2009 nationwide quantitative household surveys the binary logistic regression revealed that women who practice open defecation are more like to experience non partner sexual and physical violence compared to women who do not practice open defecation 10 kenya explores psychosocial concerns related to lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation women and men between the age of 18 36 years in usoma rural qualitative focus groups and key informant interviews environmental stress and ecosocial theories respondents expressed

pune urban qualitative focus groups and interviews women reported to have encountered several forms of violence at their sanitation spaces including rape harassment from men and verbal assaults reported psychological violence included risk of dog and snake bites fear of accidents shame of being seen defecating trauma of sexual assault and discomfort from using dirty slippery and poor lit public toilets however lower caste women were more likely to experience violence than women of upper caste women defecate early in the morning or late at night to protect their privacy others travel in pairs to defecation sites or carry stones to defend themselves 47 ethiopia kenya mozambique rwanda uganda and zambia examines wash access continuity quality quantity and reliability in rural schools in sub saharan africa 2270 heads of schools in rural communities of ethiopia kenya mozambique rwanda uganda and zambia quantitative cross sectional surveys the analysis revealed that about 1 of rural schools in ethopia and mozambique to 23 in rwanda had improved wash services on school premises fewer than 23 of the schools met who standard of latrine to student ratios for boys and girls less than 20 of the schools had 4 out of the 5 recommended menstrual hygiene services including separate sex latrines with doors and locks water for use waste bin 56 india the paper examines how

resentment against government officials regarding their sanitation needs 16 india the paper determines the association between women sanitation experiences and mental health women in 60 rural communities in odisha cross sectional survey overall access to a functional latrine was associated with high mental wellbeing scores however women reported higher symptoms of depression distress and anxiety when urinating or defecating 18 kenya explores the lived experiences of household water insecurity among pregnant and postpartum women pregnant and postpartum women in nyanza rural qualitative observation interviews photovoice some women n 18 experienced intimate partner violence during periods of water insecurity water insecurity also exposed women to interpersonal conflicts at the community level psychosocial consequences of water insecurity including shame anxiety and fear were reported further water insecurity increased households expenditure on water depleting their savings and the time spent searching for water constrained women chances to engage in economic income earning activities women prioritised the water needs of their husbands over all other household members 19 uganda the paper seeks to evaluate the geospatial clustering of water insecurity and risk of depression among men and women a whole population study of 1814 participants in mbarara district rural quantitative survey the analysis revealed that residing in a water insecurity hotspot is associated with 70 greater risk for probable depression among women but not among men 59 uganda this research seeks to understand the risks of gender violence associated with poor water sanitation and hygiene wash access 36 respondents women and men from rwanda tanzania uganda kenya qualitative focus groups and key informant interviews respondents mentioned rape and sexual assaults as common forms of violence women and girls are exposed to when accessing their wash needs domestic violence and female female violence were also noted to be common during periods of water insecurity due to desperation for water and poverty some women and girls are coerced to offer sex or sexual favours in order to facilitate their water access commodity sex 4 pakistan explores the everyday politics that contribute to the crisis of water provision at the neighbourhood level general population of karachi urban

also a major issues reported by female learners 21 india the paper examines how infrastructure disconnectedness or the lack of it causes violence against women women policy makers and town planners in kerala urban qualitative focus groups interviews transect walks participatory mapping and mental mapping women reported fear and threats to their personal security when using public toilets and urinals for instance deficiencies of sanitation infrastructure broken doors faulty door look and openings in the walls exposed women to sexual violence physical and verbal assaults were also reported to be persistent forms of violence women experience when accessing their wash needs 50 uganda this paper estimates the association between water insecurity and depression severity residents of nyakabare parish rual mixed methods in depth interview and survey multivariable linear regression analysis showed a positive and significant association between water insecurity and depression symptom severity the scores were slightly higher for men compared with women reported violence resulting from water insecurity included physical and verbal assaults among women at water points intimate

within the household or the community were also reported 
20107,the right to water and sanitation is recognized as fundamental to attaining all other rights despite the progress in access to water and sanitation in low and middle income countries lmic women and girls are vulnerable to various forms of violence when meeting their water sanitation and hygiene wash needs the findings on wash related gender based violence gbv in lmics are fragmented and thus may not be able to inform policies and interventions aimed at addressing vulnerabilities to wash related violence this scoping review characterizes forms of wash related violence against women in lmics a review of 29 peer reviewed papers emerging from a search in scopus medline embase and web of science reveals four dimensions of wash gbv structural physical psychological and sexual we observed that gender norms reproduce power relations that intersect with drivers of inequities social exclusion and marginalization to shape patterns of violence based on these findings we propose a conceptual framework showcasing how contextual factors produce and reinforce wash related gender based violence we reflect on the implications of these findings for policy and suggest the need for wash practitioners and researchers to evaluate and measure wash access beyond the joint monitoring program jmp service ladder further research on wash gbv is essential to facilitate global efforts on achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs for gender equality sdg 5 and ensuring access to water and sanitation for all sdg 6 keywords gender based violence water sanitation and hygiene wash health and wellbeing lmics 1 introduction the right to water and sanitation is integral to the human rights based approach to development and a prerequisite to attaining all other human rights 78 however globally about 2 2 billion people still lack safely managed drinking water 4 2 billion people are without safely managed sanitation while 3 billon lack basic handwashing facilities at home 77 despite the progress made in water and sanitation access between 2000 and 2017 only about 27 of the population in sub saharan africa ssa had access to safely managed water and 18 had access to safely managed sanitation services as in 2017 77 the impacts of water insecurity and inadequate sanitation have mainly been approached within the biomedical model focusing mainly on infectious diseases related to the consumption of contaminated water and food see 13 85 3 80 66 consequently water sanitation and hygiene wash interventions are designed to break the fecal oral route transmission of diseases with less consideration for wash related violence and psychosocial health outcomes 31 yet who defines health not as the absence of disease but as the complete physical social emotional and mental wellbeing 87 the ottawa charter for health promotion 89 also viewed health as a resource for everyday living and identified the underlying conditions and prerequisites for health as education peace shelter food income equity sustainable resources social justice and a stable ecosystem these definitions draw attention to the multiple determinants of health and the increasing role of the social cultural economic political and environmental conditions within which human health is shaped 36 interestingly a stream of research has documented the impacts of wash on health beyond infectious diseases particularly for women and girls in low and middle income countries lmics 64 10 38 19 18 globally about 1 in 3 women have experienced some form of violence 88 and there is a greater risk for women to experience violence when access to wash infrastructure and services is inadequate 59 38 29 30 84 21 studies have also linked inadequate wash access to women and girls disempowerment and negative wellbeing 37 wellbeing in this paper refers to all things that are good for a person and society that make for a good life 22 the time spent searching for water constrains women s engagement in income earning opportunities and other skills development programs 90 10 14 18 with regard to the impact of menstrual hygiene and women empowerment krenz and strulik 37 found that access to appropriate menstrual hygiene management reduced women s work absenteeism by 21 in burkina faso research shows how the absence of adequate wash inhibits females from safely managing their menstruation which subsequently affects their educational engagement and attainment 69 33 70 20 40 garn et al 25 in a cluster randomized trial on the impact of school wash on pupil enrollment and gender parity in enrollment found that the provision of wash in schools increased girls enrollment by 4 in kenya while the absence of wash infrastructure and services heightens risks of gender based violence gbv their presence does not completely eliminate violence 16 59 74 recent evidence suggests that household wash practices are predominantly shaped by existing social processes social norms social networks and social capital 54 53 81 28 48 68 24 even when wash infrastructure is available access and use are determined by gender social class and power relations 62 74 for example a recent study by pommells et al 59 showed that women and girls are vulnerable to sexual violence in east africa because water sources are controlled by men despite the continuing documentation of gender based violence in wash less attention is paid to how we can conceptualize violence to inform wash policy and interventions several studies have provided mounting evidence that wash research should give greater consideration to the characterization of gender based violence 70 38 59 furthermore a recent commentary by sinharoy and caruso 67 on the 2019 world water calls for a broader consideration of embedded gender vulnerabilities in wash to leave no one behind this scoping review characterized gender based violence in wash and shifts attention from interpersonal violence to the varied ways in which structural processes produce and reinforce violence gender based violence in this sense is institutionalized and manifests in various forms of social suffering such as unequal access and discrimination in wash provision the paper also presents the coping strategies employed by individuals and communities to reduce vulnerabilities to wash gbv in this review the term wash security is not merely the availability of wash infrastructure and services but rather a sufficient and reliable access to socio political and cultural environments that guarantee safety dignity and adequate access to wash services in ways that support health and wellbeing 2 space place and wash gender based violence wash access use and control are embedded in a complex web of socio cultural and political networks that impose social relations at different scales as 79 noted water is a relational resource because of its materiality and complex social networks institutions and patterns of cooperation that revolve around it jepson et al 32 supported this perspective by arguing that water should not be treated as a material object to which individuals have rights they conceptualized water security as a relational and dynamic process linked to human capability and broader political and social structures studies have also linked individual sanitation access to contextual factors such as socio cultural relationships social identity power and gender identity 62 28 27 53 in this sense gender is viewed as a social outcome with unequal power relations between men and women supported and maintained by social and cultural structures therefore understanding gbv is closely tied to understanding how individuals and groups envision both space and place and how fundamentally their meaning of place and space are maintained 76 gbv is relational and a social and spatial phenomenon it has a spatio temporal form since the social relations out of which it emerges are themselves dynamic since social norms define and govern acceptable behaviours a number of researchers have discussed their role in gbv in feminist literature gbv is examined in relation to patriarchy and masculine subjectivity 42 76 23 this stream of research suggests that when gender norms support the dominant position of men and relegate women to subordinate positions they turn to perpetuate gbv 42 76 23 also the feminisation of household labour further confines women to relatively isolated positions where they are subject to the power of their husbands 23 59 relatedly several studies have established a direct relationship between controlling behaviours of men and physical and psychological violence against women 65 23 59 thus gender norms weaken power relations between men and women putting women in vulnerable positions violence in this sense becomes a means of role enforcement and crisis of masculinity 34 in relation to the societal connection between masculinity and power 23 related to the role of gender is broader social identity defined here as ways in which particular groups interact and interrelate which governs social behaviour and thus shapes individual behaviour and relations 27 53 12 social segregation promotes vulnerability and gender inequality and allows for the re emergence of values that might conflict existing cherished societal norms 76 42 65 in this regard increased social segregation may rationalize and legitimize violence and weaken social capital within and between communities and social groups specific examples are cited from india where caste intersects with gender to shape wash access and use 35 social capital social structures and relations norms of reciprocity interpersonal trust and mutual aid that facilitates collective action promotes the diffusion of wash behavioural interventions and also facilitates collective actions in terms of management and maintenance of wash infrastructure and services in kenya women overcame wash vulnerabilities through collective resource sharing 11 similarly in exploring the relationship between social segregation and intimate partner violence in peru benavides et al 9 noted that women who received support from related social networks were less likely to experience violence thus even when women are exposed to violence the social space and networks within which they live and work determine their capability to cope with their lived situation institutional processes and policy frameworks at the international scale tend to transform wash spaces globally particularly in lmics international policies and organizations exert powerful forces and also act as the foci of socio political relations stretched over space and extend down to the national and local scales of wash governance the promotion of neoliberal policies such as full cost recovery for services prioritizing efficiency in wash policy decisions and the privatization of water services has created several invisible spaces of violence in most lmics 41 44 43 45 according to bakker 6 water governance is a form of biopolitics based on the categorization quantification and knowledge power formation of urban residents in an attempt to govern their behaviour this means the materiality of water connects individual bodies to the collective body politics 7 that creates a situation in which their fundamental right to water is dependent on their ability to negotiate access in south africa marcatelli and buscher 41 using the term liquid violence illustrate how neoliberal water policies coupled with unequal power relations dispossessed marginalized populations of water causing systemic harm to their bodies mehta et al 44 noted that public water supply in delhi india targeted elite and middle class settlements leaving marginalized populations in informal settlements to depend on contaminated water which consequently exposed them to health complications here violence is an outcome of institutional processes and arrangements thus to fully comprehend gbv in wash this paper employed a scoping review methodology to characterize the dimensions of wash gbv in lmics we see this as a critical step to support the larger global drive on reducing gendered vulnerabilities in wash and efforts to improve the wellbeing of marginalized populations 3 methods this review was guided by arksey and o malley s 5 methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews and peters et al 57 guide for systematic scoping reviews a scoping review was chosen for a number of reasons first scoping reviews provide a critical lens for mapping existing literature in a given area of research and identifying knowledge gaps and directions for future research 49 second scoping reviews are an ideal tool for examining how research is conducted on a topic in a given field 49 57 as they facilitate the synthesis of research from different methodologies 5 third scoping reviews are particularly useful when literature on a given research area has not yet been comprehensively reviewed 58 finally scoping reviews allow for the clarification of concepts in the literature to capture and disseminate a wider scope of research evidence 57 3 1 search strategy the review was conducted through systematic searches of four main electronic databases two multidisciplinary databases scopus and web of science and two biomedical databases embase and medline see table 1 these data bases were selected to cover a broad range of research works the electronic search was limited to published peer reviewed articles from 2000 to 2020 this time frame witnessed the implementation of the millennium development goals mdgs and the adoption of the sustainable development goals sdgs which established an ambitious research and policy agenda for wash in 2010 the united nations general assembly recognised access to water and sanitation as a human right and called on development organisations and states to pay particular attention to groups suffering likely to be suffering or at risk of discrimination in meeting their wash needs 43 78 four main concepts were used to develop the search strategy water sanitation hygiene and violence detailed search items are provided in table 1 the search strategy was developed by the first author in collaboration with a librarian subject areas for searches in scopus were limited to social science and medicine while searches in web of science were restricted to social science multidisciplinary geography and environmental studies the language of publication was restricted to english reference lists of included studies were manually searched for additional relevant papers all searches and screening were conducted between june 20 and july 30 2020 3 2 eligibility criteria and screening from the search peer reviewed articles that reported issues of gender violence in relation to wash access in lmics based on the world bank 86 classification of countries by their gross national income gni were selected some dimensions of gbv particularly those related to sexual abuse are often under reported because of the sensitivity and the associated stigma 38 70 keeping this in mind we included all studies presenting primary research without any restrictions based on methodologies this decision was made in order to identify a wide range of evidence related to wash gbv for qualitative studies we aimed to document the everyday embodied lived experiences of violence as a result of wash insecurity in quantitative studies our interest was on the reported pattern and established relationship between wash insecurity and gbv eligible studies explicitly reported a connection between water and or sanitation access and the embedded gender dimensions of violence articles that documented women and girls vulnerability to and experiences of violence during menstruation were also included studies that broadly explored the impacts of wash insecurity on population health were excluded no restrictions were placed on the age group of respondents in the studies screened in instances where the gender dimension of violence was unclear after title review abstract and full text reviews the second author sje was consulted the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses extension for scoping reviews prisma scr was employed to ensure methodological rigor and transparency 46 73 the first author amn screened all titles and abstracts after the removal of duplicates to determine the eligibility of studies for review full text assessment was conducted for 256 studies and 29 of these were included in the study fig 1 amn screened the full text articles and uncertainties were resolved by consulting the second author 3 3 data extraction and analysis mendeley software was used to manage the set of articles resulting from the review and excel was used to organize the data stemming from the application of a data charting exercise 5 the analysis of the literature occurred in two stages first a summary of the study characteristics including the study location study purpose and objective s study context study population study design methodology theory used and key findings was prepared this information was then synthesized into a descriptive summary second we employed the thematic approach 26 to undertake a narrative synthesis of the findings which included characterising the dimensions of wash gbv as well as identifying the various coping strategies employed by individuals and communities to reduce vulnerabilities to wash gbv 4 results the search results yielded 10 712 articles 8998 were maintained after removing duplicates after an initial screening of abstracts and titles 256 full text articles were examined and from which 29 were eligible for inclusion 13 qualitative studies five quantitative and 11 mixed methods see fig 1 a summary of the charted data of each study is presented in appendix i 4 1 the setting population and timing of included studies all the 29 studies selected were conducted in lmics fourteen 48 3 of the articles included in the review were conducted in africa twelve 41 4 in asia and one 3 4 in south america two 6 9 of the studies were conducted across continents one in asia south america and africa and the other in south america and africa studies conducted in africa were set across three sub regions including west africa n 1 east africa n 11 and southern africa n 2 all studies included from asia were set in south asia n 12 the majority of these studies n 11 were conducted in india only one study was set in central south america west africa and central south america were found to have the smallest proportion 6 9 of the literature reporting wash gbv although we recognize that limiting the search to english may have missed sources conducted in other languages a greater proportion of the studies 78 6 conducted in africa were set in east africa a majority of the studies n 13 45 included were conducted in rural settings seven 24 were conducted in urban areas with only two 7 examining the everyday water struggles among populations in informal settlements nine studies 31 were conducted in both urban and rural settings and two 7 of these examined national level datasets one in kenya and the other in india we found that 20 n 6 of the studies took place in school settings highlighting the wash experiences and practices among students a greater percentage of the studies n 19 65 focused solely on the wash experiences of women n 12 41 and girls n 7 24 specifically five studies 17 explored the ways menstrual hygiene practices exposed women and girls to various forms of violence 10 31 examined women and girls sanitation experiences and the associated violence three 10 highlighted the violence encountered by women and girls when accessing water none of the studies focused exclusively on the wash experiences of men and boys the remaining 34 n 10 of the studies examined a range of water and sanitation related violence across gender the publication trend on violence in wash over the past 20 years 2000 2020 is presented in fig 2 we observed a gradual increase in the number of studies over time with a spike in the number of publications in 2015 2016 and 2017 which marked the end and the start of the mdgs and sdgs respectively the largest drop in publication was recorded in 2019 although this stabilized in 2020 with 5 articles published so far 4 2 characterizing wash gender based violence from the results we identified four inter related dimensions of gbv comprising structural psychological sexual and physical violence table 2 psychological violence was the dimension of violence most reported in the studies n 21 72 and the majority of these studies n 14 48 related to sanitation and hygiene sexual violence was the least reported form of violence documented by only 28 of the studies 4 2 1 structural violence socio cultural economic political and institutional structures and processes sometimes influence people s access to water and sanitation services 12 21 4 these processes interrelate to create an exclusive and discriminatory pattern of water access who gets water at what time and price 21 10 90 in pakistan a study by anwar et al 4 revealed that politics and power shape water rationing and allocation in informal settlements and access is usually mediated through institutions similarly tutu and stoler 75 noted that government sponsored piped water services in ghana are generally directed to rich and middle class neighbourhoods while households in poor settlements are left to secure water by informal means these procedural injustices reinforce and expose women to a series of violence for instance bisung and elliott 10 noted that water insecurity in usoma kenya created perceptions of marginalization and neglect by the government also wutich 90 reported that structural inequities regarding water provision and access caused anger frustration and sentiments of marginalization in bolivia the absence of reliable water adds to the financial burden of women the opportunity cost of fetching water such as less time to engage in income generating activities 90 10 14 18 and paying higher prices for water 10 75 18 depleted women savings although gender mainstreaming has gained attention in water resource management financial support for gender equity initiatives in lmics is largely dependent on non governmental organizations ngos 51 however these ngos sometimes coerced women to participate in water development projects 14 the inadequacy of sanitation infrastructure also reinforces power relations within the household and community and compounds women and girls vulnerability to multiple forms of violence and health risks for example datta and ahmed 21 noted that the disconnections and absence of sanitation infrastructure in kerala india created violent spaces where women were physically and sexually abused women bear the burden of excavating pits for waste disposal alongside the continued physical and verbal assaults from spouses who enforce these duties studies have also documented the ways structural inequities interlinked with social segregations to deprive marginalized households and women of latrines 56 35 with regard to hygiene the design and structural deficiencies of public sanitation facilities do not provide privacy for safe menstrual hygiene practices 17 33 70 morgan et al 47 noted in a multi national cross sectional wash study in 2270 rural schools randomly selected from ethiopia kenya mozambique rwanda uganda and zambia that there were fewer than 20 of the schools with four of the five recommended menstrual hygiene services separate sex latrines with doors and locks water for use waste bin other instances of inadequate sanitation infrastructure for menstrual hygiene including damaged or missing toilet doors doors without locks insufficient segregation of male and female toilets and lack of changing rooms for menstrual hygiene were also reported 70 33 40 20 menstrual hygiene education was also reported to be limited at schools 40 70 and negative encounters from some male teachers created discomforts 40 female students expressed concerns about safety and lack of privacy for menstrual hygiene management 1 70 40 33 20 this gap in service reduced school attendance academic performance and sometimes caused dropouts among female students 1 33 40 4 2 2 psychological violence psychological violence includes any act that causes emotional harm anxiety and depression frustration feelings of negative identity and marginalization research has increasingly documented the psychosocial health risk of women and girls in relation to inadequate wash access regarding water reported stressors included long walking distance to water sources queuing to fetch water unsafe water sources and insufficient supplies for daily need 19 18 10 these stressors often resulted in psychological outcomes such as depression anxiety and frustration and feeling of negative identity cooper vince et al 19 observed that in rural uganda women in water insecurity hotspots are at 70 greater risk of depression than men water insecurity resulted in feelings of embarrassment frustration and negative identity and marginalization among women in usoma kenya 10 also psychosocial outcomes such as shame for not being able to keep oneself or one s children clean due to lack of water have been reported 10 18 women s inability to offer visitors clean water as a sign of hospitality accusations of water theft by neighbours fighting each other in water queues and fear of spousal violence contributed to social shaming worry anger frustration and negative self identity 18 59 19 10 71 in contrast mushavi et al 50 found that depressive symptoms associated with water insecurity were higher among men compared to women in rural uganda research has also established the association between poor sanitation and psychological wellbeing for instance hirve et al 29 found that 64 of women who practiced open defecation reported some level of stress due to perceived lack of personal safety as compared to 6 of latrine users also 44 of open defecators reported some levels of stress due to lack of privacy compared to 3 of latrine users 29 other studies have reported on the anxiety and stress women and girls experience when going for open defecation due to fear of being abused and the associated embarrassment and shame 10 62 38 52 35 women and girls also reported fear and experience of verbal assaults and ridicule when defecating in public latrines 21 15 62 relatedly a cross sectional study in 60 rural communities in odisha india found that women experience high levels of anxiety depression and distress when urinating or defecating even when they are using latrines 16 women have also reported withholding food and water intake in order to limit defecation and urination holding in shit and urine when they are pressed in public 35 38 furthermore the literature showcases how wash insecurity inhibits women and girls from practicing safe menstrual hygiene which influences their social engagement and psychological wellbeing 52 35 17 1 70 40 20 33 in a cross sectional study in odisha india caruso et al 17 found women with no functional household latrine had higher menstrual insecurity scores than women who own latrines the lack of sanitary towels and safe spaces for changing menstrual towels appropriate means of disposing sanitary pads and unavailability of soap and water for menstrual hygiene practices caused shame embarrassment and anxiety among women and girls 1 70 40 33 62 in the school environment female students reported living in fear of humiliation and ridicule by male classmates when menstrual fluid accidentally stains their uniforms or when seen changing menstrual pads in school urinals or latrines 40 20 33 social restrictions for menstruating girls resulted in emotional distress and discomfort 33 70 4 2 3 sexual violence wash insecurity also puts women and girls in overtly vulnerable positions including exposing them to sexual violence pommells et al 59 documented cases of women and girls being raped when fetching water offering sex for water when they could not pay water fees or for favors when in water queues a range of studies has also associated sexual violence with sanitation for example jadhav et al 30 analyzed the 2005 2006 indian national family health survey iii and found that indian women who practice open defecation are twice likely to experience non partner sexual violence within the past year compared to women who had household toilets simirlarly winter and barchi 84 analysis of the 2008 2009 kenyan demographic health survey dhs data revealed that women who primarily practiced open defecation had 40 more likely of experiencing non partner sexual and or physical violence in the past year compared to women who did not primarily practice open defecation these findings align with other studies which reported the sexual violence women and girls encounter when accessing their sanitation needs 62 35 38 52 for example women and girls reported being watched peeping through broken doors and walls and being harassed by men boys loitering around latrines and open defecation sites 62 35 52 38 further khanna and das 35 documented women s stories and accounts on rape and sexual harassment during open defecation in rural india including the incident where a 14 year old girl was raped and killed by a group of men 35 other forms of reported sexual assaults reported included men staring and masturbating in front of women and taking photographs of women at defecation sites 38 overall adolescent girls were at greater risk of experiencing sexual harassment 35 moreover girls inability to purchase sanitary pads also exposed them to sexual violence for example drawing on the lived experiences of schoolgirls in kenya jewittt and ryley 33 noted that girls from poor households engaged in transactional sex with fishermen and taxi drivers in order to obtain money for sanitary pads and other basic items such as soap or food 4 2 4 physical violence women and girls also experience physical violence in negotiating their daily wash access 38 62 59 35 52 18 women are not only vulnerable to attacks by non partners on their way to water sources they are also at risk of spousal abuse when water insecurity affects their normative roles 59 18 women are also susceptible to spousal abuse if participation in water management projects provides access to opportunities or enhances their social standing 14 water insecurity also creates spaces for interpersonal violence among women and girls especially during periods of water shortages when queuing causes anxiety frustration and anger 59 mothers in turn exert their anger and frustrations on their girls when they spend too much time fetching water and when water is insufficient 59 50 studies have also documented accounts of women and girls being subjected to physical violence when practicing open defecation 38 35 52 62 for example 52 p 79 reported an incident in bengaluru india where a pregnant woman was snatched and dragged off by a group of men during defecation women are also shouted at stoned and chased away with sticks at open defecation sites 35 29 4 3 individual and collective wash gender violence coping strategies despite the vulnerability of females to gender based violence around access to wash service our analysis revealed individuals women in particular and communities pragmatic strategies employed to reduce vulnerabilities to violence at the individual and household levels women and girls employed several behavioural strategies to safeguard their safety and privacy when meeting their sanitation needs some strategies identified include women and girls defecating early in the morning or late in the night to protect their privacy 52 62 29 35 38 walking long distances to find hidden spaces for defecation 35 38 going out in groups in pairs and under the guard of husbands or male household members to defecate 62 52 38 and carrying stones with them so they can defend themselves against attacks 38 women also reported withholding food and water intake and taking anti diarrheal medicines when necessary in order to avoid defecating 38 35 kulkarni et al 38 found that some women construct household latrines to enhance their safety during defecation whilst others fought with their husbands and in laws for household latrines however the lack of land tenure security and low income constrained households decisions to construct latrines 38 35 women also employ strategies to cope with water insecurity these include conserving water for multiple uses water reuse prioritization of water uses e g drinking and bathing over other uses and treating surface water for domestic uses 18 10 71 90 during periods of water scarcity some women reallocate water use to ensure their husbands had enough water to bath and drink in order to avoid their wrath 18 whilst others serve themselves food last when they are unable to cook enough food for the household because of the time spent searching for water 59 at the community level collective initiatives taken to address water challenges include sharing water with neighbours resource mobilization towards the maintenance of water facilities and the establishment of social networks for water loaning and borrowing 90 10 with respect to sanitation latrine sharing among households is a dominant coping mechanism in resource poor settings 52 10 5 discussion this review synthesizes evidence on the various forms of violence associated with the lack and inadequacy of wash services in lmics four main dimensions of violence were identified including structural social suffering and inequities resulting from institutional processes psychological emotional and mental distress sexual rape coerced transactional sex and physical our conceptualization of wash gbv extends beyond interpersonal rape and physical assaults violence to show how violence related to wash could be psychological gbv could also be structural resulting from institutional processes socio economic inequalities and discrimination in water and sanitation provision 74 75 structural violence is systemic and tends to be hegemonized since it sustains the very zero level standard against which we perceive something as subjectively violent 91 p2 as datta ahmed 21 illuminated lack of access to wash infrastructure is a form of violence that is mutually constitutive with gendered violence in marginalized settings as outlined in the results all the selected studies from asia were set in south asia and about 78 of those in africa were conducted in east africa this synthesized evidence presents a trend of spatial disparity in wash gbv research and the possibility of leaving some populations behind in the global drive to clean water and sanitation for all and gender equality a special focus is therefore needed on the areas where research on wash gbv is limited these efforts could be a catalyst for not only promoting population health but also gender equality most of the studies reviewed were conducted in settings where socio cultural norms and expectations placed the responsibility of water collection storage and domestic hygiene maintenance on women and girls in addition to these socially assigned roles unequal social relations including gender inequality intersecting with social class and caste create spaces of discrimination and inequality leading to negative experiences of sanitation among women and girls wash gbv in this regard is an outcome of unequal social relations with gender intersecting with other dimensions of inequality this highlights the need for a broader understanding of wash beyond the joint monitoring programme jmp service ladder which focuses on the availability design and quality of infrastructure with little attention to the environmental and social factors that shape wash experiences 5 1 framing wash gender based violence drawing insights from the synthesis we proposed a conceptual model which highlights how socio cultural structural and environmental interactions produce and shape violence in wash across time and space fig 3 this model is partly informed by sclar et al 64 preliminary model on the influence of sanitation on mental wellbeing the review showed that contextual factors such as social norms intersectionality inequality gender roles environmental proximity location season in the year and neigbourhood and structural policies power relations infrastructure design expose individuals especially women and girls to various vulnerabilities of violence which are embodied through lack of access to adequate water sanitation and hygiene wash gender based violence is situated and shaped by social relations across multiple scales i e household community national and international we found that women and girls are exposed to various forms of violence such as structural psychological physical and sexual violence which negatively affect their wellbeing these dimensions of violence are not mutually exclusive for instance structural violence produces and reinforces multiple forms of wash gbv the absence of infrastructure such as water and toilet facilities exposes women and girls to physical psychological and sexual violence 21 38 psychological violence on one hand is an outcome of the other three dimensions of violence see 10 62 however individuals and communities employed certain coping mechanisms agency to buffer their exposure to violence social support such as water sharing lending money to buy water and sharing of toilets drive the buffering effect against violence therefore the wellbeing of women and girls largely depended on their ability to cope and overcome their everydayness of violence however the success of the agency social support services is dependent on the availability of social support from members of the household and community personal constraints or individual factors are also reported to influence the pattern of violence such that individuals with fewer social and economic resources are at greater risk of experiencing violence for example girls who cannot afford sanitary towels are coerced into transactional sex 33 55 5 2 theoretical challenges and considerations in wash gbv studies the studies reviewed are premised on the fact that wash services are unevenly distributed and some people are denied access to wash because of who they are and where they live 21 38 35 56 14 10 however only five 17 of these studies were grounded in explicit theoretical perspectives including political ecology 14 feminist political ecology 33 4 environmental stress and ecosocial theories 10 and the theory of informality 75 the majority of the studies 83 were developed without explicit theoretical guidance although various conceptual frameworks were sometimes cited as guiding the research the theories used informed researchers understanding of the inequalities and gendered violence associated with wash access and guided their observation and framing of violence though these theories originated from different disciplinary backgrounds they share some common perspectives first the theories affirm that social economic political and environmental conditions shape the lives of individuals and their agency second they recognize that the benefits and consequences of these complex socio political economic and environmental interactions are not evenly distributed across space and among populations thirdly the theories acknowledge that wash gbv is a byproduct of these complex interactions and should be analyzed as embedded in and intersecting with various socio economic and socio cultural regimes of power and political context however each of these theories has some limitations in offering a robust theoretical lens for understanding gbv in the context of wash for example although environmental stress theory is useful in understanding how individuals and communities perceive experience and cope with the risk associated with wash insecurity it gives less attention to the drivers of these risks and their distribution among geographic areas and populations the embodiment literature helps our understanding of how environmental stressors related to wash are shaped by socio economic inequalities and become embodied to generate gendered patterns of health and wellbeing further feminist political ecology fpe uses gender as a central social category that informs societal nature relations resource access i e water and sanitation as well as politics related to the environment 61 60 in so doing it reveals how power structures shaping wash provision and access disempower bodies i e exposure to violence embedded in social and cultural contexts however fpe does not extend the analysis to explore the health implications of social inequalities and violence resulting from uneven wash resource access and use the dualism between theories has made certain inequalities hidden particularly in relation to water insecurity and gbv since each theory alone is incapable of capturing all the complexities moving forward a theoretical integration particularly incorporating insights from epidemiological theories into social science theories will aid health geographers to conceptualize violence in the context of wash and the multiple ways it is embodied 53 explicit engagement with theory will also prove useful for understanding the spatial temporality of violence as well as how community s development trajectory social processes and local meanings shape gendered violence in wash 5 3 methodological challenges and consideration in wash gbv in terms of methodology we found that the majority of the studies n 13 45 included in the review were conducted using qualitative methods and only five studies 17 were quantitative qualitative research tends to be more common especially in gbv studies 82 however quantitative investigation of the phenomenon is important in order to gain a broader contextual understanding of violence another theme that emerged from the review was that studies on sexual violence were limited this limitation has been attributed to the sensitivity of the issue and under reporting by women and girls due to the associated stigma 38 70 this requires researchers to consider adopting research designs that allow for the expansion and reframing of research questions to uncover the invisible voices of victims further many of the studies reviewed n 21 72 reported psychological violence which is the dominant dimension of violence reported some of these studies have developed tools to measure psychological distress related to sanitation insecurity for example caruso et al 15 developed a novel sanitation insecurity measure to capture the negative sanitation experiences of women in odisha india the proposed measure reflected women s sanitation concerns in three broad domains including the physical environment the social environment and personal constraints caruso et al 17 again developed and validated a measure of menstrual insecurity to assess women s menstruation insecurity in odisha though these measures have some limitations i e contextual grounding they provide an innovative research direction thus we recommend their application in different socio ecological contexts for further validation and application in wash research in addition the studies in the review showcased a comprehensive range of methodological designs for wash research cooper vince et al 15 17 stevenson et al 71 for example cooper vince et al 19 employed geographic information system analysis to identify the spatial clustering of water insecurity and depression symptom severity in rural uganda in terms of sampling majority of the studies n 16 55 were conducted with only women and girls there were no studies in the review that looked exclusively at the vulnerability of men and boys to violence while this highlights that women and girls are more likely to experience violence when meeting their wash needs an explicit understanding of men and boys vulnerability to violence would inform policy for instance women most often internalized their distress frustrations and anger regarding the lack of adequate water and sanitation while men externalized their emotional distress in the form of spousal abuse and assaults 18 5 4 gaps and directions for future research although the articles reviewed provided some important insights on violence in the context of wash some questions and gaps were identified for wash research and practice first our conceptualization of violence in wash showcases the need for a broader framing of violence in order to illuminate certain hidden inequalities integrating a structural dimension of violence will enable us to understand how institutional processes produce and reinforce violence and how we can leverage these structures for solutions second the review showed how socio cultural norms and practices created spaces of violence in the study settings however the extent to which these cultural practices and norms provided safe spaces for wash or facilitated the reduction in vulnerability to violence remained a major research gap third many of the studies identified gender inequalities and men as perpetrators of violence however none of the studies explicitly discussed the vulnerable experiences of men and boys though women and girls disproportionately bear a significant burden of wash insecurity more research is needed on the experiences of men and boys fourth several questions remained unanswered regarding the health implications of wash gbv in lmics for example how has wash gbv shaped health and wellbeing differently among men and women how do the health system and socio political institutions respond to wash gbv and what are the challenges fifth we found that none of the studies highlighted the sanitation needs of people with disability and their experiences of violence sixth the narratives that emerged from the review did not significantly address the temporalities of violence how has the landscape of wash violence changed over time with regards to sanitation oftentimes studies focused on latrine access and use without considering the possibilities of gender violence in the process of latrine construction individuals experiences of violence intensify when communities adopt shaming and social stigma as tools for promoting latrine construction 8 finally ecological change i e climate change has exacerbated the vulnerabilities to wash gbv in some lmics 72 39 63 although our model acknowledges the impacts of environmental factors on wash gbv future research should rigorously examine vulnerabilities to wash gbv linked to seasonality and climate change further research is needed to address the identified research gaps and build on the proposed conceptual framework fig 3 for research and policy interventions 6 conclusion this review demonstrates that gender based violence in wash is beyond physical sexual and psychological harm we emphasized the need for research attention on the way in which institutions and social interactions processes produce violence with violence understood as a relational outcome incorporating a structural dimension of violence may shine a spotlight on institutional weaknesses in wash provisions at the community level and the importance of collective actions at multi levels to effect change wash gbv will be exacerbated in lmics because of the covid 19 pandemic 2 understanding wash gbv as a social outcome will provide a robust platform for research and facilitate global efforts on achieving sdgs 5 achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls and 6 ensure water and sanitation for all further the findings of the review demonstrate the need for a broader evaluation of wash beyond the physical presence and quality of infrastructure and service recognizing the heterogeneity of social norms and relations that gives power to violence will significantly deconstruct the structures that reinforce gender vulnerabilities to violence beyond the home e g at the school setting our proposal for a theoretical integration would provide a platform for reflexive methodologies in research focusing on wash related violence in lmics while this scoping review significantly contributes to knowledge it has limitations firstly the search strategy was limited to peer reviewed articles published in english this may have excluded other important articles second the quality of the selected studies was not assessed however since the search was limited to peer reviewed articles there is less likelihood of using studies of low quality third as stated above explicit studies on the vulnerability and experiences of men and boys were missing consequently the findings largely represent the experiences of women and girls in the study settings we therefore recommended research attention on the experiences of men and boys fourth cases of wash related gender based violence particularly sexual violence were under reported as a result it is possible that other experiences of sexual violence were not captured finally the review is limited in terms of the generalization of the findings due to our focus on lmics however the findings are still relevant for global policy and research since lmics are the most challenged in terms of wash insecurity 83

20108,peak attenuation results in a gradual decrease of the peak discharge when a flood propagates in downstream direction peak attenuation occurs along all rivers but is not equally strong on all rivers the rate of peak attenuation depends on the river geometry such as river slope floodplain width and available storage areas floodplain wetlands and lakes along many rivers worldwide measures have been taken that decrease peak attenuation and hence resulted in higher flood water levels and increased flood risk downstream this paper shows the importance of considering peak attenuation in flood risk management it also shows that construction of embankments may contrary to what generally is expected increase peak attenuation but that this strongly depends on the height of the flood defences in combination with the discharges that pose the greatest threat to areas downstream this is exemplified using the meuse river in the netherlands as a case study keywords river floods flood risk management peak attenuation 1 introduction when a river flood travels downstream the peak discharge gradually decreases this phenomenon is called peak attenuation see fig 1 the rate of peak attenuation depends on the river geometry such as river slope and floodplain width e g 1 2 3 and available storage areas floodplain wetlands lakes and reservoirs see e g 4 5 high hydraulic roughness of the channel and the floodplain also enhances peak attenuation e g 3 peak attenuation however also depends on the shape of the flood wave as peak discharges decrease more when floods are peaked and have a short duration e g 2 3 attenuation not only reduces peak discharges and water levels but also slows down the propagation of the flood wave from a flood risk perspective it can be concluded that downstream river reaches benefit from upstream peak attenuation as the discharge peak is reduced and water levels remain lower this positive effect of peak attenuation however is not always taken into account in flood risk management planning while river training may reduce flooding locally it decreases peak attenuation and can thus result in increased flood hazard downstream e g 6 also the construction of embankments to protect riparian land for agriculture or urban development may increase flood risk downstream over the past centuries many floodplains along major rivers have been embanked this has resulted in a serious decrease in floodplain area e g 7 8 9 10 11 many flood risk management studies focus on the local effects of embankments and show rising water levels in the narrowed sections e g 12 13 heine and pinter 12 also mention backwater effects and higher water levels upstream of embanked river reaches few researchers have however studied the impacts of embankments on peak attenuation for long river stretches e g 8 14 18 for the development of flood risk management plans it is essential to assess the effects of interventions from a whole systems point of view this implies that both upstream and downstream impacts should be considered this is also stressed in the eu floods directive 2007 60 ec that came into force in 2007 the objective of the directive was to establish a framework for the assessment and management of flood risks to reduce the negative consequences of flooding on human health economic activities the environment and cultural heritage in the european union to avoid risk transfer of local interventions to neighbouring member states the directive encourages international co operation and the joint establishment of flood risk management plans coordinated at a catchment level long term integrated flood risk management plans are presently being developed for the meuse river in the netherlands this was a reason for rijkswaterstaat the executive agency of the ministry of infrastructure and water management in the netherlands to start a study into peak attenuation along the meuse river the most important questions were how much peak attenuation takes place along the river meuse under different flood conditions how does this affect water levels downstream which areas play an important role in peak attenuation and should not be affected by the new plans for enhanced flood protection how do proposed measures and interventions affect peak attenuation and how could we use this knowledge to improve the new flood risk management plan the aim of this paper is to show the relevance of considering peak attenuation in flood risk management planning evidenced by a quantification for the meuse river in the netherlands as a case study 2 the river meuse in the netherlands the meuse river is a 950 km long river in western europe the meuse originates in france and then flows through belgium and the netherlands to the north sea the river enters the netherlands near eijsden fig 2 between eijsden and roermond the river has a gravel bed and a relatively steep slope of 40 cm per km downstream of roermond the river slope decreases to about 10 cm per km near roermond lakes are present in the floodplain of the meuse they are the result of sand and gravel extraction downstream of roermond the river valley narrows as the river is flowing through a tectonically uplifted area next until cuijk the river valley is characterised by the presence of river terraces where most villages were built downstream of cuijk the river is characterised by a straightened channel and embanked floodplains in the southern part of the netherlands i e upstream of cuijk the river flows through a natural valley until the 90 s no embankments existed along this part of the river this situation is depicted in the upper part of fig 3 as past situation after the floods of 1993 and 1995 relatively low embankments in comparison with other embankments in the netherlands were constructed that protected cities and villages against a 1 100 year flood these low embankments were designed to be overflowing under more extreme discharges that are relevant for the downstream areas that have stricter protection standards this is depicted as the current situation in fig 3 in 2017 new flood protection standards were adopted in the netherlands the embankments must meet the new standards before 2050 along the meuse upstream of cuijk the new protection standards vary between 1 100 and 1 1000 per year higher protection standards in combination with climate change will lead to dike heightening in the near future this results in a loss in flow width even when discharges are very high this is depicted in fig 3 as the future situation 3 approach peak attenuation was quantified using 2d hydraulic waqua models waqua is used for two dimensional hydro dynamic and water quality simulation of well mixed estuaries coastal seas and rivers it solves the shallow water equations and can deal with rectilinear and curvilinear grids technical details can be found in 15 simulations were carried out for five peak discharges varying from about 3200 m3 s 1 100 probability of occurrence to almost 4400 m3 s 1 10 000 probability also three different flood wave shapes were used 1 an average shape or duration that also is used in the netherlands for the design of embankments 2 a steep wave with a short duration and 3 a flat flood wave with a long duration see fig 4 the wave shapes were derived from hegnauer et al 16 to isolate the effect of peak attenuation simulations were made without lateral inflow from smaller local rivers although lateral inflows are relatively small there could be an effect on computed peak discharges when peak attenuation alters the travel time of the flood wave and hence the probability that flood peaks in the meuse and the tributaries coincide the impact of measures and interventions was assessed using waqua models that represent the past present and future situation the waqua model beno17 5 v1 17 describes the current situation fig 3 it also formed the basis for the future situation for the future situation the embankments in the southern part of the meuse were raised in the waqua model to account for dike strengthening that will take place in the coming decades this is in line with the updated flood protection standards which must be met before 2050 the higher embankments will result in loss of room for the river to minimise this loss rijkswaterstaat proposed to relocate embankments at 7 locations before strengthening them also 5 detention areas are proposed these 12 measures and 2 other room for the river projects that will be carried out in the coming years were added to the waqua model to represent the future situation the room for the river measures consist of making openings in the foundation of a road that crosses the river upstream of cuijk and floodplain excavation upstream of den bosch the waqua model j93 5 was used to analyse peak attenuation in the past situation this model does not contain embankments in the southern part of the meuse room for the river measures and other changes in the river that have taken place since 1995 are absent in this model as well 4 peak attenuation in the current situation the amount of peak attenuation strongly depends on the peak discharge fig 5 shows the peak attenuation that was computed with the waqua model for the current situation and for the average wave shape in the downstream river reaches the decrease in peak discharge varies between 450 m3 s and 650 m3 s fig 5a the sudden drops in peak discharge indicate where most peak attenuation occurs upstream of the large lakes km 3 to 60 peak attenuation is limited this mainly is due to the relatively steep slope of the riverbed as peak attenuation is limited the water level reduction is small fig 5b the lakes near the city of roermond km 60 80 contribute strongly to the peak attenuation the exact location however changes with the discharge peak at very high discharge about 4400 m3 s peak attenuation mainly takes place in the upstream part of the lake area km 60 70 this is caused by overtopping of embankments in this area at lower discharges most of the peak attenuation takes place in the downstream part of the lake area km 70 80 this is caused by inflow of a detention area called lateraalkanaal west lkw downstream of roermond km 80 160 peak attenuation mainly occurs at very high discharges this is caused by overtopping of the embankments that protect the villages the decrease in peak discharge at km160 is caused by storage of water in the polder lob van gennep little peak attenuation occurs at the downstream part of the meuse downstream of km 160 this probably is related to the large water depths the relatively narrow floodplains and the lack of storage areas however because of the peak attenuation in upstream reaches water levels are lowered by 40 to 60 cm peak attenuation depends on the peak discharge fig 5 but even more so on the shape or duration of the discharge wave fig 6 indicates that peak attenuation is limited for flat flood waves with a long duration floods with a short duration steep shape however can result in much more peak attenuation than floods with an average shape or duration for a peak discharge of about 4400 m3 s peak attenuation can vary from 200 m3 s when the flood duration is long flat wave shape to 1200 m3 s when the flood has a short duration steep wave shape for a flood with an average shape and duration it takes about 80 h to travel from eijsden km 3 to keizersveer km 247 peak discharge seems to have a minor effect on the travel time fig 5c however the shape or duration of the flood has a major effect on the travel time a steep flood wave short duration moves relatively slowly whereas a flat wave long duration moves relatively fast for the wave shapes that were used in this study travel times were 30 h more for the steep flood wave short duration than for the flat flood wave long duration fig 6b it is important to notice that the exact locations that contribute to peak attenuation vary per flood depending on the peak discharge and flood duration different areas appear to be important this is also shown in fig 7 it also is important to notice that only looking at the peak discharges may underestimate the indirect contribution of river reaches to peak attenuation if overtopping of an embankment starts during an earlier stage of the flood wave the storage capacity may be insufficient and no water will be stored during the passage of the flood peak instead it will only reduce discharges during part of the rising stage of the flood resulting in a steeper top of the flood wave however this steeper flood peak will allow more peak attenuation to happen further downstream this is made clear in fig 8 which shows the downstream change in wave shape for a very steep wave with a discharge of 3862 m3 s at the red circles overtopping of embankments has caused a lower discharge on the rising part of the flood wave but only further downstream this will result in peak attenuation this phenomenon also is the reason why detention areas are often considered unreliable when the inflow of water into the detention area starts too early it will be full before the peak discharge arrives hence it will not be able to lower the discharge peak but will only reduce the discharge during the rising limb of the flood hydrograph this does not mean that the detention area has no effect at all as the narrower peak of the flood will be more susceptible to peak attenuation it may still reduce the discharge peak further downstream in this case the positive effect of storage is not noticeable at the location of the detention area but only further downstream 5 the impact of measures on peak attenuation the impact of measures and changes in the river system on peak attenuation was studied with the models that represent the past present and the future situation fig 9 shows the peak attenuation that was computed for floods with different peak discharges and an average shape for the 3 situations the present situation results in more peak attenuation along the southern part of the meuse i e between roermond and cuijk this is partly caused by the room for the river measures that were carried out after 1995 and that resulted in a small increase in river floodplain however as the increase in peak attenuation is mainly observed at relatively high river discharges we expect that most of the peak attenuation in the present situation is caused by the construction of low embankments that protect villages against a 1 100 year flood but that are overtopped at higher discharges and thus enhance the storage of water under these more extreme conditions without the low embankments these areas would have been flooded at much lower discharges reducing the available storage volume at very high discharge in the future the embankments will be raised so that even at a discharge of 4400 m3 s they will not be overtopped this results in a significant decrease in peak attenuation along the southern part of the river meuse upstream of cuijk km 160 6 conclusions peak attenuation can have a large effect on the discharges and thereby water levels in downstream river reaches the degree of peak attenuation depends on peak discharge the shape duration of the flood wave and river geometry river bed slope floodplain width etc peak attenuation along the meuse river is the strongest under very high discharges when not only the lakes near roermond and several detention areas store water but when also most embankments along the southern upstream part of the river are being overtopped a flood with a peak discharge of about 4400 m3 s and average shape can be reduced by 650 m3 s due to peak attenuation this results in about 60 cm lower water levels along the downstream river reaches the sensitivity to the shape of the flood wave is illustrated by the variation of the peak attenuation which ranges from 200 m3 s for floods with a long duration to 1200 m3 s for steep flood waves of very short duration depending on the peak discharge and flood duration different areas contribute to the peak attenuation as the areas that contribute most to the peak attenuation such as the lakes near the city of roermond are effective during floods with different peak discharges and duration a relatively robust river system results if inflow into these or other areas would have been optimised for a specific flood the total peak attenuation could have been higher but only for those flood conditions for which it was intentionally designed during all other floods peak attenuation would be much less the present system is not optimised for one specific flood so depending on the peak discharge and the duration of the flood different areas contribute to peak attenuation this makes the river system more robust in view of the large variability of and hence uncertainty about flood waves to be expected room for the river measures that were implemented during the last decades and that resulted in an increased floodplain width seem to enhance peak attenuation however the largest contribution can be attributed to the construction of low embankments along the southern part of the river meuse between roermond and cuijk they have reduced the degree of peak attenuation during low floods but have significantly increased peak attenuation during more extreme floods that are relevant when looking at the flood protection standards along downstream parts of the river as the new flood protection standards in the netherlands require raising and strengthening of the embankments also along the upstream part of the river meuse much of the recent gain in peak attenuation is likely to be lost in the coming years resulting in increased water levels downstream the results of the case study for the meuse river show the importance to assess changes in peak attenuation when developing flood risk management plans with respect to flood protection by means of constructing embankments it can be concluded that this does not always have a negative effect when damage in downstream reaches mainly occurs during very extreme floods the construction of low embankments in upstream reaches can increase peak attenuation under these particular conditions similar results were obtained for the po river by castellarin et al 8 the assessment of whether a measure is effective from a systemic flood risk management point of view therefore should not only depend on its local effects in the case of levee construction decrease in flood probability in the protected areas but an increase in water depth in unembanked floodplains but also on its upstream and downstream effects the study also shows that it is important to consider peak attenuation under different discharges different peak discharge as well as flood durations as optimisation for a single flood event could easily result in a serious overestimation of its effectiveness credit authorship contribution statement nathalie asselman conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis investigation visualization jurjen s de jong

20108,peak attenuation results in a gradual decrease of the peak discharge when a flood propagates in downstream direction peak attenuation occurs along all rivers but is not equally strong on all rivers the rate of peak attenuation depends on the river geometry such as river slope floodplain width and available storage areas floodplain wetlands and lakes along many rivers worldwide measures have been taken that decrease peak attenuation and hence resulted in higher flood water levels and increased flood risk downstream this paper shows the importance of considering peak attenuation in flood risk management it also shows that construction of embankments may contrary to what generally is expected increase peak attenuation but that this strongly depends on the height of the flood defences in combination with the discharges that pose the greatest threat to areas downstream this is exemplified using the meuse river in the netherlands as a case study keywords river floods flood risk management peak attenuation 1 introduction when a river flood travels downstream the peak discharge gradually decreases this phenomenon is called peak attenuation see fig 1 the rate of peak attenuation depends on the river geometry such as river slope and floodplain width e g 1 2 3 and available storage areas floodplain wetlands lakes and reservoirs see e g 4 5 high hydraulic roughness of the channel and the floodplain also enhances peak attenuation e g 3 peak attenuation however also depends on the shape of the flood wave as peak discharges decrease more when floods are peaked and have a short duration e g 2 3 attenuation not only reduces peak discharges and water levels but also slows down the propagation of the flood wave from a flood risk perspective it can be concluded that downstream river reaches benefit from upstream peak attenuation as the discharge peak is reduced and water levels remain lower this positive effect of peak attenuation however is not always taken into account in flood risk management planning while river training may reduce flooding locally it decreases peak attenuation and can thus result in increased flood hazard downstream e g 6 also the construction of embankments to protect riparian land for agriculture or urban development may increase flood risk downstream over the past centuries many floodplains along major rivers have been embanked this has resulted in a serious decrease in floodplain area e g 7 8 9 10 11 many flood risk management studies focus on the local effects of embankments and show rising water levels in the narrowed sections e g 12 13 heine and pinter 12 also mention backwater effects and higher water levels upstream of embanked river reaches few researchers have however studied the impacts of embankments on peak attenuation for long river stretches e g 8 14 18 for the development of flood risk management plans it is essential to assess the effects of interventions from a whole systems point of view this implies that both upstream and downstream impacts should be considered this is also stressed in the eu floods directive 2007 60 ec that came into force in 2007 the objective of the directive was to establish a framework for the assessment and management of flood risks to reduce the negative consequences of flooding on human health economic activities the environment and cultural heritage in the european union to avoid risk transfer of local interventions to neighbouring member states the directive encourages international co operation and the joint establishment of flood risk management plans coordinated at a catchment level long term integrated flood risk management plans are presently being developed for the meuse river in the netherlands this was a reason for rijkswaterstaat the executive agency of the ministry of infrastructure and water management in the netherlands to start a study into peak attenuation along the meuse river the most important questions were how much peak attenuation takes place along the river meuse under different flood conditions how does this affect water levels downstream which areas play an important role in peak attenuation and should not be affected by the new plans for enhanced flood protection how do proposed measures and interventions affect peak attenuation and how could we use this knowledge to improve the new flood risk management plan the aim of this paper is to show the relevance of considering peak attenuation in flood risk management planning evidenced by a quantification for the meuse river in the netherlands as a case study 2 the river meuse in the netherlands the meuse river is a 950 km long river in western europe the meuse originates in france and then flows through belgium and the netherlands to the north sea the river enters the netherlands near eijsden fig 2 between eijsden and roermond the river has a gravel bed and a relatively steep slope of 40 cm per km downstream of roermond the river slope decreases to about 10 cm per km near roermond lakes are present in the floodplain of the meuse they are the result of sand and gravel extraction downstream of roermond the river valley narrows as the river is flowing through a tectonically uplifted area next until cuijk the river valley is characterised by the presence of river terraces where most villages were built downstream of cuijk the river is characterised by a straightened channel and embanked floodplains in the southern part of the netherlands i e upstream of cuijk the river flows through a natural valley until the 90 s no embankments existed along this part of the river this situation is depicted in the upper part of fig 3 as past situation after the floods of 1993 and 1995 relatively low embankments in comparison with other embankments in the netherlands were constructed that protected cities and villages against a 1 100 year flood these low embankments were designed to be overflowing under more extreme discharges that are relevant for the downstream areas that have stricter protection standards this is depicted as the current situation in fig 3 in 2017 new flood protection standards were adopted in the netherlands the embankments must meet the new standards before 2050 along the meuse upstream of cuijk the new protection standards vary between 1 100 and 1 1000 per year higher protection standards in combination with climate change will lead to dike heightening in the near future this results in a loss in flow width even when discharges are very high this is depicted in fig 3 as the future situation 3 approach peak attenuation was quantified using 2d hydraulic waqua models waqua is used for two dimensional hydro dynamic and water quality simulation of well mixed estuaries coastal seas and rivers it solves the shallow water equations and can deal with rectilinear and curvilinear grids technical details can be found in 15 simulations were carried out for five peak discharges varying from about 3200 m3 s 1 100 probability of occurrence to almost 4400 m3 s 1 10 000 probability also three different flood wave shapes were used 1 an average shape or duration that also is used in the netherlands for the design of embankments 2 a steep wave with a short duration and 3 a flat flood wave with a long duration see fig 4 the wave shapes were derived from hegnauer et al 16 to isolate the effect of peak attenuation simulations were made without lateral inflow from smaller local rivers although lateral inflows are relatively small there could be an effect on computed peak discharges when peak attenuation alters the travel time of the flood wave and hence the probability that flood peaks in the meuse and the tributaries coincide the impact of measures and interventions was assessed using waqua models that represent the past present and future situation the waqua model beno17 5 v1 17 describes the current situation fig 3 it also formed the basis for the future situation for the future situation the embankments in the southern part of the meuse were raised in the waqua model to account for dike strengthening that will take place in the coming decades this is in line with the updated flood protection standards which must be met before 2050 the higher embankments will result in loss of room for the river to minimise this loss rijkswaterstaat proposed to relocate embankments at 7 locations before strengthening them also 5 detention areas are proposed these 12 measures and 2 other room for the river projects that will be carried out in the coming years were added to the waqua model to represent the future situation the room for the river measures consist of making openings in the foundation of a road that crosses the river upstream of cuijk and floodplain excavation upstream of den bosch the waqua model j93 5 was used to analyse peak attenuation in the past situation this model does not contain embankments in the southern part of the meuse room for the river measures and other changes in the river that have taken place since 1995 are absent in this model as well 4 peak attenuation in the current situation the amount of peak attenuation strongly depends on the peak discharge fig 5 shows the peak attenuation that was computed with the waqua model for the current situation and for the average wave shape in the downstream river reaches the decrease in peak discharge varies between 450 m3 s and 650 m3 s fig 5a the sudden drops in peak discharge indicate where most peak attenuation occurs upstream of the large lakes km 3 to 60 peak attenuation is limited this mainly is due to the relatively steep slope of the riverbed as peak attenuation is limited the water level reduction is small fig 5b the lakes near the city of roermond km 60 80 contribute strongly to the peak attenuation the exact location however changes with the discharge peak at very high discharge about 4400 m3 s peak attenuation mainly takes place in the upstream part of the lake area km 60 70 this is caused by overtopping of embankments in this area at lower discharges most of the peak attenuation takes place in the downstream part of the lake area km 70 80 this is caused by inflow of a detention area called lateraalkanaal west lkw downstream of roermond km 80 160 peak attenuation mainly occurs at very high discharges this is caused by overtopping of the embankments that protect the villages the decrease in peak discharge at km160 is caused by storage of water in the polder lob van gennep little peak attenuation occurs at the downstream part of the meuse downstream of km 160 this probably is related to the large water depths the relatively narrow floodplains and the lack of storage areas however because of the peak attenuation in upstream reaches water levels are lowered by 40 to 60 cm peak attenuation depends on the peak discharge fig 5 but even more so on the shape or duration of the discharge wave fig 6 indicates that peak attenuation is limited for flat flood waves with a long duration floods with a short duration steep shape however can result in much more peak attenuation than floods with an average shape or duration for a peak discharge of about 4400 m3 s peak attenuation can vary from 200 m3 s when the flood duration is long flat wave shape to 1200 m3 s when the flood has a short duration steep wave shape for a flood with an average shape and duration it takes about 80 h to travel from eijsden km 3 to keizersveer km 247 peak discharge seems to have a minor effect on the travel time fig 5c however the shape or duration of the flood has a major effect on the travel time a steep flood wave short duration moves relatively slowly whereas a flat wave long duration moves relatively fast for the wave shapes that were used in this study travel times were 30 h more for the steep flood wave short duration than for the flat flood wave long duration fig 6b it is important to notice that the exact locations that contribute to peak attenuation vary per flood depending on the peak discharge and flood duration different areas appear to be important this is also shown in fig 7 it also is important to notice that only looking at the peak discharges may underestimate the indirect contribution of river reaches to peak attenuation if overtopping of an embankment starts during an earlier stage of the flood wave the storage capacity may be insufficient and no water will be stored during the passage of the flood peak instead it will only reduce discharges during part of the rising stage of the flood resulting in a steeper top of the flood wave however this steeper flood peak will allow more peak attenuation to happen further downstream this is made clear in fig 8 which shows the downstream change in wave shape for a very steep wave with a discharge of 3862 m3 s at the red circles overtopping of embankments has caused a lower discharge on the rising part of the flood wave but only further downstream this will result in peak attenuation this phenomenon also is the reason why detention areas are often considered unreliable when the inflow of water into the detention area starts too early it will be full before the peak discharge arrives hence it will not be able to lower the discharge peak but will only reduce the discharge during the rising limb of the flood hydrograph this does not mean that the detention area has no effect at all as the narrower peak of the flood will be more susceptible to peak attenuation it may still reduce the discharge peak further downstream in this case the positive effect of storage is not noticeable at the location of the detention area but only further downstream 5 the impact of measures on peak attenuation the impact of measures and changes in the river system on peak attenuation was studied with the models that represent the past present and the future situation fig 9 shows the peak attenuation that was computed for floods with different peak discharges and an average shape for the 3 situations the present situation results in more peak attenuation along the southern part of the meuse i e between roermond and cuijk this is partly caused by the room for the river measures that were carried out after 1995 and that resulted in a small increase in river floodplain however as the increase in peak

not be overtopped this results in a significant decrease in peak attenuation along the southern part of the river meuse upstream of cuijk km 160 6 conclusions peak attenuation can have a large effect

20109,forests are under pressure globally how deforestation affects river flow is essential for water security in many regions here we conduct a meta analysis of studies investigating this question in large basins of south america and show that different modeling approaches lead to opposite conclusions about deforestation effects on river flow a widely used approach has been to use surface models while assuming that deforestation occurs only within the basin and does not affect precipitation alternative approaches consider that deforestation affects precipitation and is not necessarily bounded by the catchment area while surface models generally indicate that deforestation will increase river flow in south american large basins including deforestation effects on precipitation leads in most cases to the opposite conclusion keywords water security model assessment moisture recycling forest river discharge 1 introduction forests are under increasing pressure globally 31 around 2 3 million km2 of forest were lost from 2000 to 2012 25 these changes have been particularly pronounced in the tropical forests of the amazon basin where population growth and mounting socio economic pressure have caused extensive deforestation in recent decades 38 36 furthermore there is an ongoing risk of forest loss exacerbation due to intensified wildfires 9 42 droughts 37 54 and agricultural expansion 47 24 among the environmental consequences of amazon deforestation are the impacts on water availability in river basins of south america that arise from deforestation effects on the continental water budget including effects on precipitation 53 evapotranspiration 61 15 infiltration 10 46 and river flow 11 34 49 previous studies indicate that large scale deforestation in the amazon generally leads to reduced precipitation in vast areas of the continent reduced evapotranspiration over deforested areas and increased river flow in some basins 14 53 34 notwithstanding these results cannot be generalized as the expected response of all continent s basins to deforestation for example in contrast to the more general pattern precipitation may increase in some basins after regional deforestation due to intensified convection over small clearings 14 30 or changes in atmospheric moisture transport 7 48 an essential question for water management and governance and water security assessments is whether river flow will increase or decrease due to deforestation effects on a basin water budget due to these effects complex and dynamic nature the answer to this question for any given basin and future deforestation scenario is not straightforward which has motivated many basin specific studies reviews e g 14 69 indicate that these studies results depend not only on each case s particularities but also on the employed methods and underlying assumptions which we will refer to as the studies approach for instance in a global review of studies about the impacts of forest cover change on river flow zhang et al 69 highlighted that conclusions about annual river flow response to deforestation depend on spatial scales climate forest type and hydrological regime this review included studies that use multiple observational based approaches such as paired watershed experiments and elasticity analyses and a modeling approach based on hydrological models at the basin scale as we will discuss below other modeling approaches need to be considered in the amazon after reviewing a set of observational and modeling studies d almeida et al 14 concluded that the effects of deforestation on the hydrological cycle including but not limited to runoff and river flow depend on the scale and resolution of the studies and highlighted the consideration of deforestation effects on precipitation as an important challenge for future research later levy et al 34 conducted an empirical analysis of river flow changes caused by deforestation and agricultural development in basins across the arc of deforestation in brazil and concluded that river flow has increased due to deforestation in this region more recently heerspink et al 26 studied long term changes in river flow across the amazon and highlighted the importance of considering land atmosphere interactions and changes to the whole water budget including atmospheric surface and groundwater storage collectively these and similar studies confirm our premise that the question s answer is not straightforward and depends substantially on the studies approach ellison et al 18 proposed to divide answers into two ways of thinking the first is the view that deforestation leads to increased river flow in a basin mainly due to decreasing evapotranspiration losses which the authors describe as the demand side thinking the second view which the authors describe as the supply side thinking does not consider evapotranspiration as a loss of water in a basin but as a source of atmospheric water that may contribute to precipitation elsewhere including areas within the same basin therefore evapotranspiration reduction after deforestation does not necessarily result in increased river flow but may cause the opposite effect through precipitation changes e g 63 these relationships are critical in south america because this continent receives some of the highest amounts of recycled precipitation from terrestrial sources on earth 60 not every study s approach considers deforestation effects on precipitation using two different modeling approaches coe et al 11 showed that conclusions about mean river flow change due to deforestation in some amazonian basins could be significantly different or even opposite depending on whether or not these approaches include such effects nevertheless neglecting deforestation effects on precipitation e g in future deforestation scenarios continues to be a standard and widely used technique for assessing deforestation impacts on river flow in modeling studies here we conduct a meta analysis to investigate whether and how different modeling approaches affect conclusions about deforestation effects on river flow in large basins of south america we are especially interested in comparing modeling studies that include or exclude a representation of deforestation effects on precipitation in contrast to previous studies by d almeida et al 14 levy et al 34 and heerspink et al 26 the present study s focus is on modeling river flow in large basins under deforestation scenarios this is not equivalent to analyzing runoff from climate models over areas that are not basins e g patches or clearings such as in d almeida et al 14 further d almeida et al 14 do not include hydrological models in their analysis which even today is the most common practice to investigate how deforestation affects river flow also our focus on modeling deforestation scenarios that may be future scenarios is different from analyzing past observations e g 34 26 although these observations include actual deforestation impacts on river flow these impacts are not isolated from any other actual influence on river flow and do not represent future non observed deforestation scenarios the possibility of quantifying future impacts of deforestation on river flow relies largely on model simulations 2 data we traced peer reviewed journals tagged in q1 or q2 ranking of the scimago journal ranking sjr for hydrology related fields published between 2008 and 2020 we also included two studies published in peer reviewed journals not ranked in sjr but having more than ten citations in scopus our choice of time narrows down the influence of modeling evolution and complements the meta analysis by d almeida et al 14 we identified 119 model simulations presented in 15 papers that studied the hydrological impacts of deforestation in large basins of south america fig 1 and table 1 and allowed us to obtain percentage changes in precipitation and river flow at basin scale due to deforestation at basin to regional scale the temporal scale of simulations in scope was several years to decades while the spatial scale of interest was 1000 km2 we focused on large basins because they can have powerful internal mechanisms of precipitation recycling e g the amazon basin 19 8 or depend strongly on moisture recycling from terrestrial sources e g la plata river basin 39 appendix 1 shows details of the reviewed studies 3 developing a conceptual framework for comparing modeling approaches the models listed in table 1 include hydrological models hms such as swat 3 and vic 21 and land surface models lsms such as ibis 20 one of the primary differences between hms and lsms is the more physical basis of lsms including water and energy balances compared to the more empirical water budget approaches included in most hms while lsms focus on describing the vertical exchange of heat and water by solving the surface energy and water balance hms concentrate on solving the water balance equation and simulating basin outlet river flow 70 6 by construction both hms and lsms represent the surface water budget within a domain that includes the land and excludes the atmosphere fig 2 a thus these models treat precipitation as an input variable and hence have the inherent assumption that it is not affected by surface processes e g due to deforestation during a simulation for instance a common practice is to use observed precipitation as input for simulating future deforestation scenarios implying the assumption that this observed precipitation will not change after future deforestation e g 1 17 coupling hms or lsms with atmospheric models can overcome this limitation which requires expanding the coupled model domain into the atmosphere fig 2b and allows simulating deforestation effects on precipitation the water balance equation for the model domain shown in fig 2a here written in a convenient form 1 q t p t e t d s l t dt means that river flow q t depends on the difference between input flux of precipitation p t and output flux of evapotranspiration e t as well as on temporal variations in terrestrial water storage dsl t dt within the control volume at the basin scale infiltration is considered here as a flux within the land domain fig 2a and hence does not appear in equation 1 because q t at the large basin outlet includes water that is infiltrated upstream and returns to river channels downstream depending on models capabilities this process is partially resolved or disregarded under the assumption that infiltration leaves the model domain towards deep groundwater layers and never returns to rivers regardless of how models treat infiltration and groundwater in an actual basin especially a large basin q t at its outlet results from surface and subsurface flows through which river flow infiltration and groundwater interact when integrated over a long time t dsl t dt asymptotically approaches zero and equation 1 leads to 2 q p e where q p and e represent average values over time of q t p t and e t respectively hence a change in river flow δq can be attributed to a difference between changes in precipitation δp and evapotranspiration δe that is 3 δ q δ p δ e under the assumptions that deforestation reduces e without altering p and that variations in water storage over the period do not compensate for the resulting difference between p and e deforestation increases q by decreasing e this rationale is a fundamental assertion behind the demand side thinking 18 and a conclusion that is common to many modeling studies deforestation in a basin leads to increased river flow mainly by decreasing evapotranspiration e g 51 45 32 if the model domain includes the atmosphere precipitation is not an external input variable but an internal flow within the land atmosphere domain fig 2b not independent of land changes e g deforestation models including a representation of deforestation effects on precipitation allow for a precipitation mediated land atmosphere feedback the atmosphere affects the land through precipitation and the land affects the atmosphere through its effects on precipitation generally this is the land atmosphere feedback we will refer to henceforth in reality these effects on precipitation can occur via evapotranspiration that affects moisture recycling 63 58 or other processes such as variation of atmospheric stability 62 and production of cloud condensation nuclei 2 another factor that many studies disregard in the analysis is deforestation location relative to the basin boundary if models represent the effects of deforestation on precipitation then the river flow in a basin can be affected by deforestation within and outside its catchment area indeed the trans basin effect of deforestation can be even stronger than the within basin effect 63 however in many studies the basin of interest determines the lateral boundary of the modeling domain this is an implicit assumption of most hms and deforestation beyond this boundary is not considered based on the previous considerations we introduce four categories to classify modeling approaches depending on their domain and underlying assumptions whether explicit or implicit about the effects and location of deforestation table 2 in the first approach w f models incorporate the assumptions that precipitation is entirely independent of deforestation precipitation does not change between scenarios implying that evapotranspiration leaves the basin into the atmosphere and does not return these are standard assumptions of hms and lsms in which the atmosphere is not part of the model domain fig 2a and treat precipitation as an external input flux that remains invariant between deforestation scenarios another assumption of this approach is that river flow is not affected by deforestation outside the basin in summary simulations using this approach consider that deforestation occurs only within w the basin and neglect any land atmosphere feedback f or subtracted feedback linking deforestation and precipitation in the remaining categories land atmosphere coupled models fig 2b e g 11 or modeling assumptions e g an assumed change in e or p after deforestation based on previous studies e g 66 allow the representation of deforestation effects on precipitation we represent this in table 2 as f added feedback under these approaches the basin s evapotranspiration does not necessarily mean a loss of water for river flow and river flow can be affected by deforestation occurring within and outside the catchment area three modeling approaches of this type are distinguished depending on whether the simulated scenarios represent deforestation within w or outside o the basin or both wo table 2 4 contrasting simulated results from different modeling approaches in this section we use published data of δp and δq appendix 1 to examine the relationship between modeling approaches and conclusions about deforestation impacts on river flow fig 3 shows changes in river flow δq and precipitation δp due to deforestation as simulated in the reviewed studies grouped into the categories presented in table 2 results from wang erlandsson 2018 are presented independently see stars in fig 3e h because unlike other studies these are the only ones coming from global land use land cover change scenarios which for south america mainly represent deforestation we decided to include this study because it is very relevant to our discussion however we also verified that including or excluding it does not change the sense of results presented in fig 3 or our conclusions changes in river flow are always positive for the approaches assuming that deforestation occurs only within the basin w f and w f averaging 9 2 and 44 7 respectively fig 3e these river flow increases are linked to a null δp 0 or slightly negative average δp is 1 6 change in precipitation in the w f and w f approaches respectively fig 3g in contrast changes in river flow are almost always negative when considering deforestation outside the basin average reductions are 3 7 and 28 9 for the wo f and o f approaches respectively fig 3e f these river flow reductions are related to mostly negative changes in precipitation fig 3g averaging 10 4 and 11 7 for the wo f and o f approaches respectively despite considering a variety of basins and models results from the w f approach converge to the conclusion that river flow increases after deforestation agreeing with the demand side thinking 18 as a consequence of using the same precipitation input for simulating different deforestation scenarios this approach prescribes precipitation change as a result of deforestation to be zero fig 3g therefore the simulated river flow increases can be attributed to evapotranspiration reductions usually linked to a smaller accumulated area of vegetation leaves in non forested landscapes relative to forested landscapes e g 61 or depending on each model s capabilities related to alterations in properties such as plant rooting depth e g 11 32 and soil hydraulic properties e g 11 35 although the w f approach does not prescribe evapotranspiration reduction with increasing deforestation none of the reviewed studies show the opposite result based on eqs 1 3 fig 4 shows a schematic summary of these and other possible changes in the long term water balance due to deforestation the w f and w f approaches lead to the same conclusion deforestation results in increased river flow fig 3e f but for different reasons fig 4 the inclusion of feedback in the w f approach allows precipitation change due to deforestation fig 3g in the simulations using this approach deforestation reduces precipitation and evapotranspiration and river flow increases because the latter s reduction has a greater magnitude than the former blue box in fig 4 therefore river flow increase results from the condition that δe δp 0 the six simulations using the w f approach found this same result 55 66 in principle the opposite result is also possible δp δe 0 and hence δq 0 but the reviewed studies do not report it notably the only approach leading to contrasting results is wo f under this approach river flow increases or decreases due to deforestation fig 3 in all simulations using this approach deforestation causes precipitation and evapotranspiration reductions and river flow increases or decreases depending on the more significant reduction green boxes in fig 4 all the simulations using the o f approach lead to the same conclusion river flow decreases due to deforestation because of precipitation reductions that are not compensated by changes in evapotranspiration fig 4 in contrast to the w f approach all the cases that consider feedback f in table 2 show that precipitation over the basin decreases with deforestation in the reviewed studies the left side of fig 4 where δp 0 is found only under the assumption that precipitation does not vary with deforestation δp 0 which is inherent to the w f approach 5 implications for future studies 5 1 the need to consider the effects of trans basin deforestation on precipitation and river flow although w f is the most common approach table 2 it may be misleading for investigating future impacts of deforestation on river flow in large basins of south america and similar regions two core assumptions of this approach are that first precipitation will not change due to deforestation e g δp 0 for w f in fig 3g second deforestation will be bounded by the catchment area of the study basin these assumptions are questionable especially for continental regions where precipitation has a double way relationship with surface hydrological processes and widespread forests a growing body of literature showing that precipitation does not only affect but is also affected by the presence and state of forests especially in the amazon and neighboring continental areas 4 53 56 63 66 41 challenges the first assumption high fractions of precipitation in different regions of south america originate in the amazon as evapotranspiration 19 60 which allows the occurrence of cascading phenomena 68 and atmospheric moisture transport patterns that depend on moisture recycling 54 66 41 and exert strong effects on river flow regimes 49 evapotranspiration changes after deforestation have a strong potential to alter precipitation through trans basin effects worldwide 63 overall anthropogenic changes to terrestrial moisture recycling which are receiving growing attention as a critical alteration of the global water cycle 22 23 64 65 58 imply that a potentially large fraction of precipitation i e recycled precipitation can be significantly altered by evapotranspiration changes due to deforestation or other land use land cover changes e g 63 collectively these and other phenomena establish physical links between basins and deforested areas that extend beyond their catchment areas the fact that the boundaries of deforested areas and river basins barely and rarely coincide e g fig 1 challenges the second assumption deforestation is governed by multiple socioeconomic factors related to for instance road construction mining agriculture expansion illegal cropping the establishment of protected areas and even peace agreements such as in colombia 52 50 24 a basin boundary does not naturally limit any of these factors thus the fact that all studies using the w f approach incorporate this assumption seems to be more related to a limitation of the modeling approach than to a parsimonious representation of reality by incorporating feedback f the w f wo f and o f approaches point to overcoming the said limitations of w f further the need to include deforestation effects on precipitation is consistent with several concepts and phenomena under study in recent years the precipitationshed concept 27 highlights the difference between the boundary of a basin producing river flow and the boundary of the region where precipitation originates while the former depends on topography the latter depends on atmospheric dynamics and generally expands over several basins or even continents e g 27 63 66 indeed moisture from evapotranspiration can travel up to thousands of kilometers through the atmosphere before precipitating 30 59 these dynamics may lead to the formation of aerial rivers e g 66 and play a critical role in the distribution of atmospheric moisture and precipitation across the planet and continents and between river basins 68 54 66 41 58 as well as in the regulation of river flow regimes 49 a common implication of these concepts and phenomena is that precipitation over a basin and hence river flow are not independent of deforestation both within and beyond the catchment area 5 2 management and governance how to consider the links between hydrological processes within a basin and deforestation beyond its catchment area is an emerging challenge for water management and governance with important implications for transboundary water security and forest conservation and restoration 28 29 67 57 the focus of many water management and governance strategies has been traditionally on the basins area 13 5 29 the precipitationshed atmospheric watershed concept challenges this focus because it establishes physical relationships between basins and countries water budgets that need to be considered in new management and governance strategies 29 57 towards this goal keys et al 29 propose a typology of moisture recycling exchanges among countries and depending on such relationships a series of principles for enabling moisture recycling governance the present analysis provides additional evidence highlighting the need to consider trans basin deforestation and the anthropogenic effects to moisture recycling in assessing future deforestation or more generally land use land cover change impacts on river flow which cannot be accomplished through the still widely used w f approach there is a need to implement the wo f and o f approaches for informing these new management and governance strategies 5 3 limitations and future directions although it is common to all the reviewed studies that consider land atmosphere domains fig 3g the result that deforestation outside a basin causes precipitation reduction within the basin is not generalizable a precipitation increase over a basin resulting from deforestation beyond its boundary is also possible e g 7 48 however the prevalence of these precipitation reductions among the reviewed studies suggests that in a continent like south america trans basin deforestation can in many cases reduce the river flow of large basins through effects on precipitation our meta analysis has two main limitations first we focused on large basins 1000 km2 of south america and second there is a limited number 15 of studies complying with our selection criteria nevertheless this number is comparable with the number of modeling studies in previous meta analysis e g by lawrence and vandecar 30 and d almeida et al 14 and includes more simulations e g 119 in our case compared with 20 in d almeida et al 14 a consequence of these limitations is that our findings cannot be generalized globally not for every model or scale however an interesting feature of our framework is that it is based on the control volume definition and the resulting water balance equation rather than on models parameterizations resolution or other details that can vary greatly among models and simulations for instance different models can use different parameterizations to estimate evapotranspiration which has inherent limitations however they must satisfy the water balance equation for the selected control volume future studies may use our framework to explore whether and how our findings change for different regions and with the spatial scale furthermore since models are continuously evolving our results provide a basis for future comparisons between modeling studies 6 concluding remarks we developed a conceptual framework to classify different modeling approaches that have been used in previous studies to investigate deforestation impacts on river flow there are two main differences between these approaches the first is whether they consider deforestation effects on precipitation and the second is whether they involve deforestation within or outside the catchment area based on these differences four modeling approaches are distinguished table 2 this classification is widely applicable to other case studies conclusions about the effect of deforestation on river flow in large basins of south america depend on the modeling approach there are two clear cut patterns first under the assumptions that deforestation occurs only within the catchment area and it does not affect precipitation w f approach models either hms or lsms generally indicate that river flow will increase after deforestation second under the assumptions that deforestation is not necessarily limited by the catchment area and it affects precipitation modeling approaches that consider deforestation effects on precipitation lead in most cases to the opposite conclusion deforestation causes reduction of river flow the study of river flow response to deforestation in large basins of south america and arguably in similar contexts requires considering how deforestation affects precipitation including trans basin deforestation given the identified relationship between modeling approaches and conclusions about river flow response to deforestation using a modeling approach that neglects these effects

20109,forests are under pressure globally how deforestation affects river flow is essential for water security in many regions here we conduct a meta analysis of studies investigating this question in large basins of south america and show that different modeling approaches lead to opposite conclusions about deforestation effects on river flow a widely used approach has been to use surface models while assuming that deforestation occurs only within the basin and does not affect precipitation alternative approaches consider that deforestation affects precipitation and is not necessarily bounded by the catchment area while surface models generally indicate that deforestation will increase river flow in south american large basins including deforestation effects on precipitation leads in most cases to the opposite conclusion keywords water security model assessment moisture recycling forest river discharge 1 introduction forests are under increasing pressure globally 31 around 2 3 million km2 of forest were lost from 2000 to 2012 25 these changes have been particularly pronounced in the tropical forests of the amazon basin where population growth and mounting socio economic pressure have caused extensive deforestation in recent decades 38 36 furthermore there is an ongoing risk of forest loss exacerbation due to intensified wildfires 9 42 droughts 37 54 and agricultural expansion 47 24 among the environmental consequences of amazon deforestation are the impacts on water availability in river basins of south america that arise from deforestation effects on the continental water budget including effects on precipitation 53 evapotranspiration 61 15 infiltration 10 46 and river flow 11 34 49 previous studies indicate that large scale deforestation in the amazon generally leads to reduced precipitation in vast areas of the continent reduced evapotranspiration over deforested areas and increased river flow in some basins 14 53 34 notwithstanding these results cannot be generalized as the expected response of all continent s basins to deforestation for example in contrast to the more general pattern precipitation may increase in some basins after regional deforestation due to intensified convection over small clearings 14 30 or changes in atmospheric moisture transport 7 48 an essential question for water management and governance and water security assessments is whether river flow will increase or decrease due to deforestation effects on a basin water budget due to these effects complex and dynamic nature the answer to this question for any given basin and future deforestation scenario is not straightforward which has motivated many basin specific studies reviews e g 14 69 indicate that these studies results depend not only on each case s particularities but also on the employed methods and underlying assumptions which we will refer to as the studies approach for instance in a global review of studies about the impacts of forest cover change on river flow zhang et al 69 highlighted that conclusions about annual river flow response to deforestation depend on spatial scales climate forest type and hydrological regime this review included studies that use multiple observational based approaches such as paired watershed experiments and elasticity analyses and a modeling approach based on hydrological models at the basin scale as we will discuss below other modeling approaches need to be considered in the amazon after reviewing a set of observational and modeling studies d almeida et al 14 concluded that the effects of deforestation on the hydrological cycle including but not limited to runoff and river flow depend on the scale and resolution of the studies and highlighted the consideration of deforestation effects on precipitation as an important challenge for future research later levy et al 34 conducted an empirical analysis of river flow changes caused by deforestation and agricultural development in basins across the arc of deforestation in brazil and concluded that river flow has increased due to deforestation in this region more recently heerspink et al 26 studied long term changes in river flow across the amazon and highlighted the importance of considering land atmosphere interactions and changes to the whole water budget including atmospheric surface and groundwater storage collectively these and similar studies confirm our premise that the question s answer is not straightforward and depends substantially on the studies approach ellison et al 18 proposed to divide answers into two ways of thinking the first is the view that deforestation leads to increased river flow in a basin mainly due to decreasing evapotranspiration losses which the authors describe as the demand side thinking the second view which the authors describe as the supply side thinking does not consider evapotranspiration as a loss of water in a basin but as a source of atmospheric water that may contribute to precipitation elsewhere including areas within the same basin therefore evapotranspiration reduction after deforestation does not necessarily result in increased river flow but may cause the opposite effect through precipitation changes e g 63 these relationships are critical in south america because this continent receives some of the highest amounts of recycled precipitation from terrestrial sources on earth 60 not every study s approach considers deforestation effects on precipitation using two different modeling approaches coe et al 11 showed that conclusions about mean river flow change due to deforestation in some amazonian basins could be significantly different or even opposite depending on whether or not these approaches include such effects nevertheless neglecting deforestation effects on precipitation e g in future deforestation scenarios continues to be a standard and widely used technique for assessing deforestation impacts on river flow in modeling studies here we conduct a meta analysis to investigate whether and how different modeling approaches affect conclusions about deforestation effects on river flow in large basins of south america we are especially interested in comparing modeling studies that include or exclude a representation of deforestation effects on precipitation in contrast to previous studies by d almeida et al 14 levy et al 34 and heerspink et al 26 the present study s focus is on modeling river flow in large basins under deforestation scenarios this is not equivalent to analyzing runoff from climate models over areas that are not basins e g patches or clearings such as in d almeida et al 14 further d almeida et al 14 do not include hydrological models in their analysis which even today is the most common practice to investigate how deforestation affects river flow also our focus on modeling deforestation scenarios that may be future scenarios is different from analyzing past observations e g 34 26 although these observations include actual deforestation impacts on river flow these impacts are not isolated from any other actual influence on river flow and do not represent future non observed deforestation scenarios the possibility of quantifying future impacts of deforestation on river flow relies largely on model simulations 2 data we traced peer reviewed journals tagged in q1 or q2 ranking of the scimago journal ranking sjr for hydrology related fields published between 2008 and 2020 we also included two studies published in peer reviewed journals not ranked in sjr but having more than ten citations in scopus our choice of time narrows down the influence of modeling evolution and complements the meta analysis by d almeida et al 14 we identified 119 model simulations presented in 15 papers that studied the hydrological impacts of deforestation in large basins of south america fig 1 and table 1 and allowed us to obtain percentage changes in precipitation and river flow at basin scale due to deforestation at basin to regional scale the temporal scale of simulations in scope was several years to decades while the spatial scale of interest was 1000 km2 we focused on large basins because they can have powerful internal mechanisms of precipitation recycling e g the amazon basin 19 8 or depend strongly on moisture recycling from terrestrial sources e g la plata river basin 39 appendix 1 shows details of the reviewed studies 3 developing a conceptual framework for comparing modeling approaches the models listed in table 1 include hydrological models hms such as swat 3 and vic 21 and land surface models lsms such as ibis 20 one of the primary differences between hms and lsms is the more physical basis of lsms including water and energy balances compared to the more empirical water budget approaches included in most hms while lsms focus on describing the vertical exchange of heat and water by solving the surface energy and water balance hms concentrate on solving the water balance equation and simulating basin outlet river flow 70 6 by construction both hms and lsms represent the surface water budget within a domain that includes the land and excludes the atmosphere fig 2 a thus these models treat precipitation as an input variable and hence have the inherent assumption that it is not affected by surface processes e g due to deforestation during a simulation for instance a common practice is to use observed precipitation as input for simulating future deforestation scenarios implying the assumption that this observed precipitation will not change after future deforestation e g 1 17 coupling hms or lsms with atmospheric models can overcome this limitation which requires expanding the coupled model domain into the atmosphere fig 2b and allows simulating deforestation effects on precipitation the water balance equation for the model domain shown in fig 2a here written in a convenient form 1 q t p t e t d s l t dt means that river flow q t depends on the difference between input flux of precipitation p t and output flux of evapotranspiration e t as well as on temporal variations in terrestrial water storage dsl t dt within the control volume at the basin scale infiltration is considered here as a flux within the land domain fig 2a and hence does not appear in equation 1 because q t at the large basin outlet includes water that is infiltrated upstream and returns to river channels downstream depending on models capabilities this process is partially resolved or disregarded under the assumption that infiltration leaves the model domain towards deep groundwater layers and never returns to rivers regardless of how models treat infiltration and groundwater in an actual basin especially a large basin q t at its outlet results from surface and subsurface flows through which river flow infiltration and groundwater interact when integrated over a long time t dsl t dt asymptotically approaches zero and equation 1 leads to 2 q p e where q p and e represent average values over time of q t p t and e t respectively hence a change in river flow δq can be attributed to a difference between changes in precipitation δp and evapotranspiration δe that is 3 δ q δ p δ e under the assumptions that deforestation reduces e without altering p and that variations in water storage over the period do not compensate for the resulting difference between p and e deforestation increases q by decreasing e this rationale is a fundamental assertion behind the demand side thinking 18 and a conclusion that is common to many modeling studies deforestation in a basin leads to increased river flow mainly by decreasing evapotranspiration e g 51 45 32 if the model domain includes the atmosphere precipitation is not an external input variable but an internal flow within the land atmosphere domain fig 2b not independent of land changes e g deforestation models including a representation of deforestation effects on precipitation allow for a precipitation mediated land atmosphere feedback the atmosphere affects the land through precipitation and the land affects the atmosphere through its effects on precipitation generally this is the land atmosphere feedback we will refer to henceforth in reality these effects on precipitation can occur via evapotranspiration that affects moisture recycling 63 58 or other processes such as variation of atmospheric stability 62 and production of cloud condensation nuclei 2 another factor that many studies disregard in the analysis is deforestation location relative to the basin boundary if models represent the effects of deforestation on precipitation then the river flow in a basin can be affected by deforestation within and outside its catchment area indeed the trans basin effect of deforestation can be even stronger than the within basin effect 63 however in many studies the basin of interest determines the lateral boundary of the modeling domain this is an implicit assumption of most hms and deforestation beyond this boundary is not considered based on the previous considerations we introduce four categories to classify modeling approaches depending on their domain and underlying assumptions whether explicit or implicit about the effects and location of deforestation table 2 in the first approach w f models incorporate the assumptions that precipitation is entirely independent of deforestation precipitation does not change between scenarios implying that evapotranspiration leaves the basin into the atmosphere and does not return these are standard assumptions of hms and lsms in which the atmosphere is not part of the model domain fig 2a and treat precipitation as an external input flux that remains invariant between deforestation scenarios another assumption of this approach is that river flow is not affected by deforestation outside the basin in summary simulations using this approach consider that deforestation occurs only within w the basin and neglect any land atmosphere feedback f or subtracted feedback linking deforestation and precipitation in the remaining categories land atmosphere coupled models fig 2b e g 11 or modeling assumptions e g an assumed change in e or p after deforestation based on previous studies e g 66 allow the representation of deforestation effects on precipitation we represent this in table 2 as f added feedback under these approaches the basin s evapotranspiration does not necessarily mean a loss of water for river flow and river flow can be affected by deforestation occurring within and outside the catchment area three modeling approaches of this type are distinguished depending on whether the simulated scenarios represent deforestation within w or outside o the basin or both wo table 2 4 contrasting simulated results from different modeling approaches in this section we use published data of δp and δq appendix 1 to examine the relationship between modeling approaches and conclusions about deforestation impacts on river flow fig 3 shows changes in river flow δq and precipitation δp due to deforestation as simulated in the reviewed studies grouped into the categories presented in table 2 results from wang erlandsson 2018 are presented independently see stars in fig 3e h because unlike other studies these are the only ones coming from global land use land cover change scenarios which for south america mainly represent deforestation we decided to include this study because it is very relevant to our discussion however we also verified that including or excluding it does not change the sense of results presented in fig 3 or our conclusions changes in river flow are always positive for the approaches assuming that deforestation occurs only within the basin w f and w f averaging 9 2 and 44 7 respectively fig 3e these river flow increases are linked to a null δp 0 or slightly negative average δp is 1 6 change in precipitation in the w f and w f approaches respectively fig 3g in contrast changes in river flow are almost always negative when considering deforestation outside the basin average reductions are 3 7 and 28 9 for the wo f and o f approaches respectively fig 3e f these river flow reductions are related to mostly negative changes in precipitation fig 3g averaging 10 4 and 11 7 for the wo f and o f approaches respectively despite considering a variety of basins and models results from the w f approach converge to the conclusion that river flow increases after deforestation agreeing with the demand side thinking 18 as a consequence of using the same precipitation input for simulating different deforestation scenarios this approach prescribes precipitation change as a result of deforestation to be zero fig 3g therefore the simulated river flow increases can be attributed to evapotranspiration reductions usually linked to a smaller accumulated area of vegetation leaves in non forested landscapes relative to forested landscapes e g 61 or depending on each model s capabilities related to alterations in properties such as plant rooting depth e g 11 32 and soil hydraulic properties e g 11 35 although the w f approach does not prescribe evapotranspiration reduction with increasing deforestation none of the reviewed studies show the opposite result based on eqs 1 3 fig 4 shows a schematic summary of these and other possible changes in the long term water balance due to deforestation the w f and w f approaches lead to the same conclusion deforestation results in increased river flow fig 3e f but for different reasons fig 4 the inclusion of feedback in the w f approach allows precipitation change due to deforestation fig 3g in the simulations using this approach deforestation reduces precipitation and evapotranspiration and river flow increases because the latter s reduction has a greater magnitude than the former blue box in fig 4 therefore river flow increase results from the condition that δe δp 0 the six simulations using the w f approach found this same result 55 66 in principle the opposite result is also possible δp δe 0 and hence δq 0 but the reviewed studies do not report it notably the only approach leading to contrasting results is wo f under this approach river flow increases or decreases due to deforestation fig 3 in all simulations using this approach deforestation causes precipitation and evapotranspiration reductions and river flow increases or decreases depending on the more significant reduction green boxes in fig 4 all the simulations using the o f approach lead to the same conclusion river flow decreases due to deforestation because of precipitation reductions that are not compensated by changes in evapotranspiration fig 4 in contrast to the w f approach all the cases that consider feedback f in table 2 show that precipitation over the basin decreases with deforestation in the reviewed studies the left side of fig 4 where δp 0 is found only under the assumption that precipitation does not vary with deforestation δp 0 which is inherent to the w f approach 5 implications for future studies 5 1 the need to consider the effects of trans basin deforestation on precipitation and river flow although w f is the most common approach table 2 it may be misleading for investigating future impacts of deforestation on river flow in large basins of south america and similar regions two core assumptions of this approach are that first precipitation will not change due to deforestation e g δp 0 for w f in fig 3g second deforestation will be bounded by the catchment area of the study basin these assumptions are questionable especially for continental regions where precipitation has a double way relationship with surface hydrological processes and widespread forests a growing body of literature showing that precipitation does not only affect but is also affected by the presence and state of forests especially in the amazon and neighboring continental areas 4 53 56 63 66 41 challenges the first assumption high fractions of precipitation in different regions of south america originate in the amazon as evapotranspiration 19 60 which allows the occurrence of cascading phenomena 68 and atmospheric moisture transport patterns that depend on moisture recycling 54 66 41 and exert strong effects on river flow regimes 49 evapotranspiration changes after deforestation have a strong potential to alter precipitation through trans basin effects worldwide 63 overall anthropogenic changes to terrestrial moisture recycling which are receiving growing attention as a critical alteration of the global water cycle 22 23 64 65 58 imply that a potentially large fraction of precipitation i e recycled precipitation can be significantly altered by evapotranspiration changes due to deforestation or other land use land cover changes e g 63 collectively these and other phenomena establish physical links between basins and deforested areas that extend beyond their catchment areas the fact that the boundaries of deforested areas and river basins barely and rarely coincide e g fig 1 challenges the second assumption deforestation is governed by multiple socioeconomic factors related to for instance road construction mining agriculture expansion illegal cropping the establishment of protected areas and even peace agreements such as in colombia 52 50 24 a basin boundary does not naturally limit any of these factors thus the fact that all studies using the w f approach incorporate this assumption seems to be more related to a limitation of the modeling approach than to a parsimonious representation of reality by incorporating feedback f the w f wo f and o f approaches point to overcoming the said limitations of w f further the need to include deforestation effects on precipitation is consistent with several concepts and phenomena under study in recent years the precipitationshed concept 27 highlights the difference between the boundary of a basin producing river flow and the boundary of the region where precipitation originates while the former depends on topography the latter depends on atmospheric dynamics and generally expands over several basins or even continents e g 27 63 66 indeed moisture from evapotranspiration can travel up to thousands of kilometers through the atmosphere before precipitating 30 59 these dynamics may lead to the formation of aerial rivers e g 66 and play a critical role in the distribution of atmospheric moisture and precipitation across the planet and continents and between river basins 68 54 66 41 58 as well as in the regulation of river flow regimes 49 a common implication of these concepts and phenomena is that precipitation over a basin and hence river flow are not independent of deforestation both within and beyond the catchment area 5 2 management and governance how to consider the links between hydrological processes within a basin and deforestation beyond its catchment area is an emerging challenge for water management and governance with important implications for transboundary water security and forest conservation and restoration 28 29 67 57 the focus of many water management and governance strategies has been traditionally on the basins area 13 5 29 the precipitationshed atmospheric watershed concept challenges this focus because it establishes physical relationships between basins and countries water budgets that need to be considered in new management and governance strategies 29 57 towards this goal keys et al 29 propose a typology of moisture recycling exchanges among countries and depending on such relationships a series of principles for enabling moisture recycling governance the present analysis provides additional evidence highlighting the need to consider trans basin deforestation and the anthropogenic effects to moisture recycling in assessing future deforestation or more generally land use land cover change impacts on river flow which cannot be accomplished through the still widely used w f approach there is a need to implement the wo f and o f approaches for informing these new management and governance strategies 5 3 limitations and future directions although it is common to all the reviewed studies that consider land atmosphere domains fig 3g the result that deforestation outside a basin causes precipitation reduction within the basin is not generalizable a precipitation increase over a basin resulting from deforestation beyond its boundary is also possible e g 7 48 however the prevalence of these precipitation reductions among the reviewed studies suggests that in a continent like south america trans basin deforestation can in many cases reduce the river flow of large basins through effects on precipitation our meta analysis has two main limitations first we focused on large basins 1000 km2 of south america and second there is a limited number 15 of studies complying with our selection criteria nevertheless this number is comparable with the number of modeling studies in previous meta analysis e g by lawrence and vandecar 30 and d almeida et al 14 and includes more simulations e g 119 in our case compared with 20 in d almeida et al 14 a consequence of these limitations is that our findings cannot be generalized globally not for every model or scale however an interesting feature of our framework is that it is based on the control volume definition and the resulting water balance equation rather than on models parameterizations resolution or other details that can vary greatly among models and simulations for instance different models can use different parameterizations to estimate evapotranspiration which has inherent limitations however they must satisfy the water balance equation for the selected control volume future studies may use our framework to explore whether and how our findings change for different regions and with the spatial scale furthermore since models are continuously evolving our results provide a basis for future comparisons between modeling studies 6 concluding remarks we developed a conceptual framework to classify different modeling approaches that have been used in previous studies to investigate deforestation impacts on river flow there are two main differences between these approaches the first is whether they consider deforestation effects on precipitation and the second is whether they involve deforestation within or outside the catchment area based on these differences four modeling approaches are distinguished table 2 this classification is widely applicable to other case studies conclusions about the effect of deforestation on river flow in large basins of south america depend on the modeling approach there are two clear cut patterns first under the assumptions that deforestation occurs only within the catchment area and it does not affect precipitation w f approach models either hms or lsms generally indicate that river flow will increase after deforestation second under the assumptions that deforestation is not necessarily limited by the catchment area and it affects precipitation modeling approaches that consider deforestation effects on precipitation lead in most cases to the opposite conclusion deforestation causes reduction of river flow the study of river flow response to deforestation in large basins of south america and arguably in similar contexts requires considering how deforestation affects precipitation including trans basin deforestation given the identified relationship between modeling approaches and conclusions about river flow response to deforestation using a modeling approach that neglects these effects
