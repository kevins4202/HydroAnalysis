9185,delineating root water uptake rwu under conditions with augmented co2 concentrations is very important for scheduling irrigation to contend with climate change responses of plant growth to elevated co2 concentration e co2 have been widely reported while the effects of e co2 on rwu has hardly been studied a hydroponic experiment of wheat triticum aestivum l with five no 3 n concentrations exp 1 was conducted to investigate and quantify the effects of e co2 on rwu activity another experiment growing wheat in soil columns with four combinations of water and n supply levels exp 2 was conducted to validate the results obtained in exp 1 establishing a macroscopic rwu model to simulate soil water dynamics under e co2 although co2 acclimation was observed in both experiments plant canopy and root growth were generally stimulated under e co2 while transpiration consumption was not synchronously enhanced due to decreased stomatal conductance indicating an increase in water use efficiency while a decrease in rwu activity potential transpiration was found more linearly related to root nitrogen mass rnm than root length under various co2 concentrations regardless of wheat growth stage water and n supply level consequently rnm density was used to drive the rwu model the results from exp 1 indicated that the effects of e co2 on water uptake coefficient per rnm could be quantified by a recently proposed nonlinear stomatal conductance response model r 2 0 84 rmse 0 55 cm3 mg 1 d 1 the rwu model reliably simulated the dynamics of soil water transport and wheat transpiration under e co2 in exp 2 with the rmse and relative errors mostly less than 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and 10 respectively practical application of the established rwu model for any other specific conditions is expected to benefit from optimization of parameters following choice of most appropriate stomatal conductance response model abbreviations e co2 elevated co2 concentration rwu root water

by human activities atmospheric co2 concentration has elevated almost 40 compared to before industrialization http co2now org and is expected to be double by the end of this century ipcc 2007 elevated co2 concentration e co2 has far reaching effects on transpiration photosynthesis and plant growth leakey et al 2009 kimball 2016 sheng et al 2021 therefore to contend with future climate change it is necessary to understand root water uptake rwu characteristics under e co2 to benefit sustainable agricultural water management the most direct effect of e co2 on rwu is reflected through decreased stomatal conductance and the decrease gradually weakens and eventually disappears with adaptation time due to co2 acclimation shimono et al 2013 halpern et al 2019 ainsworth and rogers 2007 conducted a meta analysis of 292 data sets from free air co2 enrichment face experiments and found that stomatal conductance under e co2 was reduced by an average of 22 however e co2 tends to promote plant photosynthesis and growth even though co2 acclimation occurred resulting in larger canopy and root system with higher leaf area index root length and biomass li et al 2004 nie et al 2013 this has the indirect effect of increasing water uptake counteracting the effect of e co2 on stomatal conductance owing to the contradictory effects of e co2 on leaf scale transpiration rate and leaf area index reduction in plant scale transpiration rate tends to weaken or even disappear with exposure time hunsaker et al 2000 li et al 2004 shimono et al 2013 that being said the water use efficiency of crop often defined as the growth in biomass divided by the transpiration tends to increase under e co2 hunsaker et al 2000 shimono et al 2013 the limited or unchanged plant scale transpiration consumption from a bigger root system under e co2 implies a decrease in rwu activity i e water uptake coefficient per unit root tissue shimono and bunce 2009 the effects of e co2 on rwu activity a critical index in macroscopic rwu models however remain difficult to quantify impacted by complicated factors related with soil and climate conditions as well as plant characteristics the mechanisms of rwu are still far from completely understood li et al 2001 homaee et al 2002 shi et al 2013 great efforts have been made to simulate rwu and many microscopic or macroscopic models have been established wu et al 1999 most macroscopic models simulate rwu rate by assuming a constant water uptake coefficient per root length over the root zone under optimal water conditions feddes et al 1978 prasad 1988 homaee et al 2002 in fact root uptake activity is most likely dependent on n concentration in roots oscarson et al 1989 thus younger roots such as root tips and hairs with higher tissue n concentration are more active in taking up water and nutrients gao et al 1998 pierret et al 2005 compared to root length root n mass rnm showed a closer linear relation with potential transpiration of winter wheat under ambient co2 regardless of growth stage water and n supply levels thus a constant water uptake coefficient based on rnm was introduced to represent rwu activity in a macroscopic rwu model which was then successfully applied to simulate soil water transport and plant transpiration shi and zuo 2009 wang et al 2012 besides rwu plant nutrient uptake of winter wheat was also found to be linearly related to rnm under optimal water conditions shi et al 2013 nevertheless it is unclear whether plant potential transpiration remains linearly proportional to rnm under e co2 and subsequently the effects of e co2 on rnm based water uptake coefficient should be further investigated and quantified in a soil plant system water is taken up via root system and finally transpired through leaf stomata indicating a balance relationship between rwu and transpiration both leaf stomatal conductance and root hydraulic conductivity are regulated by abscisic acid signals produced in roots and dependent on root water potential tardieu and davies 1993 bahrun et al 2002 the inherent relationship between leaf stomatal conductance transpiration and root hydraulic conductivity rwu leads to their almost identical responses to environment conditions such as water stress hose et al 2000 thompson et al 2007 to date a few semi empirical and semi mechanistic models have been successfully established to quantify the effects of e co2 on stomatal conductance for various plant species jarvis 1976 including linear ball et al 1987 morison 1987 easterling et al 1992 and nonlinear models li et al 2019 liao et al 2021 therefore it might be rational and reliable to quantify the effects of e co2 on rwu by referring to a stomatal conductance response model culturing wheat in nutrient solution and soil columns fan et al 2022 explored the mechanisms of e co2 induced n deficiency by investigating the effects of e co2 on leaf gas exchange water and n uptake plant growth resource allocation and so on based on the dynamics under various co2 conditions regarding wheat growth and root water uptake in the hydroponic experiment exp 1 and soil column experiment exp 2 which have been partially described in fan et al 2022 the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between potential transpiration and rnm under e co2 and quantify the effects of e co2 on rnm based water uptake coefficient according to a stomatal conductance response model the quantitative effects of e co2 on root uptake activity were applied in a macroscopic rwu model to simulate soil water flow and transpiration in a soil wheat system 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydroponic experiment exp 1 an experiment culturing wheat triticum aestivum l cv yunmai 42 in nutrient solution fig 1a fan et

chnso ea 1108 carlo erba reagents italy 2 2 soil column experiment exp 2 another experiment culturing wheat triticum aestivum l cv nongda 212 in soil columns fig 1b fan et al 2022 was used to verify the results obtained in exp 1 establish a rnm based rwu model and simulate soil water dynamics and plant transpiration under e co2 totally 123 polyvinyl chloride columns 55 cm in depth 15 cm in

with half hoagland solution to keep optimal soil water and nutrient conditions until 20 march 27 dap on 27 dap three soil columns were randomly chosen to determine the initial plant growth and soil water status before initiating treatments removing the shoots and cutting the soil cores in 5 cm interval some soil was sampled from each soil layer to measure water content by oven drying to constant weight at 105 c and the remainder was placed on a screen with 0 05 cm diameter grid and washed to collect roots parameters related to roots in each soil layer and shoots for each column e g leaf area root length and diameter tissue fresh and dry weights tissue n concentration were measured as described for exp 1 at 7 00 on 27 dap the other 120 soil columns were mulched by 3 cm high quartz sand to minimize evaporation and then were evenly divided into two artificial climate chambers subsequently the 60 soil columns in each chamber were irrigated to field capacity and fertilizer was applied as 62 mg p kg 1 dried soil 108 mg k kg 1 and 90 ln 30 soil columns or 180 hn 30 soil columns mg n kg 1 the weight of each soil column corresponding to field capacity was estimated according to the weights of column filled dry soil and plants at 8 00 on 27 dap co2 concentration in one of the chambers was elevated and maintained at 850 50 μmol mol 1 while it was invariable 400 50 μmol mol 1 in the other chamber from 10 00 14 00 on 27 dap three duplicate columns were randomly selected from each treatment to measure stomatal conductance transpiration and photosynthetic rates of the youngest fully expanded leaf as described for exp 1 afterwards a sufficient hw and a deficit lw water supply levels were set by triggering irrigation whenever the average soil water content in the column was lower than 80 and 50 of field capacity and terminating when field capacity was achieved respectively during the whole experimental period growth conditions in the chambers were kept as photosynthetic photon flux density of 500 μmol m 2 s 1 over plants from 08 00 20 00 day night temperature of 25 15 1 c relative humidity of 40 5 exp 2 lasted 92 d until the tillering stage of wheat 24 may 2019 besides the initial sampling on 27 dap sampling was carried out about every 13 d a total of 5 times from 40 to 92 dap each sampling event was conducted before irrigation and three duplicate columns were randomly chosen from each treatment to re measure the items measured on 27 dap three soil columns under each treatment were selected and weighed daily to estimate the average soil water content and plant transpiration by considering the change of plant fresh weight due to mulching soil evaporation was assumed negligible shi et al 2013 during the entire treatment period 27 92 dap hw treatment was irrigated 106 3 and 110 0 cm based on soil surface area through 63 times in the chambers with 400 and 850 50 μmol mol 1 co2 concentrations while they were 79 2 and 77 0 cm by 24 times for lw treatment respectively 2 3 quantifying the effects of e co2 on root uptake activity to establish a rwu model a popular macroscopic model was applied to simulate rwu feddes et al 1978 wu et al 1999 1 s

dimensionless soil water stress reduction function s max z t was the maximal rwu rate under the optimal soil water condition cm3 cm 3 d 1 to estimate s max z t under e co2 the linear relationship between potential transpiration and rnm of wheat founded under ambient co2 shi and zuo 2009 wang et al 2012 was employed after validation 2 s max z t w np n d z t where n d z t was the rnm density mg cm 3 w np was the water uptake coefficient per rnm cm3 mg 1 d 1 and the effects of e co2 on w np should be quantified prior to application due to the balance relationship between water taken up by roots and transpired through leaf stomata as well as the inherent signaling mechanism the responses of leaf stomatal conductance transpiration and root hydraulic conductivity rwu to environmental conditions are almost synchronous and identical hose et al 2000 thompson et al 2007 therefore a recently proposed nonlinear model li et al 2019 liao et al 2021 describing the effects of e co2 on leaf stomatal conductance g s mol m 2 s 1 was directly referred to quantify the effects of e co2 on w np as 3 g s g s ref 1 β co 2 co 2 ref 1 4 w np w np ref 1 β co 2 co 2 ref 1 where co 2 ref was the reference co2 concentration set as 400 μmol mol 1 in this study g s ref was the stomatal conductance under the reference co2 concentration mol m 2 s 1 co 2 was the studied co2 concentration μmol mol 1 β was a fitting parameter w np ref was the water uptake coefficient per unit rnm under the reference co2 concentration cm3 mg 1 d 1 in exp 1 wheat was supplied by sufficient water and the nonlinear eq 3 was verified under the n4 treatment with detailed stomatal conductance data involving three co2 concentrations optimizing the fitting parameter β with the least square method subsequently eq 4 was validated with the measured data under all the treatments in exp 1 2 4 simulating soil water dynamics under e co2 with the rnm based rwu model according to the measured stomatal conductance data under various co2 and soil water and n conditions in exp 2 β in eq 3 was also optimized by the least square method to establish a rnm based rwu model comprised of eqs 1 2 and 4 for verification between two successive sampling events the one dimensional vertical soil water flow for the various treatments under e co2 in exp 2 was simulated by solving richards equation in matlab software r2018b mathworks

matric potential corresponding to 80 of field water capacity for wheat shi and zuo 2009 wang et al 2012 ρ was a fitting parameter optimized according to the measured data under ambient co2 as follows shi et al 2015 2021 under water stressed conditions plant actual transpiration rate t a cm d 1 was approximated by integrating the rwu rates over root zone wu et al 1999 10 t a 0 l r s z t dz where l

anova was performed with the general linear model glm procedure of statistical software package spss 20 0 international business machines corporation usa one way anova was performed to evaluate the effects of a variable on the studied parameters based on least significant differences lsd at 0 05 probability level a multifactor anova was conducted to explore the interaction of various variables such as co2 concentration n and water supply levels four statistical indexes including root mean squared error rmse coefficient of determination r 2 maximal absolute error mae and relative error re

root growth whether wheat was cultured in nutrient solution exp 1 or soil columns exp 2 e co2 stimulated leaf photosynthesis fig 2a d under n4 treatment in exp 1 with solution no 3 n concentration of 0 105 mg cm 3 the average photosynthetic rate of the youngest fully expanded leaves during the co2 treatment period 29 69 dap was enhanced 32 and 48 by elevating co2 concentration from 400 to 625 and 850 µmol mol 1 respectively under lwln hwln lwhn and hwhn treatments in exp 2 the average enhancement during 27 92 dap reached 12 17 24 and 32 when co2 concentration was elevated from 400 to 850 µmol mol 1 respectively table 1 indicated that more water or n supply brought greater stimulation on photosynthesis p 0 001 and there was a significant interactive effect between co2 and water or n supply p 0 01 however a decreasing contribution of e co2 was found with adaptation time in both exps 1 and 2 namely co2 acclimation under n4 treatment for example when wheat was exposed to elevated co2 of 625 or 850 µmol mol 1 from 29 the first day to 69 dap the enhancement in leaf photosynthetic rate decreased from 57 or 78 to 31 or 40 respectively fig 2a during the short term after elevating co2 concentration in both exps 1 and 2 the effects of e co2 on photosynthesis did not reflect through wheat growth indices such as dry weight and leaf area afterwards the cumulative effects became obvious gradually under all the water and n conditions although co2 acclimation took place wheat growth was generally stimulated under e co2 compared to ambient co2 leading to significant increase in root dry weight and length as well as n mass table 1 however the enhancement was dependent on co2 concentration and the supply levels of n and water under n1 n5 treatments elevating co2 concentration from 400 to 625 μmol mol 1 respectively led to an average increase of 31 15 and 26 in root dry matter length and n mass on 69 dap fig 3a c as well as a 7 increase in root diameter the corresponding increase rose to 41 31 43 and 11 when co2 concentration was elevated to 850 μmol mol 1 the contribution of e co2 to root dry weight was the greatest under n1 treatment and weakened with increasing n supply level but for root length and rnm it almost kept stable regardless of n supply under the four water and n treatments in exp 2 e co2 significantly enhanced root dry weight on 92 dap nevertheless significant increase in root length and n mass was only observed under hwhn fig 3d f generally co2 concentration n or water supply significantly impacted root growth of wheat while no interactive effect was found in both exps 1 and 2 table 1 3 2 the effects of e co2 on rwu since almost all water absorbed by wheat root system was transpired through leaves the effects of e co2 on transpiration were investigated to represent its effects on rwu in this study as a parameter characterizing leaf scale transpiration rate stomatal conductance was always limited by e co2 in both experiments nevertheless the degree of limitation on stomatal conductance gradually weakened with adaptation time or even disappeared fig 2e h under hwhn treatment for example the reduction of stomatal conductance decreased from the initial value of 17 on 27 dap to 12 on 53 dap and 5 on 92 dap when elevating co2 concentration from 400 to 850 μmol mol 1 the effects of e co2 on stomatal conductance tended to be accumulated and shown through plant scale transpiration rate on the first day elevating co2 concentration in exp 1 29 dap when leaf area and root system hardly had time to change significantly plant scale transpiration rate was found to be significantly limited under e co2 regardless of n supply level with an average reduction rate of 15 fig 4a for each n supply treatment however the reduction also demonstrated a tendency of gradually weakening with time exposed to e co2 and eventually disappearing at the end of experiment fig 4b therefore plant total transpiration consumption during the entire treatment period 29 69 dap in exp 1 was hardly affected by e co2 for almost all the n treatments except an average decrease of 12 for n1 treatment under an extreme n stress fig 4c the insignificant effects of e co2 on plant transpiration were further verified by the measurements in exp 2 under various soil water and n conditions fig 4e g during the co2 treatment periods in exps 1 and 2 the enhanced plant growth while unchangeable or even decreased transpiration consumption under e co2 led to a 47 121 and 14 24 increase of water use efficiency respectively transpiration was always limited by water stress and enhanced by higher n supply level for wheat without water stress fig 4c and g interactive effects on plant transpiration were only found between water and n supply rather than between co2 and water or n supply table 1 3 3 quantification of the effects of e co2 on root uptake activity under each co2 concentration condition in exps 1 and 2 the average values between two successive sampling events indicated that daily potential transpiration was roughly proportional to root length r 2 0 85 0 94 regardless of n supply level figs 5a c and 6a b the ratio namely water uptake coefficient per root length gradually decreased with increasing co2 concentration in both experiments however daily potential transpiration seemed to be more significantly linearly proportional to rnm than root length under all experimental conditions r 2 0 94 0 97 the ratio w np namely water uptake coefficient per rnm gradually decreased from 6 57 cm3 mg 1 d 1 under ambient co2 400 μmol mol 1 to 5 10 cm3 mg 1 d 1 under 625 μmol mol 1 and to 4 35 cm3 mg 1 d 1 under 850 μmol mol 1 in exp 1 fig 5d f the tendency was also shown under 400 and 850 μmol mol 1 in exp 2 decreasing from 2 01 to 1 79 cm3 mg 1 d 1 fig 6c d furthermore the effect of co2 concentration on w np was consistent with that on stomatal conductance in both exps 1 and 2 fig 7 using the stomatal conductance measured under n4 treatment in exp 1 the parameter β in eq 3 was optimized as 0 33 with a reliable fitting precision r 2 0 92 rmse 0 02 mol m 2 s 1 when the optimized value of β was substituted into eq 4 an accurate quantification for the effects of e co2 on w np was also acquired for exp 1 r 2 0 84 rmse 0 55 cm3 mg 1 d 1 3 4 simulation of soil water dynamics under e co2 with the established rwu model according to the data measured under ambient co2 conditions in exp 2 the parameter ρ in eq 9 was optimized as 0 75 and β in eq 3 was fitted as 0 12 with the stomatal conductance data measured under all the treatments fig 7 in eq 4 with the measured value of w np ref fig 6c 2 01 cm3 mg 1 d 1 and the fitted β w np under 850 μmol mol 1 was estimated as 1 78 cm3 mg 1 d 1 almost equal to the measurement figs 6d 1 79 cm3 mg 1 d 1 using eqs 2 4 9 the one dimensional vertical soil water dynamics under e co2 between two successive sampling events was successfully simulated in exp 2 with acceptable errors especially under the lw treatments table 2 the re values between the simulated and measured transpiration consumption during each sampling period were mostly less than 10 between the simulated and measured soil water contents the values of mae and rmse were mostly lower than 0 05 and 0 03 cm3 cm 3 respectively and the values of r 2 were mostly higher than 0 7 relatively poorer simulation was found under hwhn and hwln with drastic change of soil water distribution which were irrigated every 1 2 days for clear demonstration only the simulated soil water contents were compared to the measured in fig 8 when the maximal rmse occurred during a typical irrigation period under lw treatments soil water content especially in 0 25 cm gradually decreased due to root uptake until the next irrigation event 4 discussion it is fairly well agreed upon that even if co2 acclimation is inevitable especially when n supply is insufficient leaf photosynthetic rate fig 2a d and thus plant growth are promoted by e co2 resulting in a larger canopy fig 4d and h and root system fig 3 ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2009 nie et al 2013 halpern et al 2019 additionally e co2 limits stomatal conductance fig 2e h and thus leaf scale transpiration rate hunsaker et al 2000 li et al 2004 shimono et al 2013 therefore plant scale transpiration rate was only limited by e co2 in a short term when leaf area is not significantly enlarged in time fig 4 nevertheless the accumulative transpiration consumption in a long term might be unaffected due to the inconsistent effects on stomatal conductance and leaf area li et al 2004 shimono et al 2013 since invariable or even limited transpiration consumption was resulted from a larger root system under e co2 root uptake activity was limited shimono and bunce 2009 whether based on root length or n mass figs 5 and 6 compared to root length rnm has been found to be more significantly linearly proportional to potential transpiration under ambient co2 shi and zuo 2009 this relationship was validated under e co2 in both exps 1 and 2 figs 5 and 6 regardless of plant growth stage culture substrate water or n supply level these results verified that rwu was strongly dependent on the allocation of n to roots under various conditions oscarson et al 1989 shi et al 2013 therefore even when atmospheric co2 concentration is elevated rwu model should be preferentially established using rnm rather than root length however the ratio w np an index characterizing root uptake activity was significantly impacted by culture substrates and co2 concentrations shi and zuo 2009 shimono and bunce 2009 li et al 2021 the lower water uptake coefficients per rnm in exp 2 1 97 2 01 cm3 mg 1 d 1 might be mainly attributed to the narrower interface between water and roots and poorer water supply capacity from unsaturated soil to roots in comparison to exp 1 5 10 6 57 cm3 mg 1 d 1 growing wheat in fully stirred nutrient solution shi and zuo 2009 the e co2 induced decrease in w np might be related to the lower expression of root aquaporin genes which regulates root hydraulic conductivity zaghdoud et al 2013 li et al 2021 some other studies have found that the changes in root anatomy under e co2 such as deposition of suberin might also hinder lateral water transport and in turn limit root uptake activity steudle 2000 sarker and hara 2009 vishwanath et al 2015 obviously the physiological response mechanisms of root system especially root uptake activity to e co2 are very complicated and still not completely understood shimono and bunce 2009 and thus other measures should be taken to explain the effects of e co2 on water uptake coefficient per rnm up to now relative to root system plant canopy has been more widely and deeply studied which is more directly related to agricultural production and can be more easily sampled and thus more advanced technologies and special instruments have been proposed kromdijk et al 2016 stinziano et al 2017 for example the very complicated process regarding leaf gas exchange affected by many environmental factors such as atmospheric co2 concentration can be conveniently and precisely investigated through a portable photosynthesis system ball et al 1987 ainsworth and long 2005 ainsworth and rogers 2007 therefore many semi empirical and semi mechanistic stomatal conductance response models have been established under e co2 ball et al 1987 easterling et al 1992 li et al 2019 due to the water balance relationship between plant transpiration dominated by leaf stomatal conductance and rwu hose et al 2000 thompson et al 2007 the nonlinear stomatal conductance response model recently proposed by li et al 2019 was adopted to quantify the effects of e co2 on rnm based water uptake activity the hydroponic experimental results validated that the responses of stomatal conductance and water uptake coefficient per rnm to e co2 were consistent and demonstrated similar nonlinearly changing feature fig 7 represented by an identical parameter β 0 33 in eqs 3 and 4 in exp 2 directly adopting the value of β 0 12 optimized according to the measured stomatal conductance under all the treatments the rnm based rwu model was successfully applied to simulate the soil water flow in a soil wheat system under e co2 which is essential for optimizing irrigation scheduling to contend with future climate change setting 330 μmol mol 1 as the reference co2 concentration li et al 2019 analyzed a large quantity of experimental data and obtained a statistical β value of 0 66 for various crops however significant difference was found between the values for wheat cultured in nutrient solution exp 1 β 0 12 and in soil columns exp 2 β 0 33 with both much lower than li et al s 2019 suggestion theoretically the value of β might be dependent on reference co2 concentrations plant species and varieties soil and other environmental conditions and thus independent optimization might be suggested for specific situations besides the model proposed by li et al 2019 many other linear or nonlinear stomatal conductance response models morison 1987 ball et al 1987 have been previously established and validated under various conditions therefore further studies should be conducted to screen a favorable model for the quantification of root uptake activity in addition roots always absorb water and nutrients simultaneously many previous studies have found that with a bigger root system under e co2 plant n uptake is enhanced even if tissue n concentration is decreased halpern et al 2019 fan et al 2022 therefore the effects of e co2 on root n uptake activity is unclear and should be investigated and quantified for the simulation of soil n transport and transformation 5 conclusions plant potential transpiration was more linearly proportional to rnm than to root length under co2 concentrations ranging from current baseline to those predicted for the future up to 850 μmol mol 1 regardless of plant growth stage water and n supply level plant canopy and root growth were generally stimulated by e co2 while transpiration consumption was not synchronously enhanced leading to an increase in water use efficiency while a decrease in root uptake activity the effects of e co2 on water uptake coefficient per rnm were successfully quantified by a recently proposed nonlinear stomatal conductance response model the rwu model based on rnm density accurately simulated the dynamics of water transport and transpiration in a soil wheat system under e co2 future use of such models for investigating climate change should evaluate possible use of alternative and potentially case dependent superior stomatal conductance response models furthermore the relevant parameters in the adopted stomatal conductance response model could be optimized to consider the effects of reference co2 concentration and to specific plant species and varieties soil and other environmental conditions additionally the effects of e co2 on root n uptake activity should also be investigated and quantified

9185,delineating root water uptake rwu under conditions with augmented co2 concentrations is very important for scheduling irrigation to contend with climate change responses of plant growth to elevated co2 concentration e co2 have been widely reported while the effects of e co2 on rwu has hardly been studied a hydroponic experiment of wheat triticum aestivum l with five no 3 n concentrations exp 1 was conducted to investigate and quantify the effects of e co2 on rwu activity another experiment growing wheat in soil columns with four combinations of water and n supply levels exp 2 was conducted to validate the results obtained in exp 1 establishing a macroscopic rwu model to simulate soil water dynamics under e co2 although co2 acclimation was observed in both experiments plant canopy and root growth were generally stimulated under e co2 while transpiration consumption was not synchronously enhanced due to decreased stomatal conductance indicating an increase in water use efficiency while a decrease in rwu activity potential transpiration was found more linearly related to root nitrogen mass rnm than root length under various co2 concentrations regardless of wheat growth stage water and n supply level consequently rnm density was used to drive the rwu model the results from exp 1 indicated that the effects of e co2 on water uptake coefficient per rnm could be quantified by a recently proposed nonlinear stomatal conductance response model r 2 0 84 rmse 0 55 cm3 mg 1 d 1 the rwu model reliably simulated the dynamics of soil water transport and wheat transpiration under e co2 in exp 2 with the rmse and relative errors mostly less than 0 03 cm3 cm 3 and 10 respectively practical application of the established rwu model for any other specific conditions is expected to benefit from optimization of parameters following choice of most appropriate stomatal conductance response model abbreviations e co2 elevated co2 concentration rwu root water

by human activities atmospheric co2 concentration has elevated almost 40 compared to before industrialization http co2now org and is expected to be double by the end of this century ipcc 2007 elevated co2 concentration e co2 has far reaching effects on transpiration photosynthesis and plant growth leakey et al 2009 kimball 2016 sheng et al 2021 therefore to contend with future climate change it is necessary to understand root water uptake rwu characteristics under e co2 to benefit sustainable agricultural water management the most direct effect of e co2 on rwu is reflected through decreased stomatal conductance and the decrease gradually weakens and eventually disappears with adaptation time due to co2 acclimation shimono et al 2013 halpern et al 2019 ainsworth and rogers 2007 conducted a meta analysis of 292 data sets from free air co2 enrichment face experiments and found that stomatal conductance under e co2 was reduced by an average of 22 however e co2 tends to promote plant photosynthesis and growth even though co2 acclimation occurred resulting in larger canopy and root system with higher leaf area index root length and biomass li et al 2004 nie et al 2013 this has the indirect effect of increasing water uptake counteracting the effect of e co2 on stomatal conductance owing to the contradictory effects of e co2 on leaf scale transpiration rate and leaf area index reduction in plant scale transpiration rate tends to weaken or even disappear with exposure time hunsaker et al 2000 li et al 2004 shimono et al 2013 that being said the water use efficiency of crop often defined as the growth in biomass divided by the transpiration tends to increase under e co2 hunsaker et al 2000 shimono et al 2013 the limited or unchanged plant scale transpiration consumption from a bigger root system under e co2 implies a decrease in rwu activity i e water uptake coefficient per unit root tissue shimono and bunce 2009 the effects of e co2 on rwu activity a critical index in macroscopic rwu models however remain difficult to quantify impacted by complicated factors related with soil and climate conditions as well as plant characteristics the mechanisms of rwu are still far from completely understood li et al 2001 homaee et al 2002 shi et al 2013 great efforts have been made to simulate rwu and many microscopic or macroscopic models have been established wu et al 1999 most macroscopic models simulate rwu rate by assuming a constant water uptake coefficient per root length over the root zone under optimal water conditions feddes et al 1978 prasad 1988 homaee et al 2002 in fact root uptake activity is most likely dependent on n concentration in roots oscarson et al 1989 thus younger roots such as root tips and hairs with higher tissue n concentration are more active in taking up water and nutrients gao et al 1998 pierret et al 2005 compared to root length root n mass rnm showed a closer linear relation with potential transpiration of winter wheat under ambient co2 regardless of growth stage water and n supply levels thus a constant water uptake coefficient based on rnm was introduced to represent rwu activity in a macroscopic rwu model which was then successfully applied to simulate soil water transport and plant transpiration shi and zuo 2009 wang et al 2012 besides rwu plant nutrient uptake of winter wheat was also found to be linearly related to rnm under optimal water conditions shi et al 2013 nevertheless it is unclear whether plant potential transpiration remains linearly proportional to rnm under e co2 and subsequently the effects of e co2 on rnm based water uptake coefficient should be further investigated and quantified in a soil plant system water is taken up via root system and finally transpired through leaf stomata indicating a balance relationship between rwu and transpiration both leaf stomatal conductance and root hydraulic conductivity are regulated by abscisic acid signals produced in roots and dependent on root water potential tardieu and davies 1993 bahrun et al 2002 the inherent relationship between leaf stomatal conductance transpiration and root hydraulic conductivity rwu leads to their almost identical responses to environment conditions such as water stress hose et al 2000 thompson et al 2007 to date a few semi empirical and semi mechanistic models have been successfully established to quantify the effects of e co2 on stomatal conductance for various plant species jarvis 1976 including linear ball et al 1987 morison 1987 easterling et al 1992 and nonlinear models li et al 2019 liao et al 2021 therefore it might be rational and reliable to quantify the effects of e co2 on rwu by referring to a stomatal conductance response model culturing wheat in nutrient solution and soil columns fan et al 2022 explored the mechanisms of e co2 induced n deficiency by investigating the effects of e co2 on leaf gas exchange water and n uptake plant growth resource allocation and so on based on the dynamics under various co2 conditions regarding wheat growth and root water uptake in the hydroponic experiment exp 1 and soil column experiment exp 2 which have been partially described in fan et al 2022 the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between potential transpiration and rnm under e co2 and quantify the effects of e co2 on rnm based water uptake coefficient according to a stomatal conductance response model the quantitative effects of e co2 on root uptake activity were applied in a macroscopic rwu model to simulate soil water flow and transpiration in a soil wheat system 2 materials and methods 2 1 hydroponic experiment exp 1 an experiment culturing wheat triticum aestivum l cv yunmai 42 in nutrient solution fig 1a fan et

with half hoagland solution to keep optimal soil water and nutrient conditions until 20 march 27 dap on 27 dap three soil columns were randomly chosen to determine the initial plant growth and soil water status before initiating treatments removing the shoots and cutting the soil cores in 5 cm interval some soil was sampled from each soil layer to measure water content by oven drying to constant weight at 105 c and the remainder was placed on a screen with 0 05 cm diameter grid and washed to collect roots parameters related to roots in each soil layer and shoots for each column e g leaf area root length and diameter tissue fresh and dry weights tissue n concentration were measured as described for exp 1 at 7 00 on 27 dap the other 120 soil columns were mulched by 3 cm high quartz sand to minimize evaporation and then were evenly divided into two artificial climate chambers subsequently the 60 soil columns in each chamber were irrigated to field capacity and fertilizer was applied as 62 mg p kg 1 dried soil 108 mg k kg 1 and 90 ln 30 soil columns or 180 hn 30 soil columns mg n kg 1 the weight of each soil column corresponding to field capacity was estimated according to the

the other chamber from 10 00 14 00 on 27 dap three duplicate columns were randomly selected from each treatment to measure stomatal conductance transpiration and photosynthetic rates of the youngest fully expanded leaf as described for exp 1 afterwards a sufficient hw and a deficit lw water supply levels were set by triggering irrigation whenever the average soil water content in the column was lower than 80 and 50 of field capacity and terminating when field capacity was achieved respectively during the whole experimental period growth conditions in the chambers were kept as photosynthetic

besides the initial sampling on 27 dap sampling was carried out about every 13 d a total of 5 times from 40 to 92 dap each sampling event was conducted before irrigation and three duplicate columns were randomly chosen from each treatment to re measure the items measured on 27 dap three soil columns under each treatment were selected and weighed daily to estimate the average soil water content and plant transpiration by considering the change of plant fresh weight due to mulching soil evaporation was assumed negligible shi et al 2013 during the entire treatment period 27 92 dap hw treatment was irrigated 106 3 and 110 0 cm based on soil surface area through 63 times in the chambers with 400 and 850 50 μmol mol 1 co2 concentrations while they were 79 2 and 77 0 cm by 24 times for lw treatment respectively 2 3 quantifying the effects of e co2 on root uptake activity to establish a rwu model a popular macroscopic model was applied to simulate rwu feddes et al 1978 wu et al 1999 1 s

dimensionless soil water stress reduction function s max z t was the maximal rwu rate under the optimal soil water condition cm3 cm 3 d 1 to estimate s max z t under e co2 the linear relationship

cm 3 w np was the water uptake coefficient per rnm cm3 mg 1 d 1 and the effects of e co2 on w np should be quantified prior to application due to the balance relationship between water taken up by roots and transpired through leaf stomata as well as the inherent signaling mechanism the responses of leaf stomatal conductance transpiration and root hydraulic conductivity rwu to environmental conditions are almost synchronous and identical hose et al 2000 thompson et al 2007 therefore a recently proposed nonlinear model li et al 2019 liao et al 2021 describing the effects of e co2 on leaf

β was a fitting parameter w np ref was the water uptake coefficient per unit rnm under the reference co2 concentration cm3 mg 1 d 1 in exp 1 wheat was supplied by sufficient water and the nonlinear eq

validated with the measured data under all the treatments in exp 1 2 4 simulating soil water dynamics under e co2 with the rnm based rwu model according to the measured stomatal conductance data under various co2 and soil water and n conditions in exp 2 β in eq 3 was also optimized by the least square method to establish a rnm based rwu model comprised of eqs 1 2 and 4 for verification between two successive sampling events the one dimensional vertical soil water flow for the various treatments under e co2 in exp 2 was simulated by solving richards equation in matlab software r2018b mathworks

matric potential corresponding to 80 of field water capacity for wheat shi and zuo 2009 wang et al 2012 ρ was a fitting parameter optimized according to the measured data under ambient co2 as follows shi et al 2015 2021 under water stressed conditions plant actual transpiration rate t a cm d 1 was approximated by integrating the rwu rates over root zone wu et al 1999 10 t a 0 l r s z t dz where l

root growth whether wheat was cultured in nutrient solution exp 1 or soil columns exp 2 e co2 stimulated leaf photosynthesis fig 2a d under n4 treatment in exp 1 with solution no 3 n concentration of 0 105 mg cm 3 the average photosynthetic rate of the youngest fully expanded leaves during the co2 treatment period 29 69 dap was enhanced 32 and 48 by elevating co2 concentration from 400 to 625 and 850 µmol mol 1 respectively under lwln hwln lwhn and hwhn treatments in exp 2 the average enhancement during 27 92 dap reached 12 17 24 and 32 when co2 concentration was elevated from 400 to 850 µmol mol 1 respectively table 1 indicated that more water or n supply brought greater stimulation on photosynthesis p 0 001 and there was a significant interactive effect between co2 and water or n supply p 0 01 however a decreasing contribution of e co2 was found with adaptation time in both exps 1 and 2 namely co2 acclimation under n4 treatment for example when wheat was exposed to elevated co2 of 625 or 850 µmol mol 1 from 29 the first day to 69 dap the enhancement in leaf photosynthetic rate decreased from 57 or 78 to 31 or 40 respectively fig 2a during the short term after elevating co2 concentration in both exps 1 and 2 the effects of e co2 on photosynthesis did not reflect through wheat growth indices such as dry weight and leaf area afterwards the cumulative effects became obvious gradually under all the water and n conditions although co2 acclimation took place wheat growth was generally stimulated under e co2 compared to ambient co2 leading to significant increase in root dry weight and length as well as n mass table 1 however the enhancement was dependent on co2 concentration and the supply levels of n and water under n1 n5 treatments elevating co2 concentration from 400 to 625 μmol mol 1 respectively led to an average increase of 31 15 and 26 in root dry matter length and n mass on 69 dap fig 3a c as well as a 7 increase in root diameter the corresponding increase rose to 41 31 43 and 11 when co2 concentration was elevated to 850 μmol mol 1 the contribution of e co2 to root dry weight was the greatest under n1 treatment and weakened with increasing n supply level but for root length and rnm it almost kept stable regardless of n supply under the four water and n treatments in exp 2 e co2 significantly enhanced root dry weight on 92 dap nevertheless significant increase in root length and n mass was only observed under hwhn fig 3d f generally co2 concentration n or water supply significantly impacted root growth of wheat while no interactive effect was found in both exps 1 and 2 table 1 3 2 the effects of e co2 on rwu since almost all water absorbed by wheat root system was transpired through leaves the effects of e co2 on transpiration were investigated to represent its effects on rwu in this study as a parameter characterizing leaf scale transpiration rate stomatal conductance was always limited by e co2 in both experiments nevertheless the degree of limitation on stomatal conductance gradually weakened with adaptation time or even disappeared fig 2e h under hwhn treatment for example the reduction of stomatal conductance decreased from the initial value of 17 on 27 dap to 12 on 53 dap and 5 on 92 dap when elevating co2 concentration from 400 to 850 μmol mol 1 the effects of e co2 on stomatal conductance tended to be accumulated and shown through plant scale transpiration rate on the first day elevating co2 concentration in exp 1 29 dap when leaf area and root system hardly had time to change significantly plant scale transpiration rate was found to be significantly limited under e co2 regardless of n supply level with an average reduction rate of 15 fig 4a for each n supply treatment however the reduction also demonstrated a tendency of gradually weakening with time exposed to e co2 and eventually disappearing at the end of experiment fig 4b therefore plant total transpiration consumption during the entire treatment period 29 69 dap in exp 1 was hardly affected by e co2 for almost all the n treatments except an average decrease of 12 for n1 treatment under an extreme n stress fig 4c the insignificant effects of e co2 on plant transpiration were further verified by the measurements in exp 2 under various soil water and n conditions fig 4e g during the co2 treatment periods in exps 1 and 2 the enhanced plant growth while unchangeable or even decreased transpiration consumption under e co2 led to a 47 121 and 14 24 increase of water use efficiency respectively transpiration was always limited by water stress and enhanced by higher n supply level for wheat without water stress fig 4c and g interactive effects on plant transpiration were only found between water and n supply rather than between co2 and water or n supply table 1 3 3 quantification of the effects of e co2 on root uptake activity under each co2 concentration condition in exps 1 and 2 the average values between two successive sampling events indicated that daily potential transpiration was roughly proportional to root length r 2 0 85 0 94 regardless of n supply level figs 5a c and 6a b the ratio namely water uptake coefficient per root length gradually decreased with increasing co2 concentration in both experiments however daily potential transpiration seemed to be more significantly linearly proportional to rnm than root length under all experimental conditions r 2 0 94 0 97 the ratio w np namely water uptake coefficient per rnm gradually decreased from 6 57 cm3 mg 1 d 1 under ambient co2 400 μmol mol 1 to 5 10 cm3 mg 1 d 1 under 625 μmol mol 1 and to 4 35 cm3 mg 1 d 1 under 850 μmol mol 1 in exp 1 fig 5d f the tendency was also shown under 400 and 850 μmol mol 1 in exp 2 decreasing from 2 01 to 1 79 cm3 mg 1 d 1 fig 6c d furthermore the effect of co2 concentration on w np was consistent with that on stomatal conductance in both exps 1 and 2 fig 7 using the stomatal conductance measured under n4 treatment in exp 1 the parameter β in eq 3 was optimized as 0 33 with a reliable fitting precision r 2 0 92 rmse 0 02 mol m 2 s 1 when the optimized value of β was substituted into eq 4 an accurate quantification for the effects of e co2 on w np was also acquired for exp 1 r 2 0 84 rmse 0 55 cm3 mg 1 d 1 3 4 simulation of soil water dynamics under e co2 with the established rwu model according to the data measured under ambient co2 conditions in exp 2 the parameter ρ in eq 9 was optimized as 0 75 and β in eq 3 was fitted as 0 12 with the stomatal conductance data measured under all the treatments fig 7 in eq 4 with the measured value of w np ref fig 6c 2 01 cm3 mg 1 d 1 and the fitted β w np under 850 μmol mol 1 was estimated as 1 78 cm3 mg 1 d 1 almost equal to the measurement figs 6d 1 79 cm3 mg 1 d 1 using eqs 2 4 9 the one dimensional vertical soil water dynamics under e co2 between two successive sampling events was successfully simulated in exp 2 with acceptable errors especially under the lw treatments table 2 the re values between the simulated and measured transpiration consumption during each sampling period were mostly less than 10 between the simulated and measured soil water contents the values of mae and rmse were mostly lower than 0 05 and 0 03 cm3 cm 3 respectively and the values of r 2 were mostly higher than 0 7 relatively poorer simulation was found under hwhn and hwln with drastic change of soil water distribution which were irrigated every 1 2 days for clear demonstration only the simulated soil water contents were compared to the measured in fig 8 when the maximal rmse occurred during a typical irrigation period under lw treatments soil water content especially in 0 25 cm gradually decreased due to root uptake until the next irrigation event 4 discussion it is fairly well agreed upon that even if co2 acclimation is inevitable especially when n supply is insufficient leaf photosynthetic rate fig 2a d and thus plant growth are promoted by e co2 resulting in a larger canopy fig 4d and h and root system fig 3 ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2009 nie et al 2013 halpern et al 2019 additionally e co2 limits stomatal conductance fig 2e h and thus leaf scale transpiration rate hunsaker et al 2000 li et al 2004 shimono et al 2013 therefore plant scale transpiration rate was only limited by e co2 in a short term when leaf area is not significantly enlarged in time fig 4 nevertheless the accumulative transpiration consumption in a long term might be unaffected due to the inconsistent effects on stomatal conductance and leaf area li et al 2004 shimono et al 2013 since invariable or even limited transpiration consumption was resulted from a larger root system under e co2 root uptake activity was limited shimono and bunce 2009 whether based on root length or n mass figs 5 and 6 compared to root length rnm has been found to be more significantly linearly proportional to potential transpiration under ambient co2 shi and zuo 2009 this relationship was validated under e co2 in both exps 1 and 2 figs 5 and 6 regardless of plant growth stage culture substrate water or n supply level these results verified that rwu was strongly dependent on the allocation of n to roots under various conditions oscarson et al 1989 shi et al 2013 therefore even when atmospheric co2 concentration is elevated rwu model should be preferentially established using rnm rather than root length however the ratio w np an index characterizing root uptake activity was significantly impacted by culture substrates and co2 concentrations shi and zuo 2009 shimono and bunce 2009 li et al 2021 the lower water uptake coefficients per rnm in exp 2 1 97 2 01 cm3 mg 1 d 1 might be mainly attributed to the narrower interface between water and roots and poorer water supply capacity from unsaturated soil to roots in comparison to exp 1 5 10 6 57 cm3 mg 1 d 1 growing wheat in fully stirred nutrient solution shi and zuo 2009 the e co2 induced decrease in w np might be related to the lower expression of root aquaporin genes which regulates root hydraulic conductivity zaghdoud et al 2013 li et al 2021 some other studies have found that the changes in root anatomy under e co2 such as deposition of suberin might also hinder lateral water transport and in turn limit root uptake activity steudle 2000 sarker and hara 2009 vishwanath et al 2015 obviously the physiological response mechanisms of root system especially root uptake activity to e co2 are very complicated and still not completely understood shimono and bunce 2009 and thus other measures should be taken to explain the effects of e co2 on water uptake coefficient per rnm up to now relative to root system plant canopy has been more widely and deeply studied which is more directly related to agricultural production and can be more easily sampled and thus more advanced technologies and special instruments have been proposed kromdijk et al 2016 stinziano et al 2017 for example the very complicated process regarding leaf gas exchange affected by many environmental factors such as atmospheric co2 concentration can be conveniently and precisely investigated through a portable photosynthesis system ball et al 1987 ainsworth and long 2005 ainsworth and rogers 2007 therefore many semi empirical and semi mechanistic stomatal conductance response models have been established under e co2 ball et al 1987 easterling et al 1992 li et al 2019 due to the water balance relationship between plant transpiration dominated by leaf stomatal conductance and rwu hose et al 2000 thompson et al 2007 the nonlinear stomatal conductance response model recently proposed by li et al 2019 was adopted to quantify the effects of e co2 on rnm based water uptake activity the hydroponic experimental results validated that the responses of stomatal conductance and water uptake coefficient per rnm to e co2 were consistent and demonstrated similar nonlinearly changing feature fig 7 represented by an identical parameter β 0 33 in eqs 3 and 4 in exp 2 directly adopting the value of β 0 12 optimized according to the measured stomatal conductance under all the treatments the rnm based rwu model was successfully applied to simulate the soil water flow in a soil wheat system under e co2 which is essential for optimizing irrigation scheduling to contend with future climate change setting 330 μmol mol 1 as the reference co2 concentration li et al 2019 analyzed a large quantity of experimental data and obtained a statistical β value of 0 66 for various crops however significant difference was found between the values for wheat cultured in nutrient solution exp 1 β 0 12 and in soil columns exp 2 β 0 33 with both much lower than li et al s 2019 suggestion theoretically the value of β might be dependent on reference co2 concentrations plant species and varieties soil and other environmental conditions and thus independent optimization might be suggested for specific situations besides the model proposed by li et al 2019 many other linear or nonlinear stomatal conductance response models morison 1987 ball et al 1987 have been previously established and validated under various conditions therefore further studies should be conducted to screen a favorable model for the quantification of root uptake activity in addition roots always absorb water and nutrients simultaneously many previous studies have found that with a bigger root system under e co2 plant n uptake is enhanced even if tissue n concentration is decreased halpern et al 2019 fan et al 2022 therefore the effects of e co2 on root n uptake activity is unclear and should be investigated and quantified for the simulation of soil n transport and transformation 5 conclusions plant potential transpiration was more linearly proportional to rnm than to root length under co2 concentrations ranging from current baseline to those predicted for the future up to 850 μmol mol 1 regardless of plant growth stage water and n supply level plant canopy and root growth were generally stimulated by e co2 while transpiration consumption was not synchronously enhanced leading to an increase in water use efficiency while a decrease in root uptake activity the effects of e co2 on water uptake coefficient per rnm were successfully quantified by a recently proposed nonlinear stomatal conductance response model the rwu model based on rnm density accurately simulated the dynamics of water transport and transpiration in a soil wheat system under e co2 future use of such models for investigating climate change should evaluate possible use of alternative and potentially case dependent superior stomatal conductance response models furthermore the relevant parameters in the adopted stomatal conductance response model could be optimized to consider the effects of reference co2 concentration and to specific plant species and varieties soil and other environmental conditions additionally the effects of e co2 on root n uptake activity should also be investigated and quantified

9186,an accurate estimate of crop coefficient k c values at different development stages k cini k cmid and k cend is crucial for assessing crop water requirements in semi arid regions the objectives of this study were first to quantify the reference evapotranspiration et o and to calculate the actual evapotranspiration et a over citrus in a semi arid climate under drip irrigation for this purpose a site of a citrus orchard in souss massa planted with the esbal variety of clementine was equipped with an eddy covariance ec system and sensors to measure radiation soil heat flux and micrometeorological forcing data during 2020 and 2021 seasons also the soil moisture content at various soil depths in the root zone near the ec tower was monitored the energy balance closure ebc approach was adopted for flux assessment to ensure a quality check for the ec measurements the obtained ebcs were about 82 and 79 for the daily measurements in 2020 and 2021 respectively which can be considered acceptable considering the nature of the citrus orchard relatively tall and sparse second the study aimed to estimate actual k c act values for citrus under the same irrigation strategy the derived values were compared to different recommended k c values in the literature in the third stage this work aimed to offer an alternative plan to sustainable irrigation management by elaborating an irrigation schedule for citrus crops in the region using the fao 56 simple approach to avoid water stress and deep percolation i e ks 1 and dp 0 eventually an irrigation schedule was drawn following the crop s phenological stages the seasonal mean citrus evapotranspiration et a values are 1 68 3 02 and 1 86 mm day for the initial mid and end season the seasonal actual k c act values were 0 64 0 58 and 0 64 for k cini k cmid and k cend respectively additionally the application of the water balance equation revealed that a large quantity of water is lost through deep percolation 52 of total water supplied the study focuses on citrus trees being a strategic crop with important socio economic values in the souss massa region thus the results should support both scientists and farmers in planning and strategy development keywords agricultural water management crop coefficients energy and water balance irrigation scheduling mediterranean climate soil plant atmosphere continuum data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the citrus industry is an important market segment within the global fresh produce trade in the mediterranean region citrus production is oriented toward fresh consumption and only 10 is used in processing fao 2017 the total mediterranean citrus production reaches 20 million tons and morocco is among the largest producing countries along with spain and portugal chen et al 2019 indeed moroccan annual production is estimated to rise by more than one third thus reaching 2 3 million tons usda argentina 2020 the country s rank is highly attributable to the increased planted area as new orchards come into full production potential plus its favorable meteorological conditions during the flowering season and fruit ripening regarding the souss massa region citrus orchards cover an area of 40 000 ha which is 31 of the surface devoted to citrus crops nationally mampdref 2020 this area makes up about 82 of the land used for irrigated crops generally speaking irrigation is the foremost consumer of water in morocco with more than 85 of the water mobilized samih 2020 although it only concerns 13 of the utilized agricultural land the water mobilized is responsible for 14 of the gross domestic product hence irrigation is mandatory to avoid water stress and ensure suitable conditions for growth development and yield the familiar technique adopted for water supply in the region is drip irrigation its key advantages are greater fertilizer efficiency contribution to environmental preservation and higher water use efficiency bouchaou et al 2017 yet water resources are still subject to decrease negatively impacting crop yields brouziyne et al 2018 this water scarcity puts morocco as a hot spot of climate change according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change the situation in souss massa is not different than the rest of the country climate variability drastically affects water resources in this region seif ennasr et al 2016 it can be easily deduced from the increase in drought length the rise in temperature values and the reduction in rainfall seif ennasr et al 2016 harming agriculture in semi arid regions todorović 2019a the reduction in precipitation quantities induced the necessity to supplement rainfall with irrigation reasonably by controlling the balance between demand and supply in other words water needs to be optimized according to the real needs of the crop at any given moment of its development hssaisoune et al 2020 the latter requires a good characterization of evapotranspiration et which is considered the key to sustainable irrigation management the et process is specific to each location and plant growth dynamics due to its dependence on the weather crop type crop variety and soil properties among other crop features anapalli et al 2018 todorović 2019b from the energetic point of view et is defined as the energy mobilized to transport water from the plant leaves and soil to the atmosphere as a vapor it is referred to as the latent heat flux and measured as an energy flux density rana and katerji 2000 there are several methods for measuring actual evapotranspiration it depends on time scales and the objectives to fulfill the variety of options requires a classification according to the concept followed by each one hydrology micrometeorology and plant physiology soil water balance and weighing lysimeters follow a hydrological approach holmes 1984 tilahun and john 2012 estimated evapotranspiration as an independent output of the soil water balance equation over a field crop grown in australia s semi arid environment the energy balance bowen ratio the aerodynamic method and the eddy covariance ec adopt a micrometeorological line rose and sharma 1984 finally the sap flow isotope methods and chambers system are based on plant physiology concepts rana and katerji 2000 the methods based on the later concept are usually hard to scale up the energy balance bowen ratio method is not very expensive yet it is necessary to use distinctive psychrometry and keep the bulbs wet and clean for a minimum accuracy plus the aerodynamic measurement is not suitable for tall crops rana and katerji 2000 malek and bingham 1993 compared calculating evapotranspiration using the bowen ratio energy balance and the water balance during the experimental period the evapotranspiration determined by the water balance approach was 98 of that obtained by the bowen ratio energy balance method simple weighing lysimeters for determining crop coefficients and evapotranspiration for cotton showed that it is a hard to maintain tool fisher 2012 knowing this the ec remains a cutting edge science based method for mass energy and momentum transfer quantification in the soil plant atmosphere continuum mauder et al 2007 this method was widely exploited particularly within the framework of the sudmed program chehbouni et al 2008 to measure et ezzahar et al 2009 and thus estimate crop coefficients er raki et al 2008 2009 2012 over olive and citrus orchards in tensift basin which is more or less similar in terms of climate semi arid to the souss massa the methods for et estimation are either based on analytical modeling or empirical ones in a global context certain studies estimated et and crop coefficients of citrus trees in semi arid climatic conditions by different means for instance some studies focused on field measurements of the soil and plant water status rallo et al 2017 other studies covered either the analysis of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential jamshidi et al 2020 or the assessment of the reliability of the arcdualkc model based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient longo minnolo et al 2020 more recently jafari et al 2021 measured stem water potential ψ stem net photosynthesis a n and stomatal conductance g s highlighting this way soil moisture variability and crop physiological response this study follows an et operational model estimating water consumption as a fraction of reference evapotranspiration to simplify the operating strategy for agricultural usage additionally accurate quantification of deep percolation contributes highly to sustainable water resources management due to the difficulty of obtaining direct observations of deep percolation it is frequently computed as a residual of the water balance in the moroccan context deep percolation has been quantified following the soil water balance approach based on the principle of conservation of mass in the effective rooting depth detailed in section 2 6 nassah et al 2018 2017 or by mixing remote sensing data and samir satellite monitoring of irrigation tool nassah et al 2022 deep percolation is the unknown variable in the water balance approach the known variables include irrigation change in soil water content and evapotranspiration the objectives of the current paper are i to compare the calculated daily crop coefficient for the experimental period to the different values given in the literature ii to assess the irrigation protocol followed by the farmer in a citrus orchard drip irrigated under semi arid climatic conditions and iii to optimize the irrigation water schedule according to crop phenological stages the daily crop coefficient values were computed following the fao 56 single crop coefficient approach meanwhile irrigation assessment is achieved through an evaluation of deep percolation dp according to actual evapotranspiration et a based on the water balance approach for recommending the appropriate irrigation schedule two conditions were set controlling the water stress coefficient k s 1 and avoiding deep percolation dp 0 irrigation scheduling attempts to maximize the economic benefits of agricultural output while minimizing environmental consequences and respecting the provision of ecosystem services by the maximization of water use nutrients and energy todorović 2019c the soil water balance method is currently the most widely utilized irrigation scheduling method several factors control irrigation scheduling for instance the crop soil texture et o and other operational factors like the availability of water as well as the delivery and farm system s flexibility a correct irrigation protocol can positively impact the farm s financial budget and eventually yield especially in arid areas where water is a limited resource and rainfall events are rare all in all the novelty of the study presented herein is to elaborate an irrigation schedule for citrus crops tailored to the souss massa region based on the combined use of eddy covariance measurement and soil water balance based approach the research is significant because it is to our best knowledge the first protocol taking into consideration the specific climate conditions of the souss massa zone besides citrus is of high economic value among farmers so the offered protocol will bring added value to this agricultural activity consequently this study could be advantageous for farmers and decision makers in the region as a guideline to appropriately design their irrigation strategy however it does not mean that the research results are exclusive and limited to souss massa it is a contribution to knowledge in all semi arid conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this study was carried out in a commercial citrus orchard in sebt el guerdane town latitudes 30 21 28 46 n longitudes 8 58 56 27 w elevation 207 m in the souss massa region morocco fig 1 it is an area falling into a semi arid mediterranean climate influenced by the ocean and the sahara this climate is characterized by low and irregular rainfall in space and time specifically the precipitations vary between 70 and 350 mm year with an average of 200 mm year bouchaou et al 2011 as a result a significant water deficit is observed in surface water and aquifer soil analysis revealed that the plot soil is loamy sand with 80 sand 10 loam and 10 clay the field was planted with 12 years old clementine trees esbal variety grafted on citrus macrophylla rootstock the planting density of the trees was 1000 trees ha the site is daily long watered by a drip irrigation system with a water amount reaching sometimes 15 mm day depending on the climatic conditions 2 2 meteorological measurements and energy balance closure of eddy covariance evaporation measurements in the center of the site a 7 m tall tower was installed for the eddy covariance and micrometeorological measurements on september the 27th 2019 by the laboratory of applied geology and geo environment lagage of ibn zohr university in collaboration with the international laboratory lmi trema https www lmi trema ma it was placed in the center of the field fig 1 the ec system set at a high of 6 3 m taking into consideration adequate instrument elevation above the canopy to increase eddy size to meet the sensor route length and decrease roughness sublayer distortions allen et al 2011 it consisted of a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific ltd that measured fluctuations in wind velocity components and temperature and a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific ltd measuring the concentration of water vapor raw data were sampled at a rate of 20 hz and half hourly fluxes of sensible heat h sonic and latent heat le were later calculated off line using the ec processing software ecpack after performing several corrections including 1 planar fit corrections wilczak et al 2001 2 correcting the sonic temperature for the presence of humidity schotanus et al 1983 3 frequency response corrections for slow apparatus and path length integration moore 1986 4 the inclusion of the mean vertical velocity according to webb et al 1980 and 5 oxygen correction for the krypton hygrometer which is sensitive to o2 van dijk et al 2003 the processing of the ec data was done by the ec pack software including all necessary corrections this processing has been adapted in all experiments of sudmed and lmi chehbouni et al 2008 over the same tower a cnr4 radiometer kipp zonen which measures the four components of the net radiation incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave was placed at 5 13 m above the ground soil additionally the air temperature and relative humidity were measured with the cs215 probe campbell scientific ltd installed at 2 11 m above the ground and the precipitation was collected by a rain gauge for the soil measurements the soil heat was measured using the sensor for heat flux measurement in the ground hfp01 model hukseflux the sensors are distributed as the following 2 at 5 cm depth from both sides of the tree and one at bare soil concerning the volumetric water content six time domain reflectometry sensors cs655 model campbell scientific ltd were installed at 5 20 30 60 and 80 cm depth two cs655 sensors were installed at 5 cm depth on both sides of the tree due to localized geographical differences in irrigation or precipitation additions the soil is wetted differently allen et al 2011 thus tdrs were positioned between the rows at 2 5 m from the tree trunk these monitor soil volumetric water content bulk electrical conductivity and temperature all the measurements were recorded using a cr3000 micro datalogger campbell scientific ltd the evapotranspiration quantification through an ec system requires a substantial number of calculations thence it is fundamental to assess the performance of flux measurements by checking the energy balance closure ebc approach which is based on the principle of conservation of energy for that purpose the sum of the latent le and sensible h sonic heat fluxes derived from the ec system is balanced by the available energy net radiation r n minus soil heat flux g both h sonic and le data were eliminated when the precipitations occurred and only r n data between 9 00 a m and 5 00 p m were kept which correspond to the available energy of soil crop surface r n g being positive fig 2 displays the plot of r n g against h sonic le for both the 2020 and 2021 seasons using daily values fig 2a and fig 2b g is calculated as the average of the two measurements taken at 5 cm for daily measurements the obtained results showed an 82 closure for 2020 and 79 for 2021 when the regression line is forced through the origin therefore the obtained ebc here can be considered good especially if one bears in mind the complexities of the study sites tall and sparse canopy the error obtained in the ebc is acceptable with reference to the literature therefore it is not necessary to apply the methodology of twine et al 2000 and correct le the application of the method in this case where the error is acceptable in our conditions which are complex tall sparse can generate an error in the estimation of le especially with the use of g values which is difficult to measure in a sparse cover consequently the le measured by the ec can satisfactorily be used afterward in this work the different ebcs from the literature show a variance ranging from 70 to 100 closure anapalli et al 2020 er raki et al 2009 2008 gao et al 2017 liu et al 2017 machakaire et al 2021 precisely for citrus orchards closures of about 86 were reached both in the moroccan context er raki et al 2009 and worldwide peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 in what follow the values of the latent heat flux le are converted from w m2 to mm day which is more understandable by the decision makers as the actual evapotranspiration et a the obtained values of et a computed by the ec system were then compared to the standard crop evapotranspiration et c estimating et c was through the fao 56 simple approach allen et al 1998 being the product of the suggested crop coefficient by rana et al 2005 and et o using the ec technique with soil water balance fao56 rana et al 2005 published k c values of 0 80 1 20 and 0 80 for k cini k cmid and k cend respectively for irrigated citrus under mediterranean conditions later the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse was used to assess the predictive skill of the fao 56 model and evaluate the extent of agreement or disagreement between the observed and computed data as follows nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 nse 1 t 1 t et a t et c t 2 t 1 t et a t et a 2 where et a is the annual mean observed crop evapotranspiration and et a et c are observed and modeled daily crop evapotranspiration values an efficiency less than zero calls for a re scale of the nse using the following equation eq 2 of normalized nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse nossent and bauwens 2012 2 nnse 1 2 nse the convenient rescaling eliminates the problem of the nse lower limit of and re scales the nse to lie solely within the range of 0 1 2 3 reference evapotranspiration daily averaged values of climatic data were calculated from half hourly collected measurements to compute the daily reference evapotranspiration et o mm day according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 3 et o 0 408 rn g 900 γ t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind velocity at 2 m height m s γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa and δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa c at dew point temperature all the standardized equations for calculating the parameters in eq 3 can be all found in allen et al 1998 in order to evaluate the degree of dryness of the climate in souss massa we analyzed aridity impacts on et o by utilizing the aridity index ai this indicator is calculated as the ratio of precipitation p to reference evapotranspiration et o using eq 4 4 ai p et o 2 4 soil water balance and water stress coefficient one main feature to consider for irrigation management is to reduce water loss by deep percolation dp in the following experiment dp losses have been quantified over the drip irrigated citrus orchard using daily water balance for the root zone during 2020 and 2021 the dp values were derived from the simple water balance equation of the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 by expressing the soil water content as the root zone depletion dr as follows 5 dp i p ro i i i cr i et a dr i 1 6 dr i dr i 1 p ro i i i cr i et a i dp i 7 dr i 1 1000 θ fc θ i 1 zr where i is the day number dr is the root zone depletion p is the precipitation ro is the runoff from the soil surface i is irrigation and cr is the capillary rise from the water table θ fc is the volumetric soil water content at field capacity zr is the root zone depth all these terms are in mm the average value of 0 15 m3 m3 was selected from table 19 in the fao 56 for θ fc since it is a loamy sand soil and θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m3 over 60 cm depth of the soil layer in the specific study the ro is neglected in the water balance equation for several reasons the orchard is located on the souss plain no slope the precipitations are generally low and the applied irrigation method drip likewise cr was zero as the water table is deep on average 50 m below the soil surface hssaisoune et al 2016 the volumetric water content was measured by the time domain reflectometry sensor cs650 according to the equation of topp et al 1980 the equation converts permittivity to volumetric water content as follows 8 θ i 5 3 10 2 2 92 10 2 k a 5 5 10 4 k a 2 4 3 10 6 k a 3 this equation shows the relation between dielectric constant k a and volumetric water content θ it does not require any specific soil calibration for the probes readings since 1 the soil organic matter content is 0 77 way lower than 5 2 the clay content is 10 lower than 20 3 the soil porosity of sand generally varies between 0 43 and 0 36 which is not greater than 0 5 and 4 the soil is not derived from a volcanic parent material thus the measurements are accurate and can be used for dp evaluation the effect of soil water stress on crop evapotranspiration was observed by the water stress coefficient k s it is a dimensionless factor ranging between 0 and 1 depending on available soil and root zone water the latter was quantified following the fao 56 paper approach allen et al 1998 k s 1 for dr raw 9 k s taw dr taw raw taw dr 1 ρ taw for dr raw where taw is the total available water defined as the difference between water content at field capacity θ fc and wilting point θ wp m3 m3 dr is the root zone depletion m3 m3 raw is the readily available soil water m3 m3 and ρ is the depletion fraction the equations to compute these different parameters are detailed below 10 taw 1000 θ fc θ wp zr 11 raw ρ taw where the value of 0 06 m3 m3 for θ wp was selected for a loamy sand soil and the value of 0 5 for the depletion fraction p was adopted for 70 canopy coverage of citrus according to table 22 of fao 56 allen et al 1998 2 5 crop coefficient deriving ultimately the previous computing allows calculating daily actual crop coefficient k c act values which are the sine qua non for irrigation water management the daily stress coefficient k s representing the water stress coefficient couldn t be assumed to equal unity even if the plot is drip irrigated all year long and the trees in the experiment are supplied with irrigation water daily therefore k s was derived from fao 56 model the actual k c act values were computed as the ratio of et a measured by the ec system to the et o following the single crop coefficient allen et al 1998 12 k c act et a et o 2 6 irrigation management assessment the irrigation assessment is done by comparing the amount of total water supplied through irrigation to the total deep percolation the water from precipitation is negligible when compared to the amount from irrigation the ratio comparing the deep percolation and irrigation amounts i is called relative deep percolation dp r nassah et al 2018 and is defined as 13 dp r dp i 100 another valuable percentage to assess the irrigation strategy is the depleted fraction df it is a ratio of et a over the total supplied water through irrigation i and precipitation p bos 2004 which represents the part of the water supply consumed by the actual evapotranspiration eq 14 14 df et a i p the more dp r values tend towards zero and df ratio approaches 1 the successful is the irrigation strategy 2 7 irrigation scheduling as previously mentioned one of the objectives of the current paper is to schedule irrigation effectively the designed protocol is based on the needs of the different phenological stages in terms of water requirements and follows the fao 56 approach the essential growing stages for the citrus crop are dormancy flowering fruit set fruit growth slowdown of fruit growth and maturation and finally the harvest bouazzama et al 2008 irrigation requirements were assumed to be the root zone depletion dr if the latter exceeds the allowable depletion da dr values are calculated according to eq 6 with an initial value assumed to be the amount of rainfall subtracted from the sum of initial depletion dr i and et a initial dr i is the water that has been depleted from the root zone at the beginning of calculations set as 54 mm equaling the total available water taw for the soil texture da values varied according to the management allowable depletion mad of the different growing stages and were computed as follows 15 da mad taw mad is the maximum amount from taw allowed to be depleted from the soil profile for root water usage before the next irrigation it can be less than or equal to raw in optimal or full irrigation and maximum production or larger than raw in deficit irrigation and yield reduction strategy todorović 2019c its value changes from one phenological stage to another table 1 3 results 3 1 site climate and reference evapotranspiration the long term average meteorological variables maximum temperature minimum temperature and solar radiation of two crop seasons 2020 and 2021 are given in fig 3 the measured data reveal that the temperatures were to some extent cool in the first two months of the year corresponding to the dormancy of the crop gradually the temperatures increase reaching the peaks during the fruit development phenological stage also fruit ripening occurs when the temperatures are relatively high in both years the pattern of average maximum and minimum temperature was similar the average maximum temperature of the site varied from 15 c in february 2021 48 c in august 2021 the minimum temperature ranged from 2 c in january 2020 32 c in august 2020 the solar radiation values rs are high and follow the same pattern as temperature measurements the computed values ranged from 55 w m2 in december 2020 354 w m2 in june 2020 yet fig 3 shows some sudden dips in radiation it could be explained by the cloudy conditions both meteorological parameters slowly decrease as summer ends the computed reference evapotranspiration et o values for the study period 2020 and 2021 are shown in fig 4 these values were calculated according to eq 3 the observed seasonal variations within the citrus orchard during the growing seasons are typical of a semi arid climate the accumulated et o value reaches 1535 mm in 2020 and 1335 mm in 2021 reflecting the high climatic demand the obtained difference between the two years about 200 mm is strongly related to accumulated rs values higher in 2020 as depicted in fig 4 the highest value was observed at the latest of august 2020 reaching 7 9 mm day and the lowest value equaling 1 mm day occurred in december 2020 generally et o is higher than 5 mm day from may till the end of mid september for both seasons with these significant values of et o and extremely low rainfall the ai resulted in a value of 0 04 and 0 12 in 2020 and 2021 respectively according to middleton et al 1997 we are falling under a hyperarid to arid area as the ai is lower than 0 05 in 2020 and lower than 0 2 in 2021 3 2 actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration et a is the value required to derive the crop coefficients as mentioned in the methodology et a values fig 4 were computed from the latent heat flux values le measured by the eddy covariance system the accumulated et a values were 938 mm in 2020 and 795 mm in 2021 the difference of 143 mm between the two consecutive years is the result of the difference in meteorological parameter values in contrast to 2020 the farmer irrigated extensively during the wet winter of 2021 more r s values were lower in 2021 and consequently et o dropped compared to 2020 the highest values of actual evapotranspiration 4 5 mm day occur in july and august which happens to be the period of fruit growth and enlargement pertain to the lowest values around 1 mm day they are observed in december it is supposed to be the dormancy of the crop that starts in december and lasts until early march altogether we have an average amount of 839 mm year to be supplied to the crop the considerable rainfall deficit indicates the necessity to irrigate citrus crops in the region the measured et a was compared to the estimated et c by the fao 56 single crop coefficient approach as the product of k c rana et al 2005 and et o the linear regression analyses in fig 5 reveal that the model overestimates actual crop evapotranspiration this weak estimation might be due to the high single k c values suggested in rana et al 2005 the k cmid high value might be due to phenological reasons the mid season is an active period of growth known for its high stomatal conductance bethenod et al 2000 rana et al 2005 another reason could be high wind speed associated with high vapor pressure deficit these conditions result in above average values of evapotranspiration rana et al 2005 the values might not be suitable for the local context of souss massa since they are influenced by crop characteristics and agronomic practices consequently appropriate k c values are needed for accurate quantification of crop water requirements er raki et al 2009 came to the same conclusion while studying citrus evapotranspiration in the haouz region as mentioned in the methodology an evaluation of the predictive skill of the fao 56 model was done by using nnse the coefficient resulted in very low values of 0 13 and 0 08 for 2020 and 2021 respectively these values mean that the model does not explain any part of the initial variance 3 3 deep percolation evaluation and ks variation dp evaluation was done by the soil water balance equation eq 5 the annual amount of water percolating equals 633 mm in 2020 and 993 mm in 2021 which cannot be neglected in a semi arid context suffering from water scarcity in 2021 precipitation and the amount of water allocated to irrigation were higher than in 2020 which explains the difference in annual deep percolation values from fig 6 the high percolation occurs on rainy days and when the irrigation events are frequent this said even with drip irrigation there are still losses due to the non rational use of the method the maximum value of percolated water in 2020 was 20 mm in late november due to the sudden precipitations and low evapotranspiration in 2021 the highest value of dp was 16 71 mm in late february when the supply reached 18 25 mm from which 14 5 mm were from rainfall in fig 6 the zone above θ fc represents the deep percolation and below θ wp corresponds to the unavailable soil water zone of soil moisture in between is the available soil water area the figure draws the variation of soil water volumetric content from 60 to 80 cm depth over the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons generally the soil moisture varies between the wilting point moisture and field capacity in 2020 the recorded pic was due to the irrigation water leak in late march thus the soil water moisture values are low even if the deep percolation values are high the k s values were determined by the amount of water depleted in the soil root zone which was linked to water supply et a and deep percolation fig 7 illustrates k s values evolution in 2020 and 2021 the shows that k s values vary from 0 to 1 according to eq 9 computed k s are extremely low at the beginning of every year since the irrigation water wasn t supplied daily when irrigation events became more frequent its value was all year long equal to unity but it started dropping in mid december when the amount of water supplied was again reduced however the fall was huge from december 20th thus k s values are related to irrigation and rainfall by affecting root zone depletion directly related to the water stress coefficient 3 4 crop coefficients kc act deriving when deriving the crop coefficients the previous data is taken into account as an intermediate calculation the computed k c act coefficients are the main parameters allowing the determination of water requirements for the citrus crop in the souss massa region the curve in fig 8 displays the average values of k c act over 2020 and 2021 k c act experiment compared to values reported in the fao 56 paper k c fao take heed of the fact that during the dormancy of the crop going from december to early march farmers tend to irrigate less the computed k c act values for the citrus orchard at the three growth stage initial mid and late season are 0 64 0 58 and 0 64 respectively it should be noted that the crop is irrigated daily which makes et c close to et a after this adjustment following the fao 56 single approach gives close estimates of et c equal to 800 mm year not far from the eddy covariance values the k c values from the fao 56 paper range from 0 65 to 0 70 for a clean cultivated and mature citrus orchard these values are presented for canopy cover of 70 3 5 irrigation management and assessment the irrigation strategy fig 9 follows the standard recommendations encouraging irrigation during the fruit ripening june to september and maturity and lowering the irrigation quantities during the dormancy december to early march el hari et al 2010 good irrigation management is one of the interventions favoring fruit size in the fruit setting april to may it is essential to avoid water stress at this stage especially when temperatures are high the accumulated quantity of water given to the orchard reached 1501 6 mm in 2020 and 1613 7 mm in 2021 the irrigation amount for the treatments varied from 0 55 mm day in mid may to 12 84 mm day in early july 2020 and reached 14 69 mm day in july 2021 the days with too much water given are justified by the number of irrigation events per day on the other side of the coin rainfall events are low and irregular with a total precipitation volume of 66 20 mm year in 2020 they were limited to 11 events reaching 22 50 mm day in its best scenario in 2021 the total amount of precipitation was equal to 160 36 mm year given the paucity of rainfall events and the lack of water when most needed it is mandatory to irrigate the critical periods when water deficit is detrimental to the yield are 1 the flowering march and april 2 the fruit set may to june and 3 the fruit growth and ripening stage with specific attention to the period from mid july till mid august el otmani et al 2020 the big picture is that irrigation is a consubstantial part of citrus cropping in the study area soil water content is affected by the irrigation strategy and has an impact on plant health as visualized in the figure water volumetric content shows similar temporal trends at the different layers except that of the upper layer which is more affected by the irrigation events it shows much higher values and a completely different pattern the rise in volumetric moisture is proportional to the water dose indicating the correct response of tdr sensors the highest value in terms of soil water content in 2020 is observed in early april this sudden peak could be an aftereffect of a water leak that occurred in late march the irrigation water supply was first compared to dp by dp r percentage eq 13 the sum of the deep percolation computed by the water balance equation is 633 mm in 2020 and 993 mm in 2021 with an average value of 2 22 mm day when compared to irrigation it represents 42 in 2020 and 62 in 2021 an average of 52 of the allocated amount of irrigation the high values might be the result of over irrigation and soil texture therefore inappropriate irrigation management but by no means questions the high efficiency of the drip irrigation technique the second ratio used to assess the irrigation strategy is df it reflects the part of the supplied irrigation consumed by et a eq 14 the average annual df value was 0 62 in 2020 and 0 64 in 2021 in arid to semi arid areas df for citrus equaling 0 6 is critical kharrou et al 2013 df per growth stage was calculated to dig deep within this low value flowering fruit set growth and maturation are the phases that are characterized by a value lower than 0 6 corresponding to excessive irrigation the phenological stages characterized by low df value are flowering fruit set and growth and maturation when df ranges between 0 6 and 1 1 it reflects proper water use kharrou et al 2013 dormancy is the sole step in this scenario that falls within the parameters of wise water management all the values mentioned earlier emphasize the need for proper irrigation water use in this caption fig 10 the water inflow is compared to the climatic demand considering daytime values the water amount or quantity to integrate equals 872 mm for the first year given that rainfall in 2020 was 66 20 mm the et a values obtained from the ec system based on the measured values reach the sum of 938 mm meanwhile the farmer offers an amount of 1501 mm the interesting fact is that 630 mm is subject to seepage this simple equation is confirmed by the values obtained from the water balance equation in fig 10 633 mm day in other words 40 of the water supplied leaches into the soil keeping the soil humidity and recharging the water table when the groundwater level is not deep which is not the case for our study site in 2021 the water amount to integrate was 614 mm lower than the previous year because the annual rainfall was 160 mm the accumulated et a value obtained from the ec system based on the measured values in the same year is 795 mm the supplied water is higher than the previous year reaching 1774 mm year from which 1614 mm are supplied by irrigation again 979 mm are not used by the plant and thus percolate an approximate value of 993 mm day was evaluated by the water balance equation fig 10 3 6 irrigation schedule after evaluating the real water supply the optimization of irrigation water scheduling in time and quantity was performed using the fao 56 simple approach to avoid water stress and deep percolation i e k s 1 and dp 0 always the accumulated recommended irrigation obtained is an average of 831 mm year which is only 51 5 of the average amount of water applied by the farmer fig 11 shows the adequate amount of water irrigation for each phenological stage with the depleted fraction values the new depleted values serve as an assessment for the irrigation protocol given the values are equal to 1 in most keystone phenological stages which is the adequate water use interval the harvest is not a critical period requiring an abundant amount of water the following strategy suggests applying 831 mm year of irrigation water if we consider average precipitation equal to 113 mm year the water quantity is distributed as in fig 11 according to the different phenological stages the flowering fruit set and growth phases must not be subject to any form of water stress the fruit growth stage is the most demanding in terms of water reaching almost 200 mm it is justified by the cell division that ensures fruit size to our best knowledge it is the first time that an irrigation schedule has been done for citrus under souss massa conditions 4 discussion the assessment of crop evapotranspiration was done following the fao 56 approach overall the meteorological conditions are not strange in a region characterized by a semi arid climate which is dry and hot in summer and relatively cold in winter el otmani et al 2020 the issue of water scarcity in the area has been made worse by climate change and agricultural development marieme et al 2017 which is confirmed by the low values of the aridity index the different patterns of et o under semi arid climates reported in the literature er raki et al 2009 2008 jafari et al 2021 tabari et al 2012 do not differ from the pattern of the experiment however et a values fall in the conventional range of 700 1300 mm year with an average of 1000 mm year el otmani et al 2020 the same range of values 765 820 and 786 mm year was reported for citrus orchards in the haouz region er raki et al 2009 2012 el hari et al 2010 nassah et al 2018 these values are slightly different since they characterize the same region tensift al haouz it is a region with a typical mediterranean climate known for its low and erratic rainfall roughly 240 mm the annual average rainfall was way lower than the average crop water requirement er raki et al 2009 regarding the dp losses they cannot be assessed by the variation in soil moisture content in the root zone in this case the soil is loamy sand with 80 sand making the particles coarse and the soil porosity larger these properties are faster infiltration and lower soil water content tian et al 2017 additionally the organic matter content is lower than 1 the latter condition when combined with the sandy soil type results in poor water retention sun et al 2017 in fact the decrease in water holding capacity and the rise in infiltration capacity are typical when sand content is high compared to clay content yang et al 2019 following the fao 56 single approach daily crop coefficient values and for different stages were derived the crop coefficient values reported in allen et al 1998 and the derived k c act values from the experiment follow more or less the same pattern but are not equal it is visible that allen et al 1998 overestimate the crop coefficient reflecting the crop demand this overestimation reaches 9 different results from studies focusing on the calibration of citrus et a based on the single crop coefficient maestre valero et al 2017 and the dual crop coefficient er raki et al 2008 are gathered in table 2 these recommended k c values show a clear discrepancy one way to explain so is that crop coefficients depend on variable factors they integrate climatic factors yang et al 2003 plant biophysical characteristics consoli and papa 2013 irrigation management and soil evaporation maestre valero et al 2017 these factors and processes are directly impacted by agricultural practices another comparison helping to locate this experiment s results is comparing the derived k c act values to different values reported for citrus orchards from multiple published studies table 2 from the collected values there is an immense contrast between the same values computed in one country er raki et al 2008 heitz et al 2011 bouazzama et al 2008 indicate entirely different results the values from er raki et al 2008 in the table are as they were cited in jamshidi et al 2020 a range of crop coefficient values has also been suggested as a result of numerous studies looking at citrus et c based on the dual k c approach er raki et al 2008 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 the diversity and complexity of meteorological conditions irrigation control plant physical and biological characteristics and soil evaporation rates are probably to blame for these differences in the reported kc values the requirement for local calibrations is further highlighted by the inherent anomalies in kc coming from its empirical determination particularly under drought circumstances maestre valero et al 2017 employed the ec approach which was linked to soil water balance fao56 by er raki et al 2009 also different approaches were utilized to estimate evapotranspiration values for citrus castel 2000 combined data from drainage and weighing lysimeters using the swb technique k cmid 0 55 in spain water use efficiency was assessed by the analytic hierarchy process ahp technique and a new synthetic irrigation efficiency index iei was elaborated poveda bautista et al 2021 this study emphasized the significance of assessing the effectiveness of irrigation water use in the moroccan context nassah et al 2018 adopted relative deep percolation ratio the result recorded an average annual dp r value of 43 in the haouz region of morocco the same value recorded in this experiment for the first year in other studies dp r equals about 11 in arid and semi arid climates garcía petillo and castel 2007 lower than the obtained dp r irrigation assessment leads to the necessity of appropriate irrigation scheduling even when micro irrigation distribution systems and water saving management strategies are used the hydrological models can be thought of as an accessible tool for indirect evaluations of soil and crop water status targeted at identifying irrigation schedule parameters rallo et al 2017 the fao 56 paper contains some ambiguity especially in citrus orchards where crop water use is influenced by tree light interception or crop load consoli et al 2006 rallo et al 2021 moreover the importance of monitoring the soil plant atmosphere continuum to identify precise thresholds of permissible soil depletion for precision irrigation scheduling was demonstrated by the ecophysiological linkages in puig sirera et al 2021 the same study determined a threshold of depletion factor p 0 41 to create a site specific irrigation scheduling protocol for citrus the eddy covariance allows the measurement of hsonic and le for an area of few hectares depending on the wind speed ezzahar et al 2007 however the measurement of the net radiation rn and the soil flux g remain a punctual information allen et al 2011 indeed the dual k c approach could have been better to use allen et al 2011 currently it needs more time to do the new simulations 5 conclusions the study is the first application of the ec technique in citrus farming in the souss massa region characterized by a semi arid climate worsened by water scarcity generally the meteorological conditions are similar to the ones of the mediterranean area characterized by a semi arid climate the latter leads to reference evapotranspiration values being high reflecting a considerable climatic demand nevertheless the annual average rainfall is lower than the crop water requirement meaning there is an obvious need to supply water through irrigation the et o values computed following the penman monteith equation from the fao 56 paper can be reliable for elaborating an irrigation protocol allowing the adjustment of crop coefficient values the derived kc act values for the citrus orchard at the three growth stage initial mid and late season are 0 64 0 58 and 0 64 respectively on the other hand the research investigates dp in citrus orchards using drip irrigation in a semi arid climate and develops a method based on the fao 56 model for defining irrigation schemes and optimizing irrigation under the region s specific conditions the results demonstrate that the water balance equation gives a very high dp of about 813 mm year with a rough dp r value of 52 percent it is in line with the measured soil water moisture level the fao 56 simple approach was employed to determine the proper irrigation amounts the results reveal that by considering rainfall the model proposes a far lower quantity of irrigation than the farmer allocates according to the model calculations it appears that on average around 55 of the water supply may be saved this research has shown that for sustainable water management a tailor made drip irrigation schedule is required indeed drip irrigation reduces water losses to evapotranspiration however losses to deep percolation need to be lowered through the control of water flow into the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9186,an accurate estimate of crop coefficient k c values at different development stages k cini k cmid and k cend is crucial for assessing crop water requirements in semi arid regions the objectives of this study were first to quantify the reference evapotranspiration et o and to calculate the actual evapotranspiration et a over citrus in a semi arid climate under drip irrigation for this purpose a site of a citrus orchard in souss massa planted with the esbal variety of clementine was equipped with an eddy covariance ec system and sensors to measure radiation soil heat flux and micrometeorological forcing data during 2020 and 2021 seasons also the soil moisture content at various soil depths in the root zone near the ec tower was monitored the energy balance closure ebc approach was adopted for flux assessment to ensure a quality check for the ec measurements the obtained ebcs were about 82 and 79 for the daily measurements in 2020 and 2021 respectively which can be considered acceptable considering the nature of the citrus orchard relatively tall and sparse second the study aimed to estimate actual k c act values for citrus under the same irrigation strategy the derived values were compared to different recommended k c values in the literature in the third stage this work aimed to offer an alternative plan to sustainable irrigation management by elaborating an irrigation schedule for citrus crops in the region using the fao 56 simple approach to avoid water stress and deep percolation i e ks 1 and dp 0 eventually an irrigation schedule was drawn following the crop s phenological stages the seasonal mean citrus evapotranspiration et a values are 1 68 3 02 and 1 86 mm day for the initial mid and end season the seasonal actual k c act values were 0 64 0 58 and 0 64 for k cini k cmid and k cend respectively additionally the application of the water balance equation revealed that a large quantity of water is lost through deep percolation 52 of total water supplied the study focuses on citrus trees being a strategic crop with important socio economic values in the souss massa region thus the results should support both scientists and farmers in planning and strategy development keywords agricultural water management crop coefficients energy and water balance irrigation scheduling mediterranean climate soil plant atmosphere continuum data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the citrus industry is an important market segment within the global fresh produce trade in the mediterranean region citrus production is oriented toward fresh consumption and only 10 is used in processing fao 2017 the total mediterranean citrus production reaches 20 million tons and morocco is among the largest producing countries along with spain and portugal chen et al 2019 indeed moroccan annual production is estimated to rise by more than one third thus reaching 2 3 million tons usda argentina 2020 the country s rank is highly attributable to the increased planted area as new orchards come into full production potential plus its favorable meteorological conditions during the flowering season and fruit ripening regarding the souss massa region citrus orchards cover an area of 40 000 ha which is 31 of the surface devoted to citrus crops nationally mampdref 2020 this area makes up about 82 of the land used for irrigated crops generally speaking irrigation is the foremost consumer of water in morocco with more than 85 of the water mobilized samih 2020 although it only concerns 13 of the utilized agricultural land the water mobilized is responsible for 14 of the gross domestic product hence irrigation is mandatory to avoid water stress and ensure suitable conditions for growth development and yield the familiar technique adopted for water supply in the region is drip irrigation its key advantages are greater fertilizer efficiency contribution to environmental preservation and higher water use efficiency bouchaou et al 2017 yet water resources are still subject to decrease negatively impacting crop yields brouziyne et al 2018 this water scarcity puts morocco as a hot spot of climate change according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change the situation in souss massa is not different than the rest of the country climate variability drastically affects water resources in this region seif ennasr et al 2016 it can be easily deduced from the increase in drought length the rise in temperature values and the reduction in rainfall seif ennasr et al 2016 harming agriculture in semi arid regions todorović 2019a the reduction in precipitation quantities induced the necessity to supplement rainfall with irrigation reasonably by controlling the balance between demand and supply in other words water needs to be optimized according to the real needs of the crop at any given moment of its development hssaisoune et al 2020 the latter requires a good characterization of evapotranspiration et which is considered the key to sustainable irrigation management the et process is specific to each location and plant growth dynamics due to its dependence on the weather crop type crop variety and soil properties among other crop features anapalli et al 2018 todorović 2019b from the energetic point of view et is defined as the energy mobilized to transport water from the plant leaves and soil to the atmosphere as a vapor it is referred to as the latent heat flux and measured as an energy flux density rana and katerji 2000 there are several methods for measuring actual evapotranspiration it depends on time scales and the objectives to fulfill the variety of options requires a classification according to the concept followed by each one hydrology micrometeorology and plant physiology soil water balance and weighing lysimeters follow a hydrological approach holmes 1984 tilahun and john 2012 estimated evapotranspiration as an independent output of the soil water balance equation over a field crop grown in australia s semi arid environment the energy balance bowen ratio the aerodynamic method and the eddy covariance ec adopt a micrometeorological line rose and sharma 1984 finally the sap flow isotope methods and chambers system are based on plant physiology concepts rana and katerji 2000 the methods based on the later concept are usually hard to scale up the energy balance bowen ratio method is not very expensive yet it is necessary to use distinctive psychrometry and keep the bulbs wet and clean for a minimum accuracy plus the aerodynamic measurement is not suitable for tall crops rana and katerji 2000 malek and bingham 1993 compared calculating evapotranspiration using the bowen ratio energy balance and the water balance during the experimental period the evapotranspiration determined by the water balance approach was 98 of that obtained by the bowen ratio energy balance method simple weighing lysimeters for determining crop coefficients and evapotranspiration for cotton showed that it is a hard to maintain tool fisher 2012 knowing this the ec remains a cutting edge science based method for mass energy and momentum transfer quantification in the soil plant atmosphere continuum mauder et al 2007 this method was widely exploited particularly within the framework of the sudmed program chehbouni et al 2008 to measure et ezzahar et al 2009 and thus estimate crop coefficients er raki et al 2008 2009 2012 over olive and citrus orchards in tensift basin which is more or less similar in terms of climate semi arid to the souss massa the methods for et estimation are either based on analytical modeling or empirical ones in a global context certain studies estimated et and crop coefficients of citrus trees in semi arid climatic conditions by different means for instance some studies focused on field measurements of the soil and plant water status rallo et al 2017 other studies covered either the analysis of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential jamshidi et al 2020 or the assessment of the reliability of the arcdualkc model based on the fao 56 dual crop coefficient longo minnolo et al 2020 more recently jafari et al 2021 measured stem water potential ψ stem net photosynthesis a n and stomatal conductance g s highlighting this way soil moisture variability and crop physiological response this study follows an et operational model estimating water consumption as a fraction of reference evapotranspiration to simplify the operating strategy for agricultural usage additionally accurate quantification of deep percolation contributes highly to sustainable water resources management due to the difficulty of obtaining direct observations of deep percolation it is frequently computed as a residual of the water balance in the moroccan context deep percolation has been quantified following the soil water balance approach based on the principle of conservation of mass in the effective rooting depth detailed in section 2 6 nassah et al 2018 2017 or by mixing remote sensing data and samir satellite monitoring of irrigation tool nassah et al 2022 deep percolation is the unknown variable in the water balance approach the known variables include irrigation change in soil water content and evapotranspiration the objectives of the current paper are i to compare the calculated daily crop coefficient for the experimental period to the different values given in the literature ii to assess the irrigation protocol followed by the farmer in a citrus orchard drip irrigated under semi arid climatic conditions and iii to optimize the irrigation water schedule according to crop phenological stages the daily crop coefficient values were computed following the fao 56 single crop coefficient approach meanwhile irrigation assessment is achieved through an evaluation of deep percolation dp according to actual evapotranspiration et a based on the water balance approach for recommending the appropriate irrigation schedule two conditions were set controlling the water stress coefficient k s 1 and avoiding deep percolation dp 0 irrigation scheduling attempts to maximize the economic benefits of agricultural output while minimizing environmental consequences and respecting the provision of ecosystem services by the maximization of water use nutrients and energy todorović 2019c the soil water balance method is currently the most widely utilized irrigation scheduling method several factors control irrigation scheduling for instance the crop soil texture et o and other operational factors like the availability of water as well as the delivery and farm system s flexibility a correct irrigation protocol can positively impact the farm s financial budget and eventually yield especially in arid areas where water is a limited resource and rainfall events are rare all in all the novelty of the study presented herein is to elaborate an irrigation schedule for citrus crops tailored to the souss massa region based on the combined use of eddy covariance measurement and soil water balance based approach the research is significant because it is to our best knowledge the first protocol taking into consideration the specific climate conditions of the souss massa zone besides citrus is of high economic value among farmers so the offered protocol will bring added value to this agricultural activity consequently this study could be advantageous for farmers and decision makers in the region as a guideline to appropriately design their irrigation strategy however it does not mean that the research results are exclusive and limited to souss massa it is a contribution to knowledge in all semi arid conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this study was carried out in a commercial citrus orchard in sebt el guerdane town latitudes 30 21 28 46 n longitudes 8 58 56 27 w elevation 207 m in the souss massa region morocco fig 1 it is an area falling into a semi arid mediterranean climate influenced by the ocean and the sahara this climate is characterized by low and irregular rainfall in space and time specifically the precipitations vary between 70 and 350 mm year with an average of 200 mm year bouchaou et al 2011 as a result a significant water deficit is observed in surface water and aquifer soil analysis revealed that the plot soil is loamy sand with 80 sand 10 loam and 10 clay the field was planted with 12 years old clementine trees esbal variety grafted on citrus macrophylla rootstock the planting density of the trees was 1000 trees ha the site is daily long watered by a drip irrigation system with a water amount reaching sometimes 15 mm day depending on the climatic conditions 2 2 meteorological measurements and energy balance closure of eddy covariance evaporation measurements in the center of the site a 7 m tall tower was installed for the eddy covariance and micrometeorological measurements on september the 27th 2019 by the laboratory of applied geology and geo environment lagage of ibn zohr university in collaboration with the international laboratory lmi trema https www lmi trema ma it was placed in the center of the field fig 1 the ec system set at a high of 6 3 m taking into consideration adequate instrument elevation above the canopy to increase eddy size to meet the sensor route length and decrease roughness sublayer distortions allen et al 2011 it consisted of a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific ltd that measured fluctuations in wind velocity components and temperature and a krypton hygrometer kh20 campbell scientific ltd measuring the concentration of water vapor raw data were sampled at a rate of 20 hz and half hourly fluxes of sensible heat h sonic and latent heat le were later calculated off line using the ec processing software ecpack after performing several corrections including 1 planar fit corrections wilczak et al 2001 2 correcting the sonic temperature for the presence of humidity schotanus et al 1983 3 frequency response corrections for slow apparatus and path length integration moore 1986 4 the inclusion of the mean vertical velocity according to webb et al 1980 and 5 oxygen correction for the krypton hygrometer which is sensitive to o2 van dijk et al 2003 the processing of the ec data was done by the ec pack software including all necessary corrections this processing has been adapted in all experiments of sudmed and lmi chehbouni et al 2008 over the same tower a cnr4 radiometer kipp zonen which measures the four components of the net radiation incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave was placed at 5 13 m above the ground soil additionally the air temperature and relative humidity were measured with the cs215 probe campbell scientific ltd installed at 2 11 m above the ground and the precipitation was collected by a rain gauge for the soil measurements the soil heat was measured using the sensor for heat flux measurement in the ground hfp01 model hukseflux the sensors are distributed as the following 2 at 5 cm depth from both sides of the tree and one at bare soil concerning the volumetric water content six time domain reflectometry sensors cs655 model campbell scientific ltd were installed at 5 20 30 60 and 80 cm depth two cs655 sensors were installed at 5 cm depth on both sides of the tree due to localized geographical differences in irrigation or precipitation additions the soil is wetted differently allen et al 2011 thus tdrs were positioned between the rows at 2 5 m from the tree trunk these monitor soil volumetric water content bulk electrical conductivity and temperature all the measurements were recorded using a cr3000 micro datalogger campbell scientific ltd the evapotranspiration quantification through an ec system requires a substantial number of calculations thence it is fundamental to assess the performance of flux measurements by checking the energy balance closure ebc approach which is based on the principle of conservation of energy for that purpose the sum of the latent le and sensible h sonic heat fluxes derived from the ec system is balanced by the available energy net radiation r n minus soil heat flux g both h sonic and le data were eliminated when the precipitations occurred and only r n data between 9 00 a m and 5 00 p m were kept which correspond to the available energy of soil crop surface r n g being positive fig 2 displays the plot of r n g against h sonic le for both the 2020 and 2021 seasons using daily values fig 2a and fig 2b g is calculated as the average of the two measurements taken at 5 cm for daily measurements the obtained results showed an 82 closure for 2020 and 79 for 2021 when the regression line is forced through the origin therefore the obtained ebc here can be considered good especially if one bears in mind the complexities of the study sites tall and sparse canopy the error obtained in the ebc is acceptable with reference to the literature therefore it is not necessary to apply the methodology of twine et al 2000 and correct le the application of the method in this case where the error is acceptable in our conditions which are complex tall sparse can generate an error in the estimation of le especially with the use of g values which is difficult to measure in a sparse cover consequently the le measured by the ec can satisfactorily be used afterward in this work the different ebcs from the literature show a variance ranging from 70 to 100 closure anapalli et al 2020 er raki et al 2009 2008 gao et al 2017 liu et al 2017 machakaire et al 2021 precisely for citrus orchards closures of about 86 were reached both in the moroccan context er raki et al 2009 and worldwide peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 in what follow the values of the latent heat flux le are converted from w m2 to mm day which is more understandable by the decision makers as the actual evapotranspiration et a the obtained values of et a computed by the ec system were then compared to the standard crop evapotranspiration et c estimating et c was through the fao 56 simple approach allen et al 1998 being the product of the suggested crop coefficient by rana et al 2005 and et o using the ec technique with soil water balance fao56 rana et al 2005 published k c values of 0 80 1 20 and 0 80 for k cini k cmid and k cend respectively for irrigated citrus under mediterranean conditions later the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse was used to assess the predictive skill of the fao 56 model and evaluate the extent of agreement or disagreement between the observed and computed data as follows nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 nse 1 t 1 t et a t et c t 2 t 1 t et a t et a 2 where et a is the annual mean observed crop evapotranspiration and et a et c are observed and modeled daily crop evapotranspiration values an efficiency less than zero calls for a re scale of the nse using the following equation eq 2 of normalized nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse nossent and bauwens 2012 2 nnse 1 2 nse the convenient rescaling eliminates the problem of the nse lower limit of and re scales the nse to lie solely within the range of 0 1 2 3 reference evapotranspiration daily averaged values of climatic data were calculated from half hourly collected measurements to compute the daily reference evapotranspiration et o mm day according to the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 3 et o 0 408 rn g 900 γ t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind velocity at 2 m height m s γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa and δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa c at dew point temperature all the standardized equations for calculating the parameters in eq 3 can be all found in allen et al 1998 in order to evaluate the degree of dryness of the climate in souss massa we analyzed aridity impacts on et o by utilizing the aridity index ai this indicator is calculated as the ratio of precipitation p to reference evapotranspiration et o using eq 4 4 ai p et o 2 4 soil water balance and water stress coefficient one main feature to consider for irrigation management is to reduce water loss by deep percolation dp in the following experiment dp losses have been quantified over the drip irrigated citrus orchard using daily water balance for the root zone during 2020 and 2021 the dp values were derived from the simple water balance equation of the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 by expressing the soil water content as the root zone depletion dr as follows 5 dp i p ro i i i cr i et a dr i 1 6 dr i dr i 1 p ro i i i cr i et a i dp i 7 dr i 1 1000 θ fc θ i 1 zr where i is the day number dr is the root zone depletion p is the precipitation ro is the runoff from the soil surface i is irrigation and cr is the capillary rise from the water table θ fc is the volumetric soil water content at field capacity zr is the root zone depth all these terms are in mm the average value of 0 15 m3 m3 was selected from table 19 in the fao 56 for θ fc since it is a loamy sand soil and θ is the volumetric soil water content m3 m3 over 60 cm depth of the soil layer in the specific study the ro is neglected in the water balance equation for several reasons the orchard is located on the souss plain no slope the precipitations are generally low and the applied irrigation method drip likewise cr was zero as the water table is deep on average 50 m below the soil surface hssaisoune et al 2016 the volumetric water content was measured by the time domain reflectometry sensor cs650 according to the equation of topp et al 1980 the equation converts permittivity to volumetric water content as follows 8 θ i 5 3 10 2 2 92 10 2 k a 5 5 10 4 k a 2 4 3 10 6 k a 3 this equation shows the relation between dielectric constant k a and volumetric water content θ it does not require any specific soil calibration for the probes readings since 1 the soil organic matter content is 0 77 way lower than 5 2 the clay content is 10 lower than 20 3 the soil porosity of sand generally varies between 0 43 and 0 36 which is not greater than 0 5 and 4 the soil is not derived from a volcanic parent material thus the measurements are accurate and can be used for dp evaluation the effect of soil water stress on crop evapotranspiration was observed by the water stress coefficient k s it is a dimensionless factor ranging between 0 and 1 depending on available soil and root zone water the latter was quantified following the fao 56 paper approach allen et al 1998 k s 1 for dr raw 9 k s taw dr taw raw taw dr 1 ρ taw for dr raw where taw is the total available water defined as the difference between water content at field capacity θ fc and wilting point θ wp m3 m3 dr is the root zone depletion m3 m3 raw is the readily available soil water m3 m3 and ρ is the depletion fraction the equations to compute these different parameters are detailed below 10 taw 1000 θ fc θ wp zr 11 raw ρ taw where the value of 0 06 m3 m3 for θ wp was selected for a loamy sand soil and the value of 0 5 for the depletion fraction p was adopted for 70 canopy coverage of citrus according to table 22 of fao 56 allen et al 1998 2 5 crop coefficient deriving ultimately the previous computing allows calculating daily actual crop coefficient k c act values which are the sine qua non for irrigation water management the daily stress coefficient k s representing the water stress coefficient couldn t be assumed to equal unity even if the plot is drip irrigated all year long and the trees in the experiment are supplied with irrigation water daily therefore k s was derived from fao 56 model the actual k c act values were computed as the ratio of et a measured by the ec system to the et o following the single crop coefficient allen et al 1998 12 k c act et a et o 2 6 irrigation management assessment the irrigation assessment is done by comparing the amount of total water supplied through irrigation to the total deep percolation the water from precipitation is negligible when compared to the amount from irrigation the ratio comparing the deep percolation and irrigation amounts i is called relative deep percolation dp r nassah et al 2018 and is defined as 13 dp r dp i 100 another valuable percentage to assess the irrigation strategy is the depleted fraction df it is a ratio of et a over the total supplied water through irrigation i and precipitation p bos 2004 which represents the part of the water supply consumed by the actual evapotranspiration eq 14 14 df et a i p the more dp r values tend towards zero and df ratio approaches 1 the successful is the irrigation strategy 2 7 irrigation scheduling as previously mentioned one of the objectives of the current paper is to schedule irrigation effectively the designed protocol is based on the needs of the different phenological stages in terms of water requirements and follows the fao 56 approach the essential growing stages for the citrus crop are dormancy flowering fruit set fruit growth slowdown of fruit growth and maturation and finally the harvest bouazzama et al 2008 irrigation requirements were assumed to be the root zone depletion dr if the latter exceeds the allowable depletion da dr values are calculated according to eq 6 with an initial value assumed to be the amount of rainfall subtracted from the sum of initial depletion dr i and et a initial dr i is the water that has been depleted from the root zone at the beginning of calculations set as 54 mm equaling the total available water taw for the soil texture da values varied according to the management allowable depletion mad of the different growing stages and were computed as follows 15 da mad taw mad is the maximum amount from taw allowed to be depleted from the soil profile for root water usage before the next irrigation it can be less than or equal to raw in optimal or full irrigation and maximum production or larger than raw in deficit irrigation and yield reduction strategy todorović 2019c its value changes from one phenological stage to another table 1 3 results 3 1 site climate and reference evapotranspiration the long term average meteorological variables maximum temperature minimum temperature and solar radiation of two crop seasons 2020 and 2021 are given in fig 3 the measured data reveal that the temperatures were to some extent cool in the first two months of the year corresponding to the dormancy of the crop gradually the temperatures increase reaching the peaks during the fruit development phenological stage also fruit ripening occurs when the temperatures are relatively high in both years the pattern of average maximum and minimum temperature was similar the average maximum temperature of the site varied from 15 c in february 2021 48 c in august 2021 the minimum temperature ranged from 2 c in january 2020 32 c in august 2020 the solar radiation values rs are high and follow the same pattern as temperature measurements the computed values ranged from 55 w m2 in december 2020 354 w m2 in june 2020 yet fig 3 shows some sudden dips in radiation it could be explained by the cloudy conditions both meteorological parameters slowly decrease as summer ends the computed reference evapotranspiration et o values for the study period 2020 and 2021 are shown in fig 4 these values were calculated according to eq 3 the observed seasonal variations within the citrus orchard during the growing seasons are typical of a semi arid climate the accumulated et o value reaches 1535 mm in 2020 and 1335 mm in 2021 reflecting the high climatic demand the obtained difference between the two years about 200 mm is strongly related to accumulated rs values higher in 2020 as depicted in fig 4 the highest value was observed at the latest of august 2020 reaching 7 9 mm day and the lowest value equaling 1 mm day occurred in december 2020 generally et o is higher than 5 mm day from may till the end of mid september for both seasons with these significant values of et o and extremely low rainfall the ai resulted in a value of 0 04 and 0 12 in 2020 and 2021 respectively according to middleton et al 1997 we are falling under a hyperarid to arid area as the ai is lower than 0 05 in 2020 and lower than 0 2 in 2021 3 2 actual evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration et a is the value required to derive the crop coefficients as mentioned in the methodology et a values fig 4 were computed from the latent heat flux values le measured by the eddy covariance system the accumulated et a values were 938 mm in 2020 and 795 mm in 2021 the difference of 143 mm between the two consecutive years is the result of the difference in meteorological parameter values in contrast to 2020 the farmer irrigated extensively during the wet winter of 2021 more r s values were lower in 2021 and consequently et o dropped compared to 2020 the highest values of actual evapotranspiration 4 5 mm day occur in july and august which happens to be the period of fruit growth and enlargement pertain to the lowest values around 1 mm day they are observed in december it is supposed to be the dormancy of the crop that starts in december and lasts until early march altogether we have an average amount of 839 mm year to be supplied to the crop the considerable rainfall deficit indicates the necessity to irrigate citrus crops in the region the measured et a was compared to the estimated et c by the fao 56 single crop coefficient approach as the product of k c rana et al 2005 and et o the linear regression analyses in fig 5 reveal that the model overestimates actual crop evapotranspiration this weak estimation might be due to the high single k c values suggested in rana et al 2005 the k cmid high value might be due to phenological reasons the mid season is an active period of growth known for its high stomatal conductance bethenod et al 2000 rana et al 2005 another reason could be high wind speed associated with high vapor pressure deficit these conditions result in above average values of evapotranspiration rana et al 2005 the values might not be suitable for the local context of souss massa since they are influenced by crop characteristics and agronomic practices consequently appropriate k c values are needed for accurate quantification of crop water requirements er raki et al 2009 came to the same conclusion while studying citrus evapotranspiration in the haouz region as mentioned in the methodology an evaluation of the predictive skill of the fao 56 model was done by using nnse the coefficient resulted in very low values of 0 13 and 0 08 for 2020 and 2021 respectively these values mean that the model does not explain any part of the initial variance 3 3 deep percolation evaluation and ks variation dp evaluation was done by the soil water balance equation eq 5 the annual amount of water percolating equals 633 mm in 2020 and 993 mm in 2021 which cannot be neglected in a semi arid context suffering from water scarcity in 2021 precipitation and the amount of water allocated to irrigation were higher than in 2020 which explains the difference in annual deep percolation values from fig 6 the high percolation occurs on rainy days and when the irrigation events are frequent this said even with drip irrigation there are still losses due to the non rational use of the method the maximum value of percolated water in 2020 was 20 mm in late november due to the sudden precipitations and low evapotranspiration in 2021 the highest value of dp was 16 71 mm in late february when the supply reached 18 25 mm from which 14 5 mm were from rainfall in fig 6 the zone above θ fc represents the deep percolation and below θ wp corresponds to the unavailable soil water zone of soil moisture in between is the available soil water area the figure draws the variation of soil water volumetric content from 60 to 80 cm depth over the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons generally the soil moisture varies between the wilting point moisture and field capacity in 2020 the recorded pic was due to the irrigation water leak in late march thus the soil water moisture values are low even if the deep percolation values are high the k s values were determined by the amount of water depleted in the soil root zone which was linked to water supply et a and deep percolation fig 7 illustrates k s values evolution in 2020 and 2021 the shows that k s values vary from 0 to 1 according to eq 9 computed k s are extremely low at the beginning of every year since the irrigation water wasn t supplied daily when irrigation events became more frequent its value was all year long equal to unity but it started dropping in mid december when the amount of water supplied was again reduced however the fall was huge from december 20th thus k s values are related to irrigation and rainfall by affecting root zone depletion directly related to the water stress coefficient 3 4 crop coefficients kc act deriving when deriving the crop coefficients the previous data is taken into account as an intermediate calculation the computed k c act coefficients are the main parameters allowing the determination of water requirements for the citrus crop in the souss massa region the curve in fig 8 displays the average values of k c act over 2020 and 2021 k c act experiment compared to values reported in the fao 56 paper k c fao take heed of the fact that during the dormancy of the crop going from december to early march farmers tend to irrigate less the computed k c act values for the citrus orchard at the three growth stage initial mid and late season are 0 64 0 58 and 0 64 respectively it should be noted that the crop is irrigated daily which makes et c close to et a after this adjustment following the fao 56 single approach gives close estimates of et c equal to 800 mm year not far from the eddy covariance values the k c values from the fao 56 paper range from 0 65 to 0 70 for a clean cultivated and mature citrus orchard these values are presented for canopy cover of 70 3 5 irrigation management and assessment the irrigation strategy fig 9 follows the standard recommendations encouraging irrigation during the fruit ripening june to september and maturity and lowering the irrigation quantities during the dormancy december to early march el hari et al 2010 good irrigation management is one of the interventions favoring fruit size in the fruit setting april to may it is essential to avoid water stress at this stage especially when temperatures are high the accumulated quantity of water given to the orchard reached 1501 6 mm in 2020 and 1613 7 mm in 2021 the irrigation amount for the treatments varied from 0 55 mm day in mid may to 12 84 mm day in early july 2020 and reached 14 69 mm day in july 2021 the days with too much water given are justified by the number of irrigation events per day on the other side of the coin rainfall events are low and irregular with a total precipitation volume of 66 20 mm year in 2020 they were limited to 11 events reaching 22 50 mm day in its best scenario in 2021 the total amount of precipitation was equal to 160 36 mm year given the paucity of rainfall events and the lack of water when most needed it is mandatory to irrigate the critical periods when water deficit is detrimental to the yield are 1 the flowering march and april 2 the fruit set may to june and 3 the fruit growth and ripening stage with specific attention to the period from mid july till mid august el otmani et al 2020 the big picture is that irrigation is a consubstantial part of citrus cropping in the study area soil water content is affected by the irrigation strategy and has an impact on plant health as visualized in the figure water volumetric content shows similar temporal trends at the different layers except that of the upper layer which is more affected by the irrigation events it shows much higher values and a completely different pattern the rise in volumetric moisture is proportional to the water dose indicating the correct response of tdr sensors the highest value in terms of soil water content in 2020 is observed in early april this sudden peak could be an aftereffect of a water leak that occurred in late march the irrigation water supply was first compared to dp by dp r percentage eq 13 the sum of the deep percolation computed by the water balance equation is 633 mm in 2020 and 993 mm in 2021 with an average value of 2 22 mm day when compared to irrigation it represents 42 in 2020 and 62 in 2021 an average of 52 of the allocated amount of irrigation the high values might be the result of over irrigation and soil texture therefore inappropriate irrigation management but by no means questions the high efficiency of the drip irrigation technique the second ratio used to assess the irrigation strategy is df it reflects the part of the supplied irrigation consumed by et a eq 14 the average annual df value was 0 62 in 2020 and 0 64 in 2021 in arid to semi arid areas df for citrus equaling 0 6 is critical kharrou et al 2013 df per growth stage was calculated to dig deep within this low value flowering fruit set growth and maturation are the phases that are characterized by a value lower than 0 6 corresponding to excessive irrigation the phenological stages characterized by low df value are flowering fruit set and growth and maturation when df ranges between 0 6 and 1 1 it reflects proper water use kharrou et al 2013 dormancy is the sole step in this scenario that falls within the parameters of wise water management all the values mentioned earlier emphasize the need for proper irrigation water use in this caption fig 10 the water inflow is compared to the climatic demand considering daytime values the water amount or quantity to integrate equals 872 mm for the first year given that rainfall in 2020 was 66 20 mm the et a values obtained from the ec system based on the measured values reach the sum of 938 mm meanwhile the farmer offers an amount of 1501 mm the interesting fact is that 630 mm is subject to seepage this simple equation is confirmed by the values obtained from the water balance equation in fig 10 633 mm day in other words 40 of the water supplied leaches into the soil keeping the soil humidity and recharging the water table when the groundwater level is not deep which is not the case for our study site in 2021 the water amount to integrate was 614 mm lower than the previous year because the annual rainfall was 160 mm the accumulated et a value obtained from the ec system based on the measured values in the same year is 795 mm the supplied water is higher than the previous year reaching 1774 mm year from which 1614 mm are supplied by irrigation again 979 mm are not used by the plant and thus percolate an approximate value of 993 mm day was evaluated by the water balance equation fig 10 3 6 irrigation schedule after evaluating the real water supply the optimization of irrigation water scheduling in time and quantity was performed using the fao 56 simple approach to avoid water stress and deep percolation i e k s 1 and dp 0 always the accumulated recommended irrigation obtained is an average of 831 mm year which is only 51 5 of the average amount of water applied by the farmer fig 11 shows the adequate amount of water irrigation for each phenological stage with the depleted fraction values the new depleted values serve as an assessment for the irrigation protocol given the values are equal to 1 in most keystone phenological stages which is the adequate water use interval the harvest is not a critical period requiring an abundant amount of water the following strategy suggests applying 831 mm year of irrigation water if we consider average precipitation equal to 113 mm year the water quantity is distributed as in fig 11 according to the different phenological stages the flowering fruit set and growth phases must not be subject to any form of water stress the fruit growth stage is the most demanding in terms of water reaching almost 200 mm it is justified by the cell division that ensures fruit size to our best knowledge it is the first time that an irrigation schedule has been done for citrus under souss massa conditions 4 discussion the assessment of crop evapotranspiration was done following the fao 56 approach overall the meteorological conditions are not strange in a region characterized by a semi arid climate which is dry and hot in summer and relatively cold in winter el otmani et al 2020 the issue of water scarcity in the area has been made worse by climate change and agricultural development marieme et al 2017 which is confirmed by the low values of the aridity index the different patterns of et o under semi arid climates reported in the literature er raki et al 2009 2008 jafari et al 2021 tabari et al 2012 do not differ from the pattern of the experiment however et a values fall in the conventional range of 700 1300 mm year with an average of 1000 mm year el otmani et al 2020 the same range of values 765 820 and 786 mm year was reported for citrus orchards in the haouz region er raki et al 2009 2012 el hari et al 2010 nassah et al 2018 these values are slightly different since they characterize the same region tensift al haouz it is a region with a typical mediterranean climate known for its low and erratic rainfall roughly 240 mm the annual average rainfall was way lower than the average crop water requirement er raki et al 2009 regarding the dp losses they cannot be assessed by the variation in soil moisture content in the root zone in this case the soil is loamy sand with 80 sand making the particles coarse and the soil porosity larger these properties are faster infiltration and lower soil water content tian et al 2017 additionally the organic matter content is lower than 1 the latter condition when combined with the sandy soil type results in poor water retention sun et al 2017 in fact the decrease in water holding capacity and the rise in infiltration capacity are typical when sand content is high compared to clay content yang et al 2019 following the fao 56 single approach daily crop coefficient values and for different stages were derived the crop coefficient values reported in allen et al 1998 and the derived k c act values from the experiment follow more or less the same pattern but are not equal it is visible that allen et al 1998 overestimate the crop coefficient reflecting the crop demand this overestimation reaches 9 different results from studies focusing on the calibration of citrus et a based on the single crop coefficient maestre valero et al 2017 and the dual crop coefficient er raki et al 2008 are gathered in table 2 these recommended k c values show a clear discrepancy one way to explain so is that crop coefficients depend on variable factors they integrate climatic factors yang et al 2003 plant biophysical characteristics consoli and papa 2013 irrigation management and soil evaporation maestre valero et al 2017 these factors and processes are directly impacted by agricultural practices another comparison helping to locate this experiment s results is comparing the derived k c act values to different values reported for citrus orchards from multiple published studies table 2 from the collected values there is an immense contrast between the same values computed in one country er raki et al 2008 heitz et al 2011 bouazzama et al 2008 indicate entirely different results the values from er raki et al 2008 in the table are as they were cited in jamshidi et al 2020 a range of crop coefficient values has also been suggested as a result of numerous studies looking at citrus et c based on the dual k c approach er raki et al 2008 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 the diversity and complexity of meteorological conditions irrigation control plant physical and biological characteristics and soil evaporation rates are probably to blame for these differences in the reported kc values the requirement for local calibrations is further highlighted by the inherent anomalies in kc coming from its empirical determination particularly under drought circumstances maestre valero et al 2017 employed the ec approach which was linked to soil water balance fao56 by er raki et al 2009 also different approaches were utilized to estimate evapotranspiration values for citrus castel 2000 combined data from drainage and weighing lysimeters using the swb technique k cmid 0 55 in spain water use efficiency was assessed by the analytic hierarchy process ahp technique and a new synthetic irrigation efficiency index iei was elaborated poveda bautista et al 2021 this study emphasized the significance of assessing the effectiveness of irrigation water use in the moroccan context nassah et al 2018 adopted relative deep percolation ratio the result recorded an average annual dp r value of 43 in the haouz region of morocco the same value recorded in this experiment for the first year in other studies dp r equals about 11 in arid and semi arid climates garcía petillo and castel 2007 lower than the obtained dp r irrigation assessment leads to the necessity of appropriate irrigation scheduling even when micro irrigation distribution systems and water saving management strategies are used the hydrological models can be thought of as an accessible tool for indirect evaluations of soil and crop water status targeted at identifying irrigation schedule parameters rallo et al 2017 the fao 56 paper contains some ambiguity especially in citrus orchards where crop water use is influenced by tree light interception or crop load consoli et al 2006 rallo et al 2021 moreover the importance of monitoring the soil plant atmosphere continuum to identify precise thresholds of permissible soil depletion for precision irrigation scheduling was demonstrated by the ecophysiological linkages in puig sirera et al 2021 the same study determined a threshold of depletion factor p 0 41 to create a site specific irrigation scheduling protocol for citrus the eddy covariance allows the measurement of hsonic and le for an area of few hectares depending on the wind speed ezzahar et al 2007 however the measurement of the net radiation rn and the soil flux g remain a punctual information allen et al 2011 indeed the dual k c approach could have been better to use allen et al 2011 currently it needs more time to do the new simulations 5 conclusions the study is the first application of the ec technique in citrus farming in the souss massa region characterized by a semi arid climate worsened by water scarcity generally the meteorological conditions are similar to the ones of the mediterranean area characterized by a semi arid climate the latter leads to reference evapotranspiration values being high reflecting a considerable climatic demand nevertheless the annual average rainfall is lower than the crop water requirement meaning there is an obvious need to supply water through irrigation the et o values computed following the penman monteith equation from the fao 56 paper can be reliable for elaborating an irrigation protocol allowing the adjustment of crop coefficient values the derived kc act values for the citrus orchard at the three growth stage initial mid and late season are 0 64 0 58 and 0 64 respectively on the other hand the research investigates dp in citrus orchards using drip irrigation in a semi arid climate and develops a method based on the fao 56 model for defining irrigation schemes and optimizing irrigation under the region s specific conditions the results demonstrate that the water balance equation gives a very high dp of about 813 mm year with a rough dp r value of 52 percent it is in line with the measured soil water moisture level the fao 56 simple approach was employed to determine the proper irrigation amounts the results reveal that by considering rainfall the model proposes a far lower quantity of irrigation than the farmer allocates according to the model calculations it appears that on average around 55 of the water supply may be saved this research has shown that for sustainable water management a tailor made drip irrigation schedule is required indeed drip irrigation reduces water losses to evapotranspiration however losses to deep percolation need to be lowered through the control of water flow into the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9187,imprecise irrigation hinders the sustainable development of the fruit tree crop intercropping system in the loess gully area of china drip fertigation was applied for two years as part of an apple soybean intercropping system to optimize local water and nutrient management patterns the effects of different drip irrigation and fertilizer levels on photosynthetic characteristics soil nutrients and their interspecific competitions were studied the treatments were four irrigation levels namely 60 w1 70 w2 80 w3 and 90 w4 of field capacity fc and three nitrogen fertilization levels namely 59 f1 92 f2 and 124 kg ha 1 f3 the control ck was a rain fed neither irrigation nor fertilizer crop the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and soybean yield gy increased at first but then decreased as irrigation and fertilizer application levels rose the partial factor productivity pfp decreased as fertilization increased but the soil available nitrogen content showed the opposite trend the soil nutrients and soybean pn and tr were positively correlated with distance from the apple tree row the interspecific competition intensity for light and soil water decreased from

irrigation is the main irrigation method in alley cropping systems across the loess gully area of western shanxi china however flood irrigation can lead to considerable water evaporation and reduce water and fertilizer utilization efficiency in intercropping systems dou et al 2022a zhou et al 2019b drip irrigation has a line source distribution and can directly apply water and nutrients to areas near the plant roots which is more effective than flood irrigation li et al 2021a currently drip irrigation is mainly used in monoculture and relay intercropping systems abdalhi et al 2016 sandhu et al 2019a ye et al 2019 however the interspecific light and soil nutrient interactions between perennial fruit trees intercropped with annual crops under drip irrigation are not clear unlike relay intercropping the interspecific interactions between intercropping perennial fruit trees and annual crops vary from year to year sanchez 1995 simultaneously under drip irrigation the water and fertilizer input modes can affect the physiological growths of the aboveground and belowground parts of the intercropping crops which further alters the interspecific interactions chen et al 2020 in turn variations in interspecific interactions can also change the growth of the aboveground and belowground components of the system li et al 2009 ultimately these factors together can change the economic benefits of the system lu et al 2021 sandhu et al 2019a however the complex variations in the interspecific interactions associated with the distribution and utilization of soil water and nutrients between intercropping systems and monocultures could lead to differences in plant photosynthetic characteristics which means that the optimal water and fertilizer modes for alley cropping systems under drip irrigation are still unclear the interspecific interactions in agroforestry systems mainly include competition and complementarity between the aboveground and belowground plant parts yang et al 2017 under rain fed conditions the intercropping system reduces soil water content soil nutrient content the net photosynthetic rate and crop yields compared to monoculture systems in general these indexes increase with distance from the tree row which suggests that intercropping systems have negative marginal effects due to interspecific competition for soil moisture nutrients and light gao et al 2013 xu et al 2013 yun et al 2012 irrigation and fertilization can meet the water and nutrient demands of the crops during the peak growth period of intercropping systems perdoná and soratto 2015 zhao et al 2016 a previous study showed that fertilization allowed the intercropping crops to absorb more soil nutrients and increased crop yields eaglesham et al 1981 simultaneously irrigation may have promoted soil nutrients availability reduced competition for soil moisture and nutrients and enhanced the complementarity of crops toward water and nutrients lenka et al 2013 however when the amount of irrigation and fertilization exceeded or fell below a certain range crop physiological and soil biochemical processes were inhibited gheysari et al 2009 warren et al 2003 zhang et al 2021 plant photosynthetic physiology and soil nutrients are important manifestations of crop physiology and soil biochemical processes therefore plant growth and development are also simultaneously influenced by soil nutrient content and photosynthetic characteristics which are also regulated by irrigation and fertilization chai et al 2014 therefore photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients are the key indexes used to evaluate the comprehensive benefits of irrigation and fertilization management cao et al 2017 li et al 2019 a previous study in the loess gully area found that under flood irrigation adequate water and fertilizer application can improve the soil nutrients status and promote the crop photosynthetic parameters for apple maize intercropping systems zhou et al 2019b it has also been reported that the interspecific competition for light and nutrients in the intercropping system intensified with the intercropping years under flood irrigation dou et al 2022a zheng et al 2021 however the effects of drip irrigation on plant photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients are still unclear which has made it difficult to identify the optimal application of drip irrigation in fruit crop intercropping systems it has been reported that under drip irrigation the distribution area for soil water and nutrients was more concentrated than that under flood irrigation li et al 2021b therefore in the intercropping system the interaction between photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients under drip irrigation may be different from flood irrigation a previous study found that the growth of the maize canopy increased the interception of light under drip irrigation which had a negative impact on the photosynthetic characteristics of sugarcane baker and blamey 1985 similarly chen et al 2020 reported that under drip irrigation the no3 n in the surface layer migrated from the tomato area to the maize area in a horizontal direction the interspecific interactions between the photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients in intercropping systems under rain fed and flood irrigation conditions are well established gao et al 2013 gong et al 2021 yang et al 2016 however the interspecific interactions between perennial fruit trees and annual crops under drip irrigation especially with regards to the aboveground and belowground parts are still unclear therefore to maximize the use of resources and optimize current irrigation practices on the loess plateau the alley cropping system photosynthetic characteristics soil nutrients and their interspecific interactions need to be investigated when different drip water combined with fertilizer regimes are applied the main objectives of our study were to investigate i the effects of different drip irrigation water and fertilizer levels on the photosynthetic characteristics soil nutrients and interspecific interactions in the system and ii optimization measures for water and fertilizer management in an apple soybean alley cropping system on the loess plateau of west shanxi china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was conducted at the forest

filling stage august 30 to september 20 in 2019 with correspondingly less precipitation during the other growth stages according to the standards set by the shanxi institute of meteorological sciences 2018 was a normal year whereas 2019 was a dry year 2 3 2 photosynthetic characteristics two li 6400 portable photosynthesis systems li cor inc lincoln ne usa were used to determine the photosynthetic parameters on two cloudless days during the soybean podding and filling stages july 20 and august 23 2018 and july 25 and august 29 2019 the photosynthetic indicators investigated in this study were the net photosynthetic rate pn µmol co2 m 2 s 1 and transpiration rate tr mmol h2o m 2 s 1 of the apple and soybean leaves the sample sites for soybean were 1 0 1 7 and 2 4 m away from the tree row fig 1 and the soybean plant nearest to the sampling sites was selected and labeled three middle leaves from the upper triple compound leaves of each labeled soybean plant were used to measure the photosynthetic indexes three healthy leaves on new apple branches were used to measure the photosynthesis indicators at a vertical height of 1 5 1 8 m on the sunny side of each tree measurements were taken every 2 h from 09 00 17 00 h and each leaf was measured three times and the results averaged 2 3 3 soil moisture determination the irrigation amount was calculated using the equation for irrigating rain fed crops man et al 2014 as follows 1 m 10 γ h θ w θ 0 where m is the amount of irrigation mm h is the depth of soil to be kept moist θ w is the target gravimetric water content of

4 determination of soil nutrients the sampling points for soil nutrients were the same as for swc after the soybean harvest soil samples from each plot were taken using an auger at 20 cm intervals from 0 to 60 cm depth fig 1 the soil was divided into two sub samples after sieving it to 5 mm one sample was used to determine the soil n content no 3 n and nh4 n while the other was air dried for the soil organic matter som analysis ammonium nitrogen an and nitrate nitrogen nn were measured using kcl 2 mol l 1 solution extraction and a smartchem automatic chemical analyzer 450 ams alliance rome italy the soil organic matter was measured by the concentrated sulfuric acid potassium dichromate plus thermal oxidation method nelson 1996 2 3 5 root measurements the apple tree and soybean

soybean roots were distinguished by their different color apple tree roots are red whereas soybean roots are yellowish the soybean root length density rld and apple root length density arld were calculated by analyzing images of the apple tree and soybean roots using winrhizo software ver 2003 reagent instruments inc quebec canada the spatial distribution of the apple tree and soybean roots is presented in dou et al 2022b 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 grain yield gy and partial factor productivity pfp at harvest october 18 2018 october 20 2019 all soybean plants on the plots were harvested and sun dried by local farmers then the soybean grain was stripped and weighed and the grain yield gy kg ha 1 was calculated the production of apples was not calculated as the apple trees did not fruit during the experiment the partial factor productivity pfp kg kg 1 is the ratio of grain yield per unit area of intercropped soybean to nitrogen fertilizer application per unit area dou et al 2022a calculated as follows 2 pfp gy f where f is the total amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied kg ha 1 2 4 2 daily mean photosynthetic index the daily mean photosynthetic index of each treatment was obtained by averaging the values at distances of 1 0 1 7 and 2 4 m from the tree row at 9 00 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 table 3 the leaf intrinsic water use efficiency wuei μmol h2o mmol 1 co2 was determined using the following equation 3 wuei pn tr 2 4 3 interspecific interactions the slope of the regression line was used to describe the interspecific interactions gao et al 2013 zhou et al 2019b the variation rates for the photosynthetic index were derived from univariate linear regression of the photosynthetic index values at three points 1 0 1 7 and 2 4 m from the tree row table 4 similarly the rld arld soil nutrients and soil moisture slopes were determined by linearly fitting the index values for rows that were 0 5 1 0 1 75 and 2 5 m away from the tree row the rld arld soil nutrients and soil moisture values at 0 40 cm depth were averaged from the values recorded at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth the number 1 after the rld arld soil nutrients and swc abbreviations means that the subsequent value is for the 0 40 cm soil layer and number 2 represents their values at 40 60 cm soil depth e g rld1 and rld2 table 5 the soil layer was divided into two parts 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth to show the difference in the correlations for interspecific interactions in the vertical direction 2 4 4 correlation analysis a correlation analysis pearson s correlation coefficient was used to show the correlation relationship between the indexes for the aboveground and belowground parts the original values of the soil nutrients for each treatment in the correlation analysis were averaged from four different distances from the tree rows 0 5 2 5 m while the original values of the soybean photosynthetic indexes are derived from table 3 similarly the data in tables 4 and 5 were used for a correlation analysis of the slopes 2 4 5 comprehensive benefit a principal component analysis pca was used to calculate the comprehensive score for each treatment using the following equation table 6 4 q a q 1 b q 2 where q is the comprehensive score for each treatment using a pca that involved the following indicators photosynthetic parameters of soybean and apple gy rld arld soil nutrients and swc q 1 and q 2 are the scores of the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 of each treatment the a and b terms are the proportions of the variance rate contributed by pc1 and pc2 respectively to the cumulative variance contribution rate of the extracted principal component zheng et al 2022 2 4 6 multiple regression analysis a multiple regression analysis was used to obtain the relationship between irrigation and fertilization and gy pfp rld arld and pn in the regression analysis the water input and fertilizer rate for each treatment were normalized z score to eliminate the effects of dimension and self variation the calculation formula for the coded values is as follows 5 x x μ σ where x is the coded value of each treatment x is the raw data for each treatment μ is the mean value of the overall data and σ is the standard deviation of the overall data the coded values are shown in table 1 the horizontal projection of the multiple regression equations for pn rld arld pfp and gy were used to determine an optimal water and fertilizer input range dou et al 2022a pier and doerge 1995 2 5 statistical analyses graph construction and the principal component analysis were conducted using origin 2021 origin lab northampton ma usa the analysis of variance anova and linear regression were conducted using spss ver 16 0 spss inc chicago il usa and the nonlinear multivariate regression analysis was conducted using matlab ver 2018b mathworks natick ma usa the treatment means for the photosynthetic characteristics were compared by the least significant difference lsd test at the 5 level 3 results 3 1 effects of water and fertilizer regulation on photosynthetic indexes the daily average values for the photosynthesis indicators under the different treatments are shown in table 3 at a given level of irrigation the pn and tr for apple leaves reached their maximum values under f2 they increased initially and then decreased as the fertilizer dose rose in 2018 and 2019 the average values for pn and tr in the experimental treatments for both years were significantly higher than for ck except for tr at the w1 level in 2019 p 0 05 the daily average values for pn and tr among the treatments in 2018 and 2019 were 16 08 68 39 and 5 59 79 21 greater than those for ck respectively at the same fertilizer level pn and tr first increased but then decreased as the irrigation level rose and the w3 and w1 treatments produced the maximum and minimum values in both years respectively the w3f2 and ck treatments produced the maximum and minimum pn and tr values in 2018 and 2019 respectively at the same fertilization level the wuei for apple leaves decreased at first and then increased as the irrigation level rose in 2018 but it just decreased in 2019 the maximum value for wuei occurred in w1f1 for both years while the minimum value occurred in w3f2 in 2018 and w3f1 in 2019 the soybean pn tr and wuei trends for the irrigation and fertilizer treatments were similar to those of apple the pn and tr among all the experimental treatments were significantly higher than ck p 0 05 and the daily mean values were 10 22 47 99 and 10 29 105 12 greater than those for the ck respectively over the two years the maximum daily mean values for pn and tr occurred in the w3f2 treatment for both years which was the same for apple the soybean wuei decreased at first and then increased with irrigation at the same fertilization level in 2018 and 2019 reaching a maximum at the w1 level and a minimum at the w3 level the w1f1 treatment produced the maximum wuei in both years while the minimum wuei value occurred in w3f2 the overall pn and tr for the apple and soybean treatments decreased by 1 64 23 17 and 8 91 32 53 respectively in 2019 compared to 2018 whereas wuei increased by 28 85 49 69 the fertilization and irrigation factors had significant effects on the daily mean pn and tr values of the soybean and apple leaves in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 over the two years the f values for irrigation were generally greater than those for fertilization in apple and soybean 3 2 effects of water and fertilizer regulation on soil nutrients irrigation and fertilization increased an and nn among all experimental treatments compared to ck in both 2018 and 2019 fig 4 at the same level of irrigation an and nn in the 0 60 cm soil layer generally increased with fertilization level in both years reaching a maximum at the f3 level in 2018 the total nn and som values for the three soil layers 0 60 cm increased at first and then decreased with increasing irrigation level under the same fertilization conditions with the maximum and the minimum values occurring at the w3 and w1 levels the nn and som at the w3 level increased by 1 79 21 45 compared to the other irrigation treatments average of l1 l4 in 2019 the trend for the total nn values for the three soil layers 0 60 cm was similar to that in 2018 with the largest values occurring at the w2 or w3 levels which increased by 1 84 31 58 average of l1 l4 compared to the other irrigation levels the an and nn values throughout the whole 0 60 cm soil layer rose as the horizontal distance from the tree row increased in both years in 2018 and 2019 the maximum and minimum an and nn values in the 0 60 cm soil layer both appeared at 2 5 m l4 and 0 5 m l1 away from the tree although the extreme values for som appeared at different distances vertically an nn and som generally decreased with increasing soil depth at the different distances from the tree row in 2018 and 2019 however an showed a greater soil nutrient content in the 20 40 cm soil layer than in the 0 20 cm layer at the w4 level in both years a similar trend was observed for nn in 2018 and 2019 where the maximum value in the w4 level occurred in the 20 40 cm or 40 60 cm layer this showed that soil nitrate nitrogen accumulated in the deeper layers of the soil when the w4 level was applied there was no significant differences in an content between 2019 and 2018 while nn increased by 3 01 and som declined by 16 mean values for the different treatments distance from the tree rows and depths in 2018 and 2019 fertilization and distance from the tree row had significant effects on an and nn p 0 01 while irrigation only had a significant effect on nn p 0 05 meanwhile the irrigation fertilizer interaction had no significant effect on soil nutrients p 0 05 3 3 aboveground and belowground interspecific competition the degree of the slope was used to indicate the effect of interspecific competition on photosynthesis and the results are shown in table 4 a higher absolute value for the regression coefficient indicated a greater apple tree effect on soybean leaf photosynthesis overall both pn and tr for the treatments showed linear relationships with regards to the distance between the soybean and the rows of apple in 2018 and 2019 while the slopes for wuei were generally not significant p 0 05 in both years the pn and tr slopes for distance from the tree row were positive for all treatments which revealed that pn and tr rose as the distance from the tree row increased whereas the wuei showed a decreasing trend apart from ck the 2019 slope values for pn were lower than that of 2018 the same pattern occurred for tr where apart from w3f3 and w4f3 the slope values for tr among most treatments in 2019 were lower than that of 2018 conversely apart from the w2f1 and w3f1 treatments the absolute value of the slope for wuei in 2019 was higher than that in 2018 the slopes showing the soil nutrients characteristics swc rld and arld relationships with distance from the tree row are shown in table 5 the rld swc and soil nutrients slopes were positive in both years except for som and arld indicating that the nutrients swc and rld generally rose as the distance from the tree row increased combined with the photosynthetic index during the two years the slopes for the aboveground and belowground parts were basically positive except for som arld and wuei overall the slope trend for the belowground index was more significant than that for the aboveground index in contrast to pn and tr the absolute value of the slopes for rld arld and nn in the 0 40 cm average of the 0 20 cm layer and the 20 40 cm layer and 40 60 cm soil layers generally increased by 7 76 74 26 in 2019 compared to 2018 mean value of the slope for all treatments however the absolute value of the slopes for som and swc in the two soil layers decreased by 21 44 66 22 in 2019 compared to 2018 meanwhile the slope for an at 0 40 cm depth increased by 9 52 while the slope for an at 40 60 cm decreased by 4 43 this indicated that the intensity of the interspecific interactions among rld arld and nn increased to a certain extent in dry years which was the opposite to pn tr and swc 3 4 correlation between aboveground and belowground indicators the correlations among the soybean photosynthetic characteristics and rld soil nutrients gy and swc are shown in fig 5 a and b in 2018 pn tr rld gy swc and soil nutrients were highly positively correlated with each other however wuei was negatively correlated with the other indices in 2019 the correlations among each indicator were similar to that of 2018 whereas the correlations between som and the other indexes were weaker than that in 2018 the rld an and nn correlations with pn and tr in the 0 40 cm layer for both years were stronger than those in the 40 60 cm layer this showed that the interaction between the belowground part and the aboveground part in the surface soil layer was stronger than that in the deep layer there was a positive correlation between the 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers for rld swc an nn and som in both years p 0 05 the rld correlations with an nn and som in the 0 40 cm soil layer were stronger than that in the 40 60 cm layer in 2018 and 2019 a correlation of the linear regression slopes analysis was used to investigate the correlation relationship between interspecific competition and the aboveground and belowground indicators fig 5 c and d overall the correlation for the slope between the aboveground and belowground indicators was weaker than its absolute value however the rld1 and rld2 slopes were both positively correlated in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 which was consistent with their absolute value indicating that there was a strong interaction between interspecific competition among the roots in the 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers the slope showing the relationship between pn and wuei showed that they were positively correlated in both years but the relationship in 2019 was stronger than that in 2018 similarly the correlation between the slope for the relationship between an1 and som2 in 2019 was stronger than that in 2018 although the correlation between the slope for nn in the 0 40 cm layer and tr was not significant in 2018 p 0 05 it was significantly positively correlated in 2019 p 0 01 these results suggested that the correlation for interspecific competition among the indicators was not the same in the different years the comprehensive benefits of different irrigation and fertilization treatments were investigated using a principal component analysis of the indicators used to characterize the aboveground and belowground plant parts and the soil fig 6 pc1 mainly reflected a comprehensive index for the photosynthetic characteristics of soybean and apple while pc2 mainly represented a comprehensive index for soybean yield soil nutrients and soil moisture the pc1 and pc2 results explained 60 6 and 21 4 of the variation in a total of 26 samples taken over the two years respectively in general the score ranking among treatments was w3 w4 w2 w1 ck and f2 f3 f1 ck in terms of cp1 and cp2 for both years the cp2 in 2019 was higher than that in 2018 while it was the opposite for cp1 the comprehensive score for all treatments in 2018 was higher than that in 2019 table 6 meanwhile the treatments with the highest and lowest comprehensive scores were w3f2 and ck in both years 3 5 pfp gy and quantitative relationships fertilization irrigation and the irrigation fertilizer interactions had significant effects on gy and soybean pfp in both years p 0 01 fig 7 at a given level of irrigation pfp gradually decreased as fertilizer dose increased in 2018 and 2019 at the same fertilization level pfp increased at first and then decreased as the irrigation level rose in both years with the maximum values occurring at the w3 level the minimum value for pfp occurred in w1f3 for both years while the maximum values occurred in w3f1 in 2018 and w4f1 in 2019 the gy increased at first and then decreased as the irrigation and fertilization rates rose in 2018 and 2019 with the maximum value occurring in the w3f2 treatment this indicated that yield did not increase continuously with irrigation and fertilization however the grain yield increased by 33 34 77 08 in 2019 compared to 2018 among all the treatments with the largest increase rate occurring in w4f3 after evaluating the integrated indicator data for the two years we derived a quantitative relationship between total water input level irrigation and rainfall and fertilizer dose and pn gy pfp and root length density the results of the nonlinear multivariate regression analysis are shown in fig 8 the multiple regression equation showed that the maximum values for soybean pn apple pn rld arld gy and pfp in the fitted equations were 16 42 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 15 61 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 0 19 cm cm 3 0 05 cm cm 3 2493 58 kg hm 2 and 38 0 kg kg 1 respectively but the maximum values of the six indexes were not reached at the same irrigation or fertilization levels the horizontal projection of the regression equations showed that when the water input range was between 4624 49 and 4795 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 and the fertilization amount was between 84 10 and 107 27 kg ha 1 a 1 soybean pn apple pn rld arld and gy could reach 94 100 of the maximum value of the multiple regression equation and pfp could reach 68 73 of the maximum value of the multiple regression equation 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drip fertilizer regulation on photosynthetic indexes and soil nutrients the fertilization and irrigation factors under drip irrigation generally had significant effects on the photosynthetic indexes for the aboveground parts p 0 01 table 3 in 2018 and 2019 increases in the irrigation and fertilization levels led to initial increases in apple and soybean pn and tr but they then decreased and the maximum values appeared at the f2 and w3 80 fc levels this was inconsistent with earlier studies involving flood irrigation in which the pn zhou et al 2019b and tr zheng et al 2022 values increased with the increase in irrigation reaching their maximum values at the 85 fc irrigation level the flood irrigation may have increased irrigation water evaporation and or runoff losses compared to drip irrigation kucukyumuk et al 2012 therefore increasing the irrigation level may have continuously promoted water consumption by crop transpiration which boosted the pn and tr of the crops furthermore this result was also inconsistent with an earlier study involving an apple monoculture system in which the pn tr and stomatal conductance increased with increasing fertilization zhou et al 2019a this phenomenon may be due to the oversupply of fertilizer f3 which can reduce the carbon dioxide assimilation capacity of plant mesophyll cells whereas medium doses f2 can boost the aboveground biomass and vegetation coverage by intercropping systems this would ease the high temperatures at noon and improve the farmland microclimate zhou et al 2019b alternatively it may be because the water and fertilizer utilization rates in the intercropping system were higher than that in the monoculture system mårtensson et al 2022 nie et al 2012 which meant that the intercropping system was more prone to excessive supplies of water and fertilizer the order for apple and soybean wuei was w1 w2 w4 w3 in both years the highest irrigation level may have decreased stomatal resistance by the leaves and resulted in a higher increase rate for tr than pn liu et al 2021 shang et al 2020 therefore moderate deficit irrigation could reduce transpiration and improve the leaf wuei the daily averages for pn and tr in apple and soybean decreased with the increase in intercropping years whereas wuei increased this may be attributed to the rainfall during the growth period in 2018 being 81 6 mm more than that in 2019 thus the ineffective use of soil moisture in 2018 was greater than that in 2019 simultaneously the high water use efficiency shown by the drip irrigation system meant that the reduction in rainfall led to an improvement in wuei fertilization had significant effects on an and nn p 0 05 fig 4 at the same level of irrigation an and nn in the 0 60 cm soil layer generally increased with fertilization level in both years and all the coupled treatments increased the available nitrogen content compared to ck this meant that irrigation and fertilization can increase the soil nitrogen content and reduce nutrient stress in 2018 and 2019 at the same fertilizer application rate the total nn across the three soil layers 0 60 cm increased at first and then decreased with the increase in irrigation amount and the maximum value appeared in w2 or w3 this result was consistent with an earlier study in which n fertilizer that was applied at rates above the crop requirement level tended to cause the nn to migrate with the water qiang et al 2021 therefore nn migration at the w4 level may cause more losses than at the w2 or w3 levels the results also showed that at the w4 level 90 fc the maximum nn values appeared in the 20 40 cm or 40 60 cm layers in a vertical direction this was inconsistent with an earlier study on flood irrigation dou et al 2022a when the irrigation level exceeded just 65 fc a large amount of soil nitrate nitrogen migrated to the deep layer one possible reason for this difference is that the water infiltration rate via drip irrigation was slower than that of flood irrigation jin et al 2018 so the amount of deep soil moisture and nutrient leakage was less at the same irrigation level parr and bertrand 1960 another possible explanation is that the water distribution range under drip irrigation was smaller than that under flood irrigation which meant that the soybean and fruit tree roots were mainly concentrated in the upper and lower soil layers respectively this was conducive to the niche separation of roots wang et al 2021 therefore the niche separation of roots promoted fruit trees and crops to make full use of the nutrients in the different soil layers which decreased the deep leaching of soil nutrients kumar and jose 2016 in 2019 the soil nn content increased to some extent while som decreased by 16 compared to 2018 mean values of the different treatments distance from the tree rows and depths the reason for this may be that fertilization and nitrogen fixation by soybean rhizobia increased the nn content of the soil liang et al 2020 alternatively before the experiment in 2018 the som mainly came from the backfilling of weeds between the rows of fruit trees however when the soybeans were harvested in 2018 the soybean plants and roots were entirely pulled out of the soil the organic matter returned to the soil was less than the organic matter consumed and decomposed during the growth period of the plants resulting in a decline in som as a result reasonable applications of organic fertilizer or straw returning combined with chemical fertilizer may be a favorable measure to improve comprehensive soil fertility 4 2 interspecific competition between aboveground and belowground plant parts there is competition and complementarity for light water and fertilizer in intercropping systems this study showed that soybean pn and tr have a linearly increasing relationship with distance from the tree row table 4 this result was consistent with studies on the intercropping of fruit trees and dwarf crops zheng et al 2022 the slopes of the belowground parts were basically positive except for som and arld table 5 this may be due to the fact that the niche overlap degree of the roots system was inversely related to distance from the tree dou et al 2022b xu et al 2013 therefore the competition for soil nutrients was stronger in the area close to the fruit tree row in general the slope trend for the overall aboveground index was more significant than that of the belowground index a possible reason for this was that the interactions among the belowground parts of each plant type were more complex than that of the aboveground parts due to the influence of soil biochemical properties duchene et al 2017 fu et al 2019 therefore the variation trend for the belowground indicators in the horizontal direction of the system may be nonlinear dou et al 2022a in this study the interspecific interaction between rld arld and nn increased to a certain extent in 2019 compared to 2018 which was the opposite to pn tr and swc the possible reasons for this are as follows the pn and tr of apple and soybean decreased in response to the dry year in 2019 which also reduced interspecific competition for light in addition the interspecific competition between the roots may have intensified with the intercropping years because the growth of the underground roots was related to the number of growing years sun et al 2018 meanwhile the reduction in soil water content during the dry year also reduced water competition within the belowground part to a certain extent in 2019 similar to the roots system the competition for nutrients was related to the intercropping years because the fertilizer inputs were the same for both years dou et al 2022a therefore the competition for nutrients intensified with growing years in addition the growth of the fruit tree canopy meant that shading near the tree row increased however the slopes for pn and tr decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 a possible reason for this is that soybeans in the row nearest the tree row adapted to shading and improved their utilization of diffuse light which is more suitable for photosynthesis than direct light zhang et al 2018 concurrently water input by drip irrigation also improved the water and nutrient utilization rate of the crops therefore the photosynthetic characteristics of soybean near the tree row increased in 2019 and the competition for light by the aboveground part decreased these results may also indicate that drip irrigation can regulate the soil environment near plant roots to optimize the interspecific interaction between the aboveground and belowground parts of the intercropping system the rld was positively correlated with all the other indicators except wuei and the correlation coefficient for the roots system in the 0 40 cm layer was higher than that for the 40 60 cm layer fig 5 this showed that there were differences in the interactions shown by soybean roots in a vertical direction the results also suggested that the line source distribution of soil moisture under drip irrigation can lead to the separation of root niches which would reduce belowground competition li et al 2009 although the correlation between the nn slope for the 0 40 cm layer and tr was not significant in 2018 p 0 05 it was significantly positively correlated in 2019 p 0 01 this result suggested that the correlation relationship for the interspecific interaction between nn and the tr may be affected by planting years this may be due to the changes in the root and canopy biomasses of the fruit trees with planting years which would affect the nn distribution and photosynthetic characteristics these results should be confirmed using longer observation periods in future experiments 4 3 pfp gy and quantitative relationships the grain yield increased by 33 34 77 08 in 2019 compared to 2018 across all the treatments fig 7 this was inconsistent with a previous study zheng et al 2022 in which the soybean yield decreased to some extent in dry years a possible reason for this was that compared to flood irrigation drip irrigation and fertilization may improve the efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization li et al 2021b and alleviate water and nutrient stress in dry years another possible reason for this is that under the same fertilization conditions the rainfall in 2018 was 81 6 mm more than that in 2019 which led to more soil moisture being consumed by transpiration which then caused decreases in wuei and pfp and excessive crop growth furthermore in this study competition by the aboveground part of soybean for light and the belowground part for water decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 tables 4 and 5 therefore the complementarity of intercropping may have increased the soybean yield in 2019 at the same fertilization level gy and pfp increased at first and then decreased as irrigation levels rose in both years and the maximum value appeared at the w3 level this may be because the roots absorbed and utilized more soil nutrients at high levels of irrigation and that excessive irrigation promoted the nutrients absorbed by the roots to be used for vegetative growth of the aboveground part and root biomass ebel et al 1995 the growth of root biomass and the canopy increased interspecific competition thus the highest water and fertilizer levels did not produce the highest yields dou et al 2022a zhou et al 2019b the w3 irrigation level combined with the f2 fertilizer level had the best photosynthetic characteristics soil nutrient contents and crop yields therefore the w3f2 treatment was the optimal treatment under drip irrigation and fertilization the principal component analysis of the nine indexes also confirmed that the benefits of the intercropping system can be maximized by combining the medium fertilization f2 level with irrigation at 80 fc w3 fig 6 the multiple regression equations aimed to establish an optimal model for a water and fertilizer regime we found that when the water input was between 4624 49 and 4795 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 i e 1019 49 1190 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 irrigation amount and the fertilization amount was between 84 10 and 107 27 kg ha 1 a 1 gy pn of apple and soybean rld arld and pfp can reach 68 100 of the maximum value of their regression equation fig 8 however previous studies considered that the optimal regulation of water and fertilizer in an apple maize alley cropping system under flood irrigation was achieved with irrigation set at 433 1633 m3 ha 1 a 1 and a 70 empirical fertilizer application of 289 0 118 0 118 0 kg ha 1 a 1 n p k compound fertilizer dou et al 2022a zhou et al 2019b the amount of recommended irrigation according to this study was less than the previous studies even though water consumption by soybean is higher than that of corn zheng et al 2021 zhou et al 2019b therefore drip irrigation can considerably reduce water resource use compared to flood irrigation and is a more suitable irrigation method for alley cropping systems in the local area however the interspecific interaction results for the roots system and the canopy distribution of perennial fruit trees did not fully correlate with the increase in intercropping years the model recommended in this paper may only be useful when 4 5 year old apple trees are used therefore there needs to be further studies on older trees 5 conclusion under drip fertigation the fertilization and irrigation factors had significant effects on the daily mean photosynthetic indexes for apple and soybean in 2018 and 2019 in both 2018 and 2019 pn and tr for apple and soybean reached their maximum values at the moderate fertilization level f2 with the w3 irrigation level irrigation and fertilization can increase the an and nn content and alleviate the competition for nutrients the photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients generally rose as the distance from the tree row increased except for wuei and som the interspecific competition for soil nitrate nitrogen and between the roots increased with the intercropped planting years whereas the competition for soil moisture and light decreased the correlation for interspecific competition between the aboveground and belowground index was weak and varied with intercropping years the gy and pfp values increased at first and then decreased with the increase in irrigation for both years and the maximum value occurred at the w3 level a principal component analysis indicated that in the apple soybean alley cropping system the medium fertilization f2 level combined with the 85 fc irrigation level w3 had the highest comprehensive benefit a multiple regression analysis showed that a water input range of 4624 49 4795 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 combined with a 84 10 107 27 kg ha 1 a 1 nitrogen fertilizer application was most beneficial during the first 4 5 years of the intercropping system

9187,imprecise irrigation hinders the sustainable development of the fruit tree crop intercropping system in the loess gully area of china drip fertigation was applied for two years as part of an apple soybean intercropping system to optimize local water and nutrient management patterns the effects of different drip irrigation and fertilizer levels on photosynthetic characteristics soil nutrients and their interspecific competitions were studied the treatments were four irrigation levels namely 60 w1 70 w2 80 w3 and 90 w4 of field capacity fc and three nitrogen fertilization levels namely 59 f1 92 f2 and 124 kg ha 1 f3 the control ck was a rain fed neither irrigation nor fertilizer crop the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and soybean yield gy increased at first but then decreased as irrigation and fertilizer application levels rose the partial factor productivity pfp decreased as fertilization increased but the soil available nitrogen content showed the opposite trend the soil nutrients and soybean pn and tr were positively correlated with distance from the apple tree row the interspecific competition intensity for light and soil water decreased from 2018 to 2019 while root and soil nitrate nitrogen nn increased the interspecific competition correlation between the aboveground and belowground parts was weak and varied between the two intercropping years a principal component analysis showed that treatment w3f2 had the highest comprehensive score thus a combination of irrigation at 80 fc and 92 kg ha 1 nitrogen fertilizer application is optimal for the system a multiple regression analysis indicated a water input range of 4624 49 4795 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 combined with 84 10 107 27 kg ha 1 a 1 fertilizer application was suitable for optimal

introduction irrigation and fertilization play important roles in achieving high and stable crop yields across areas where water and nutrient resources are scarce rufat et al 2014 at present border irrigation is the main irrigation method in alley cropping systems across the loess gully area of western shanxi china however flood irrigation can lead to considerable water evaporation and reduce water and fertilizer utilization efficiency in intercropping systems dou et al 2022a zhou et al 2019b drip irrigation has a line source distribution and can directly apply water and nutrients to areas near the plant roots which is more effective than flood irrigation li et al 2021a currently drip irrigation is mainly used in monoculture and relay intercropping systems abdalhi et al 2016 sandhu et al 2019a ye et al 2019 however the interspecific light and soil nutrient interactions between perennial fruit trees intercropped with annual crops under drip irrigation are not clear unlike relay intercropping the interspecific interactions between intercropping perennial fruit trees and annual crops vary from year to year sanchez 1995 simultaneously under drip irrigation the water and fertilizer input modes can affect the physiological growths of the aboveground and belowground parts of the intercropping crops which further alters the interspecific interactions chen et al 2020 in turn variations in interspecific interactions can also change the growth of the aboveground and belowground components of the system li et al 2009 ultimately these factors together can change the economic benefits of the system lu et al 2021 sandhu et al 2019a however the complex variations in the interspecific interactions associated with the distribution and utilization of soil water and nutrients between intercropping systems and monocultures could lead to differences in plant photosynthetic characteristics which means that the optimal water and fertilizer modes for alley cropping systems under drip irrigation are still unclear the interspecific interactions in agroforestry systems mainly include competition and complementarity between the aboveground and belowground plant parts yang et al 2017 under rain fed conditions the intercropping system reduces soil water content soil nutrient content the net photosynthetic rate and crop yields compared to monoculture systems in general these indexes increase with distance from the tree row which suggests that intercropping systems have negative marginal effects due to interspecific competition for soil moisture nutrients and light gao et al 2013 xu et al 2013 yun et al 2012 irrigation and fertilization can meet the water and nutrient demands of the crops during the peak growth period of intercropping systems perdoná and soratto 2015 zhao et al 2016 a previous study showed that fertilization allowed the intercropping crops to absorb more soil nutrients and increased crop yields eaglesham et al 1981 simultaneously irrigation may have promoted soil nutrients availability reduced competition for soil moisture and nutrients and enhanced the complementarity of crops toward water and nutrients lenka et al 2013 however when the amount of irrigation and fertilization exceeded or fell below a certain range crop physiological and soil biochemical processes were inhibited gheysari et al 2009 warren et al 2003 zhang et al 2021 plant photosynthetic physiology and soil nutrients are important manifestations of crop physiology and soil biochemical processes therefore plant growth and development are also simultaneously influenced by soil nutrient content and photosynthetic characteristics which are also regulated by irrigation and fertilization chai et al 2014 therefore photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients are the key indexes used to evaluate the comprehensive benefits of irrigation and fertilization management cao et al 2017 li et al 2019 a previous study in the loess gully area found that under flood irrigation adequate water and fertilizer application can improve the soil nutrients status and promote the crop photosynthetic parameters for apple maize intercropping systems zhou et al 2019b it has also been reported that the interspecific competition for light and nutrients in the intercropping system intensified with the intercropping years under flood irrigation dou et al 2022a zheng et al 2021 however the effects of drip irrigation on plant photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients are still unclear which has made it difficult to identify the optimal application of drip irrigation in fruit crop intercropping systems it has been reported that under drip irrigation the distribution area for soil water and nutrients was more concentrated than that under flood irrigation li et al 2021b therefore in the intercropping system the interaction between photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients under drip irrigation may be different from flood irrigation a previous study found that the growth of the maize canopy increased the interception of light under drip irrigation which had a negative impact on the photosynthetic characteristics of sugarcane baker and blamey 1985 similarly chen et al 2020 reported that under drip irrigation the no3 n in the surface layer migrated from the tomato area to the maize area in a horizontal direction the interspecific interactions between the photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients in intercropping systems under rain fed and flood irrigation conditions are well established gao et al 2013 gong et al 2021 yang et al 2016 however the interspecific interactions between perennial fruit trees and annual crops under drip irrigation especially with regards to the aboveground and belowground parts are still unclear therefore to maximize the use of resources and optimize current irrigation practices on the loess plateau the alley cropping system photosynthetic characteristics soil nutrients and their interspecific interactions need to be investigated when different drip water combined with fertilizer regimes are applied the main objectives of our study were to investigate i the effects of different drip irrigation water and fertilizer levels on the photosynthetic characteristics soil nutrients and interspecific interactions in the system and ii optimization measures for water and fertilizer management in an apple soybean alley cropping system on the loess plateau of west shanxi china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was conducted at the forest

plot 5 0 m 8 0 m covered 40 m2 and consisted of two apple trees and eight soybean rows the interval between the adjacent plots was 4 0 m a buffer zone to minimize irrigation edge effects the experiments had a randomized block factorial design with three replicates the treatments consisted of three levels of nitrogen n fertilization and four levels of irrigation the three levels of n

taking into consideration the rainfall and annual average potential evaporation in the region irrigation was carried out when there was no effective rainfall daily rainfall was less than 0 1 mm li et

and 29 and august 20 the n fertilizer was evenly divided into three parts and applied to the plots during the second to fourth irrigation periods in total there were 13 treatments in this experiment including 12 water and fertilizer coupling treatments and a control ck without irrigation and fertilization ck treatment represents current practice by farmers in the region the total amount of irrigation and nitrogen applied per year to each treatment is shown in table 1 the start and end times of each soybean growth period per year are shown in table 2 there were four drip tapes on both sides of each plot which were placed in the same position in the soybean rows at an interval of 0 5 m the irrigation water from a nearby water cellar was pumped by an electric motor and conveyed to the main line of 63 mm outer diameter od polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes from the main sub mains of 25 mm od pvc pipes were drawn and from the sub main 16 mm low linear density polyethylene lldpe pipes

were spaced at 0 3 m the water pressure in the sub main pipe was controlled at 0 1 mpa by a water pressure gauge in the sub main line venturi fertilizer applicators and sand filters were installed for fertilization and filtration 2 3 data collection and measurements 2 3 1 meteorological measurements the air temperature and precipitation were measured at 0 5 h intervals by an automatic weather station watchdog 2900et spectrum technologies dallas tx usa located at the experimental site the mean air temperature during the growth period for soybean was 18 8 c in 2018 and 18 3 c in 2019 fig 3

filling stage august 30 to september 20 in 2019 with correspondingly less precipitation during the other growth stages according to the standards set by the shanxi institute of meteorological sciences 2018 was a normal year whereas 2019 was a dry year 2 3 2 photosynthetic characteristics two li 6400 portable photosynthesis systems li cor inc lincoln ne usa were used to determine the photosynthetic parameters on two cloudless days during the soybean podding and filling stages july 20 and august 23 2018 and july 25 and august 29 2019 the photosynthetic indicators investigated in this study were

fig 1 and the soybean plant nearest to the sampling sites was selected and labeled three middle leaves from the upper triple compound leaves of each labeled soybean plant were used to measure the photosynthetic indexes three healthy leaves on new apple branches were used to measure the photosynthesis indicators at a vertical height of 1 5 1 8 m on the sunny side of each tree measurements were taken every 2 h from 09 00 17 00 h and each leaf was measured three times and the results averaged 2 3 3 soil moisture determination the irrigation amount was calculated using the equation for

4 determination of soil nutrients the sampling points for soil nutrients were the same as for swc after the soybean harvest soil samples from each plot were taken using an auger at 20 cm intervals from 0 to 60 cm depth fig 1 the soil was divided into two sub samples after sieving it to 5 mm one sample was used to determine the soil n content no 3 n and nh4 n while the other was air dried for

rome italy the soil organic matter was measured by the concentrated sulfuric acid potassium dichromate plus thermal oxidation method nelson 1996 2 3 5 root measurements the apple tree and soybean roots were sampled at the filling stage august 24 2018 and august 26 2019 using a root drill 10 cm diameter the sampling points and depths were the same as for the soil nutrients the apple tree and soybean roots were distinguished by their different color apple tree roots are red whereas soybean roots are yellowish the soybean root length density rld and apple root length density arld were calculated by analyzing images of the apple tree and soybean roots using winrhizo software ver 2003 reagent instruments inc quebec canada the spatial distribution of the apple tree and soybean roots is presented in dou et al 2022b 2 4 data processing 2 4 1 grain yield gy and partial factor productivity pfp at harvest october 18 2018 october 20 2019 all soybean plants on the plots were harvested and sun dried by local farmers then the soybean grain was stripped and weighed and the grain yield gy kg ha 1 was calculated the production of apples was not calculated as the apple trees did not fruit during the experiment the partial factor productivity pfp kg kg 1 is the ratio of grain yield per unit area of intercropped soybean to nitrogen fertilizer application per unit area dou et al

was obtained by averaging the values at distances of 1 0 1 7 and 2 4 m from the tree row at 9 00 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 table 3 the leaf intrinsic water use efficiency wuei μmol h2o mmol 1 co2 was determined using the following equation 3 wuei pn tr 2 4 3 interspecific interactions the slope of the regression line was used to describe the interspecific interactions gao et al 2013 zhou et al 2019b the variation rates for the photosynthetic index were derived from univariate linear regression of the photosynthetic index values at three points 1 0 1 7 and 2 4 m from the tree row table 4 similarly the rld arld soil nutrients and soil moisture slopes were determined by linearly fitting the index values for rows that were 0 5 1 0 1 75 and 2 5 m away from the tree row the rld arld soil nutrients and soil moisture values at 0 40 cm depth were averaged from the values recorded at 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm depth the number 1 after the rld arld soil nutrients and swc abbreviations means that the subsequent value is for the 0 40 cm soil layer and number 2 represents their values at 40 60 cm soil depth e g rld1 and rld2 table 5 the soil layer was divided into two parts 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm depth to show the difference in the correlations for interspecific interactions in the vertical direction 2 4 4 correlation analysis a correlation analysis pearson s correlation coefficient was used to show the correlation relationship between the indexes for the aboveground and belowground parts the original values of the soil nutrients for each treatment in the correlation analysis were averaged from four different distances from the tree rows 0 5 2 5 m while the original values of the soybean photosynthetic indexes are derived from table 3 similarly the data in tables 4 and 5 were used for a correlation analysis of the slopes 2 4 5 comprehensive benefit a principal component analysis pca was used to calculate the comprehensive score for each treatment using the following equation table 6 4 q a q 1 b q 2 where q is the comprehensive score for each treatment using a pca that involved the following indicators photosynthetic parameters of soybean and apple gy rld arld soil nutrients and swc q 1 and q 2 are the scores of the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 of each treatment the a and b terms are the proportions of the variance rate contributed by

the different treatments are shown in table 3 at a given level of irrigation the pn and tr for apple leaves reached their maximum values under f2 they increased initially and then decreased as the fertilizer dose rose in 2018 and 2019 the average values for pn and tr in the experimental treatments for both years were significantly higher than for ck except for tr at the w1 level in 2019 p 0 05 the daily average values for pn and tr among the treatments in 2018 and 2019 were 16 08 68 39 and 5 59 79 21 greater than those for ck respectively at the same fertilizer level pn and tr first increased but then decreased as the irrigation level rose and the w3 and w1 treatments produced the maximum and minimum values in both years respectively the w3f2 and ck treatments produced the maximum and minimum pn and tr values in 2018 and 2019 respectively at the same fertilization level the wuei for apple leaves decreased at first and then increased as the irrigation level rose in 2018 but it just decreased in 2019 the maximum value for wuei occurred in w1f1 for both years while the minimum value occurred in w3f2 in 2018 and w3f1 in 2019 the soybean pn tr and wuei trends for the irrigation and fertilizer treatments were similar to those of apple the pn and tr among all the experimental treatments were significantly higher than ck p 0 05 and the daily mean values were 10 22 47 99 and 10 29 105 12 greater than those for the ck respectively over the two years the maximum daily mean values for pn and tr occurred in the w3f2 treatment for both years which was the same for apple the soybean wuei decreased at first and then increased with irrigation at the same fertilization level in 2018 and 2019 reaching a maximum at the w1 level and a minimum at the w3 level the w1f1 treatment produced the maximum wuei in both years while the minimum wuei value occurred in w3f2 the overall pn and tr for the apple and soybean treatments decreased by 1 64 23 17 and 8 91 32 53 respectively in 2019 compared to 2018 whereas wuei increased by 28 85 49 69 the fertilization and irrigation factors had significant effects on the daily mean pn and tr values of the soybean and apple leaves in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 over the two years the f values for irrigation were generally greater than those for fertilization in apple and soybean 3 2 effects of water and fertilizer regulation on soil nutrients irrigation and fertilization increased an and nn among all experimental treatments compared to ck in both 2018 and 2019 fig 4 at the same level of irrigation an and nn in the 0 60 cm soil layer generally increased with fertilization level in both years reaching a maximum at the f3 level in 2018 the total nn and som values for the three soil layers 0 60 cm increased at first and then decreased with increasing irrigation level under the same fertilization conditions with the maximum and the minimum values occurring at the w3 and w1 levels the nn and som at the w3 level increased by 1 79 21 45 compared to the other irrigation treatments average of l1 l4 in 2019 the trend for the total nn values for the three soil layers 0 60 cm was similar to that in 2018 with the largest values occurring at the w2 or w3 levels which increased by 1 84 31 58 average of l1 l4 compared to the other irrigation levels the an and nn values throughout the whole 0 60 cm soil layer rose as the horizontal distance from the tree row increased in both years in 2018 and 2019 the maximum and minimum an and nn values in the 0 60 cm soil layer both appeared at 2 5 m l4 and 0 5 m l1 away from the tree although the extreme values for som appeared at different distances vertically an nn and som generally decreased with increasing soil depth at the different distances from the tree row in 2018 and 2019 however an showed a greater soil nutrient content in the 20 40 cm soil layer than in the 0 20 cm layer at the w4 level in both years a similar trend was observed for nn in 2018 and 2019 where the maximum value in the w4 level occurred in the 20 40 cm or 40 60 cm layer this showed that soil nitrate nitrogen accumulated in the deeper layers of the soil when the w4 level was applied there was no significant differences in an content between 2019 and 2018 while nn increased by 3 01 and som declined by 16 mean values for the different treatments distance from the tree rows and depths in 2018 and 2019 fertilization and distance from the tree row had significant effects on an and nn p 0 01 while irrigation only had a significant effect on nn p 0 05 meanwhile the irrigation fertilizer interaction had no significant effect on soil nutrients p 0 05 3 3 aboveground and belowground interspecific competition the degree of the slope was used to indicate the effect of interspecific competition on photosynthesis and the results are shown in table 4 a higher absolute value for the regression coefficient indicated a greater apple tree effect on soybean leaf photosynthesis overall both pn and tr for the treatments showed linear relationships with regards to the distance between the soybean and the rows of apple in 2018 and 2019 while the slopes for wuei were generally not significant p 0 05 in both years the pn and tr slopes for distance from the tree row were positive for all treatments which revealed that pn and tr rose as the distance from the tree row increased whereas the wuei showed a decreasing trend apart from ck the 2019 slope values for pn were lower than that of 2018 the same pattern occurred for tr where apart from w3f3 and w4f3 the slope values for tr among most treatments in 2019 were lower than that of 2018 conversely apart from the w2f1 and w3f1 treatments the absolute value of the slope for wuei in 2019 was higher than that in 2018 the slopes showing the soil nutrients characteristics swc rld and arld relationships with distance from the tree row are shown in table 5 the rld swc and soil nutrients slopes were positive in both years except for som and arld indicating that the nutrients swc and rld generally rose as the distance from the tree row increased combined with the photosynthetic index during the two years the slopes for the aboveground and belowground parts were basically positive except for som arld and wuei overall the slope trend for the belowground index was more significant than that for the aboveground index in contrast to pn and tr the absolute value of the slopes for rld arld and nn in the 0 40 cm average of the 0 20 cm layer and the 20 40 cm layer and 40 60 cm soil layers generally increased by 7 76 74 26 in 2019 compared to 2018 mean value of the slope for all treatments however the absolute value of the slopes for som and swc in the two soil layers decreased by 21 44 66 22 in 2019 compared to 2018 meanwhile the slope for an at 0 40 cm depth increased by 9 52 while the slope for an at 40 60 cm decreased by 4 43 this indicated that the intensity of the interspecific interactions among rld arld and nn increased to a certain extent in dry years which was the opposite to pn tr and swc 3 4 correlation between aboveground and belowground indicators the correlations among the soybean photosynthetic characteristics and rld soil nutrients gy and swc are shown in fig 5 a and b in 2018 pn tr rld gy swc and soil nutrients were highly positively correlated with each other however wuei was negatively correlated with the other indices in 2019 the correlations among each indicator were similar to that of 2018 whereas the correlations between som and the other indexes were weaker than that in 2018 the rld an and nn correlations with pn and tr in the 0 40 cm layer for both years were stronger than those in the 40 60 cm layer this showed that the interaction between the belowground part and the aboveground part in the surface soil layer was stronger than that in the deep layer there was a positive correlation between the 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers for rld swc an nn and som in both years p 0 05 the rld correlations with an nn and som in the 0 40 cm soil layer were stronger than that in the 40 60 cm layer in 2018 and 2019 a correlation of the linear regression slopes analysis was used to investigate the correlation relationship between interspecific competition and the aboveground and belowground indicators fig 5 c and d overall the correlation for the slope between the aboveground and belowground indicators was weaker than its absolute value however the rld1 and rld2 slopes were both positively correlated in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 which was consistent with their absolute value indicating that there was a strong interaction between interspecific competition among the roots in the 0 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers the slope showing the relationship between pn and wuei showed that they were positively correlated in both years but the relationship in 2019 was stronger than that in 2018 similarly the correlation between the slope for the relationship between an1 and som2 in 2019 was stronger than that in 2018 although the correlation between the slope for nn in the 0 40 cm layer and tr was not significant in 2018 p 0 05 it was significantly positively correlated in 2019 p 0 01 these results suggested that the correlation for interspecific competition among the indicators was not the same in the different years the comprehensive benefits of different irrigation and fertilization treatments were investigated using a principal component analysis of the indicators used to characterize the aboveground and belowground plant parts and the soil fig 6 pc1 mainly reflected a comprehensive index for the photosynthetic characteristics of soybean and apple while pc2 mainly represented a comprehensive index for soybean yield soil nutrients and soil moisture the pc1 and pc2 results explained 60 6 and 21 4 of the variation in a total of 26 samples taken over the two years respectively in general the score ranking among treatments was w3 w4 w2 w1 ck and f2 f3 f1 ck in terms of cp1 and cp2 for both years the cp2 in 2019 was higher than that in 2018 while it was the opposite for cp1 the comprehensive score for all treatments in 2018 was higher than that in 2019 table 6 meanwhile the treatments with the highest and lowest comprehensive scores were w3f2 and ck in both years 3 5 pfp gy and quantitative relationships fertilization irrigation and the irrigation fertilizer interactions had significant effects on gy and soybean pfp in both years p 0 01 fig 7 at a given level of irrigation pfp gradually decreased as fertilizer dose increased in 2018 and 2019 at the same fertilization level pfp increased at first and then decreased as the irrigation level rose in both years with the maximum values occurring at the w3 level the minimum value for pfp occurred in w1f3 for both years while the maximum values occurred in w3f1 in 2018 and w4f1 in 2019 the gy increased at first and then decreased as the irrigation and fertilization rates rose in 2018 and 2019 with the maximum value occurring in the w3f2 treatment this indicated that yield did not increase continuously with irrigation and fertilization however the grain yield increased by 33 34 77 08 in 2019 compared to 2018 among all the treatments with the largest increase rate occurring in w4f3 after evaluating the integrated indicator data for the two years we derived a quantitative relationship between total water input level irrigation and rainfall and fertilizer dose and pn gy pfp and root length density the results of the nonlinear multivariate regression analysis are shown in fig 8 the multiple regression equation showed that the maximum values for soybean pn apple pn rld arld gy and pfp in the fitted equations were 16 42 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 15 61 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 0 19 cm cm 3 0 05 cm cm 3 2493 58 kg hm 2 and 38 0 kg kg 1 respectively but the maximum values of the six indexes were not reached at the same irrigation or fertilization levels the horizontal projection of the regression equations showed that when the water input range was between 4624 49 and 4795 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 and the fertilization amount was between 84 10 and 107 27 kg ha 1 a 1 soybean pn apple pn rld arld and gy could reach 94 100 of the maximum value of the multiple regression equation and pfp could reach 68 73 of the maximum value of the multiple regression equation 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drip fertilizer regulation on photosynthetic indexes and soil nutrients the fertilization and irrigation factors under drip irrigation generally had significant effects on the photosynthetic indexes for the aboveground parts p 0 01 table 3 in 2018 and 2019 increases in the irrigation and fertilization levels led to initial increases in apple and soybean pn and tr but they then decreased and the maximum values appeared at the f2 and w3 80 fc levels this was inconsistent with earlier studies involving flood irrigation in which the pn zhou et al 2019b and tr zheng et al 2022 values increased with the increase in irrigation reaching their maximum values at the 85 fc irrigation level the flood irrigation may have increased irrigation water evaporation and or runoff losses compared to drip irrigation kucukyumuk et al 2012 therefore increasing the irrigation level may have continuously promoted water consumption by crop transpiration which boosted the pn and tr of the crops furthermore this result was also inconsistent with an earlier study involving an apple monoculture system in which the pn tr and stomatal conductance increased with increasing fertilization zhou et al 2019a this phenomenon may be due to the oversupply of fertilizer f3 which can reduce the carbon dioxide assimilation capacity of plant mesophyll cells whereas medium doses f2 can boost the aboveground biomass and vegetation coverage by intercropping systems this would ease the high temperatures at noon and improve the farmland microclimate zhou et al 2019b alternatively it may be because the water and fertilizer utilization rates in the intercropping system were higher than that in the monoculture system mårtensson et al 2022 nie et al 2012 which meant that the intercropping system was more prone to excessive supplies of water and fertilizer the order for apple and soybean wuei was w1 w2 w4 w3 in both years the highest irrigation level may have decreased stomatal resistance by the leaves and resulted in a higher increase rate for tr than pn liu et al 2021 shang et al 2020 therefore moderate deficit irrigation could reduce transpiration and improve the leaf wuei the daily averages for pn and tr in apple and soybean decreased with the increase in intercropping years whereas wuei increased this may be attributed to the rainfall during the growth period in 2018 being 81 6 mm more than that in 2019 thus the ineffective use of soil moisture in 2018 was greater than that in 2019 simultaneously the high water use efficiency shown by the drip irrigation system meant that the reduction in rainfall led to an improvement in wuei fertilization had significant effects on an and nn p 0 05 fig 4 at the same level of irrigation an and nn in the 0 60 cm soil layer generally increased with fertilization level in both years and all the coupled treatments increased the available nitrogen content compared to ck this meant that irrigation and fertilization can increase the soil nitrogen content and reduce nutrient stress in 2018 and 2019 at the same fertilizer application rate the total nn across the three soil layers 0 60 cm increased at first and then decreased with the increase in irrigation amount and the maximum value appeared in w2 or w3 this result was consistent with an earlier study in which n fertilizer that was applied at rates above the crop requirement level tended to cause the nn to migrate with the water qiang et al 2021 therefore nn migration at the w4 level may cause more losses than at the w2 or w3 levels the results also showed that at the w4 level 90 fc the maximum nn values appeared in the 20 40 cm or 40 60 cm layers in a vertical direction this was inconsistent with an earlier study on flood irrigation dou et al 2022a when the irrigation level exceeded just 65 fc a large amount of soil nitrate nitrogen migrated to the deep layer one possible reason for this difference is that the water infiltration rate via drip irrigation was slower than that of flood irrigation jin et al 2018 so the amount of deep soil moisture and nutrient leakage was less at the same irrigation level parr and bertrand 1960 another possible explanation is that the water distribution range under drip irrigation was smaller than that under flood irrigation which meant that the soybean and fruit tree roots were mainly concentrated in the upper and lower soil layers respectively this was conducive to the niche separation of roots wang et al 2021 therefore the niche separation of roots promoted fruit trees and crops to make full use of the nutrients in the different soil layers which decreased the deep leaching of soil nutrients kumar and jose 2016 in 2019 the soil nn content increased to some extent while som decreased by 16 compared to 2018 mean values of the different treatments distance from the tree rows and depths the reason for this may be that fertilization and nitrogen fixation by soybean rhizobia increased the nn content of the soil liang et al 2020 alternatively before the experiment in 2018 the som mainly came from the backfilling of weeds between the rows of fruit trees however when the soybeans were harvested in 2018 the soybean plants and roots were entirely pulled out of the soil the organic matter returned to the soil was less than the organic matter consumed and decomposed during the growth period of the plants resulting in a decline in som as a result reasonable applications of organic fertilizer or straw returning combined with chemical fertilizer may be a favorable measure to improve comprehensive soil fertility 4 2 interspecific competition between aboveground and belowground plant parts there is competition and complementarity for light water and fertilizer in intercropping systems this study showed that soybean pn and tr have a linearly increasing relationship with distance from the tree row table 4 this result was consistent with studies on the intercropping of fruit trees and dwarf crops zheng et al 2022 the slopes of the belowground parts were basically positive except for som and arld table 5 this may be due to the fact that the niche overlap degree of the roots system was inversely related to distance from the tree dou et al 2022b xu et al 2013 therefore the competition for soil nutrients was stronger in the area close to the fruit tree row in general the slope trend for the overall aboveground index was more significant than that of the belowground index a possible reason for this was that the interactions among the belowground parts of each plant type were more complex than that of the aboveground parts due to the influence of soil biochemical properties duchene et al 2017 fu et al 2019 therefore the variation trend for the belowground indicators in the horizontal direction of the system may be nonlinear dou et al 2022a in this study the interspecific interaction between rld arld and nn increased to a certain extent in 2019 compared to 2018 which was the opposite to pn tr and swc the possible reasons for this are as follows the pn and tr of apple and soybean decreased in response to the dry year in 2019 which also reduced interspecific competition for light in addition the interspecific competition between the roots may have intensified with the intercropping years because the growth of the underground roots was related to the number of growing years sun et al 2018 meanwhile the reduction in soil water content during the dry year also reduced water competition within the belowground part to a certain extent in 2019 similar to the roots system the competition for nutrients was related to the intercropping years because the fertilizer inputs were the same for both years dou et al 2022a therefore the competition for nutrients intensified with growing years in addition the growth of the fruit tree canopy meant that shading near the tree row increased however the slopes for pn and tr decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 a possible reason for this is that soybeans in the row nearest the tree row adapted to shading and improved their utilization of diffuse light which is more suitable for photosynthesis than direct light zhang et al 2018 concurrently water input by drip irrigation also improved the water and nutrient utilization rate of the crops therefore the photosynthetic characteristics of soybean near the tree row increased in 2019 and the competition for light by the aboveground part decreased these results may also indicate that drip irrigation can regulate the soil environment near plant roots to optimize the interspecific interaction between the aboveground and belowground parts of the intercropping system the rld was positively correlated with all the other indicators except wuei and the correlation coefficient for the roots system in the 0 40 cm layer was higher than that for the 40 60 cm layer fig 5 this showed that there were differences in the interactions shown by soybean roots in a vertical direction the results also suggested that the line source distribution of soil moisture under drip irrigation can lead to the separation of root niches which would reduce belowground competition li et al 2009 although the correlation between the nn slope for the 0 40 cm layer and tr was not significant in 2018 p 0 05 it was significantly positively correlated in 2019 p 0 01 this result suggested that the correlation relationship for the interspecific interaction between nn and the tr may be affected by planting years this may be due to the changes in the root and canopy biomasses of the fruit trees with planting years which would affect the nn distribution and photosynthetic characteristics these results should be confirmed using longer observation periods in future experiments 4 3 pfp gy and quantitative relationships the grain yield increased by 33 34 77 08 in 2019 compared to 2018 across all the treatments fig 7 this was inconsistent with a previous study zheng et al 2022 in which the soybean yield decreased to some extent in dry years a possible reason for this was that compared to flood irrigation drip irrigation and fertilization may improve the efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization li et al 2021b and alleviate water and nutrient stress in dry years another possible reason for this is that under the same fertilization conditions the rainfall in 2018 was 81 6 mm more than that in 2019 which led to more soil moisture being consumed by transpiration which then caused decreases in wuei and pfp and excessive crop growth furthermore in this study competition by the aboveground part of soybean for light and the belowground part for water decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 tables 4 and 5 therefore the complementarity of intercropping may have increased the soybean yield in 2019 at the same fertilization level gy and pfp increased at first and then decreased as irrigation levels rose in both years and the maximum value appeared at the w3 level this may be because the roots absorbed and utilized more soil nutrients at high levels of irrigation and that excessive irrigation promoted the nutrients absorbed by the roots to be used for vegetative growth of the aboveground part and root biomass ebel et al 1995 the growth of root biomass and the canopy increased interspecific competition thus the highest water and fertilizer levels did not produce the highest yields dou et al 2022a zhou et al 2019b the w3 irrigation level combined with the f2 fertilizer level had the best photosynthetic characteristics soil nutrient contents and crop yields therefore the w3f2 treatment was the optimal treatment under drip irrigation and fertilization the principal component analysis of the nine indexes also confirmed that the benefits of the intercropping system can be maximized by combining the medium fertilization f2 level with irrigation at 80 fc w3 fig 6 the multiple regression equations aimed to establish an optimal model for a water and fertilizer regime we found that when the water input was between 4624 49 and 4795 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 i e 1019 49 1190 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 irrigation amount and the fertilization amount was between 84 10 and 107 27 kg ha 1 a 1 gy pn of apple and soybean rld arld and pfp can reach 68 100 of the maximum value of their regression equation fig 8 however previous studies considered that the optimal regulation of water and fertilizer in an apple maize alley cropping system under flood irrigation was achieved with irrigation set at 433 1633 m3 ha 1 a 1 and a 70 empirical fertilizer application of 289 0 118 0 118 0 kg ha 1 a 1 n p k compound fertilizer dou et al 2022a zhou et al 2019b the amount of recommended irrigation according to this study was less than the previous studies even though water consumption by soybean is higher than that of corn zheng et al 2021 zhou et al 2019b therefore drip irrigation can considerably reduce water resource use compared to flood irrigation and is a more suitable irrigation method for alley cropping systems in the local area however the interspecific interaction results for the roots system and the canopy distribution of perennial fruit trees did not fully correlate with the increase in intercropping years the model recommended in this paper may only be useful when 4 5 year old apple trees are used therefore there needs to be further studies on older trees 5 conclusion under drip fertigation the fertilization and irrigation factors had significant effects on the daily mean photosynthetic indexes for apple and soybean in 2018 and 2019 in both 2018 and 2019 pn and tr for apple and soybean reached their maximum values at the moderate fertilization level f2 with the w3 irrigation level irrigation and fertilization can increase the an and nn content and alleviate the competition for nutrients the photosynthetic characteristics and soil nutrients generally rose as the distance from the tree row increased except for wuei and som the interspecific competition for soil nitrate nitrogen and between the roots increased with the intercropped planting years whereas the competition for soil moisture and light decreased the correlation for interspecific competition between the aboveground and belowground index was weak and varied with intercropping years the gy and pfp values increased at first and then decreased with the increase in irrigation for both years and the maximum value occurred at the w3 level a principal component analysis indicated that in the apple soybean alley cropping system the medium fertilization f2 level combined with the 85 fc irrigation level w3 had the highest comprehensive benefit a multiple regression analysis showed that a water input range of 4624 49 4795 75 m3 ha 1 a 1 combined with a 84 10 107 27 kg ha 1 a 1 nitrogen fertilizer application was most beneficial during the first 4 5 years of the intercropping system

9188,in arid regions supplemental irrigation and fertilization are the major driving factors for sustaining crop production with the increasing water scarcity rising fertilizer costs and growing environmental concerns identifying appropriate irrigation and nitrogen n amounts for simultaneously improving resource use efficiency and yield benefits is essential for sustainable crop production in arid regions a two year field study was conducted in the arid region of northwest china to evaluate the effects of reduced irrigation and n treatments including w80f75 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 w80f50 600 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 w60f75 450 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 and w60f50 450 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 on resource use efficiency forage yield dm forage nutritive values grain yield and economic benefit of spring wheat in comparison with the farmers management practice w100f100 750 mm irrigation and 300 kg n ha 1 results indicated that moderately reduced irrigation and n w80f75 significantly improved the forage nutritive quality evident by high crude protein yield relative feed value digestible dry matter dry matter intake total digestible nutrients and net energy for lactation no significant difference in dm yield was observed between w100f100 and w80f75 treatments during both years however the grain yield for w80f75 treatment was 12 9 greater than that of w100f100 in 2015 in addition w80f75 treatment increased the resource use efficiency net returns and cost befit ratios by reducing the input amounts while maintaining comparable yields to that of w100f100 however the w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments significantly decreased the dm grain yield nutritive values resource efficiency and economic benefits of spring wheat compared to w80f75 therefore the application of 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 to spring wheat is an appropriate management practice for reducing inputs while achieving high resource use efficiency forage

more than 70 by 2050 to meet the increasing food feed and fiber demands of the ever growing world population kamran et al 2018c teixeira et al 2014 with limited arable lands this production increase needs to be achieved through the intensification of crop productivity i e more produce per unit of cultivated land teixeira et al 2014 wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most widely grown staple food crops providing 20 of the protein and 21 of the food calories to over 4 5 billion people globally chen et al 2018 additionally wheat dry matter straw is a valuable feed resource for the pastoral based livestock industry blümmel et al 2019 northern china is an important wheat production region representing 25 of china s total farmland while providing 66 of the wheat production zhang et al 2020 in recent years the importance of wheat for its dual purpose grain forage has enormously increased with the development of the regional livestock industry and rising food and feed demands hou et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 due to scarce precipitation and soil degradation in northwest china intensive agronomic practices are widely adopted by farmers to boost grain yield si et al 2020 tang et al 2018 however the effects of these practices on the forage yield and nutritive quality are often overlooked therefore appropriate irrigation and fertilization are essential to ensure the competing demands of animal feed with high nutritional quality while maintaining sustainable grain production from limited arable land in the region the interaction and complementary effects of water and nitrogen n are recognized as the primary factors that influence crop growth and final yields jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 kaplan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 water facilitates n availability which in turn increases water use efficiency wang et al 2014 in china agricultural practices with over reliance on irrigation and fertilization are widely adopted by producers to boost crop production kamran et al 2022 si et al 2020 for instance the average application of irrigation and n by wheat farmers in northwest china reaches 700 mm and 300 kg ha 1 respectively chen et al 2018 lu et al 2014 wang et al 2012 2010 unfortunately the n recovery efficiency of cereal crops is very poor about 20 or less lower than the world average 33 resulting in over 70 n losses to the environment cui et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 few studies have suggested that these intensive agronomic practices are untenable both from economic and ecological benefit perspectives si et al 2020 tan et al 2017 wang et al 2012 furthermore the increasing water scarcity and soil degradation in the context of global climate change are increasingly threatening agriculture productivity and sustainability particularly in arid and semi arid regions ding et al 2021 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 kheir et al 2021 demanding rationalized irrigation and nutrient management recent studies have proposed reduced irrigation and fertilizer amounts to a certain level as an effective approach for sustaining crop production in water deficit regions hou et al 2019 ma et al 2022 si et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however water limitation influences plants response to fertilization and decreases plant nutrient acquisition by constraining mineralization and n transport from bulk soil to the rhizosphere in dry soil kunrath et al 2018 moreover the climatic conditions and agriculture systems are highly diverse in time and space and the concept of reduced irrigation and fertilization for a specific region may not be suitable for other regions hence a site specific implementation strategy is needed to identify appropriate water and n amounts for maintaining optimal yields forage nutritive quality and economic benefits of spring wheat in the arid region of northwest china where irrigation meets over 90 of crop water demands greater biomass is the desired goal for forage producers lithourgidis et al 2006 ronga et al 2020 but high nutritional qualities are more valuable for the profitability of forage production and the livestock enterprises it supports zhang et al 2018 crude protein fiber contents and relative feed value are the essential quality metrics used for assessing forage nutritive values agnew et al 2022 among the field management practices irrigation and fertilization had the strongest impact on nutritional composition islam et al 2012 kaplan et al 2019 tang et al 2018 previous studies have reported a trade off between maximizing forage yield and quality attributes kamran et al 2022 kaplan et al 2019 rostamza et al 2011 requiring both factors to be considered while adopting irrigation and n management practices for maximizing the economic benefits in addition improving crop water and fertilizer productivity is important in areas with deficit water and poor soil nutrients kunrath et al 2018 teixeira et al 2014 several studies have examined the effects of irrigation and or n on the resource use efficiencies of wheat based on the dm or grain yield lai et al 2022 sharma et al 2020 si et al 2020 wang et al 2016 however to our knowledge no study has assessed crop water productivity cwp and n fertilizer productivity nfp for wheat managed both for grain and forage purposes also a comparable method of calculating the cwp and nfp of forage crops using indices that integrate forage nutritional quality and yield has not been previously used thus we applied a novel approach to calculate resource use efficiencies based on yield and nutritional quality e g crude protein and forage value to provide more valuable assessments of the treatments used in the study previous studies have mainly focused on irrigation and n fertilizer management for increasing wheat grain yield however little is known if grain and forage yield forage nutritive quality and resource efficiency of wheat can simultaneously be improved with optimized irrigation and n regimes in arid regions we hypothesized that the current irrigation and n management for spring wheat in the arid region of northwest china is excessive and not conducive to higher yield benefits instead optimizing irrigation and n amounts would be valuable in improving resource use efficiency nutritional quality indices and economic benefits therefore the objectives of the present study were to investigate the effects of different reduced irrigation and n regimes on grain yield biomass accumulation forage nutritive indices and to determine a suitable management practice for optimum cwp nfp and net returns for spring wheat in the arid regions of northwest china the results of this study will provide new insights into the sustainable cultivation of dual purpose spring wheat in arid regions and would help in overcoming the increasing food and feeds demands in the context of climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site location and climate data field trials were performed over two spring wheat growing seasons 2015 2016 at

by local farmers during the spring wheat growing seasons respectively for each treatment irrigation water was applied in equal parts at the sowing 25 jointing 25 heading 25 and grain filling 25 stages the irrigation schedules were based on soil moisture depletion and water requirements at the critical crop growth stages for each irrigation event the amount of water applied was manually determined and recorded by a water flow meter urea 46 n as n source was applied in split doses before irrigation events 60 at first irrigation and 40 at third irrigation treatments were organized in a randomized complete block rcb design with four replications each treatment plot was 10 m 10 m 100 m2 with a 1 5 m buffer between adjacent plots field ridges covered with impervious plastic membranes were built between adjacent plots to prevent lateral water and n movement recommended phosphorus 120 kg p2o5 and potassium 150 kg k2o ha 1 fertilizers were uniformly applied across all the treatment plots no

increasing trend with the progression of the crop growth period and reached peak values 12 58 18 41 t ha 1 at the bo stage fig 2a b thereafter the forage biomass declined at the gf stage 7 85 13 60 t ha 1 owing to the onset of leaf senesces at each sampling stage greater biomass was achieved with w100f100 and w80f75 during both years the difference between w100f100 and w80f75 treatments was non significant at various sampling stages except for the tl stage in 2016 fig 2a b however too much decrease in irrigation and n amounts resulted in a linear decline in biomass and the lowest biomass was achieved for w60f75 and w60f50 treatments results showed significant effects of the year treatments and their interaction on the dry matter dm yield of spring wheat fig 3a the average dm yield of all treatments was greater by 9 4 in 2015 compared to that in 2016 the dm yield achieved for different treatments ranged from 4 1 to 7 2 t ha 1 in 2015 and from 3 6 to 6 9 t ha 1 in 2016 fig 3a

increasing trend from tl to jo stage and then gradually decreased until gf stage in general cp concentration exhibited a similar trend in both wheat growing seasons and tended to increase with a moderate decrease in irrigation and n w80f75 but markedly decreased with severely reduced irrigation and n rates as compared to the conventional full application during the whole crop growing period fig 4a b the cp yield for the total dm at harvesting was significantly p 0 01 affected by irrigation and n treatments but the effect of the year and its interaction with treatment t y was non significant p 0 05 table 1 the cp yield ranged from 243 1 to 749 3 kg ha 1 in 2015 and from 272 4 to 755 6 kg ha 1 in 2016 for different treatments table 1 among all the treatments the highest cp

from 327 8 to 383 9 at tl stage 206 5 314 3 at jo stage 146 8 213 11 at bo stage and 122 6 206 5 at gf stage in 2015 and 2016 fig 5a b at each stage there were significant differences in rfv values among treatments remarkably the rfv values were increased by reducing the irrigation and n rates when compared to conventional full application management at most of the sampling stages the rfv was greater for w80f75 w80f50 and w60f75 treatments while the values were lower for the w100f100 treatment fig 5a b the treatments year and their interaction significantly affected the total rfv yield at harvesting table 1 among the various treatments the highest rfv yield was achieved for w80f75 14 10 and 12 94 t ha 1 the rfv yield for the w80f75 treatment was greater by 38 8 and 26 0 compared to the conventional w100f100 treatment in 2015 and 2016 respectively except for w80f75 other reduced irrigation and n treatments significantly decreased the rfv yield compared to w100f100 in both years table

contents as affected by reduced irrigation and n treatments based on the different effects of treatments on the shoot fiber the accumulation of acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf of spring wheat was assessed at various growth stages figs 6 7 the concentration of adf and ndf progressively increased following the crop growth period and the maximum values were observed at gf stage during the wheat growing seasons the concentration of adf and ndf ranged from 10 0 to 14 8 and 19 6 25 3 at tl stage 11 1 21 4 and 22 6 31 0 at jo stage 17 2 27 2 and 29 5 42 9 at bo stage and 21 1 33 0 and 32 6 50 1 at gf stage figs 6 7 at each sampling stage the adf and ndf concentrations were greater for w100f100 treatment at harvesting the adf and ndf content per unit dm of wheat was significantly affected by year treatments and their interaction table 1 the w100f100 resulted in the highest adf 330 2 and 294 4 g kg 1 and ndf 465 5 and 500 5 g kg 1 contents in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 1 initially the adf and ndf contents followed a decreasing trend with moderately reduced irrigation and n but increased again with the excessive reduction of irrigation and n the lowest adf and ndf contents were achieved for the w80f75 and w80f50 treatments table 1 compared to w100f100 the adf content of w80f75 treatment was lowered by 36 2 and 28 2 and ndf content by 29 8 and 25 5 while the adf contents of the w80f50 treatments was decreased by 31 7 and 30 5 and ndf by 25 6 and 18 5 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the adf and ndf contents for w60f50 were comparable to that of w100f100 in both years table 1 3 6 digestible dry matter dry matter intake total digestible nutrients and net energy for lactation when analyzed at harvest the digestible dry matter ddm dry matter intake dmi total digestible nutrients tdn and net energy for lactation nel were significantly affected by year treatments and their interaction table 1 initially the ddm dmi tdn and nel increased with reducing irrigation and n amounts and the highest values were observed for w80f75 and w80f50 treatments in both years table 1 in comparisons the ddm dmi tdn and nel of w80f75 treatment were greater by 14 7 and 9 8 42 6 and 34 2 26 3 and 16 9 21 5 and 14 4 while that of w80f50 was greater by 12 9 and 10 6 34 5 and 22 5 23 0 and 18 3 18 8 and 15 0 compared to that of w100f100 in 2015 and 2016 respectively in addition the w60f75 and w60f50 treatments markedly reduced the ddm dmi tdn and nel compared to the w80f75 treatment however the values were still higher than that for the w100f100 treatment table 1 3 7 crop water productivity and nitrogen fertilizer productivity the crop water productivity of wheat based on the total yield production cwpyield cp yield cwpcp and rfv yield cwprfv was strongly influenced by treatments the highest values were obtained for the w80f75 treatment in both years fig 8 compared to w100f100 the cwpyield for w80f75 treatment was increased by 28 3 and 23 33 cwpcp by 22 8 and 36 8 and cwprfv by 70 3 and 55 7 in 2015 and 2016 respectively however the w80f50 and w60f75 treatments markedly declined the cwpyield and cwprfv compared to w80f75 but the values were still higher than that for the w100f100 treatment in both years fig 8 no significant difference in cwpyield was observed between the w100f100 and w60f50 treatments however the cwpcp and cwprfv for w60f50 treatment were significantly lower than that for w100f100 fig 8 the fertilizer productivity for total yield nfpyield cp content nfpcp and rfv nfprfv was also significantly affected by irrigation and n treatments and year except for nfpcp the interaction of year and treatments was significant only for nfprfv fig 9 initially reducing the irrigation and n application amounts increased the nfp and the highest values were achieved for w80f50 followed by w80f75 treatment during both years fig 9 compared to w100f100 the nfpyield nfpcp and nfprfv for w80f50 treatment was increased by 64 0 and 62 7 31 6 and 59 4 110 8 and 82 2 while that for w80f75 treatment was increased by 39 5 and 33 1 32 8 and 46 7 85 1 and 68 0 in 2015 and 2016 respectively however the w60f75 and w60f50 treatments decreased the nfpyield nfpcp and nfprfv compared to w80f75 and w80f50 treatments and the values were comparable to that of w100f100 during both years fig 9 3 8 economic benefits with reduced irrigation and n treatments the net returns ranged from 7148 16417 rmb ha 1 in 2015 and 6324 15019 rmb ha 1 in 2016 table 2 among the various treatments the highest net returns were achieved for w80f75 16417 rmb ha 1 in 2015 which was greater by 11 1 compared to w100f100 14776 rmb ha 1 however no significant difference in net returns was manifested between w80f75 15019 rmb ha 1 and w100f100 14726 rmb ha 1 in 2016 on the other hand w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments markedly reduced the net returns of spring wheat in both years table 2 compared to w100f100 the net returns for w80f50 w60f75 w60f50 treatments were decreased by 20 6 38 5 and 51 6 in 2015 and 22 9 42 4 and 57 1 in 2016 respectively the benefit cost ratio among different treatments ranged from 1 29 2 73 in 2015 and 1 14 2 50 in 2016 respectively table 2 the highest benefit cost ratio of 2 73 and 2 50 was achieved for w80f75 which was greater by 19 7 and 10 1 than w100f100 treatment in 2015 and 2016 respectively too much reduction in irrigation and n application steadily declined the benefit cost ratio of spring wheat and the lowest ratios were achieved for w60f75 1 56 and 1 46 and w60f50 1 29 and 1 14 treatments table 2 compared to w100f100 the cost benefit ratios for w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments was lowered by 10 5 31 6 and 43 4 in 2015 and by 12 8 35 7 and 49 8 in 2016 respectively 3 9 correlation and principal component analysis the pearson correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations of resource use efficiency indices cwpyield cwpcp cwprfv nfpcp and nfprfv with yield crude protein content and rfv of spring wheat but negative relations with adf and ndf content fig 10a the net returns followed a strong positive relationship with crude protein

nfpcp and nfprfv 4 discussion 4 1 response of wheat yield to reduced irrigation and n treatments the agroecosystems in arid regions are highly vulnerable due to limited available water and soil nutrient resources kheir et al 2022 li et al 2022 wang et al 2018 supplemental irrigation and n fertilization are key solutions to sustaining plant growth and improving the yield stability of crops chen et al 2018 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 ma et al 2022 an adequate n supply is essential for utilizing the benefits of additional water and reciprocally an adequate water supply is required to utilize the benefits of n fertilizers kunrath et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in general reducing irrigation and or n levels are believed to decrease crop yield jiang et al 2013 zhong et al 2021 however a moderate decrease in irrigation and n w80f75 in the present study did not show any detrimental effects on dm and grain yield of spring wheat these results partly support our hypothesis that the farmers practiced irrigation and n application in the arid region of northwest china are excessive and a rational decrease would not limit the crop water and nutrient demands required for optimal growth and productivity of spring wheat consistent with these results previous studies have shown that appropriate irrigation and n amounts in water deficit arid regions were more beneficial than their excessive applications li et al 2022 si et al 2020 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2006 a higher grain yield with w80f75 treatment is endorsed to the synergistic effects of optimum water and n on carbon assimilation and grain filling efficiency guo et al 2014 si et al 2020 wang et al 2014 previously teixeira et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 reported that rational irrigation and fertilizer ensure optimal resource acquisition and improve photosynthetic and carboxylation efficiency resulting in greater crop yields in addition both dm and grain yield were markedly decreased with severe deficit irrigation and n treatments w60f75 and w60f50 this is because of an increase in the osmotic pressure of the rhizosphere which causes plants to acquire more energy for maintaining cell water contents decreasing the plant s ability to transpire and absorb nutrients gonzalez dugo et al 2010 jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 moreover dry soil limits the mineralization and transport of n from bulk soil to the rhizosphere which reduces n availability to plants kunrath et al 2018 nitrogen limitation on the other hand reduces leaf and stem expansion islam et al 2012 si et al 2020 teixeira et al 2014 and resource capture radiation interception and n uptake accelerates the onset of senescence and chlorophyll degradation kamran et al 2020 kaplan et al 2019 wang et al 2013 which causes a reduction in assimilates and the grain sink capacity çakir 2004 srivastava et al 2018 wang et al 2014 also the irrigation and n limitations exacerbate premature kernel abortion çakir 2004 gao et al 2017 which could be another possible reason for lower grain yield with w60f75 and w60f50 treatments 4 2 impacts of reduced irrigation and n treatments on the nutritive quality in this study crude protein contents and rfv decreased while ndf and adf contents increased with the advancement of the spring wheat growing period such trends are distinctive in crops ascribed to a decrease in leaf area with the onset of leaf senescence kamran et al 2020 liu et al 2021 ronga et al 2020 and an increase in stem rigidity owing to greater accumulation of fiber contents kamran et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018 leading to a reduction of nutritive quality among treatments w80f75 markedly improved the nutritive quality evidenced by greater crude protein and rfv yield and lower adf and ndf content compared to that of w100f100 treatment consistently previous studies have also reported high forage quality of different crops with optimized irrigation and fertilization than in well irrigated and high fertilized conditions kaplan et al 2019 ma et al 2022 rostamza et al 2011 previously kamran et al 2022 and marsalis et al 2010 showed a negative correlation between forage quality with irrigation and n fertilizer rates excessive irrigation and fertilization often result in lower forage quality because of their interactive effects strengthening the cell wall component and fiber contents kaplan et al 2019 which was also confirmed by greater ndf and adf contents in our present study islam et al 2012 reported high ndf and adf ratios and low protein in stalks compared to leaves since high irrigation and fertilization levels increase the stem ratios thereby regulating the fiber concentration kaplan et al 2019 rostamza et al 2011 on the other hand appropriate irrigation and n maintain a high leaf to stem ratio and delay maturity contributing to high crude protein yield and forage quality liu et al 2021 rostamza et al 2011 furthermore n being an essential element is crucial for the synthesis of chlorophyll enzymes and proteins which regulate almost all metabolic activities of plants islam et al 2012 therefore adequate water and n with w80f75 treatment will increase plant n uptake thereby enhancing the synthesis of amino acid and protein contents which is in close agreement with findings from previous studies kaplan et al 2019 tang et al 2018 in addition quality traits such as ddm dmi tdn and nel are highly desirable because of their advantages in boosting animals ability to absorb the forage nutrients lithourgidis et al 2006 tang et al 2018 compared to both conventional and severe deficit irrigation and n treatments the w80f75 treatment noticeably improved all of the above mentioned quality components attributed to the positive effects of w80f75 on lowering the undesirable ndf and adf contents the crude protein tdn and nel for wheat in the present study were comparable to previously reported values for corn marsalis et al 2010 pearl millet rostamza et al 2011 and sorghum jahanzad et al 2013 tang et al 2018 supporting the importance of dm straw yield of spring wheat as a potential feed source for livestock development 4 3 impacts of reduced irrigation and n treatments on resource use efficiency in recent years studies are increasingly focusing on maintaining the best resource use efficiency and economic productivity with lower inputs to ensure sustainable productivity in arid regions fang and su 2019 kheir et al 2022 li et al 2022 zhang et al 2006 in the present study the cwpyield and nfpyield were greater for the w80f75 treatment compared to other treatments this implies that appropriate irrigation and fertilization simultaneously improve the effectiveness of water and nutrition and such complementary effects could be referred to as synergistic functions wang et al 2016 because matching fertilizer with irrigation amount improves the crop nutrients absorption and utilization effectively improving productivity and resource use efficiency dai et al 2019 jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 similar results were achieved by rostamza et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 and li et al 2022 who observed that instead of excessive applications irrigation and n based on crop demand contributed to enhanced resource use efficiencies in justification adequate irrigation and n levels increase leaf area index which enhances light and co2 capture and regulates photoassimilates distribution in the plant s above ground parts translating into higher resource use efficiency fang and su 2019 kaplan et al 2019 kunrath et al 2018 ma et al 2022 wang et al 2016 since the dm and grain yields in our study were comparable for both w100f100 and w80f75 treatments a greater cwpyield and nfpyield obtained for the w80f75 treatment is attributed to the lower degree of water and n rates applied on the other hand the irrigation and n amounts for w60f75 and w60f50 treatments were further reduced but the cwpyield and nfpyield were significantly lower than that for w80f75 treatment this is because the w60f75 and w60f50 treatments failed to maintain yield benefit and the dm and grain yield significantly declined compared to the w80f75 treatment extremely deficit irrigation and n application are linked to poor biomass accumulation and yields by limiting resource capture teixeira et al 2014 adversely affecting photosynthetic capacity wang et al 2010 2015 reducing carbon assimilation and grain filling characteristics wang et al 2014 2013 which consequently decrease the resource use efficiencies besides the previously reported values for crop water productivity chen et al 2018 lai et al 2022 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2006 and n fertilizer productivity chen et al 2018 si et al 2020 tan et al 2017 for wheat in north china were lower than those observed in our present study in explanation previous studies used wheat solely for grain purpose while we used wheat for dual purpose and have considered both grain and dm yield for calculating the crop water and fertilizer productivity factor additionally water and fertilizer productivity based on the nutritive attributes can be used as an important criterion for assessing the efficacy of different agronomic managements in forage crops zhang et al 2018 our results showed that moderately reduced irrigation and n treatments enhanced the cwpcp cwprfv nfpcp and nfprfv of wheat dm yield over that of conventional management the highest cwpcp and cwprfv values were achieved for the w80f75 treatment while the greatest nfpcp and nfprfv values were achieved for w80f50 and w80f75 treatments in both years the higher values with w80f50 and w80f75 treatments are attributed to a greater leaf to stem ratio and delayed crop maturity with appropriate irrigation and n application islam et al 2012 rostamza et al 2011 tang et al 2018 which improved the forage nutritive quality and hence the cwp and nfp for crude protein and rfv the cwp and nfp for crude protein ranged from 0 47 to 1 19 kg mm 1 and 1 57 3 65 kg kg 1 while that for rfv ranged from 10 40 to 21 27 kg mm 1 and 32 70 71 37 kg kg 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively unfortunately no previous studies have calculated similar indices or reported data to compare these values with results from elsewhere future studies should therefore focus on integrating forage quality attributes along with biomass and grain yield while calculating cwp and nfp for dual purpose crops under different agronomic management which would provide a better understanding of their use as forage crop 4 4 impacts of reduced irrigation and n treatments on the economic benefit intensive agronomic practices are often believed to boost crop yields and hence economic benefits wang et al 2018 in the present study w80f75 presented the greatest net returns of spring wheat compared to w1000f100 signifying that intensive practices do not necessarily improve the economic benefits which is in agreement with the findings of a previous study li et al 2022 a higher net return and benefit cost ratio with w80f75 treatment are attributed to i reduced input by decreasing irrigation and n application rates and ii higher output due to relatively stable yields similar results of higher yield and economic benefits with appropriate fertilization and or irrigation were reported for maize wang et al 2018 yan et al 2021 wheat li et al 2019 and alfalfa zhang et al 2020 in this study the total output grain dm yield with w100f100 treatment failed to compensate for the high input costs lowering the net returns and benefits cost ratio on the other hand very low irrigation and n treatments w60f75 and w60f50 significantly reduced the input costs but were still not economically beneficial because of resulting in significant yield losses the w80f75 treatment increased the net returns by 2107 rmb ha 1 and 776 rmb ha 1 15 2 and 5 4 and the benefit cost ratio by 0 54 and 0 30 24 0 and 13 5 compared with the w100f100 treatment in 2016 the economic benefit and benefit cost ratio for w80f75 treatment were lower than that in 2015 because precipitation was relatively lower which increased the crop water demand and reduced the effectiveness of w80f75 on increasing yield benefit compared to w100f100 these findings suggest that the effects of reduced irrigation and fertilization are associated with precipitation whereas light precipitation could reduce the effectiveness of deficit irrigation and fertilization overall w80f75 maintained significantly higher net returns even in the year of low precipitation suggesting that the application of 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 can be used for wheat production in the arid region of northwest china without yield losses 5 conclusions present findings illustrated significant prospects for optimizing the irrigation and n fertilizer amounts for spring wheat in the arid region of northwest china a moderate decrease in irrigation and n w80f75 improved the resource use efficiencies and forage nutritive quality without compromising the grain yield of spring wheat compared to conventional management w100f100 in addition the w80f75 treatment improved the net returns and the benefit cost ratio over that of w100f100 in both wheat growing seasons except for w80f75 other deficit irrigation and n treatments presented detrimental effects by reducing grain yield dm yield forage nutritive values resource use efficiency and economic benefits compared to w100f100 thus the application of 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 can be used as an effective treatment for obtaining optimum yields and is more valuable when considering the forage nutritive values and net income benefit for spring wheat production in the arid region of northwest china and areas with similar climatic conditions nevertheless the climatic conditions particularly precipitation amounts and soil properties may vary between different arid regions and the optimized irrigation and n treatment in this study may not be favorable to optimal yields and economic benefits in other arid regions therefore future multi locational studies are suggested to clarify how climatic variations in different arid regions would influence the potential effects of deficit water and fertilization on spring wheat production forage nutritive quality and economic benefit more specific

9188,in arid regions supplemental irrigation and fertilization are the major driving factors for sustaining crop production with the increasing water scarcity rising fertilizer costs and growing environmental concerns identifying appropriate irrigation and nitrogen n amounts for simultaneously improving resource use efficiency and yield benefits is essential for sustainable crop production in arid regions a two year field study was conducted in the arid region of northwest china to evaluate the effects of reduced irrigation and n treatments including w80f75 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 w80f50 600 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 w60f75 450 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 and w60f50 450 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 on resource use efficiency forage yield dm forage nutritive values grain yield and economic benefit of spring wheat in comparison with the farmers management practice w100f100 750 mm irrigation and 300 kg n ha 1 results indicated that moderately reduced irrigation and n w80f75 significantly improved the forage nutritive quality evident by high crude protein yield relative feed value digestible dry matter dry matter intake total digestible nutrients and net energy for lactation no significant difference in dm yield was observed between w100f100 and w80f75 treatments during both years however the grain yield for w80f75 treatment was 12 9 greater than that of w100f100 in 2015 in addition w80f75 treatment increased the resource use efficiency net returns and cost befit ratios by reducing the input amounts while maintaining comparable yields to that of w100f100 however the w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments significantly decreased the dm grain yield nutritive values resource efficiency and economic benefits of spring wheat compared to w80f75 therefore the application of 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 to spring wheat is an appropriate management practice for reducing inputs while achieving high resource use efficiency forage

more than 70 by 2050 to meet the increasing food feed and fiber demands of the ever growing world population kamran et al 2018c teixeira et al 2014 with limited arable lands this production increase needs to be achieved through the intensification of crop productivity i e more produce per unit of cultivated land teixeira et al 2014 wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most widely grown staple food crops providing 20 of the protein and 21 of the food calories to over 4 5 billion people globally chen et al 2018 additionally wheat dry matter straw is a valuable feed resource for the pastoral based livestock industry blümmel et al 2019 northern china is an important wheat production region representing 25 of china s total farmland while providing 66 of the wheat production zhang et al 2020 in recent years the importance of wheat for its dual purpose grain forage has enormously increased with the development of the regional livestock industry and rising food and feed demands hou et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 due to scarce precipitation and soil degradation in northwest china intensive agronomic practices are widely adopted by farmers to boost grain yield si et al 2020 tang et al 2018 however the effects of these practices on the forage yield and nutritive quality are often overlooked therefore appropriate irrigation and fertilization are essential to ensure the competing demands of animal feed with high nutritional quality while maintaining sustainable grain production from limited arable land in the region the interaction and complementary effects of water and nitrogen n are recognized as the primary factors that influence crop growth and final yields jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 kaplan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 water facilitates n availability which in turn increases water use efficiency wang et al 2014 in china agricultural practices with over reliance on irrigation and fertilization are widely adopted by producers to boost crop production kamran et al 2022 si et al 2020 for instance the average application of irrigation and n by wheat farmers in northwest china reaches 700 mm and 300 kg ha 1 respectively chen et al 2018 lu et al 2014 wang et al 2012 2010 unfortunately the n recovery efficiency of cereal crops is very poor about 20 or less lower than the world average 33 resulting in over 70 n losses to the environment cui et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 few studies have suggested that these intensive agronomic practices are untenable both from economic and ecological benefit perspectives si et al 2020 tan et al 2017 wang et al 2012 furthermore the increasing water scarcity and soil degradation in the context of global climate change are increasingly threatening agriculture productivity and sustainability particularly in arid and semi arid regions ding et al 2021 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 kheir et al 2021 demanding rationalized irrigation and nutrient management recent studies have proposed reduced irrigation and fertilizer amounts to a certain level as an effective approach for sustaining crop production in water deficit regions hou et al 2019 ma et al 2022 si et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however water limitation influences plants response to fertilization and decreases plant nutrient acquisition by constraining mineralization and n transport from bulk soil to the rhizosphere in dry soil kunrath et al 2018 moreover the climatic conditions and agriculture systems are highly diverse in time and space and the concept of reduced irrigation and fertilization for a specific region may not be suitable for other regions hence a site specific implementation strategy is needed to identify appropriate water and n amounts for maintaining optimal yields forage nutritive quality and economic benefits of spring wheat in the arid region of northwest china where irrigation meets over 90 of crop water demands greater biomass is the desired goal for forage producers lithourgidis et al 2006 ronga et al 2020 but high nutritional qualities are more valuable for the profitability of forage production and the livestock enterprises it supports zhang et al 2018 crude protein fiber contents and relative feed value are the essential quality metrics used for assessing forage nutritive values agnew et al 2022 among the field management practices irrigation and fertilization had the strongest impact on nutritional composition islam et al 2012 kaplan et al 2019 tang et al 2018 previous studies have reported a trade off between maximizing forage yield and quality attributes kamran et al 2022 kaplan et al 2019 rostamza et al 2011 requiring both factors to be considered while adopting irrigation and n management practices for maximizing the economic benefits in addition improving crop water and fertilizer productivity is important in areas with deficit water and poor soil nutrients kunrath et al 2018 teixeira et al 2014 several studies have examined the effects of irrigation and or n on the resource use efficiencies of wheat based on the dm or grain yield lai et al 2022 sharma et al 2020 si et al 2020 wang et al 2016 however to our knowledge no study has assessed crop water productivity cwp and n fertilizer productivity nfp for wheat managed both for grain and forage purposes also a comparable method of calculating the cwp and nfp of forage crops using indices that integrate forage nutritional quality and yield has not been previously used thus we applied a novel approach to calculate resource use efficiencies based on yield and nutritional quality e g crude protein and forage value to provide more valuable assessments of the treatments used in the study previous studies have mainly focused on irrigation and n fertilizer management for increasing wheat grain yield however little is known if grain and forage yield forage nutritive quality and resource efficiency of wheat can simultaneously be improved with optimized irrigation and n regimes in arid regions we hypothesized that the current irrigation and n management for spring wheat in the arid region of northwest china is excessive and not conducive to higher yield benefits instead optimizing irrigation and n amounts would be valuable in improving resource use efficiency nutritional quality indices and economic benefits therefore the objectives of the present study were to investigate the effects of different reduced irrigation and n regimes on grain yield biomass accumulation forage nutritive indices and to determine a suitable management practice for optimum cwp nfp and net returns for spring wheat in the arid regions of northwest china the results of this study will provide new insights into the sustainable cultivation of dual purpose spring wheat in arid regions and would help in overcoming the increasing food and feeds demands in the context of climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site location and climate data field trials were performed over two spring wheat growing seasons 2015 2016 at

w60f50 450 mm irrigation and 150 kg n ha 1 the w80 and w60 represent 80 and 60 of the total amount of border irrigation w100 while f75 and f50 indicate 75 and 50 of the total n fertilizer f100 applied by local farmers during the spring wheat growing seasons respectively for each treatment irrigation water was applied in equal parts at the sowing 25 jointing 25 heading 25 and grain filling 25 stages the irrigation schedules were based on soil moisture depletion and water requirements at the critical crop growth stages for each irrigation event the amount of water applied was manually determined and recorded by a water flow meter urea 46 n as n source was applied in split doses before irrigation events 60 at first irrigation and 40 at third irrigation treatments were organized in a randomized complete block rcb design with four replications each treatment plot was 10 m 10 m 100 m2 with a 1 5 m buffer between adjacent plots field ridges covered with impervious plastic membranes were built between adjacent plots to prevent lateral water and n movement recommended phosphorus 120 kg p2o5 and potassium 150 kg k2o ha 1 fertilizers were uniformly applied across all the treatment plots no herbicides were applied in both crop growing seasons 2 3 sampling measurements and calculation 2 3 1 measurement of forage biomass wheat plants were harvested from two separate randomly selected areas each 4 m2 within each replicated plot at tillering tl jointing jo booting bo and grain filling gf stages plants were hand cut at ground level with manual shears and fresh forage biomass was determined immediately with an electric scale subsequently the samples were oven dried at 65 c until constant weight to estimate the dry matter yield dm the final dm yield was determined at harvesting 2 3 2 measurement of forage nutritive values for the determination of forage nutritive values oven dried plant samples were crushed into fine powder passed through a 1 mm mesh screen and prepared for chemical analysis the concentration of crude protein cp was estimated by determining n content using the standard kjeldahl method zhang et al 2018 the concentration of acid detergent fiber adf and

dry matter yield fresh biomass of spring wheat was significantly p 0 05 affected by different irrigation and n treatments during 2015 and 2016 fig 2a b the forage biomass followed a gradually increasing trend with the progression of the crop growth period and reached peak values 12 58 18 41 t ha 1 at the bo stage fig 2a b thereafter the forage biomass declined at the gf stage 7 85 13 60 t ha 1 owing to the onset of leaf senesces at each sampling stage greater biomass was achieved with w100f100 and w80f75 during both years the difference between w100f100 and w80f75 treatments was non significant at various sampling stages except for the tl stage in 2016 fig 2a b however too much decrease in irrigation and n amounts resulted in a linear decline in biomass and the lowest biomass was achieved for w60f75 and w60f50 treatments results showed significant effects of the year treatments and their interaction on the dry matter dm yield of spring wheat fig 3a the average dm yield of all treatments was greater by 9 4 in 2015 compared to that in 2016 the dm yield achieved for different treatments ranged from 4 1 to 7 2 t ha 1 in 2015 and from 3 6 to 6 9 t ha 1 in 2016 fig 3a statistically no significant difference in dm was evident between w100f100 7 0 and 6 9 t ha 1 and w80f75 7 2 and 6 7 t ha 1 treatments in 2015 and 2016 except for w80f75 the dm of spring wheat was markedly decreased with other reduced irrigation and n treatments in both crop growing seasons fig 3a compared to w100f100 the dm yield for w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments were decreased by 18 2 22 9 and 41 6 in 2015 and 21 4 38 2 and 48 9 in 2016 respectively 3 2 grain yield as affected by reduced irrigation and n treatments different irrigation and n treatments significantly influenced the wheat grain yield in both crop growing seasons no significant difference in grain yield was evident between 2015 and 2016 interestingly the highest grain yield was achieved with w80f75 7 3 and 6 8 t ha 1 which was greater by 14 1 and 7 9 compared to w100f100 6 4 and 6 3 t ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 3b however excessively reduced irrigation and n treatments showed detrimental effects on grain yield the w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments resulted in grain yields of 5 4 4 2 and 4 0 t ha 1 in 2015 and 5 4 4 7 and 3 9 t ha 1 in 2016 fig 3b in comparison the grain yield for w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments was decreased by 15 6 34 4 and 37 5 in 2015 and by 14 3 25 4 and 38 1 in 2016 compared to that of w100f100 respectively 3 3 crude protein as affected by reduced irrigation and n treatments the dynamic of crude protein cp concentration at various stages during the spring wheat growing period with different treatments are presented in fig 4 initially the cp followed an increasing trend from tl to jo stage and then gradually decreased until gf stage in general cp concentration exhibited a similar trend in both wheat growing seasons and tended to increase with a moderate decrease in irrigation and n w80f75 but markedly decreased with severely reduced irrigation and n rates as compared to the conventional full application during the whole crop growing period fig 4a b the cp yield for the total dm at harvesting was significantly p 0 01 affected by irrigation and n treatments but the effect of the year and its interaction with treatment t y was non significant p 0 05 table 1 the cp yield ranged from 243 1 to 749 3 kg ha 1 in 2015 and from 272 4 to 755 6 kg ha 1 in 2016 for different treatments table 1 among all the treatments the highest cp yield was achieved for the w80f75 746 2 and 755 6 kg ha 1 followed by w100f100 749 3 and 687 0 kg ha 1 whereas the lowest cp yield was obtained for w60f50 243 1 and 272 4 kg ha 1 and w60f75 388 1 and 354 3 kg ha 1 treatments in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 1 the cp yield for the w80f75 treatment was similar to that of w100f100 in 2015 but was greater by 10 0 in 2016 on the other hand the cp yield of w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments was decreased by 34 2 48 2 and 67 6 in 2015 and by 20 3 48 4 and 60 3 in 2016 when compared to w100f100 treatment respectively 3 4 relative feed value as affected by irrigation and n treatments during both spring wheat growing seasons the relative feed value rfv gradually decreased with the advancement of the crop growth period the rfv values ranged from 327 8 to 383 9 at tl stage 206 5 314 3 at jo stage 146 8 213 11 at bo stage and 122 6 206 5 at gf stage in 2015 and 2016 fig 5a b at each stage there were significant differences in rfv values among treatments remarkably the rfv values were increased by reducing the irrigation and n rates when compared to conventional full application management at most of the sampling stages the rfv was greater for w80f75 w80f50 and w60f75 treatments while the values were lower for the w100f100 treatment fig 5a b the treatments year and their interaction significantly affected the total rfv yield at harvesting table 1 among the various treatments the highest rfv yield was achieved for w80f75 14 10 and 12 94 t ha 1 the rfv yield for the w80f75 treatment was greater by 38 8 and 26 0 compared to the conventional w100f100 treatment in 2015 and 2016 respectively except for w80f75 other reduced irrigation and n treatments significantly decreased the rfv yield compared to w100f100 in both years table 1 in comparison the rfv yield for the w60f75 and w60f50 treatments decreased by 16 1 and 47 4 in 2015 while it decreased by 28 3 and 48 7 in 2016 compared to that of w100f100 respectively 3 5 fiber contents as affected by reduced irrigation and n treatments based on the different effects of treatments on the shoot fiber the accumulation of acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf of spring wheat was assessed at various growth stages figs 6 7 the concentration of adf and ndf progressively increased following the crop growth period and the maximum values were observed at gf stage during the wheat growing seasons the concentration of adf and ndf ranged from 10 0 to 14 8 and 19 6 25 3 at tl stage 11 1 21 4 and 22 6 31 0 at jo stage 17 2 27 2 and 29 5 42 9 at bo stage and 21 1 33 0 and 32 6 50 1 at gf stage figs 6 7 at each sampling stage the adf and ndf concentrations were greater for w100f100 treatment at harvesting the adf and ndf content per unit dm of wheat was significantly affected by year treatments and their interaction table 1 the w100f100 resulted in the highest adf 330 2 and 294 4 g kg 1 and ndf 465 5 and 500 5 g kg 1 contents in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 1 initially the adf and ndf contents followed a decreasing trend with moderately reduced irrigation and n but increased again with the excessive reduction of irrigation and n the lowest adf and ndf contents were achieved for the w80f75 and w80f50 treatments table 1 compared to w100f100 the adf content of w80f75 treatment was lowered by 36 2 and 28 2 and ndf content by 29 8 and 25 5 while the adf contents of the w80f50 treatments was decreased by 31 7 and 30 5 and ndf by 25 6 and 18 5 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the adf and ndf contents for w60f50 were comparable to that of w100f100 in both years table 1 3 6 digestible dry matter dry matter intake total digestible nutrients and net energy for lactation when analyzed at harvest the digestible dry matter ddm dry matter intake dmi total digestible nutrients tdn and net energy for lactation nel were significantly affected by year treatments and their interaction table 1 initially the ddm dmi tdn and nel increased with reducing irrigation and n amounts and the highest values were observed for w80f75 and w80f50 treatments in both years table 1 in comparisons the ddm dmi tdn and nel of w80f75 treatment were greater by

respectively in addition the w60f75 and w60f50 treatments markedly reduced the ddm dmi tdn and nel compared to the w80f75 treatment however the values were still higher than that for the w100f100 treatment table 1 3 7 crop water productivity and nitrogen fertilizer productivity the crop water productivity of wheat based on the total yield production cwpyield cp yield cwpcp and rfv yield cwprfv

33 cwpcp by 22 8 and 36 8 and cwprfv by 70 3 and 55 7 in 2015 and 2016 respectively however the w80f50 and w60f75 treatments markedly declined the cwpyield and cwprfv compared to w80f75 but the values were still higher than that for the w100f100 treatment in both years fig 8 no significant difference in cwpyield was observed between the w100f100 and w60f50 treatments however the cwpcp and cwprfv

irrigation and n treatments and year except for nfpcp the interaction of year and treatments was significant only for nfprfv fig 9 initially reducing the irrigation and n application amounts increased the nfp and the highest values were achieved for w80f50 followed by w80f75 treatment during both years fig 9 compared to w100f100 the nfpyield nfpcp and nfprfv for w80f50 treatment was increased by 64

treatments decreased the nfpyield nfpcp and nfprfv compared to w80f75 and w80f50 treatments and the values were comparable to that of w100f100 during both years fig 9 3 8 economic benefits with reduced irrigation and n treatments the net returns ranged from 7148 16417 rmb ha 1 in 2015 and 6324 15019 rmb ha 1 in 2016 table 2 among the various treatments the highest net returns were achieved for w80f75 16417 rmb ha 1 in 2015 which was greater by 11 1 compared to w100f100 14776 rmb ha 1 however no significant difference in net returns was manifested between w80f75 15019 rmb ha 1 and w100f100 14726 rmb ha 1 in 2016 on the other hand w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments markedly reduced the net returns of spring wheat in both years table 2 compared to w100f100 the net returns for w80f50 w60f75 w60f50 treatments were decreased by 20 6 38 5 and 51 6 in 2015 and 22 9 42 4 and 57 1 in 2016 respectively the benefit cost ratio among different treatments ranged from 1 29 2 73 in 2015 and 1 14 2 50 in 2016 respectively table 2 the highest benefit cost ratio of 2 73 and 2 50 was achieved for w80f75 which was greater by 19 7 and 10 1 than w100f100 treatment in 2015 and 2016 respectively too much reduction in irrigation and n application steadily declined the benefit cost ratio of spring wheat and the lowest ratios were achieved for w60f75 1 56 and 1 46 and w60f50 1 29 and 1 14 treatments table 2 compared to w100f100 the cost benefit ratios for w80f50 w60f75 and w60f50 treatments was lowered by 10 5 31 6 and 43 4 in 2015 and by 12 8 35 7 and 49 8 in 2016 respectively 3 9 correlation and principal component analysis the pearson correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations of resource use efficiency indices cwpyield cwpcp cwprfv nfpcp and nfprfv with yield crude protein content and rfv of spring wheat but negative relations with adf and ndf content fig 10a the net returns followed a strong positive relationship with crude protein rfv resource use efficiency grain and forage yields while presenting a negative relationship with adf and ndf contents in addition the correlation analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between crude protein and rfv with forage yield while negative correlations of adf and ndf with forage yield fig 10a in addition the pca ordination plot was prepared to present the concerted information on the resource use efficiency forage yield and quality traits and net returns in relation to irrigation and nitrogen treatments fig 10b the first two principal components pcs

nfpcp and nfprfv 4 discussion 4 1 response of wheat yield to reduced irrigation and n treatments the agroecosystems in arid regions are highly vulnerable due to limited available water and soil nutrient resources kheir et al 2022 li et al 2022 wang et al 2018 supplemental irrigation and n fertilization are key solutions to sustaining plant growth and improving the yield stability of crops chen et al 2018 gonzalez dugo et al 2010 ma et al 2022 an adequate n supply is essential for utilizing the benefits of additional water and reciprocally an adequate water supply is required to utilize the benefits of n fertilizers kunrath et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in general reducing irrigation and or n levels are believed to decrease crop yield jiang et al 2013 zhong et al 2021 however a moderate decrease in irrigation and n w80f75 in the present study did not show any detrimental effects on dm and grain yield of spring wheat these results partly support our hypothesis that the farmers practiced irrigation and n application in the arid region of northwest china are excessive and a rational decrease would not limit the crop water and nutrient demands required for optimal growth and productivity of spring wheat consistent with these results previous studies have shown that appropriate irrigation and n amounts in water deficit arid regions were more beneficial than their excessive applications li et al 2022 si et al 2020 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2006 a higher grain yield with w80f75 treatment is endorsed to the synergistic effects of optimum water and n on carbon assimilation and grain filling efficiency guo et al 2014 si et al 2020 wang et al 2014 previously teixeira et al 2014 and wang et al 2015 reported that rational irrigation and fertilizer ensure optimal resource acquisition and improve photosynthetic and carboxylation efficiency resulting in greater crop yields in addition both dm and grain yield were markedly decreased with severe deficit irrigation and n treatments w60f75 and w60f50 this is because of an increase in the osmotic pressure of the rhizosphere which causes plants to acquire more energy for maintaining cell water contents decreasing the plant s ability to transpire and absorb nutrients gonzalez dugo et al 2010 jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 moreover dry soil limits the mineralization and transport of n from bulk soil to the rhizosphere which reduces n availability to plants kunrath et al 2018 nitrogen limitation on the other hand reduces leaf and stem expansion islam et al 2012 si et al 2020 teixeira et al 2014 and resource capture radiation interception and n uptake accelerates the onset of senescence and chlorophyll degradation kamran et al 2020 kaplan et al 2019 wang et al 2013 which causes a reduction in assimilates and the grain sink capacity çakir 2004 srivastava et al 2018 wang et al 2014 also the irrigation and n limitations exacerbate premature kernel abortion çakir 2004 gao et al 2017 which could be another possible reason for lower grain yield with w60f75 and w60f50 treatments 4 2 impacts of reduced irrigation and n treatments on the nutritive quality in this study crude protein contents and rfv decreased while ndf and adf contents increased with the advancement of the spring wheat growing period such trends are distinctive in crops ascribed to a decrease in leaf area with the onset of leaf senescence kamran et al 2020 liu et al 2021 ronga et al 2020 and an increase in stem rigidity owing to greater accumulation of fiber contents kamran et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018 leading to a reduction of nutritive quality among treatments w80f75 markedly improved the nutritive quality evidenced by greater crude protein and rfv yield and lower adf and ndf content compared to that of w100f100 treatment consistently previous studies have also reported high forage quality of different crops with optimized irrigation and fertilization than in well irrigated and high fertilized conditions kaplan et al 2019 ma et al 2022 rostamza et al 2011 previously kamran et al 2022 and marsalis et al 2010 showed a negative correlation between forage quality with irrigation and n fertilizer rates excessive irrigation and fertilization often result in lower forage quality because of their interactive effects strengthening the cell wall component and fiber contents kaplan et al 2019 which was also confirmed by greater ndf and adf contents in our present study islam et al 2012 reported high ndf and adf ratios and low protein in stalks compared to leaves since high irrigation and fertilization levels increase the stem ratios thereby regulating the fiber concentration kaplan et al 2019 rostamza et al 2011 on the other hand appropriate irrigation and n maintain a high leaf to stem ratio and delay maturity contributing to high crude protein yield and forage quality liu et al 2021 rostamza et al 2011 furthermore n being an essential element is crucial for the synthesis of chlorophyll enzymes and proteins which regulate almost all metabolic activities of plants islam et al 2012 therefore adequate water and n with w80f75 treatment will increase plant n uptake thereby enhancing the synthesis of amino acid and protein contents which is in close agreement with findings from previous studies kaplan et al 2019 tang et al 2018 in addition quality traits such as ddm dmi tdn and nel are highly desirable because of their advantages in boosting animals ability to absorb the forage nutrients lithourgidis et al 2006 tang et al 2018 compared to both conventional and severe deficit irrigation and n treatments the w80f75 treatment noticeably improved all of the above mentioned quality components attributed to the positive effects of w80f75 on lowering the undesirable ndf and adf contents the crude protein tdn and nel for wheat in the present study were comparable to previously reported values for corn marsalis et al 2010 pearl millet rostamza et al 2011 and sorghum jahanzad et al 2013 tang et al 2018 supporting the importance of dm straw yield of spring wheat as a potential feed source for livestock development 4 3 impacts of reduced irrigation and n treatments on resource use efficiency in recent years studies are increasingly focusing on maintaining the best resource use efficiency and economic productivity with lower inputs to ensure sustainable productivity in arid regions fang and su 2019 kheir et al 2022 li et al 2022 zhang et al 2006 in the present study the cwpyield and nfpyield were greater for the w80f75 treatment compared to other treatments this implies that appropriate irrigation and fertilization simultaneously improve the effectiveness of water and nutrition and such complementary effects could be referred to as synergistic functions wang et al 2016 because matching fertilizer with irrigation amount improves the crop nutrients absorption and utilization effectively improving productivity and resource use efficiency dai et al 2019 jalil sheshbahreh et al 2019 similar results were achieved by rostamza et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 and li et al 2022 who observed that instead of excessive applications irrigation and n based on crop demand contributed to enhanced resource use efficiencies in justification adequate irrigation and n levels increase leaf area index which enhances light and co2 capture and regulates photoassimilates distribution in the plant s above ground parts translating into higher resource use efficiency fang and su 2019 kaplan et al 2019 kunrath et al 2018 ma et al 2022 wang et al 2016 since the dm and grain yields in our study were comparable for both w100f100 and w80f75 treatments a greater cwpyield and nfpyield obtained for the w80f75 treatment is attributed to the lower degree of water and n rates applied on the other hand the irrigation and n amounts for w60f75 and w60f50 treatments were further reduced but the cwpyield and nfpyield were significantly lower than that for w80f75 treatment this is because the w60f75 and w60f50 treatments failed to maintain yield benefit and the dm and grain yield significantly declined compared to the w80f75 treatment extremely deficit irrigation and n application are linked to poor biomass accumulation and yields by limiting resource capture teixeira et al 2014 adversely affecting photosynthetic capacity wang et al 2010 2015 reducing carbon assimilation and grain filling characteristics wang et al 2014 2013 which consequently decrease the resource use efficiencies besides the previously reported values for crop water productivity chen et al 2018 lai et al 2022 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2006 and n fertilizer productivity chen et al 2018 si et al 2020 tan et al 2017 for wheat in north china were lower than those observed in our present study in explanation previous studies used wheat solely for grain purpose while we used wheat for dual purpose and have considered both grain and dm yield for calculating the crop water and fertilizer productivity factor additionally water and fertilizer productivity based on the nutritive attributes can be used as an important criterion for assessing the efficacy of different agronomic managements in forage crops zhang et al 2018 our results showed that moderately reduced irrigation and n treatments enhanced the cwpcp cwprfv nfpcp and nfprfv of wheat dm yield over that of conventional management the highest cwpcp and cwprfv values were achieved for the w80f75 treatment while the greatest nfpcp and nfprfv values were achieved for w80f50 and w80f75 treatments in both years the higher values with w80f50 and w80f75 treatments are attributed to a greater leaf to stem ratio and delayed crop maturity with appropriate irrigation and n application islam et al 2012 rostamza et al 2011 tang et al 2018 which improved the forage nutritive quality and hence the cwp and nfp for crude protein and rfv the cwp and nfp for crude protein ranged from 0 47 to 1 19 kg mm 1 and 1 57 3 65 kg kg 1 while that for rfv ranged from 10 40 to 21 27 kg mm 1 and 32 70 71 37 kg kg 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively unfortunately no previous studies have calculated similar indices or reported data to compare these values with results from elsewhere future studies should therefore focus on integrating forage quality attributes along with biomass and grain yield while calculating cwp and nfp for dual purpose crops under different agronomic management which would provide a better understanding of their use as forage crop 4 4 impacts of reduced irrigation and n treatments on the economic benefit intensive agronomic practices are often believed to boost crop yields and hence economic benefits wang et al 2018 in the present study w80f75 presented the greatest net returns of spring wheat compared to w1000f100 signifying that intensive practices do not necessarily improve the economic benefits which is in agreement with the findings of a previous study li et al 2022 a higher net return and benefit cost ratio with w80f75 treatment are attributed to i reduced input by decreasing irrigation and n application rates and ii higher output due to relatively stable yields similar results of higher yield and economic benefits with appropriate fertilization and or irrigation were reported for maize wang et al 2018 yan et al 2021 wheat li et al 2019 and alfalfa zhang et al 2020 in this study the total output grain dm yield with w100f100 treatment failed to compensate for the high input costs lowering the net returns and benefits cost ratio on the other hand very low irrigation and n treatments w60f75 and w60f50 significantly reduced the input costs but were still not economically beneficial because of resulting in significant yield losses the w80f75 treatment increased the net returns by 2107 rmb ha 1 and 776 rmb ha 1 15 2 and 5 4 and the benefit cost ratio by 0 54 and 0 30 24 0 and 13 5 compared with the w100f100 treatment in 2016 the economic benefit and benefit cost ratio for w80f75 treatment were lower than that in 2015 because precipitation was relatively lower which increased the crop water demand and reduced the effectiveness of w80f75 on increasing yield benefit compared to w100f100 these findings suggest that the effects of reduced irrigation and fertilization are associated with precipitation whereas light precipitation could reduce the effectiveness of deficit irrigation and fertilization overall w80f75 maintained significantly higher net returns even in the year of low precipitation suggesting that the application of 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 can be used for wheat production in the arid region of northwest china without yield losses 5 conclusions present findings illustrated significant prospects for optimizing the irrigation and n fertilizer amounts for spring wheat in the arid region of northwest china a moderate decrease in irrigation and n w80f75 improved the resource use efficiencies and forage nutritive quality without compromising the grain yield of spring wheat compared to conventional management w100f100 in addition the w80f75 treatment improved the net returns and the benefit cost ratio over that of w100f100 in both wheat growing seasons except for w80f75 other deficit irrigation and n treatments presented detrimental effects by reducing grain yield dm yield forage nutritive values resource use efficiency and economic benefits compared to w100f100 thus the application of 600 mm irrigation and 225 kg n ha 1 can be used as an effective treatment for obtaining optimum yields and is more valuable when considering the forage nutritive values and net income benefit for spring wheat production in the arid region of northwest china and areas with similar climatic conditions nevertheless the climatic conditions particularly precipitation amounts and soil properties may vary between different arid regions and the optimized irrigation and n treatment in this study may not be favorable to optimal yields and economic benefits in other arid regions therefore future multi locational studies are suggested to clarify how climatic variations in different arid regions would influence the potential effects of deficit water and fertilization on spring wheat production forage nutritive quality and economic benefit more specific guidelines will help farmers to reduce irrigation and fertilizer inputs while maximizing economic profitability in arid agricultural production systems declaration of competing interest the authors

9189,this study aims to elucidate the process of crop evapotranspiration etc and develop models to estimate etc as a crucial value to efficiently schedule irrigation accordingly we propose a new idea for non destructive online acquisition of etc data via mobile phones the greenhouse environmental data were collected by sensors and uploaded to a mobile phone for the penman monteith pm calculations of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 the canopy coverage pgc was accurately extracted from mobile phone images using the super green algorithm and four machine learning algorithms xgboost catboost svr and rf were used to construct an online computing model for crop coefficient k c etc k c et0 was used to dynamically monitor the change of water requirement of different types of lettuce the results showed that the correlation coefficients for the four monitoring networks were in the range of 0 74 0 93 which could be used to estimate the k c at different stages the integrated models showed high accuracy and similar performance compared with that of the svr model the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean square error mse of the three algorithms were reduced regarding the generalisation and computational speed of the proposed approach the estimation accuracy of the xgboost model was improved by 17 31 and the convergence speed was also increased by 12 57 relative to other models on different types of lettuce the xgboost model can be recommended as the k c model for estimation the daily mean values of leaf lettuce and head lettuce as measured in etc were 2 38 mm d 1 and 6 22 mm d 1 respectively the average errors were 3 48 and 6 36 respectively we further explored models of the mathematical relationship between k c and the plant height h plant width d and normalised vegetation index ndvi to establish a new approach for reasonable and scientific irrigation management keywords image processing machine learning crop coefficient crop evapotranspiration data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction evapotranspiration refers to the total amount of water vapour transported to the atmosphere by vegetation and the ground the phenomena is an important part of the surface energy balance and ecological water cycle evapotranspiration affects atmospheric circulation as well as plant growth and yields and plays a role in regulating the climate wang et al 2020a li et al 2020a as a crops with large water requirements and high sensitivity to water vegetables are suitable for irrigation test based on our iws lettuce lactuca sativa var ramosa hort is rich in nutrition and has various health benefits and medicinal value as a representative leafy vegetable in recent years the cultivation scale of lettuce has increased rapidly the area under cultivation for vegetables planting area in china is approximately 1 35 million hm2 gao et al 2022 therefore an accurate understanding of lettuce evapotranspiration makes it possible to manage irrigation resources properly with maximum efficiency at present evapotranspiration is determined mainly by using the k c method the food and agriculture organisation fao has proposed a standard method to estimate crop evapotranspiration reference crop evapotranspiration multiplied by k c in which the reference evapotranspiration is calculated using the modified pm model and the key problem is the acquisition of k c water waste can reach up to 20 for irrigation management with overestimated k c values whereas the yield reduction can reach up to 38 with underestimated k c values luís et al 2019 therefore extensive research has been conducted on the estimation of k c luís et al 2019 nyawade shadrack et al 2021 hu et al 2021 brenner et al 2018 chen et al 2019 calculated the plant density and evaporation of maize at different growth stages using a water balance equation and the double k c method yu et al 2020 used the bowen ratio energy balance method to estimate the evapotranspiration of vineyards in semi humid areas li and ma 2018 calculated summer maize evapotranspiration using a double k c model and verified their results using the stable carbon isotope method and water balance method respectively the method used to measure k c is simple and practical the fao recommendations address only 84 crops and only suggest specific values for different crop growth periods however different values of k c can be recorded in various regions and at different times a considerable deviation may be observed between the calculated crop evapotranspiration based on k c as recommended by the fao and the actual value wang et al 2019 established a single k c evapotranspiration model for the entire growth period of summer maize using a genetic algorithm and measured data from a weighing lysimeter and meteorological elements steele et al 1996 established a regression relationship between k c and the days after sowing to construct a dynamic curve of k c during the growth period of maize liu and kang 2006 studied the relationship between evapotranspiration and reference crop transpiration at the heading stage of winter wheat they established a relationship between leaf area index plant height and k c using data regression however most of these studies calculated and fitted their results using traditional methods these traditional methods are simple and require long term observation of experimental data thus the generalisation performance of the corresponding models is typically relatively low with the development of artificial intelligence technology machine vision has been widely implemented in many industries as well as in urban design medicine and other fields and provides a new solution for agriculture at present the application of machine vision technology to agriculture has mainly focused on the identification of diseases and insect pests robot picking and other aspects cagnoni et al 2020 indicating the feasibility of machine vision in agricultural applications in this study we propose an online estimation method for etc based on low cost mobile phone photography the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the pgc of lettuce using a super green algorithm for image segmentation 2 establish the lettuce k c model using different machine learning algorithms and select the algorithm model suitable for the representation of the dynamic crop growth process 3 provide an accurate estimation of etc by combination with the single crop coefficient method and 4 establish the relationship equation for lettuce between k c and h d and ndvi and explore the inversion of the multi feature parameters of lettuce using a machine vision algorithm the results of this work establish a theoretical basis for further research on crop irrigation and growth regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design in this study we conducted two cropping experiments in a sunlight greenhouse 116 46 e 40 18 n of the national precision agriculture demonstration base in changping district beijing at an altitude of 50 m pot planting of lettuce lactuca sativa var ramose hort was used in the experiments soil was obtained from layer of soil 0 20 cm deep from the base farmland after being naturally air dried it was crushed and passed through a 2 mm sieved soil the soil type was sandy clay loam and the quality of the cultivated land was graded as medium the soil moisture content was measured by the drying method and the bulk density of the soil was measured by the wilkes method the inner diameter of

intelligent weighing system cagnoni et al 2020 accuracy 1 g range 0 20 kg developed by the national engineering research centre for information technology in agriculture was adopted to automatically measure the changes in crop evapotranspiration during the lettuce growing period at 10 min measurement 2 2 2 crop growth image acquisition a huawei brand mobile phone was placed at a height of 70 80 cm to obtain a vertical view image of the potted lettuce under natural light conditions at 9 00 a m daily the resolution of the images was1080 2400 pixels two images were taken in the same pot at each time for image collection and an image with a good effect and high quality was manually selected as the test sample 2 2 3 meteorological data acquisition the greenhouse cloud environment ep400 data

the highest and lowest air temperatures at the test site were recorded daily 2 2 4 growth parameter measurement a hand held cm1000ndvi measuring instrument was used to measure the ndvi of potted lettuce at 13 00 daily each lettuce was measured three timesz and we recorded the average value the intelligent weighing system was used to realize the continuous weighing of the whole growth cycle of plants and the real time monitoring of the evapotranspiration of potted plants data were transmitted back to the cloud platform through the base station every 10 min we measured the h and d of the lettuce with a tape measure at 8 00 daily we also measured each plant three times and recorded the average value 2 2 5 et0 the fao 56 pm equation based on microclimatology and energy balance is the most practical and reliable method to calculate crop evapotranspiration satisfactory results have been obtained in experimental research in crop evapotranspiration infields and greenhouses in this greenhouse experiment we used the revised pm formula the formula used to perform this calculation is as follows gao et al 2022 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 1694 e s e a t 273 δ 1 64 γ where et0 represents

pre processing fig 2 shows a picture of the plants as recorded by the mobile phone owing to its artificial shooting method the mobile phone was not in a fixed position to take the shoot so in the photography produced a certain perspective distortion effect therefore it was necessary to correct this effect through a perspective geometric transformation perspective transformation is the projection of an image onto a new visual plane called projection mapping as shown in the figure we used the phone to defined a coordinate system xc yc zc whereas another coordinate system was associated with the reference coordinate system x y z however the perspective effect generated in a plane image as observed from any 3d angle can be modelled as follows zheng et al 2020 p x y i x z y z 7 x 0 w 1 y 0 h 1 here i is the captured image and p is the corrected image with a resolution of w h the values of x y z are computed using the three dimensional rotation matrix m 8 x y z m x y 1 m 11 m 12 m 13 m 21 m 22 m 23 m 31 m 32 1 x y 1 in the above m is the perspective transformation matrix because we are dealing with 2d images let z 1 to estimate the value of the matrix m and eliminate the observed distortion the simplest and fastest method was adopted an artificial rectangular marker was first placed over the location the size of this frame was known and the size information allows for mapping between the pixels and real world units the four corners of the rectangle p1 p2 p3 and p4 in this process are shown in fig 3 the matrix m can be calculated by mapping these points p1 p2 p3 and p4 to the four corners of the image p c1 c2 c3 and c4 the resolution of image p is defined as having the same aspect ratio as the marker size c i x m 11 p i x m 12 p i y m 13 m 31 p i x m 32 p i y

the four equations above allow for the solution of the eight unknowns m11 m12 m32 which can be obtained from i by calculating the matrix m fig 3c fig 4 shows images taken at different locations and those corrected using the above methods it may be observed from the figure that there were distortions in the images taken at different positions after the perspective distortion correction the top view with the same effect was obtained at the different positions 3 2 image segmentation and pgc extraction based on the super green algorithm image segmentation divides an image into several incompatible regions according to colour texture and other features lettuce is a typical green plant and the colour characteristics were more evident than the background to separate plants from the background and obtain the required pgc we adopted the super green algorithm in this study the super green algorithm exhibits a better extraction effect for image of green plant than other methods the shadow and soil images can be evidently suppressed and the plant image becomes more prominent the super green algorithm is as follows 11 e x g 2 g r b to separate plants from the background a threshold value was determined first and then the grey value of each pixel point was compared with the threshold value according to the results of the comparison results the pixels were divided into plants or backgrounds in this paper the maximum interclass variance method otsu s method javier herrera et al 2011 was adopted this method is simple and is not affected by image brightness and contrast as an automatic threshold selection method the process involved in calculating this value is simple and stable fig 5 shows the pgc evolution of the leaf and head lettuce fig 6 shows the trends of pgc and cumulative effective accumulated temperature for the two different types of lettuce during the entire growth period the effective accumulated temperature was used to indicate the heat demand for crop growth and development cumulative effective accumulated temperature refers to the cumulative sum of the remaining temperature after subtracting 10 from the daily average temperature during the entire growth period with increasing of cumulative effective accumulated temperature the pgc of lettuce increased gradually first and then tended to stabilize the pgc of the leaf lettuce increased from 10 57 to 76 at harvest the pgc of head lettuce increased from 10 38 to 100 at harvest in the seedling and rosette stages the cumulative effective temperature gradually increased and the pgc of lettuce exhibited a rapid increasing trend the effective accumulated temperature and pgc of the leaf lettuce increased by 11 84 and 1 34 respectively the effective accumulated temperature and pgc of the head lettuce increased by 15 24 and 2 13 respectively after entering the heading stage the cumulative effective temperature for the two types reached the highest values at 579 26 and 639 76 respectively the pgc growth in the lettuce then decreased and tends to stabilize through a correlation analysis table 1 it may be observed that the cumulative effective accumulated temperature was significantly positively correlated with the pgc in the seedling and rosette stages the correlation between the pgc and cumulative effective accumulated temperature was 0 92 0 98 4 k c model construction analysis 4 1 kalman filtering to eliminate air factors human factors data transmission process noise interference information and interference from the other external factors in the observed data we used a kalman filter to denoise the measured k c value kalman filtering is an algorithm that uses a linear system state equation to estimate a system state optimally through input and output data sompop and nawinda 2020 as may be observed from the figure the noise was removed from the k c data after kalman filtering with small fluctuations and good stability compared with the original data the rmse mae and mse of the filtered data were reduced by 24 81 18 05 and 42 95 respectively showing that the model became more accurate fig 7 4 2 k c estimation model construction in this study we established estimation models based on xgboost catboost rf and svr models and evaluated their performance in terms of accuracy generalisation and speed to screen for optimised estimation models fig 8 4 2 1 extreme gradient lifting model xgboost the xgboost model is a mainstream algorithm that has emerged in recent years the model is trained sequentially and the subsets of each weak learner are combined to obtain a new strong learner gertz et al 2020 the specific tree model used in this study was the classification and regression tree model the advantages of this algorithm include that it uses many strategies to prevent overfitting supports parallelisation and adds processing of sparse data the calculation formula is as follows 12 f i t k 1 t f k x i f i t 1 f i x i here f i x i is the learner of step t f i x i and f i t 1 are steps t and t 1 respectively and x i is the input variable 4 2 2 gradient boosting lifting decision tree model catboost catboost is a gradient boosting decision tree framework based on an oblivious tree algorithm with relatively few parameters which supports category variables and exhibits high accuracy the main issue concerns managing the classification features efficiently and reasonably for the regression task this method needs to use the average value of the data obtained for the prior calculations in this approach θ σ 1 σ 2 σ n n t is replaced with the following equation deng et al 2020 13 x σ p k j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k y σ j β p j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k β where p is the prior value and β is the weight of the prior values 4 2 3 random forest model rf the rf algorithm was proposed by leo breiman in 2001 through bootstrap resampling n samples are repeatedly and randomly selected from an original training sample set n to generate a new training sample set training decision tree then m decision trees are generated according to the above steps to form a rf and the classification result of the new data is determined by the score generated from the number of votes in the classification tree the prediction results of the regression model used in this method are calculated as follows li et al 2020b 14 h x 1 t i 1 t h x θ t here h x represents the regression prediction result and h x θ t represents the output based on x and θ 4 2 4 support vector regression model svr support vector machines provide a better way to minimise structural risk the vector regression algorithm mainly realises linear regression by constructing a linear decision function in a high dimensional space after increasing the dimensions and optimises the model by maximising the width of the interval band and minimising the total loss taheri et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the final function of the model is as follows 15 f x i 1 m a ˆ i a i k x i t x b in the above k x i t x is the radial basis kernel function the main parameters of the four models used in this work are listed in table 2 in the table max depth is the maximum depth of the tree and higher values made the model more complex and easier to overfit gamma is the minimum loss required for further segmentation on the leaves of the tree learning rate determines whether the objective function converged to the local minimum in the appropriate time and c is a penalty factor designed to preventing the overfitting problem in the prediction model the optimal parameters obtained through the manual adjustment are shown in table 2 the hardware configuration of the computer used in this experiment included an intel r core tm i5 4210 h cpu with clock rates of 2 90 ghz 2 90 ghz and 4 gb of ram running the windows10 operating system 64 bit the anaconda platform was adopted as the basic platform to train the model we used the python programming language version 3 7 and the pycharm integrated development environment 4 3 comparative analysis of the k c estimation performance based on machine learning in terms of accuracy performance the scatter diagram results for the measured and estimated k c values are compared in fig 9 as shown in the figure the overall integrated model xgboost catboost rf exhibited performance superior to that of the svr model however there was little difference among the different integrated models and the correlation range was 0 75 0 93 as may be observed from table 3 the difference in the estimation accuracy values rmse mae and mse among the integrated models was small compared with the svr model the rmse mae and mse of the integrated model decreased by 5 49 13 37 9 78 10 33 and 3 33 24 14 respectively in terms of the generalisation performance the pgcs of leaf and head lettuce were mixed into a validation set and input into the leaf and head lettuce models respectively for verification as may be observed from the results the estimation performance of the integrated model was still better than that of the svr model however some differences were evident among the different integration models the r2 values of each model were on the order of xgboost catboost rf indicating that the xgboost model exhibited good generalisation as may be observed from table 3 the generalisation performance of the xgboost estimation model was slightly better than those of the catboost and rf models compared with the catboost and rf models the mse rmse and mae of the xgboost model decrease were lower by 1 69 13 76 1 00 8 91 and 2 98 12 04 respectively in terms of the estimated efficiency it may be observed from fig 10 that the testing times of each model were on the order of xgboost catboost svr rf and that the testing time of the xgboost model was significantly shorter than that of the other models by 0 044 0 156 and 0 061 s respectively under the same number of iterations the loss values of the xgboost catboost svr and rf models were 0 02 0 03 0 03 and 0 03 respectively indicating that the xgboost model exhibited high estimation efficiency overall the estimation performance for the head lettuce was better than that for the leaf lettuce the measured value of k c estimated based on the xgboost model was close to the estimated value thus the generalisation of the model was better it was able to evaluate the growth state of lettuce better and can be used as an optimal model to estimate k c therefore the xgboost model exhibited a higher accuracy in the k c and etc estimations and was more advantageous than the other models 4 4 verification analysis of the etc estimation model 4 4 1 verification analysis of the estimation of k c fig 11 shows the trend of k c and the measured values during the entire fertility period as estimated using xgboost as may be observed from figure k c of lettuce increased gradually with the growth period there was some deviation in the measured values of the lettuce in the heading stage this may be due to the fact that the canopy coverage of lettuce reached 100 in the late heading stage resulting in no change in the final estimated value as shown in table 4 the estimation accuracy of lettuce k c for all growth stages was high and the r2 between the estimated value and the measured value was above 0 96 in the heading stage the transpiration of the crops was strong and the k c values of both the leaf and head lettuce reached maximum values of 2 65 and 3 04 respectively the average k c values of the leaf lettuce at the seedling rosette and heading stages were 1 12 1 29 and 2 26 respectively the relative errors were 4 17 1 09 and 1 14 respectively the average k c values of the head lettuce at the seedling rosette and heading stages were 0 83 1 26 and 2 92 respectively the relative errors were 1 28 8 71 and 10 34 respectively 4 4 2 verification analysis of the estimation of etc the field environmental data of the greenhouse were collected by sensors and uploaded to the mobile phone remotely combined with the k c values as estimated from the collected images they were substituted into the pm formula to calculate etc the changes in the estimated and measured etc values during the entire growth period of the lettuce are shown in fig 12 etc was calculated according to the estimated k c and compared with the actual etc it may be observed from fig 12 that the variation trends of the estimated etc values and the measured values were similar there was a difference in the etc between the head lettuce and the leaf lettuce this was due to the different types of lettuce the weight of head lettuce is more than three times that of leaf lettuce the leaf area of head lettuce is larger than that of leaf lettuce and the transpiration and photosynthesis are stronger resulting in increased of water requirements according to table 5 the average estimated etc of leaf lettuce in the seedling stage was 2 35 mm d 1 the relative error value when compared with the measured average etc was 1 68 at the rosette and heading stages the water requirements and thus etc of the lettuce increased with averages of 2 35 mm d 1 and 2 45 mm d 1 respectively compared with the measured average etc the relative errors were 1 68 and 7 07 respectively the water demand of the head lettuce at the seedling stage was small and the etc was low with an average of 2 71 mm d 1 the relative error with the measured etc was 7 16 at the rosette and heading stages the water demand and thus etc of the lettuce increase with averages of 4 62 mm d 1 and 11 33 mm d 1 respectively the relative errors with the measured etc were 2 49 and 9 43 respectively in the case of two types of lettuce planting the errors between the estimated and measured values of the etc were small accordingly machine learning methods showed a high ability to estimate the water requirements of lettuce crops 4 4 3 relationship of k c and other growth parameters k c is influenced by crop conditions and changes as the crop grows many studies have been conducted to estimate k c both domestically and internationally liu and kang 2006 established the relationship between k c and plant height and found that k c increased with increaseing in plant height previous studies established regression equations for the ndvi effective diameter and k c to estimate the value of k c narendra kumar and kamlesh 2010 gonzález esquiva et al 2016 to explore the relationships between them in this study k c was used to establish a regression equation for the different growth parameters to obtain the growth status of the lettuce in real time table 6 fig 13 shows the fitting equation diagram as established by k c with h d and ndvi the equation fitted by k c with h was in the form of logarithmic growth whereas the equation fitted by k c with d and ndvi was parabolic compared with d and ndvi h exhibited higher fitting accuracies of 0 93 and 0 95 respectively compared with d h showed an increase of 9 69 and 14 45 respectively compared with the ndvi h showed increases of 21 74 and 4 64 respectively this study shows that there was a high correlation between h d ndvi and k c and that the real time results of each parameter were obtained through k c inversion in the future the growth of lettuce can be reflected in real time and irrigation strategies can be adjusted in a timely manner to provide guidance for accurate irrigation and production as different crop types seasons and planting methods have different effects on k c their growth and development conditions also differ therefore further research on k c inversion based on different planting methods and crop types remains necessary 5 discussion in this study the simulation of k c has been studied at different levels and the influencing factors of k c were found to differ for different varieties and regions in this study the pgc was used to simulate k c and the variation trend of the estimated value of k c was consistent with the measured value of k c with the development of the growth period k c gradually showed a linear increasing trend xu et al 2010 showed that the growth period of lettuce in greenhouses in winter was longer than that in summer and that the crop coefficient increased gradually but the increase rate decreased at the end of the growing cycle this is similar to the results of the present study compared with this study the k c value for lettuce recommended by the fao is set under specific conditions the k c values for the early middle and late periods are 0 70 1 00 and 0 95 respectively which are significantly different from the measured k c values this most likely occurred because the value recommended by the fao for k c are designed for a situation in which there is no water stress in the growing stage of the crop and good tillage and field water management conditions allow the crop to achieve the maximum yield yuan et al 2018 this study was conducted in a greenhouse with potted crops in different regions crop growth is affected by many factors resulting in a large error between the value recommended by the fao and actual value obtained in the present work in general the k c value as estimated in this study was more consistent with the measured value compared with the catboost rf and svr models the xgboost model exhibited a higher accuracy in estimating k c and etc this was the case because the xgboost algorithm provides functions for parallel computation approximate tree construction and the effective processing of sparse data for small datasets which not only makes xgboost operationally efficient but also provides a higher fitting accuracy and improves the robustness of the model the catboost model uses a greedy algorithm in this case may produce an overfitting problem the rf algorithm leads to overfitting in regression problems with high noise the svr algorithm is sensitive the selection of parameters and kernel functions as well as missing data which make it difficult for the model to find appropriate parameters and reduce its accuracy previous studies also showed that the xgboost model is superior to other tree based ensemble learning models for estimations le et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 by using the single crop coefficient method the error between the k c calculation of etc as estimated by the xgboost model and the measured value was small and the performance was good the main reason for the error was the influence of the predicted error of k c at different growth stages and weather conditions this is similar to the results reported by wang et al 2020b fig 14 shows the error diagram between the results of each estimation model and the measured k c values of lettuce the solid line indicates zero value and the dotted line shows the error range 0 2 0 2 it may be observed from the results in the figure that the error value of lettuce k c estimation based on the xgboost model was the smallest the overall estimated value of the xgboost model were smaller than the measured value and the estimated errors were 80 00 and 84 62 within the error range 0 2 0 2 respectively the estimation results of the catboost and rf models were relatively good with 75 00 and 75 00 76 92 and 80 77 estimation errors within 2 2 respectively the estimation effect of the svr model was relatively poor with 72 50 and 69 23 estimation errors within the error range 2 2 respectively compared with single input models for the leaf lettuce and head lettuce when the leaf and head lettuce were used as inputs the errors increased by more than 30 94 this was attributed to the large difference in the pgc values between the two types of lettuce when mixing was used as the input the training model fluctuated considerably resulting in low correlation when using the model 6 conclusions efficient irrigation minimises unnecessary water use thereby helping to save energy in this study we used image distortion correction combined with a super green algorithm was used to extract crop canopy coverage data for leaf lettuce and head lettuce we established an estimation model for lettuce water requirements based on machine vision technology we trained xgboost catboost svr and rf models to estimate the coefficients of the lettuce crop the results have shown that the integration models xgboost catboost rf performed better than svr models in terms of accuracy with a correlation range of 0 75 0 93 the generalisation performance of the xgboost model was compared with the catboost svr and rf models and the xgboost model was found to exhibit superior performance compared to the catboost and rf models in terms of generalisation whereas the svr model exhibited the worst generalisation performance the estimation model dynamically monitored the changes in the crop coefficient during the entire growth process the pm formula was used to calculate the crop water requirements to help farmers decide the amount of irrigation to use and effectively solved the problem of reducing water consumption without affecting productivity in addition we have further established a model of the mathematical relationship model based on the crop coefficient plant height plant width and ndvi providing theoretical guidance to future studies that aim to explore crop growth monitoring with the rapid development of smart agriculture the fao proposed that the integration of new technologies and agriculture is an important way to ensure sustainable development in the present work we realized the online measurement of water demand which can be applied to leafy vegetables and the application can be expanded to fruits and vegetables in the future simultaneously the development and construction of a closed loop intelligent irrigation control system with internet of things devices such as water demand calculators and irrigation controllers remains as a potentially fruitful avenue

9189,this study aims to elucidate the process of crop evapotranspiration etc and develop models to estimate etc as a crucial value to efficiently schedule irrigation accordingly we propose a new idea for non destructive online acquisition of etc data via mobile phones the greenhouse environmental data were collected by sensors and uploaded to a mobile phone for the penman monteith pm calculations of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 the canopy coverage pgc was accurately extracted from mobile phone images using the super green algorithm and four machine learning algorithms xgboost catboost svr and rf were used to construct an online computing model for crop coefficient k c etc k c et0 was used to dynamically monitor the change of water requirement of different types of lettuce the results showed that the correlation coefficients for the four monitoring networks were in the range of 0 74 0 93 which could be used to estimate the k c at different stages the integrated models showed high accuracy and similar performance compared with that of the svr model the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean square error mse of the three algorithms were reduced regarding the generalisation and computational speed of the proposed approach the estimation accuracy of the xgboost model was improved by 17 31 and the convergence speed was also increased by 12 57 relative to other models on different types of lettuce the xgboost model can be recommended as the k c model for estimation the daily mean values of leaf lettuce and head lettuce as measured in etc were 2 38 mm d 1 and 6 22 mm d 1 respectively the average errors were 3 48 and 6 36 respectively we further explored models of the mathematical relationship between k c and the plant height h plant width d and normalised vegetation index ndvi to establish a new approach for reasonable and scientific irrigation management keywords image processing machine learning crop coefficient crop evapotranspiration data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction evapotranspiration refers to the total amount of water vapour transported to the atmosphere by vegetation and the ground the phenomena is an important part of the surface energy balance and ecological water cycle evapotranspiration affects atmospheric circulation as well as plant growth and yields and plays a role in regulating the climate wang et al 2020a li et al 2020a as a crops with large water requirements and high sensitivity to water vegetables are suitable for irrigation test based on our iws lettuce lactuca sativa var ramosa hort is rich in nutrition and has various health benefits and medicinal value as a representative leafy vegetable in recent years the cultivation scale of lettuce has increased rapidly the area under cultivation for vegetables planting area in china is approximately 1 35 million hm2 gao et al 2022 therefore an accurate understanding of lettuce evapotranspiration makes it possible to manage irrigation resources properly with maximum efficiency at present evapotranspiration is determined mainly by using the k c method the food and agriculture organisation fao has proposed a standard method to estimate crop evapotranspiration reference crop evapotranspiration multiplied by k c in which the reference evapotranspiration is calculated using the modified pm model and the key problem is the acquisition of k c water waste can reach up to 20 for irrigation management with overestimated k c values whereas the yield reduction can reach up to 38 with underestimated k c values luís et al 2019 therefore extensive research has been conducted on the estimation of k c luís et al 2019 nyawade shadrack et al 2021 hu et al 2021 brenner et al 2018 chen et al 2019 calculated the plant density and evaporation of maize at different growth stages using a water balance equation and the double k c method yu et al 2020 used the bowen ratio energy balance method to estimate the evapotranspiration of vineyards in semi humid areas li and ma 2018 calculated summer maize evapotranspiration using a double k c model and verified their results using the stable carbon isotope method and water balance method respectively the method used to measure k c is simple and practical the fao recommendations address only 84 crops and only suggest specific values for different crop growth periods however different values of k c can be recorded in various regions and at different times a considerable deviation may be observed between the calculated crop evapotranspiration based on k c as recommended by the fao and the actual value wang et al 2019 established a single k c evapotranspiration model for the entire growth period of summer maize using a genetic algorithm and measured data from a weighing lysimeter and meteorological elements steele et al 1996 established a regression relationship between k c and the days after sowing to construct a dynamic curve of k c during the growth period of maize liu and kang 2006 studied the relationship between evapotranspiration and reference crop transpiration at the heading stage of winter wheat they established a relationship between leaf area index plant height and k c using data regression however most of these studies calculated and fitted their results using traditional methods these traditional methods are simple and require long term observation of experimental data thus the generalisation performance of the corresponding models is typically relatively low with the development of artificial intelligence technology machine vision has been widely implemented in many industries as well as in urban design medicine and other fields and provides a new solution for agriculture at present the application of machine vision technology to agriculture has mainly focused on the identification of diseases and insect pests robot picking and other aspects cagnoni et al 2020 indicating the feasibility of machine vision in agricultural applications in this study we propose an online estimation method for etc based on low cost mobile phone photography the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the pgc of lettuce using a super green algorithm for image segmentation 2 establish the lettuce k c model using different machine learning algorithms and select the algorithm model suitable for the representation of the dynamic crop growth process 3 provide an accurate estimation of etc by combination with the single crop coefficient method and 4 establish the relationship equation for lettuce between k c and h d and ndvi and explore the inversion of the multi feature parameters of lettuce using a machine vision algorithm the results of this work establish a theoretical basis for further research on crop irrigation and growth regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design in this study we conducted two cropping experiments in a sunlight greenhouse 116 46 e

intelligent weighing system cagnoni et al 2020 accuracy 1 g range 0 20 kg developed by the national engineering research centre for information technology in agriculture was adopted to automatically measure the changes in crop evapotranspiration during the lettuce growing period at 10 min measurement 2 2 2 crop growth image acquisition a huawei brand mobile phone was placed at a height of 70 80 cm to obtain a vertical view image of the potted lettuce under natural light conditions at 9 00 a m daily the resolution of the images was1080 2400 pixels two images were taken in the same pot at each time for image collection and an image with a good effect and high quality was manually selected as the test sample 2 2 3 meteorological data acquisition the greenhouse cloud environment ep400 data

the highest and lowest air temperatures at the test site were recorded daily 2 2 4 growth parameter measurement a hand held cm1000ndvi measuring instrument was used to measure the ndvi of potted lettuce at 13 00 daily each lettuce was measured three timesz and we recorded the average value the intelligent weighing system was used to realize the continuous weighing of the whole growth cycle of plants and the real time monitoring of the evapotranspiration of potted plants data were transmitted back to the cloud platform through the base station every 10 min we measured the h and d of the lettuce with a tape measure at 8 00 daily we also measured each plant three times and recorded the average value 2 2 5 et0 the fao 56 pm equation based on microclimatology and energy balance is the most practical and reliable method to calculate crop evapotranspiration satisfactory results have been obtained in experimental research in crop evapotranspiration infields and greenhouses in this greenhouse experiment we used the revised pm formula the formula used to perform this calculation is as follows gao et al 2022 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 1694 e s e a t 273 δ 1 64 γ where et0 represents

rmse and determination coefficient r2 3 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 4 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 5 r m s e i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n 6 r 2 1 i y i y i i y i y i 2 2 where y ˆ i is the predicted value y i is the measured value y i is the average value and n is the total number of predicted results 2 4 technical roadmap the general framework of this study is shown in fig 1 and includes the following five steps 1 we collected input images of lettuce at different growth stages and trimmed the images via a perspective distortion correction 2 we used the super green algorithm to extract the pgc from the pictures 3 we used the k c obtained from the experiment for to perform kalman filtering and divided the dataset into two parts to perform a training and testing sets where the xgboost catboost rf and svr models were used to perform training and the accuracy generalisation and speed performance of the models were comprehensively considered and the estimation results r2 mae rmse and mse were used to find the optimal estimation model 4 we used meteorological parameters and the optimal estimation model to obtain k c for the etc estimation and validation 5 we explored the relationship between k c and the different growth parameters using k c and the different parameters h d ndvi for inversion 3 image pre processing and analysis of image segmentation results from image pre processing 3 1 image pre processing fig 2 shows a picture of the plants as recorded by the mobile phone owing to its artificial shooting method the mobile phone was not in a fixed position to take the shoot so in the photography produced a certain perspective distortion effect therefore it was necessary to correct this effect through a perspective geometric transformation perspective transformation is the projection of an image onto a new visual plane called projection mapping as shown in the figure we used the phone to defined a coordinate system xc yc zc whereas another coordinate system was associated with the reference coordinate system x y z however the perspective effect generated in a plane image as observed from any 3d angle can be modelled as follows zheng et al 2020 p x y i x z y z 7 x 0 w 1 y 0 h 1 here i is the captured image and p is the corrected image with a resolution of w h the values of x y z are computed using the three dimensional rotation matrix m 8 x y z m x y 1 m 11 m 12 m 13 m 21 m 22 m 23 m 31 m 32 1 x y 1 in the above m is the perspective transformation matrix because we are dealing with 2d images let z 1 to estimate the value of the matrix m and eliminate the observed distortion the simplest and fastest method was adopted an artificial rectangular marker was first placed over the location the size of this frame was known and the size information allows for mapping between the pixels and real world units the four corners of the rectangle p1 p2 p3 and p4 in this process are shown in fig 3 the matrix m can be calculated by mapping these points p1 p2 p3 and p4 to the four corners of the image p c1 c2 c3 and c4 the resolution of image p is defined as having the same aspect ratio as the marker size c i x m 11 p i x m 12 p i y m 13 m 31 p i x m 32 p i y 1 9 c i y m 21 p i x m 22 p i y m 23 m 31 p i x m 32 p i y 1 10 m 11 p i x m 12 p i y m 13 m 31 p i x c i x m 32 p i y c i x c i x m 21 p i x m 22 p i y m 23 m 31 p i x c i y m 32 p i y c i y c i y the four equations above allow for the solution of the eight unknowns m11 m12 m32 which can be obtained from i by calculating the matrix m fig 3c fig 4 shows images taken at different locations and those corrected using the above methods it may be observed from the figure that there were distortions in the images taken at different positions after the perspective distortion correction the top view with the same effect was obtained at the different positions 3 2 image segmentation and pgc extraction based on the super green algorithm image segmentation divides an image into several incompatible regions according to colour texture and other features lettuce is a typical green plant and the colour characteristics were more evident than the background to separate plants from the background and obtain the required pgc we adopted the super green algorithm in this study the super green algorithm exhibits a better extraction effect for image of green plant than other methods the shadow and soil images can be evidently suppressed and the plant image becomes more prominent the super green algorithm is as follows 11 e x g 2 g r b to separate plants from the background a threshold value was determined first and then the grey value of each pixel point was compared with the threshold value according to the results of the comparison results the pixels were divided into plants or backgrounds in this paper the maximum interclass variance method otsu s method javier herrera et al 2011 was adopted this method is simple and is not affected by image brightness and contrast as an automatic threshold selection method the process involved in calculating this value is simple and stable fig 5 shows the pgc evolution of the leaf and head lettuce fig 6 shows the trends of pgc and cumulative effective accumulated temperature for the two different types of lettuce during the entire growth period the effective accumulated temperature was used to indicate the heat demand for crop growth and development cumulative effective accumulated temperature refers to the cumulative sum of the remaining temperature after subtracting 10 from the daily average temperature during the entire growth period with increasing of cumulative effective accumulated temperature the pgc of lettuce increased gradually first and then tended to stabilize the pgc of the leaf lettuce increased from 10 57 to 76 at harvest the pgc of head lettuce increased from 10 38 to 100 at harvest in the seedling and rosette stages the cumulative effective temperature gradually increased and the pgc of lettuce exhibited a rapid increasing trend the effective accumulated temperature and pgc of the leaf lettuce increased by 11 84 and 1 34 respectively the effective accumulated temperature and pgc of the head lettuce increased by 15 24 and 2 13 respectively after entering the heading stage the cumulative effective temperature for the two types reached the highest values at 579 26 and 639 76 respectively the pgc growth in the lettuce then decreased and tends to stabilize through a correlation analysis table 1 it may be observed that the cumulative effective accumulated temperature was significantly positively correlated with the pgc in the seedling and rosette stages the correlation between the pgc and cumulative effective accumulated temperature was 0 92 0 98 4 k c model construction analysis 4 1 kalman filtering to eliminate air factors human factors data transmission process noise interference information and interference from the other external factors in the observed data we used a kalman filter to denoise the measured k c value kalman filtering is an algorithm that uses a linear system state equation to estimate a system state optimally through input and output data sompop and nawinda 2020 as may be observed from the figure the noise was removed from the k c data after kalman filtering with small fluctuations and good stability compared with the original data the rmse mae and mse of the filtered data were reduced by 24 81 18 05 and 42 95 respectively showing that the model became more accurate fig 7 4 2 k c estimation model construction in this study we established estimation models based on xgboost catboost rf and svr models and evaluated their performance in terms of accuracy generalisation and speed to screen for optimised estimation models fig 8 4 2 1 extreme gradient lifting model xgboost the xgboost model is a mainstream algorithm that has emerged in recent years the model is trained sequentially and the subsets of each weak learner are combined to obtain a new strong learner gertz et al 2020 the specific tree model used in this study was the classification and regression tree model the advantages of this algorithm include that it uses many strategies to prevent overfitting supports parallelisation and adds processing of sparse data the calculation formula is as follows 12 f i t k 1 t f k x i f i t 1 f i x i here f i x i is the learner of step t f i x i and f i t 1 are steps t and t 1 respectively and x i is the input variable 4 2 2 gradient boosting lifting decision tree model catboost catboost is a gradient boosting decision tree framework based on an oblivious tree algorithm with relatively few parameters which supports category variables and exhibits high accuracy the main issue concerns managing the classification features efficiently and reasonably for the regression task this method needs to use the average value of the data obtained for the prior calculations in this approach θ σ 1 σ 2 σ n n t is replaced with the following equation deng et al 2020 13 x σ p k j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k y σ j β p j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k β where p is the prior value and β is the weight of the prior values 4 2 3 random forest model rf the rf algorithm was proposed by leo breiman in 2001 through bootstrap resampling n samples are repeatedly and randomly selected from an original training sample set n to generate a new training sample set training decision tree then m decision trees are generated according to the above steps to form a rf and the classification result of the new data is determined by the score generated from the number of votes in the classification tree the prediction results of the regression model used in this method are calculated as follows li et al 2020b 14 h x 1 t i 1 t h x θ t here h x represents the regression prediction result and h x θ t represents the output based on x and θ 4 2 4 support vector regression model svr support vector machines provide a better way to minimise structural risk the vector regression algorithm mainly realises linear regression by constructing a linear decision function in a high dimensional space after increasing the dimensions and optimises the model by maximising the width of the interval band and minimising the total loss taheri et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the final function of the model is as follows 15 f x i 1 m a ˆ i a i k x i t x b in the above k x i t x is the radial basis kernel function the main parameters of the four models used in this work are listed in table 2 in the table max depth is the maximum depth of the tree and higher values made the model more complex and easier to overfit gamma is the minimum loss required for further segmentation on the leaves of the tree learning rate determines whether the objective function converged to the local minimum in the appropriate time and c is a penalty factor designed to preventing the overfitting problem in the prediction model the optimal parameters obtained through the manual adjustment are shown in table 2 the hardware configuration of the computer used in this experiment included an intel r core tm i5 4210 h cpu with clock rates of 2 90 ghz 2 90 ghz and 4 gb of ram running the windows10 operating system 64 bit the anaconda platform was adopted as the basic platform to train the model we used the python programming language version 3 7 and the pycharm integrated development environment 4 3 comparative analysis of the k c estimation performance based on machine learning in terms of accuracy performance the scatter diagram results for the measured and estimated k c values are compared in fig 9 as shown in the figure the overall integrated model xgboost catboost rf exhibited performance superior to that of the svr model however there was little difference among the different integrated models and the correlation range was 0 75 0 93 as may be observed from table 3 the difference in the estimation accuracy values rmse mae and mse among the integrated models was small compared with the svr model the rmse mae and mse of the integrated model decreased by 5 49 13 37 9 78 10 33 and 3 33 24 14 respectively in terms of the generalisation performance the pgcs of leaf and head lettuce were mixed into a validation set and input into the leaf and head lettuce models respectively for verification as may be observed from the results the estimation performance of the integrated model was still better than that of the svr model however some differences were evident among the different integration models the r2 values of each model were on the order of xgboost catboost rf indicating that the xgboost model exhibited good generalisation as may be observed from table 3 the generalisation performance of the xgboost estimation model was slightly better than those of the catboost and rf models compared with the catboost and rf models the mse rmse and mae of the xgboost model decrease were lower by 1 69 13 76 1 00 8 91 and 2 98 12 04 respectively in terms of the estimated efficiency it may be observed from fig 10 that the testing times of each model were on the order of xgboost catboost svr rf and that the testing time of the xgboost model was significantly shorter than that of the other models by 0 044 0 156 and 0 061 s respectively under the same number of iterations the loss values of the xgboost catboost svr and rf models were 0 02 0 03 0 03 and 0 03 respectively indicating that the xgboost model exhibited high estimation efficiency overall the estimation performance for the head lettuce was better than that for the leaf lettuce the measured value of k c estimated based on the xgboost model was close to the estimated value thus the generalisation of the model was better it was able to evaluate the growth state of lettuce better and can be used as an optimal model to estimate k c therefore the xgboost model exhibited a higher accuracy in the k c and etc estimations and was more advantageous than the other models 4 4 verification analysis of the etc estimation model 4 4 1 verification analysis of the estimation of k c fig 11 shows the trend of k c and the measured values during the entire fertility period as estimated using xgboost as may be observed from figure k c of lettuce increased gradually with the growth period there was some deviation in the measured values of the lettuce in the heading stage this may be due to the fact that the canopy coverage of lettuce reached 100 in the late heading stage resulting in no change in the final estimated value as shown in table 4 the estimation accuracy of lettuce k c for all growth stages was high and the r2 between the estimated value and the measured value was above 0 96 in the heading stage the transpiration of the crops was strong and the k c values of both the leaf and head lettuce reached maximum values of 2 65 and 3 04 respectively the average k c values of the leaf lettuce at the seedling rosette and heading stages were 1 12 1 29 and 2 26 respectively the relative errors were 4 17 1 09 and 1 14 respectively the average k c values of the head lettuce at the seedling rosette and heading stages were 0 83 1 26 and 2 92 respectively the relative errors were 1 28 8 71 and 10 34 respectively 4 4 2 verification analysis of the estimation of etc the field environmental data of the greenhouse were collected by sensors and uploaded to the mobile phone remotely combined with the k c values as estimated from the collected images they were substituted into the pm formula to calculate etc the changes in the estimated and measured etc values during the entire growth period of the lettuce are shown in fig 12 etc was calculated according to the estimated k c and compared with the actual etc it may be observed from fig 12 that the variation trends of the estimated etc values and the measured values were similar there was a difference in the etc between the head lettuce and the leaf lettuce this was due to the different types of lettuce the weight of head lettuce is more than three times that of leaf lettuce the leaf area of head lettuce is larger than that of leaf lettuce and the transpiration and photosynthesis are stronger resulting in increased of water requirements according to table 5 the average estimated etc of leaf lettuce in the seedling stage was 2 35 mm d 1 the relative error value when compared with the measured average etc was 1 68 at the rosette and heading stages the water requirements and thus etc of the lettuce increased with averages of 2 35 mm d 1 and 2 45 mm d 1 respectively compared with the measured average etc the relative errors were 1 68 and 7 07 respectively the water demand of the head lettuce at the seedling stage was small and the etc was low with an average of 2 71 mm d 1 the relative error with the measured etc was 7 16 at the rosette and heading stages the water demand and thus etc of the lettuce increase with averages of 4 62 mm d 1 and 11 33 mm d 1 respectively the relative errors with the measured etc were 2 49 and 9 43 respectively in the case of two types of lettuce planting the errors between the estimated and measured values of the etc were small accordingly machine learning methods showed a high ability to estimate the water requirements of lettuce crops 4 4 3 relationship of k c and other growth parameters k c is influenced by crop conditions and changes as the crop grows many studies have been conducted to estimate k c both domestically and internationally liu and kang 2006 established the relationship between k c and plant height and found that k c increased with increaseing in plant height previous studies established regression equations for the ndvi effective diameter and k c to estimate the value of k c narendra kumar and kamlesh 2010 gonzález esquiva et al 2016 to explore the relationships between them in this study k c was used to establish a regression equation for the different growth parameters to obtain the growth status of the lettuce in real time table 6 fig 13 shows the fitting equation diagram as established by k c with h d and ndvi the equation fitted by k c with h was in the form of logarithmic growth whereas the equation fitted by k c with d and ndvi was parabolic compared with d and ndvi h exhibited higher fitting accuracies of 0 93 and 0 95 respectively compared with d h showed an increase of 9 69 and 14 45 respectively compared with the ndvi h showed increases of 21 74 and 4 64 respectively this study shows that there was a high correlation between h d ndvi and k c and that the real time results of each parameter were obtained through k c inversion in the future the growth of lettuce can be reflected in real time and irrigation strategies can be adjusted in a timely manner to provide guidance for accurate irrigation and production as different crop types seasons and planting methods have different effects on k c their growth and development conditions also differ therefore further research on k c inversion based on different planting methods and crop types remains necessary 5 discussion in this study the simulation of k c has been studied at different levels and the influencing factors of k c were found to differ for different varieties and regions in this study the pgc was used to simulate k c and the variation trend of the estimated value of k c was consistent with the measured value of k c with the development of the growth period k c gradually showed a linear increasing trend xu et al 2010 showed that the growth period of lettuce in greenhouses in winter was longer than that in summer and that the crop coefficient increased gradually but the increase rate decreased at the end of the growing cycle this is similar to the results of the present study compared with this study the k c value for lettuce recommended by the fao is set under specific conditions the k c values for the early middle and late periods are 0 70 1 00 and 0 95 respectively which are significantly different from the measured k c values this most likely occurred because the value recommended by the fao for k c are designed for a situation in which there is no water stress in the growing stage of the crop and good tillage and field water management conditions allow the crop to achieve the maximum yield yuan et al 2018 this study was conducted in a greenhouse with potted crops in different regions crop growth is affected by many factors resulting in a large error between the value recommended by the fao and actual value obtained in the present work in general the k c value as estimated in this study was more consistent with the measured value compared with the catboost rf and svr models the xgboost model exhibited a higher accuracy in estimating k c and etc this was the case because the xgboost algorithm provides functions for parallel computation approximate tree construction and the effective processing of sparse data for small datasets which not only makes xgboost operationally efficient but also provides a higher fitting accuracy and improves the robustness of the model the catboost model uses a greedy algorithm in this case may produce an overfitting problem the rf algorithm leads to overfitting in regression problems with high noise the svr algorithm is sensitive the selection of parameters and kernel functions as well as missing data which make it difficult for the model to find appropriate parameters and reduce its accuracy previous studies also showed that the xgboost model is superior to other tree based ensemble learning models for estimations le et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 by using the single crop coefficient method the error between the k c calculation of etc as estimated by the xgboost model and the measured value was small and the performance was good the main reason for the error was the influence of the predicted error of k c at different growth stages and weather conditions this is similar to the results reported by wang et al 2020b fig 14 shows the error diagram between the results of each estimation model and the measured k c values of lettuce the solid line indicates zero value and the dotted line shows the error range 0 2 0 2 it may be observed from the results in the figure that the error value of lettuce k c estimation based on the xgboost model was the smallest the overall estimated value of the xgboost model were smaller than the measured value and the estimated errors were 80 00 and 84 62 within the error range 0 2 0 2 respectively the estimation results of the catboost and rf models were relatively good with 75 00 and 75 00 76 92 and 80 77 estimation errors within 2 2 respectively the estimation effect of the svr model was relatively poor with 72 50 and 69 23 estimation errors within the error range 2 2 respectively compared with single input models for the leaf lettuce and head lettuce when the leaf and head lettuce were used as inputs the errors increased by more than 30 94 this was attributed to the large difference in the pgc values between the two types of lettuce when mixing was used as the input the training model fluctuated considerably resulting in low correlation when using the model 6 conclusions efficient irrigation minimises unnecessary water use thereby helping to save energy in this study we used image distortion correction combined with a super green algorithm was used to extract crop canopy coverage data for leaf lettuce and head lettuce we established an estimation model for lettuce water requirements based on machine vision technology we trained xgboost catboost svr and rf models to estimate the coefficients of the lettuce crop the results have shown that the integration models xgboost catboost rf performed better than svr models in terms of accuracy with a correlation range of 0 75 0 93 the generalisation performance of the xgboost model was compared with the catboost svr and rf models and the xgboost model was found to exhibit superior performance compared to the catboost and rf models in terms of generalisation whereas the svr model exhibited the worst generalisation performance the estimation model dynamically monitored the changes in the crop coefficient during the entire growth process the pm formula was used to calculate the crop water requirements to help farmers decide the amount of irrigation to use and effectively solved the problem of reducing water consumption without affecting productivity in addition we have further established a model of the mathematical relationship model based on the crop coefficient plant height plant width and ndvi providing theoretical guidance to future studies that aim to explore crop growth monitoring with the rapid development of smart agriculture the fao proposed that the integration of new technologies and agriculture is an important way to ensure sustainable development in the present work we realized the online measurement of water demand which can be applied to leafy vegetables and the application can be expanded to fruits and vegetables in the future simultaneously the development and construction of a closed loop intelligent irrigation control system with internet of things devices such as water demand calculators and irrigation controllers remains as a potentially fruitful avenue
