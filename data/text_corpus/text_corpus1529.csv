7645,study region the cho shui river basin is located in central taiwan and has a catchment area of approximately 3157 km2 and an annual average rainfall of 2200 mm it is the longest river in taiwan and its mainstream has an average slope of 0 018 however the prediction of flash floods upstream of the cho shui river has yet to be investigated because of the river s steep slope typhoons or storms can result in significant flood disasters therefore accurate and reliable river stage prediction is required for flood disaster mitigation study focus a predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology was developed and used for constructing seven data driven models for river stage predictions the proposed methodology employs both river stage and residual error prediction models the optimal residual error prediction model was determined using seven data driven models an extensive comparison of the seven data driven models was conducted regarding prediction performance with 1 24 h lead times new hydrological insights for the region the proposed error correction based data driven models exhibited high prediction accuracy making them suitable for improvements of river stage predictions with the decrease in lead time averaged root mean square error rmse up to 73 7 the error correction based categorical gradient boosting regression cgbr and encoder decoder long short term memory lstm models outperformed the other models yielding the average peak water level error pwe of 0 3 m for the 24 hour ahead prediction thus these two models could be helpful for early warning river flood forecasting during typhoons or storms graphical abstract ga1 keywords multiple hour ahead river stage machine learning ensemble learning deep learning data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the hydrological cycle is a continuous water circulation between the atmosphere ocean and land on land the rainfall runoff process is a crucial hydrological phenomenon that plays an essential role in managing floods and droughts xiong et al 2022a storm and typhoon induced heavy runoff could cause floods leading to significant human loss and property damage for example in thailand the floods in chao phraya river basin occurred in 2011 resulting in the death of over 800 persons about 13 6 million people in flood affected areas and economic loss of about 45 billion usd abhishek et al 2021 according to the emergency events database 385 major natural disaster events were recorded worldwide in 2021 with 156 occurring in asia in addition flooding was the most frequent type of natural disaster in 2021 accounting for nearly 50 of all disasters to mitigate flood disasters the development of early warning systems with accurate and reliable forecasts is urgently needed for predicting both flood arrival time and potential flood affected areas the direct approach for establishing a flood forecasting model involves the use of a numerical method to solve the flow governing equations yielding physically based models such models can achieve high numerical accuracy using high resolution elevation data however this approach has a high computational cost a more efficient approach for establishing a flood forecasting model involves the adoption of hydrological data without the use of the theory of flood processes such models are called data driven models data driven models are more efficient and are commonly applied for flood forecasting model construction data driven models are divided into three types machine learning ensemble learning and deep learning models machine learning and ensemble learning models have increasingly been applied for flood related predictions including for rainfall runoff river flood stage streamflow reservoir inflow and urban inundation for example chen et al 2012a compared the performance of the artificial neural networks anns with two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic models for simulating the water levels in an estuarine system in taiwan chen et al 2012b predicted typhoon induced storm tides with a 2d hydrodynamic model and anns model their results indicated that the anns could be used to predict water level variations comparable to the numerical models lin et al 2013 employed support vector regression svr to propose a two stage flood forecasting model for 1 6 h lead time runoff predictions patel and ramachandran 2015 employed anns and svr to model long term time series data of river inflows in the cauvery south india their results indicated that the svr outperformed the anns in terms of correlation and root mean square error rmse whereas the anns yielded higher nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values jhong et al 2017 proposed a two stage inundation forecasting model based on svr the model was applied to simulate 1 6 h lead time inundation maps during typhoons yan et al 2018 combined svr with a numerical model to propose an urban flood forecasting model their model produced strong performance in resolving urban flood depths at relatively low computational costs chen et al 2020 employed different machine learning techniques namely multilayer perceptron regression mlpr a radial basis function network svr and numerical models to predict groundwater dynamics in the heihe river basin northwestern china in that study the machine learning models yielded superior accuracy to the numerical models however the numerical models had greater generalization ability ga than did the machine learning models as for the application of a large area xiong et al 2022b employed three machine learning methods to quantify 50 years of dwindling groundwater in india they also presented hydrological simulations with the in situ groundwater levels for past and future assessments phan and nguyen 2020 proposed a hybrid approach that combined machine learning models with the autoregressive integrated moving average model for water level forecasting in the red river their results indicated that the combined models achieved more accurate resolutions than did the traditional single models nguyen et al 2021 employed the extreme gradient boosting regression xgbr model to propose a hybrid model for hourly water level prediction in the jungrang urban basin south korea gan et al 2021 applied the light gradient boosting machine regression lgbmr model to predict the water levels of the lower columbia river guo et al 2021 applied four machine learning techniques namely svr random forest regression mlpr and lgbmr to predict river stage hydrographs in the lan yang river basin taiwan they found that the lgbmr model outperformed the other models ahmed et al 2022 employed different machine learning models for the river stage predictions in durian tunggal river malaysia they found that the gaussian process regression model performs better in simulating daily river stages the preceding discussion of the literature highlights the following desirable features of data driven models based on machine or ensemble learning techniques implementation without considering physical properties of data low computational cost and effective management of nonlinear properties between input output variables however when the given dataset is few the data driven models would perform poorly and thus should be complemented with the in situ data where available alternatively the data set created by physical based model can be utilized to combine with the observed data for increasing the integrity of data on the other hand with the development of novel data driven models the deep learning long short term memory lstm model has been introduced and proved reliable in many engineering fields essam et al 2022 the lstm model has also been applied for time series prediction and widely applied to flood problems for instance baek et al 2020 combined a convolutional neural network cnn with lstm to simulate water level and water quality in the nakdong river basin gao et al 2020 used two popular deep learning techniques gated recurrent unit gru networks and lstm to predict short term runoff flow in the yutan station control catchment area in fujian province southeast china their results indicated that both the gru and lstm yielded higher prediction accuracy than the anns liu et al 2020 applied an encoder decoder lstm to predict the streamflow of the yangtze river they also employed the empirical mode decomposition algorithm alongside the lstm to maximize prediction accuracy dazzi and vacondio 2021 adopted three data driven models namely svr mlpr and lstm for predicting the flood stage of the parma river in italy in their results the lstm model was the most accurate in forecasting the peak flood stage values lee and kim 2021 employed lstm to predict the inflow rate of the soyang river dam they used an encoder decoder algorithm to improve the prediction accuracy of the inflow rate kao et al 2020 adopted an encoder decoder based lstm model for 6 hour ahead forecasting of inflow in the shihmen reservoir taiwan latif et al 2021 applied a deep learning lstm algorithm to predict the daily inflow in the durian tunggal reservoir in melaka malaysia the results of the preceding studies highlight that lstm models can be employed to estimate extreme reservoir inflows moreover ibrahim et al 2022 presented an extensive review of the standalone and hybrid data driven models in different hydrology fields including streamflow forecasting reservoir inflow prediction and optimal operation solutions to deeply investigate the potential of different models they provided the optimization modeling analysis to select the hydrological model as mentioned most previous studies have focused on flood simulations at the midstream and downstream of the river however the flash flood predictions at an upstream river region using data driven models are rarely investigated and are complicated with more challenges when the steep riverbed slope the physical based model requires suitable numerical treatment to avoid unphysical oscillation solutions moreover if dramatic changes in erosion and deposition occur in the riverbed more given mechanisms are required for a physical based model to solve the complicated hydrology and sediment problems therefore despite not considering physical properties data driven models yield resolutions comparable to physically based models and thus are suitable for resolving flash floods in steep gravel riverbed reach however the major challenge is that the longer lead time results in more prediction errors than physically based models few studies have considered forecasts with long lead times up to 24 h for river stage predictions in steep gravel riverbed reach forecasts with longer lead times may prove more helpful for flood early warning therefore enhancing the prediction accuracy of data driven models with longer lead times is crucial in this paper seven error correction based data driven models employing a novel predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology is proposed this novel methodology integrates a river stage prediction model and a residual error prediction model the methodology updates the error correction yielding highly accurate river flood evolution data in this manner the prediction error of flood arrival time can be minimized when dealing with longer lead times for forecasts of up to 24 h to learn input output dependencies the hourly hydrological data for 2004 2019 in the upstream region of the cho shui river were collected and employed to construct data driven models seven models were employed namely svr xgbr lgbmr categorical gradient boosting regression cgbr gru encoder decoder lstm hereafter lstm1 and cnn lstm hereafter lstm2 the sensitivity analysis for the optimal proportion of the dataset for training testing phases and the optimal input features were also conducted among these seven models the optimal residual error prediction model was determined through the use of svr by using nine evaluation criteria including correlation coefficient cc mean absolute error mae rmse nse ga peak water level error pwe error of time to peak water level etp decrease in the percentage error of the lead time averaged rmse dermse and increase in the percentage error of the lead time averaged nse iense after the residual error prediction in each model was optimized the proposed seven models were used to predict the river stage with lead times of 1 24 h the prediction performance of the seven models was evaluated and compared for five river stage stations the primary contribution of this study is to propose new error correction based data driven models based on the predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology thus contributing to improved prediction performance of such models in addition the most important proportion for training and test data division and the optimal combination of inputs are proposed for enhancing the applicability of predicting river stage furthermore this is the first study to comprehensively assess and compare the performance of seven models svr xgbr lgbmr cgbr gru lstm1 and lstm2 for river flood stage predictions with lead times of 1 24 h in steep gravel riverbed reach 2 methodology 2 1 data driven models 2 1 1 machine learning the commonly used svr proposed by drucker et al 1997 is employed herein to construct one data driven model with consideration of structural risk minimization the regression function of svr is given by yu et al 2006 liong and chandrasekaran 2007 1 f x w t ϕ x b where w is the weight vector of the regression function ϕ is the nonlinear mapping function and b is the bias term eq 1 can be further expressed as an optimization problem as follows 2 min w b ξ ξ 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 3 subject to y i w t ϕ x i b ϵ ξ i w t ϕ x i b y i ϵ ξ i ξ i 0 ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where c denotes the penalty coefficient ξ and ξ are slack variables and ϵ is the parameter of the insensitive loss function 2 1 2 ensemble learning ensemble learning is a group of machine learning models that is rarely applied for simulating the nonlinear relationships in time series flood predictions therefore three ensemble learning models were used in this study xgbr lgbmr and cgbr xgbr is based on the gradient boosting decision tree in the optimization stage xgbr introduces a second order taylor expansion into the objective function to yield the first order and second order derivatives chen and guestrin 2016 in addition through the use of level wise tree growth xgbr overcomes overfitting problems and reduces prediction complexity further details on the xgbr algorithm can be found in related studies jin et al 2019 tama and rhee 2019 lucas et al 2020 lgbmr ke et al 2017 introduces the concepts of gradient based one side sampling and exclusive feature bundling to maximize predictive performance and reduce overfitting problems different from xgbr lgbmr employs a histogram based algorithm and leaf wise growth for reducing computational time the objective function of lgbmr can be written as follows gao et al 2019 qadeer and jeon 2019 4 obj t i 1 n g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t 2 x i i 1 t ω f i where ω is the regularization function of a decision tree f i for the tth iteration g i and h i are respectively the first and second derivatives of the loss function and f t x i denotes the new predicted value at the tth step the first and second derivatives can be expressed by 5 g i y ˆ i t 1 l y i y ˆ i t 1 h i y ˆ i t 1 2 l y i y ˆ i t 1 where y i is the true objective value y ˆ i is the predicted value and y ˆ i t 1 is the predicted value for the t 1 step model cgbr prokhorenkova et al 2018 is an advanced ensemble learning model cgbr introduces a new essential ordered boosting algorithm to manage categorical features to enhance prediction accuracy and avoid overfitting cgbr applies the minimal variance sampling method to grow a balanced tree for improving computation efficiency more details about the methodology of cgbr can be found in the literature hadavimoghaddam et al 2021 gao et al 2022 2 1 3 deep learning deep learning has been applied for continued advancement of data driven models especially for time series predictions deep learning performs well with unstructured datasets compared with machine learning deep learning has superior self learning abilities and is more scalable in this study deep learning techniques were used to train three data driven models namely gru lstm1 and lstm2 a schematic of these three models is provided in fig 1 lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is an improved version of the recurrent neural network rnn lstm can preserve prediction information even over long periods different from rnn lstm consists of an input layer memory cells and an output layer the core characteristic of lstm is the usage of memory cells that help address vanishing or exploding gradients observed in rnn the memory cells are composed of a forget gate an input gate and an output gate the following equations present the structure of the lstm network xiang et al 2020 6 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 7 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 8 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 9 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 10 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 11 h t o t tanh c t where f t i t o t and c t are the forget gate input gate output gate and memory cell vectors respectively w f w i w o and w c are the weighted parameter matrices for the forget gate input gate output gate and memory cells respectively b f b i b o and b c are the bias for the forget gate input gate output gate and memory cells respectively σ is the nonlinear sigmoid activation function x t denotes the input vector at time step t and h t is the output hidden vector the gru cell has a simpler structure than the modified lstm network the gru applies two control gates the update and reset gates for accelerating the prediction process cho et al 2014 the update gate is employed to control how much of the current input data can be stored in the previous memory the reset gate is used to determine how much information from the previous moment is forgotten and written into the current state in practice the input and output variables are processed in the same time steps for both the gru and lstm this limitation restricts the application of gru and lstm to address this shortcoming cho et al 2014 proposed the encoder decoder framework with which different input and output time steps can be employed for achieving multiple hour ahead predictions in this framework the relevant deep learning network model first encodes the input sequence into a fixed length vector after the fixed length vector is decoded the predicted output is obtained because lstm is applied for both the encoder and decoder sequences this model is referred to as the lstm1 model the gru is also employed to encode and decode sequences thus enabling multiple hour ahead predictions cnn models have also been reported to perform satisfactorily in addressing problems in different fields kim and cho 2019 livieris et al 2022 ghimire et al 2021 a cnn a type of feedforward neural network can be applied to both time series forecasting and image processing cnn mainly include two components a convolution layer and pooling layer in this study to enhance the ability of the cnn it was integrated with the lstm model yielding cnn lstm lstm2 enabling advanced forecasting accuracy as presented in fig 1 in the first component of lstm2 two cnn layers are adopted to develop the features of the input data for resolving complicated mathematical operations for the second component of lstm2 lstm is employed to generate features and dense layers for a more detailed description of the methodology used in lstm2 please refer to related studies wegayehu and muluneh 2021 moishin et al 2021 2 2 proposed error correction based models few researchers have applied the residual error correction methodology for improving model prediction performance ngamsanroaj and tamee 2019 kan et al 2020 in this study this methodology was extended in the framework of the multiple hour ahead for achieving a longer prediction capability of 1 24 h lead times the proposed predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology for constructing data driven model can be decomposed into two submodels the river stage prediction model and residual error prediction model to maximize the accuracy of the model a residual error prediction model was added that can predict the residual error and achieve the final prediction results the proposed methodology can be expressed as follows 12 h t t corrected h t t predicted e t t predicted where t is the current time t is the lead time h t t corrected is the corrected river stage at time t t h t t predicted denotes the predicted river stage at time t t and e t t predicted is the predicted residual error of the river stage at time t t in this study the lead times of 1 24 h were investigated when data driven models were applied the different combinations of input variables resulted in different predictions the previous study guo et al 2021 investigated the river stage prediction in a tidal river in taiwan and thus the rainfall river stage and tidal stage were considered however the river stage in the upstream region of the cho shui river may be affected by the basin rainfall and the river stage therefore the presented study considered input variables of the rainfall and the river stage the hourly rainfall measured data from each rainfall station were averaged in the present study to increase the training efficiency accordingly the river stage prediction output based on the multiple hour ahead methodology can be expressed as follows 13 h t 1 predicted h t 2 predicted h t t predicted f r t r t 1 r t l h t h t 1 h t l where f is the regression function from the data driven model l denotes the lag length of the input variables r t l is the antecedent watershed average rainfall at time t l and h t l is the antecedent river stage at time t l the time of flood concentration in the cho shui river taiwan is about 6 12 h according to previous studies lin et al 2013 guo et al 2021 the commonly used lag length of 6 h was set in this study that could satisfy the requirement of flood early warning to perform the residual error correction the residual error can be predicted using the following prediction model 14 e t 1 predicted e t 2 predicted e t t predicted f e t e t 1 e t l the residual error series of the river stage is obtained from predicted and measured values and is given by 15 e t h t h t predicted where h t predicted is the predicted values of the river stage by the data driven model and h t represents the measured data the residual error series mean the difference between the measured and predicted river stages then the residual error series were employed as the expected or actual values to construct the residual error prediction model therefore eqs 13 and 14 are used to produce the relevant prediction values for all lead times up to the maximum of 24 h the process of the proposed methodology is as follows fig 2 1 prepare the input vectors namely the rainfall and river stage for the past 6 h 2 use the seven data driven models to train and predict the river stage for the next 24 h by using eq 13 3 with the predicted river stage data derive the time series data of the residual error by using eq 15 4 use the residual error data of the river stage to train the error prediction model and obtain the predicted values by using eq 14 5 from eq 12 update and correct the river stage as the final forecasting result of river stages for 1 24 h lead time 2 3 performance evaluation criteria to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance of the data driven models four commonly used criteria named cc mae rmse and nse for the time series prediction problem were employed and summarized in appendix a chen et al 2020 cai et al 2021 huang et al 2021 to further examine the prediction accuracy of models five evaluation criteria are also applied and expressed as follows 16 ga rmse in test rmse in training 17 pwe h p pre h p mea 18 etp t p pre t p mea 19 dermse rmse without ec rmse with ec rmse without ec 100 20 iense nse with ec nse without ec nse with ec 100 where h p mea and h p pre are respectively the measured and predicted peak river stages and t p mea and t p pre denote the measured and predicted time to the peak river stage respectively dermse stands for the decrease in the percentage error of the lead time averaged rmse rmse with ec and rmse without ec are respectively the lead time averaged rmse values predicted by the model with and without the error correction ec iense represents the increase in the percentage error of the lead time averaged nse nse with ec and nse without ec are the lead time averaged nse values predicted by the model with and without the ec respectively nse and cc represent the fitted performance between the predicted river stages and the measured ones the range of nse can be between negative infinity and 1 and the range of cc can be between 1 and 1 the closer the nse or cc is to 1 the better the river stage simulation accuracy is the smaller the mae rmse pwe and etp the higher the model s accuracy in addition the value of pwe is greater than 0 or less than 0 which means that the peak river stage prediction is overestimated or underestimated the ga is one of the most critical evaluation criteria for data driven simulations and applications the ga is used to assess the ability to learn non linear problems the value of ga is unity indicating that the proposed model learns and predicts a given problem perfectly however suppose the model is focused on learning a given problem from the collected training data rather than constructing a more reliable model in that case the value of ga is more significant than 1 0 indicating the model is overtraining on the contrary the value of ga is smaller than 1 0 meaning the model is undertrained 2 4 proposed models for river stage forecasting a flowchart of the process for river stage forecasting is presented in fig 3 the process includes three main steps preprocessing model construction and validation the measured hourly data for rainfall and river stage are collected in the preprocessing step the commonly used min max normalization method is employed to normalize the collected data to the range of 1 1 to prevent inaccurate predictions for model training and testing the collected data were divided into training and testing datasets before model validation the optimal ratio for training and test splitting and the optimal combination of inputs were determined and analyzed the optimal prediction model in terms of residual error was also conducted with these optimal analysis results the river stage predictions were performed and model validations were conducted using the seven evaluation criteria for 1 24 h lead times 3 study area and observational data this study was conducted for the cho shui river basin which is the longest river in taiwan with a total length of 186 km lee and tsai 2010 chang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 as displayed in fig 4 the cho shui river has a watershed area of 3157 km2 and the riverbed elevation ranges from 0 m to 3917 m the longitudinal average riverbed slope is approximately 0 018 due to the steep riverbed slopes the rapid runoff flows during typhoon or storm periods often lead to flash floods and riverbed scour leading to severe damage to flood protection facilities such as embankment toe for example on august 8 2009 typhoon morakot impacted southern taiwan and caused serious flood disasters in many river basins such as bank overflow and embankment failures including the cho shui river in addition typhoon saola on august 2012 caused critical floods and thus the adjacent irrigation channels on the cho shui river were damaged therefore this study considered the cho shui river to investigate the applicability of data driven models in simulating river stage evolution at steep river reach fig 4 presents the locations of hydrological stations in the cho shui river basin six rainfall gauging stations and five river stage gauging stations chao et al 2018 the seven models were trained and employed to predict the river stages at the neimaobu baodan renlun yufong and mingchu stations with lead times of 1 24 h the central weather bureau and the water resources agency ministry of economic affairs taiwan respectively provided the rainfall and river stage data the hourly river stage data were measured from water level monitoring stations in real time table 1 lists the data collected from 2004 to 2019 during which time 41 typhoons and storm events were recorded to further understand the hydrology statistics of the dataset table 2 presents the collected data statistics of the hydrological characteristic in five river stage stations as shown in table 2 the maximum values of measured river stages at the neimaobu baodan bridge renlun bridge yufong bridge and mingchu bridge were 475 7 352 19 323 71 269 65 and 151 51 m respectively for the recorded rainfall data the result indicates that the average rainfall ranged from 0 0 to 65 67 mm hr 4 results and discussion the seven data driven models mentioned in section 2 were applied in the framework of the predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology to construct the error correction based data driven models following the flowchart presented in fig 3 the collected hydrological measurements were divided into training and testing datasets and subsequently applied to construct and validate the models nine evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the performance of the models the programming algorithms of all proposed models were implemented in python 3 7 all river stage predictions performed in this study were conducted on a computer with an intel core i5 with a 3 0 ghz cpu and 8 0 gb ram in addition the open source libraries in python named keras scikit learn and tensorflow were employed as the deployment platform of model construction 4 1 optimal proportion of the dataset for model training and testing a widely used ratio of a dataset is 7 3 for the training and test phases which means 70 of the dataset is used for model training and 30 for model testing respectively however the practical application depends on the specific characteristic of a given dataset hence this section tries to determine the optimal ratio for data division on training and test datasets as shown in table 3 three scenarios for the proportion of data division at five river stage stations were designed and evaluated the commonly used svr without ec was first applied for analysis the 1 24 h lead time average ga value is adopted as the target indicator for assessing the optimal proportion fig 5 compares measurements with the predicted river stage using svr without ec for three scenarios at yufong station the results indicated that all scenarios simulated the river stage for a 6 h lead time well the result of the ga value shown in table 3 could be utilized to assess the performance of model applicability it is found that the proposed second scenario ratio of 1 21 at yufong station has the best ga accuracy through overall consideration the optimal proportion of data division at neimaobu baodan bridge renlun bridge yufong bridge and mingchu bridge were 1 41 1 55 1 26 1 21 and 0 58 respectively 4 2 sensitivity analysis of input features before model training and testing the optimal combinations of inputs should be discussed and determined again the commonly used svr without ec was utilized to predict the river stage at yufong station with a lead time of 24 h three combination cases of input variables were designed and listed in table 4 fig 6 shows the predicted river stage results including a time series hourly plot and scatter plot with three combinations of input factors at yufong station for a test case of 12 h lead time the prediction result by combinations of c2 and c3 agree with the measured river stages however the prediction result by combining c1 produces a physical violating resolution indicating that only considering rainfall inputs does not provide the correct prediction four commonly used indicators were further employed to compare the overall prediction accuracy as shown in table 4 a combination of c3 gives the smallest values in terms of mae and rmse whereas the combination of c1 yields the largest ones moreover it is found that the combination of c3 produces the best performance in terms of cc and nse thus the combination of c3 does combine the feature factors of rainfall and river stage to increase the prediction accuracy 4 3 determining the optimal error prediction model the seven data driven models mentioned in section 2 can be employed to construct the river stage and residual error prediction models the commonly used svr was adopted to predict the river stage and increase comparisons efficiency then the seven data driven models were employed to determine the optimal residual error prediction model based on the optimal input combination and data splitting ratio the seven models and svr were used to predict the river stage at the yufong station for lead times of 1 24 h fig 7 a displays the river stages simulated using svr for a 24 h lead time the predicted river stages were used to create the error database as presented in fig 7 b with this residual error database the seven models were applied to construct residual error prediction models fig 8 presents the simulated residual error results with four close up views displaying four flood events for a lead time of 24 h differences in error prediction results among the seven models are clearly presented the deep learning models namely gru lstm1 and lstm2 achieved relatively poor prediction accuracy but they yielded favorable cc performance 0 9 to determine the optimal residual error prediction model ga was used to evaluate the error prediction capability of the seven models a ga value close to 1 indicates that the model has high ga table s1 and fig 9 present the ga results obtained using the seven models for lead times of 1 24 h the average ga values over 1 24 h obtained using svr xgbr lgbmr cgbr gru lstm1 and lstm2 were 1 22 1 34 1 24 1 21 1 19 1 24 and 1 30 respectively notably the gru outperformed the other models thus the gru was used as the optimal model to establish the residual error prediction model named the gru based error correction gec model for all the following simulations 4 4 influence of residual error correction on river stage prediction after the optimal residual error model was determined the influence of residual error correction on the river stage prediction was examined the target output was the prediction of the river stage at the yufong station for the complete test dataset with lead times of 1 24 h fig s1 presents the prediction results for the seven models without the gec model at yufong station for lead times of 6 12 18 and 24 h the results revealed that all the models yielded well predictions with the measured data for the lead time of 6 h when the lead time was increased to 12 18 and 24 h the predicted points moved away from the reference line suggesting that the models without the gec model had slightly lower performance for the prediction lead times of 12 18 and 24 h to examine the influence of the gec model on river stage prediction the prediction results obtained using the seven models integrating the gec model at yufong station for lead times of 6 12 18 and 24 h were considered fig s2 compared with the results without the gec model the predicted points obtained from all the models that integrated the gec model were closer to the reference line this result indicates that the gec model significantly affected the prediction accuracy for the predictions over 24 h table s2 summarizes the prediction results obtained using the seven models with and without the gec model at the yufong station for lead times of 1 24 h based on four evaluation indices for all the models without the gec model the overall predicted cc was larger than 0 284 and the lowest nse value was 0 081 for all the models that integrated the gec model the lowest cc value was 0 953 and the overall predicted nse was larger than 0 908 in addition the models that integrated the gec model had considerably smaller mae and rmse values than the models without the gec model to elucidate why the models integrating the gec model had the highest accuracy the influence of the gec model on river stage prediction was examined by considering the lead time averaged rmse and nse values fig s3 the results indicated that the 24 h lead time averaged values in terms of rmse and nse were respectively within than 0 15 m and 0 94 by all models with gec the results also revealed that the dermse for all models ranged from 65 6 to 73 7 and the iense increased from 46 9 to 56 4 for predictions from all models therefore the seven models that integrated the gec model yielded substantial improvements in river stage prediction relative to models without the gec model moreover cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models achieved the highest values for iense and dermse respectively in conclusion the prediction result in this section illustrates that the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models performs the best prediction accuracy among all employed data driven models 4 5 results of model validation the prediction performance for a lead time of 24 h by using the proposed seven models with the gec model integrated were verified and compared for five stations namely neimaobu baodan renlun yufong and mingchu stations the results fig s4 indicated that the predictions of all the models were consistent with the measured values to evaluate the performance differences among the seven models the etp and pwe values of the prediction results at five stations for 6 12 18 and 24 h lead times were considered table s3 the maximum absolute pwe values for the svr gec xgbr gec lgbmr gec cgbr gec gru gec lstm1 gec and lstm2 gec models were 0 91 1 12 1 00 1 09 1 33 0 93 and 1 30 m respectively the maximum absolute etp values for the aforementioned models were 18 7 7 10 18 11 and 8 h respectively these results indicate that the gru gec model yielded the largest error for the maximum absolute values of both etp and pwe fig s5 presents boxplots of the absolute pwe values from two selected events for 18 and 24 h lead times the box results for the gru gec model had the broadest distributions suggesting that the model uncertainty of this model was greater than those of the other six models for cho shui river data the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models produce relatively less uncertainty due to the narrower distributions of box plot results to consider the overall model performance the pwe results in fig s5 were averaged for all lead times the average median absolute pwe values for the svr gec xgbr gec lgbmr gec cgbr gec gru gec lstm1 gec and lstm2 gec models were 0 30 0 35 0 35 0 29 0 41 0 28 and 0 33 m respectively the overall average pwe values for all seven models were smaller than 0 45 m for the 24 hr ahead prediction the greatest difference in terms of absolute pwe values among the seven models was 0 13 m the results also indicated that the svr gec cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models exhibited satisfactory overall performance in terms of pwe the average etp values are displayed in fig s6 all of the models exhibited an increasing trend in etp values for the prediction lead times of 6 12 18 and 24 h the svr gec xgbr gec lgbmr gec cgbr gec gru gec lstm1 gec and lstm2 gec models yielded lead time averaged etp values of 3 08 2 58 2 85 2 65 3 45 2 95 and 3 53 h respectively the overall averaged etp values for all seven models were smaller than 3 6 h for the 24 hr ahead prediction the greatest difference in terms of absolute etp values among the seven models was 0 95 h the results also indicated that the xgbr gec lgbmr gec cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models exhibited satisfactory etp performance the comprehensive evaluation results revealed that the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models were the most accurate data driven models for time series prediction of both the peak river stage and time to peak river stage 5 conclusion this study proposed a predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology for constructing river stage prediction models based on seven data driven models svr xgbr lgbmr cgbr gru lstm1 and lstm2 nearly 16 years of hydrological data for the upstream area of the cho shui river in taiwan were collected and used to construct the data driven models the proposed models were then successfully applied to predict the evolution of future river stages up to 24 h ahead the prediction performance of the seven models was compared based on nine evaluation criteria the results indicated that the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models achieved the most accurate river stage resolution among the seven proposed models the major findings and contributions of this study are as follows 1 this study focused on the sensitivity analysis for the optimal proportion of the training and test dataset and the optimal input features our research indicated that optimal proportion at the neimaobu baodan bridge renlun bridge yufong bridge and mingchu bridge were 1 41 1 55 1 26 1 21 and 0 58 respectively among the feature factors the combination of rainfall and river stage in the previous 6 h were found to be the most important factors than that considering only hourly rainfall or river stage also the optimal residual error prediction model was determined using seven models combined with svr overall the gru model is effective at learning the time series relationship between the provided input and output variables yielding accurate residual error prediction of the river stage this new understanding could help improve river stage predictions by data driven models 2 this research highlights the importance of residual error correction for river stage prediction the present findings indicated that the seven proposed models that employed the gec model obtained significantly higher improvements relative to the models that did not employ the gec model for river stage prediction with the dermse ranging from 65 6 to 73 7 and the iense ranging from 46 9 to 56 4 3 this is the first comprehensive investigation of seven data driven models with and without a gec model including a quantitative analysis of model training and validation although the svr gec model had overall poor etp performance it performed well in terms of pwe in addition the gru model provided accurate residual error prediction but its combined error correction i e gru gec was insufficient for river stage prediction to conclude the overall average pwe value for both the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models was within than 0 30 m for the 24 hr ahead prediction indicating the models are useful for advancing existing knowledge in the field of flood prediction the primary advantage of the proposed methodology is its simplicity and high efficiency the methodology only employs hourly rainfall and river stage measurements as its input therefore the proposed methodology can quickly solve global flood problems with limited hydrological data future research should establish a real time flood forecasting system using the framework of the proposed methodology to maximize the practical application more broadly further research should explore the operational integration of a physically based rainfall forecasting model with a data driven flood prediction model in response to climate change or extreme weather conditions more detailed studies and tests on the data driven approach concerning spatial and temporal precipitation resolution require further study duan et al 2019 2022 zhao et al 2022 the combination of the data driven models with the radar rainfall forecasting of images would be helpful for flood early warning and could be future research scope credit authorship

7645,study region the cho shui river basin is located in central taiwan and has a catchment area of approximately 3157 km2 and an annual average rainfall of 2200 mm it is the longest river in taiwan and its mainstream has an average slope of 0 018 however the prediction of flash floods upstream of the cho shui river has yet to be investigated because of the river s steep slope typhoons or storms can result in significant flood disasters therefore accurate and reliable river stage prediction is required for flood disaster mitigation study focus a predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology was developed and used for constructing seven data driven models for river stage predictions the proposed methodology employs both river stage and residual error prediction models the optimal residual error prediction model was determined using seven data driven models an extensive comparison of the seven data driven models was conducted regarding prediction performance with 1 24 h lead times new hydrological insights for the region the proposed error correction based data driven models exhibited high prediction accuracy making them suitable for improvements of river stage predictions with the decrease in lead time averaged root mean square error rmse up to 73 7 the error correction based categorical gradient boosting regression cgbr and encoder decoder long short term memory lstm models outperformed the other models yielding the average peak water level error pwe of 0 3 m for the 24 hour ahead prediction thus these two models could be helpful for early warning river flood forecasting during typhoons or storms graphical abstract ga1 keywords multiple hour ahead river stage machine learning ensemble learning deep learning data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the hydrological cycle is a continuous water circulation between the atmosphere ocean and land on land the rainfall runoff process is a crucial hydrological phenomenon that plays an essential role in managing floods and droughts xiong et al 2022a storm and typhoon induced heavy runoff could cause floods leading to significant human loss and property damage for example in thailand the floods in chao phraya river basin occurred in 2011 resulting in the death of over 800 persons about 13 6 million people in flood affected areas and economic loss of about 45 billion usd abhishek et al 2021 according to the emergency events database 385 major natural disaster events were recorded worldwide in 2021 with 156 occurring in asia in addition flooding was the most frequent type of natural disaster in 2021 accounting for nearly 50 of all disasters to mitigate flood disasters the development of early warning systems with accurate and reliable forecasts is urgently needed for predicting both flood arrival time and potential flood affected areas the direct approach for establishing a flood forecasting model involves the use of a numerical method to solve the flow governing equations yielding physically based models such models can achieve high numerical accuracy using high resolution elevation data however this approach has a high computational cost a more efficient approach for establishing a flood forecasting model involves the adoption of hydrological data without the use of the theory of flood processes such models are called data driven models data driven models are more efficient and are commonly applied for flood forecasting model construction data driven models are divided into three types machine learning ensemble learning and deep learning models machine learning and ensemble learning models have increasingly been applied for flood related predictions including for rainfall runoff river flood stage streamflow reservoir inflow and urban inundation for example chen et al 2012a compared the performance of the artificial neural networks anns with two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic models for simulating the water levels in an estuarine system in taiwan chen et al 2012b predicted typhoon induced storm tides with a 2d hydrodynamic model and anns model their results indicated that the anns could be used to predict water level variations comparable to the numerical models lin et al 2013 employed support vector regression svr to propose a two stage flood forecasting model for 1 6 h lead time runoff predictions patel and ramachandran 2015 employed anns and svr to model long term time series data of river inflows in the cauvery south india their results indicated that the svr outperformed the anns in terms of correlation and root mean square error rmse whereas the anns yielded higher nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values jhong et al 2017 proposed a two stage inundation forecasting model based on svr the model was applied to simulate 1 6 h lead time inundation maps during typhoons yan et al 2018 combined svr with a numerical model to propose an urban flood forecasting model their model produced strong performance in resolving urban flood depths at relatively low computational costs chen et al 2020 employed different machine learning techniques namely multilayer perceptron regression mlpr a radial basis function network svr and numerical models to predict groundwater dynamics in the heihe river basin northwestern china in that study the machine learning models yielded superior accuracy to the numerical models however the numerical models had greater generalization ability ga than did the machine learning models as for the application of a large area xiong et al 2022b employed three machine learning methods to quantify 50 years of dwindling groundwater in india they also presented hydrological simulations with the in situ groundwater levels for past and future assessments phan and nguyen 2020 proposed a hybrid approach that combined machine learning models with the autoregressive integrated moving average model for water level forecasting in the red river their results indicated that the combined models achieved more accurate resolutions than did the traditional single models nguyen et al 2021 employed the extreme gradient boosting regression xgbr model to propose a hybrid model for hourly water level prediction in the jungrang urban basin south korea gan et al 2021 applied the light gradient boosting machine regression lgbmr model to predict the water levels of the lower columbia river guo et al 2021 applied four machine learning techniques namely svr random forest regression mlpr and lgbmr to predict river stage hydrographs in the lan yang river basin taiwan they found that the lgbmr model outperformed the other models ahmed et al 2022 employed different machine learning models for the river stage predictions in durian tunggal river malaysia they found that the gaussian process regression model performs better in simulating daily river stages the preceding discussion of the literature highlights the following desirable features of data driven models based on machine or ensemble learning techniques implementation without considering physical properties of data low computational cost and effective management of nonlinear properties between input output variables however when the given dataset is few the data driven models would perform poorly and thus should be complemented with the in situ data where available alternatively the data set created by physical based model can be utilized to combine with the observed data for increasing the integrity of data on the other hand with the development of novel data driven models the deep learning long short term memory lstm model has been introduced and proved reliable in many engineering fields essam et al 2022 the lstm model has also been applied for time series prediction and widely applied to flood problems for instance baek et al 2020 combined a convolutional neural network cnn with lstm to simulate water level and water quality in the nakdong river basin gao et al 2020 used two popular deep learning techniques gated recurrent unit gru networks and lstm to predict short term runoff flow in the yutan station control catchment area in fujian province southeast china their results indicated that both the gru and lstm yielded higher prediction accuracy than the anns liu et al 2020 applied an encoder decoder lstm to predict the streamflow of the yangtze river they also employed the empirical mode decomposition algorithm alongside the lstm to maximize prediction accuracy dazzi and vacondio 2021 adopted three data driven models namely svr mlpr and lstm for predicting the flood stage of the parma river in italy in their results the lstm model was the most accurate in forecasting the peak flood stage values lee and kim 2021 employed lstm to predict the inflow rate of the soyang river dam they used an encoder decoder algorithm to improve the prediction accuracy of the inflow rate kao et al 2020 adopted an encoder decoder based lstm model for 6 hour ahead forecasting of inflow in the shihmen reservoir taiwan latif et al 2021 applied a deep learning lstm algorithm to predict the daily inflow in the durian tunggal reservoir in melaka malaysia the results of the preceding studies highlight that lstm models can be employed to estimate extreme reservoir inflows moreover ibrahim et al 2022 presented an extensive review of the standalone and hybrid data driven models in different hydrology fields including streamflow forecasting reservoir inflow prediction and optimal operation solutions to deeply investigate the potential of different models they provided the optimization modeling analysis to select the hydrological model as mentioned most previous studies have focused on flood simulations at the midstream and downstream of the river however the flash flood predictions at an upstream river region using data driven models are rarely investigated and are complicated with more challenges when the steep riverbed slope the physical based model requires suitable numerical treatment to avoid unphysical oscillation solutions moreover if dramatic changes in erosion and deposition occur in the riverbed more given mechanisms are required for a physical based model to solve the complicated hydrology and sediment problems therefore despite not considering physical properties data driven models yield resolutions comparable to physically based models and thus are suitable for resolving flash floods in steep gravel riverbed reach however the major challenge is that the longer lead time results in more prediction errors than physically based models few studies have considered forecasts with long lead times up to 24 h for river stage predictions in steep gravel riverbed reach forecasts with longer lead times may prove more helpful for flood early warning therefore enhancing the prediction accuracy of data driven models with longer lead times is crucial in this paper seven error correction based data driven models employing a novel predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology is proposed this novel methodology integrates a river stage prediction model and a residual error prediction model the methodology updates the error correction yielding highly accurate river flood evolution data in this manner the prediction error of flood arrival time can be minimized when dealing with longer lead times for forecasts of up to 24 h to learn input output dependencies the hourly hydrological data for 2004 2019 in the upstream region of the cho shui river were collected and employed to construct data driven models seven models were employed namely svr xgbr lgbmr categorical gradient boosting regression cgbr gru encoder decoder lstm hereafter lstm1 and cnn lstm hereafter lstm2 the sensitivity analysis for the optimal proportion of the dataset for training testing phases and the optimal input features were also conducted among these seven models the optimal residual error prediction model was determined through the use of svr by using nine evaluation criteria including correlation coefficient cc mean absolute error mae rmse nse ga peak water level error pwe error of time to peak water level etp decrease in the percentage error of the lead time averaged rmse dermse and increase in the percentage error of the lead time averaged nse iense after the residual error prediction in each model was optimized the proposed seven models were used to predict the river stage with lead times of 1 24 h the prediction performance of the seven models was evaluated and compared for five river stage stations the primary contribution of this study is to propose new error correction based data driven models based on the predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology thus contributing to improved prediction performance of such models in addition the most important proportion for training and test data division and the optimal combination of inputs are proposed for enhancing the applicability of predicting river stage furthermore this is the first study to comprehensively assess and compare the performance of seven models svr xgbr lgbmr cgbr gru lstm1 and lstm2 for river flood stage predictions with lead times of 1 24 h in steep gravel riverbed reach 2 methodology 2 1 data driven models 2 1 1 machine learning the commonly used svr proposed by drucker et al 1997 is employed herein to construct one data driven model with consideration of structural risk minimization the regression function of svr is given by yu et al 2006 liong and chandrasekaran 2007 1 f x w t ϕ x b where w is the weight vector of the regression function ϕ is the nonlinear mapping function and b is the bias term eq 1 can be further expressed as an optimization problem as follows 2 min w b ξ ξ 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i 3 subject to y i w t ϕ x i b ϵ ξ i w t ϕ x i b y i ϵ ξ i ξ i 0 ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where c denotes the penalty coefficient ξ and ξ are slack variables and ϵ is the parameter of the insensitive loss function 2 1 2 ensemble learning ensemble learning is a group of machine learning models that is rarely applied for simulating the nonlinear relationships in time series flood predictions therefore three ensemble learning models were used in this study xgbr lgbmr and cgbr xgbr is based on the gradient boosting decision tree in the optimization stage xgbr introduces a second order taylor expansion into the objective function to yield the first order and second order derivatives chen and guestrin 2016 in addition through the use of level wise tree growth xgbr overcomes overfitting problems and reduces prediction complexity further details on the xgbr algorithm can be found in related studies jin et al 2019 tama and rhee 2019 lucas et al 2020 lgbmr ke et al 2017 introduces the concepts of gradient based one side sampling and exclusive feature bundling to maximize predictive performance and reduce overfitting problems different from xgbr lgbmr employs a histogram based algorithm and leaf wise growth for reducing computational time the objective function of lgbmr can be written as follows gao et al 2019 qadeer and jeon 2019 4 obj t i 1 n g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t 2 x i i 1 t ω f i where ω is the regularization function of a decision tree f i for the tth iteration g i and h i are respectively the first and second derivatives of the loss function and f t x i denotes the new predicted value at the tth step the first and second derivatives can be expressed by 5 g i y ˆ i t 1 l y i y ˆ i t 1 h i y ˆ i t 1 2 l y i y ˆ i t 1 where y i is the true objective value y ˆ i is the predicted value and y ˆ i t 1 is the predicted value for the t 1 step model cgbr prokhorenkova et al 2018 is an advanced ensemble learning model cgbr introduces a new essential ordered boosting algorithm to manage categorical features to enhance prediction accuracy and avoid overfitting cgbr applies the minimal variance sampling method to grow a balanced tree for improving computation efficiency more details about the methodology of cgbr can be found in the literature hadavimoghaddam et al 2021 gao et al 2022 2 1 3 deep learning deep learning has been applied for continued advancement of data driven models especially for time series predictions deep learning performs well with unstructured datasets compared with machine learning deep learning has superior self learning abilities and is more scalable in this study deep learning techniques were used to train three data driven models namely gru lstm1 and lstm2 a schematic of these three models is provided in fig 1 lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is an improved version of the recurrent neural network rnn lstm can preserve prediction information even over long periods different from rnn lstm consists of an input layer memory cells and an output layer the core characteristic of lstm is the usage of memory cells that help address vanishing or exploding gradients observed in rnn the memory cells are composed of a forget gate an input gate and an output gate the following equations present the structure of the lstm network xiang et al 2020 6 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 7 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 8 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 9 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 10 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 11 h t o t tanh c t where f t i t o t and c t are the forget gate input gate output gate and memory cell vectors respectively w f w i w o and w c are the weighted parameter matrices for the forget gate input gate output gate and memory cells respectively b f b i b o and b c are the bias for the forget gate input gate output gate and memory cells respectively σ is the nonlinear sigmoid activation function x t denotes the input vector at time step t and h t is the output hidden vector the gru cell has a simpler structure than the modified lstm network the gru applies two control gates the update and reset gates for accelerating the prediction process cho et al 2014 the update gate is employed to control how much of the current input data can be stored in the previous memory the reset gate is used to determine how much information from the previous moment is forgotten and written into the current state in practice the input and output variables are processed in the same time steps for both the gru and lstm this limitation restricts the application of gru and lstm to address this shortcoming cho et al 2014 proposed the encoder decoder framework with which different input and output time steps can be employed for achieving multiple hour ahead predictions in this framework the relevant deep learning network model first encodes the input sequence into a fixed length vector after the fixed length vector is decoded the predicted output is obtained because lstm is applied for both the encoder and decoder sequences this model is referred to as the lstm1 model the gru is also employed to encode and decode sequences thus enabling multiple hour ahead predictions cnn models have also been reported to perform satisfactorily in addressing problems in different fields kim and cho 2019 livieris et al 2022 ghimire et al 2021 a cnn a type of feedforward neural network can be applied to both time series forecasting and image processing cnn mainly include two components a convolution layer and pooling layer in this study to enhance the ability of the cnn it was integrated with the lstm model yielding cnn lstm lstm2 enabling advanced forecasting accuracy as presented in fig 1 in the first component of lstm2 two cnn layers are adopted to develop the features of the input data for resolving complicated mathematical operations for the second component of lstm2 lstm is employed to generate features and dense layers for a more detailed description of the methodology used in lstm2 please refer to related studies wegayehu and muluneh 2021 moishin et al 2021 2 2 proposed error correction based models few researchers have applied the residual error correction methodology for improving model prediction performance ngamsanroaj and tamee 2019 kan et al 2020 in this study this methodology was extended in the framework of the multiple hour ahead for achieving a longer prediction capability of 1 24 h lead times the proposed predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology for constructing data driven model can be decomposed into two submodels the river stage prediction model and residual error prediction model to maximize the accuracy of the model a residual error prediction model was added that can predict the residual error and achieve the final prediction results the proposed methodology can be expressed as follows 12 h t t corrected h t t predicted e t t predicted where t is the current time t is the lead time h t t corrected is the corrected river stage at time t t h t t predicted denotes the predicted river stage at time t t and e t t predicted is the predicted residual error of the river stage at time t t in this study the lead times of 1 24 h were investigated when data driven models were applied the different combinations of input variables resulted in different predictions the previous study guo et al 2021 investigated the river stage prediction in a tidal river in taiwan and thus the rainfall river stage and tidal stage were considered however the river stage in the upstream region of the cho shui river may be affected by the basin rainfall and the river stage therefore the presented study considered input variables of the rainfall and the river stage the hourly rainfall measured data from each rainfall station were averaged in the present study to increase the training efficiency accordingly the river stage prediction output based on the multiple hour ahead methodology can be expressed as follows 13 h t 1 predicted h t 2 predicted h t t predicted f r t r t 1 r t l h t h t 1 h t l where f is the regression function from the data driven model l denotes the lag length of the input variables r t l is the antecedent watershed average rainfall at time t l and h t l is the antecedent river stage at time t l the time of flood concentration in the cho shui river taiwan is about 6 12 h according to previous studies lin et al 2013 guo et al 2021 the commonly used lag length of 6 h was set in this study that could satisfy the requirement of flood early warning to perform the residual error correction the residual error can be predicted using the following prediction model 14 e t 1 predicted e t 2 predicted e t t predicted f e t e t 1 e t l the residual error series of the river stage is obtained from predicted and measured values and is given by 15 e t h t h t predicted where h t predicted is the predicted values of the river stage by the data driven model and h t represents the measured data the residual error series mean the difference between the measured and predicted river stages then the residual error series were employed as the expected or actual values to construct the residual error prediction model therefore eqs 13 and 14 are used to produce the relevant prediction values for all lead times up to the maximum of 24 h the process of the proposed methodology is as follows fig 2 1 prepare the input vectors namely the rainfall and river stage for the past 6 h 2 use the seven data driven models to train and predict the river stage for the next 24 h by using eq 13 3 with the predicted river stage data derive the time series data of the residual error by using eq 15 4 use the residual error data of the river stage to train the error prediction model and obtain the predicted values by using eq 14 5 from eq 12 update and correct the river stage as the final forecasting result of river stages for 1 24 h lead time 2 3 performance evaluation criteria to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance of the data driven models four commonly used criteria named cc mae rmse and nse for the time series prediction problem were employed and summarized in appendix a chen et al 2020 cai et al 2021 huang et al 2021 to further examine the prediction accuracy of models five evaluation criteria are also applied and expressed as follows 16 ga rmse in test rmse in training 17 pwe h p pre h p mea 18 etp t p pre t p mea 19 dermse rmse without ec rmse with ec rmse without ec 100 20 iense nse with ec nse without ec nse with ec 100 where h p mea and h p pre are respectively the measured and predicted peak river stages and t p mea and t p pre denote the measured and predicted time to the peak river stage respectively dermse stands for the decrease in the percentage error of the lead time averaged rmse rmse with ec and rmse without ec are respectively the lead time averaged rmse values predicted by the model with and without the error correction ec iense represents the increase in the percentage error of the lead time averaged nse nse with ec and nse without ec are the lead time averaged nse values predicted by the model with and without the ec respectively nse and cc represent the fitted performance between the predicted river stages and the measured ones the range of nse can be between negative infinity and 1 and the range of cc can be between 1 and 1 the closer the nse or cc is to 1 the better the river stage simulation accuracy is the smaller the mae rmse pwe and etp the higher the model s accuracy in addition the value of pwe is greater than 0 or less than 0 which means that the peak river stage prediction is overestimated or underestimated the ga is one of the most critical evaluation criteria for data driven simulations and applications the ga is used to assess the ability to learn non linear problems the value of ga is unity indicating that the proposed model learns and predicts a given problem perfectly however suppose the model is focused on learning a given problem from the collected training data rather than constructing a more reliable model in that case the value of ga is more significant than 1 0 indicating the model is overtraining on the contrary the value of ga is smaller than 1 0 meaning the model is undertrained 2 4 proposed models for river stage forecasting a flowchart of the process for river stage forecasting is presented in fig 3 the process includes three main steps preprocessing model construction and validation the measured hourly data for rainfall and river stage are collected in the preprocessing step the commonly used min max normalization method is employed to normalize the collected data to the range of 1 1 to prevent inaccurate predictions for model training and testing the collected data were divided into training and testing datasets before model validation the optimal ratio for training and test splitting and the optimal combination of inputs were determined and analyzed the optimal prediction model in terms of residual error was also conducted with these optimal analysis results the river stage predictions were performed and model validations were conducted using the seven evaluation criteria for 1 24 h lead times 3 study area and observational data this study was conducted for the cho shui river basin which is the longest river in taiwan with a total length of 186 km lee and tsai 2010 chang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 as displayed in fig 4 the cho shui river has a watershed area of 3157 km2 and the riverbed elevation ranges from 0 m to 3917 m the longitudinal average riverbed slope is approximately 0 018 due to the steep riverbed slopes the rapid runoff flows during typhoon or storm periods often lead to flash floods and riverbed scour leading to severe damage to flood protection facilities such as embankment toe for example on august 8 2009 typhoon morakot impacted southern taiwan and caused serious flood disasters in many river basins such as bank overflow and embankment failures including the cho shui river in addition typhoon saola on august 2012 caused critical floods and thus the adjacent irrigation channels on the cho shui river were damaged therefore this study considered the cho shui river to investigate the applicability of data driven models in simulating river stage evolution at steep river reach fig 4 presents the locations of hydrological stations in the cho shui river basin six rainfall gauging stations and five river stage gauging stations chao et al 2018 the seven models were trained and employed to predict the river stages at the neimaobu baodan renlun yufong and mingchu stations with lead times of 1 24 h the central weather bureau and the water resources agency ministry of economic affairs taiwan respectively provided the rainfall and river stage data the hourly river stage data were measured from water level monitoring stations in real time table 1 lists the data collected from 2004 to 2019 during which time 41 typhoons and storm events were recorded to further understand the hydrology statistics of the dataset table 2 presents the collected data statistics of the hydrological characteristic in five river stage stations as shown in table 2 the maximum values of measured river stages at the neimaobu baodan bridge renlun bridge yufong bridge and mingchu bridge were 475 7 352 19 323 71 269 65 and 151 51 m respectively for the recorded rainfall data the result indicates that the average rainfall ranged from 0 0 to 65 67 mm hr 4 results and discussion the seven data driven models mentioned in section 2 were applied in the framework of the predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology to construct the error correction based data driven models following the flowchart presented in fig 3 the collected hydrological measurements were divided into training and testing datasets and subsequently applied to construct and validate the models nine evaluation criteria were used to evaluate the performance of the models the programming algorithms of all proposed models were implemented in python 3 7 all river stage predictions performed in this study were conducted on a computer with an intel core i5 with a 3 0 ghz cpu and 8 0 gb ram in addition the open source libraries in python named keras scikit learn and tensorflow were employed as the deployment platform of model construction 4 1 optimal proportion of the dataset for model training and testing a widely used ratio of a dataset is 7 3 for the training and test phases which means 70 of the dataset is used for model training and 30 for model testing respectively however the practical application depends on the specific characteristic of a given dataset hence this section tries to determine the optimal ratio for data division on training and test datasets as shown in table 3 three scenarios for the proportion of data division at five river stage stations were designed and evaluated the commonly used svr without ec was first applied for analysis the 1 24 h lead time average ga value is adopted as the target indicator for assessing the optimal proportion fig 5 compares measurements with the predicted river stage using svr without ec for three scenarios at yufong station the results indicated that all scenarios simulated the river stage for a 6 h lead time well the result of the ga value shown in table 3 could be utilized to assess the performance of model applicability it is found that the proposed second scenario ratio of 1 21 at yufong station has the best ga accuracy through overall consideration the optimal proportion of data division at neimaobu baodan bridge renlun bridge yufong bridge and mingchu bridge were 1 41 1 55 1 26 1 21 and 0 58 respectively 4 2 sensitivity analysis of input features before model training and testing the optimal combinations of inputs should be discussed and determined again the commonly used svr without ec was utilized to predict the river stage at yufong station with a lead time of 24 h three combination cases of input variables were designed and listed in table 4 fig 6 shows the predicted river stage results including a time series hourly plot and scatter plot with three combinations of input factors at yufong station for a test case of 12 h lead time the prediction result by combinations of c2 and c3 agree with the measured river stages however the prediction result by combining c1 produces a physical violating resolution indicating that only considering rainfall inputs does not provide the correct prediction four commonly used indicators were further employed to compare the overall prediction accuracy as shown in table 4 a combination of c3 gives the smallest values in terms of mae and rmse whereas the combination of c1 yields the largest ones moreover it is found that the combination of c3 produces the best performance in terms of cc and nse thus the combination of c3 does combine the feature factors of rainfall and river stage to increase the prediction accuracy 4 3 determining the optimal error prediction model the seven data driven models mentioned in section 2 can be employed to construct the river stage and residual error prediction models the commonly used svr was adopted to predict the river stage and increase comparisons efficiency then the seven data driven models were employed to determine the optimal residual error prediction model based on the optimal input combination and data splitting ratio the seven models and svr were used to predict the river stage at the yufong station for lead times of 1 24 h fig 7 a displays the river stages simulated using svr for a 24 h lead time the predicted river stages were used to create the error database as presented in fig 7 b with this residual error database the seven models were applied to construct residual error prediction models fig 8 presents the simulated residual error results with four close up views displaying four flood events for a lead time of 24 h differences in error prediction results among the seven models are clearly presented the deep learning models namely gru lstm1 and lstm2 achieved relatively poor prediction accuracy but they yielded favorable cc performance 0 9 to determine the optimal residual error prediction model ga was used to evaluate the error prediction capability of the seven models a ga value close to 1 indicates that the model has high ga table s1 and fig 9 present the ga results obtained using the seven models for lead times of 1 24 h the average ga values over 1 24 h obtained using svr xgbr lgbmr cgbr gru lstm1 and lstm2 were 1 22 1 34 1 24 1 21 1 19 1 24 and 1 30 respectively notably the gru outperformed the other models thus the gru was used as the optimal model to establish the residual error prediction model named the gru based error correction gec model for all the following simulations 4 4 influence of residual error correction on river stage prediction after the optimal residual error model was determined the influence of residual error correction on the river stage prediction was examined the target output was the prediction of the river stage at the yufong station for the complete test dataset with lead times of 1 24 h fig s1 presents the prediction results for the seven models without the gec model at yufong station for lead times of 6 12 18 and 24 h the results revealed that all the models yielded well predictions with the measured data for the lead time of 6 h when the lead time was increased to 12 18 and 24 h the predicted points moved away from the reference line suggesting that the models without the gec model had slightly lower performance for the prediction lead times of 12 18 and 24 h to examine the influence of the gec model on river stage prediction the prediction results obtained using the seven models integrating the gec model at yufong station for lead times of 6 12 18 and 24 h were considered fig s2 compared with the results without the gec model the predicted points obtained from all the models that integrated the gec model were closer to the reference line this result indicates that the gec model significantly affected the prediction accuracy for the predictions over 24 h table s2 summarizes the prediction results obtained using the seven models with and without the gec model at the yufong station for lead times of 1 24 h based on four evaluation indices for all the models without the gec model the overall predicted cc was larger than 0 284 and the lowest nse value was 0 081 for all the models that integrated the gec model the lowest cc value was 0 953 and the overall predicted nse was larger than 0 908 in addition the models that integrated the gec model had considerably smaller mae and rmse values than the models without the gec model to elucidate why the models integrating the gec model had the highest accuracy the influence of the gec model on river stage prediction was examined by considering the lead time averaged rmse and nse values fig s3 the results indicated that the 24 h lead time averaged values in terms of rmse and nse were respectively within than 0 15 m and 0 94 by all models with gec the results also revealed that the dermse for all models ranged from 65 6 to 73 7 and the iense increased from 46 9 to 56 4 for predictions from all models therefore the seven models that integrated the gec model yielded substantial improvements in river stage prediction relative to models without the gec model moreover cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models achieved the highest values for iense and dermse respectively in conclusion the prediction result in this section illustrates that the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models performs the best prediction accuracy among all employed data driven models 4 5 results of model validation the prediction performance for a lead time of 24 h by using the proposed seven models with the gec model integrated were verified and compared for five stations namely neimaobu baodan renlun yufong and mingchu stations the results fig s4 indicated that the predictions of all the models were consistent with the measured values to evaluate the performance differences among the seven models the etp and pwe values of the prediction results at five stations for 6 12 18 and 24 h lead times were considered table s3 the maximum absolute pwe values for the svr gec xgbr gec lgbmr gec cgbr gec gru gec lstm1 gec and lstm2 gec models were 0 91 1 12 1 00 1 09 1 33 0 93 and 1 30 m respectively the maximum absolute etp values for the aforementioned models were 18 7 7 10 18 11 and 8 h respectively these results indicate that the gru gec model yielded the largest error for the maximum absolute values of both etp and pwe fig s5 presents boxplots of the absolute pwe values from two selected events for 18 and 24 h lead times the box results for the gru gec model had the broadest distributions suggesting that the model uncertainty of this model was greater than those of the other six models for cho shui river data the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models produce relatively less uncertainty due to the narrower distributions of box plot results to consider the overall model performance the pwe results in fig s5 were averaged for all lead times the average median absolute pwe values for the svr gec xgbr gec lgbmr gec cgbr gec gru gec lstm1 gec and lstm2 gec models were 0 30 0 35 0 35 0 29 0 41 0 28 and 0 33 m respectively the overall average pwe values for all seven models were smaller than 0 45 m for the 24 hr ahead prediction the greatest difference in terms of absolute pwe values among the seven models was 0 13 m the results also indicated that the svr gec cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models exhibited satisfactory overall performance in terms of pwe the average etp values are displayed in fig s6 all of the models exhibited an increasing trend in etp values for the prediction lead times of 6 12 18 and 24 h the svr gec xgbr gec lgbmr gec cgbr gec gru gec lstm1 gec and lstm2 gec models yielded lead time averaged etp values of 3 08 2 58 2 85 2 65 3 45 2 95 and 3 53 h respectively the overall averaged etp values for all seven models were smaller than 3 6 h for the 24 hr ahead prediction the greatest difference in terms of absolute etp values among the seven models was 0 95 h the results also indicated that the xgbr gec lgbmr gec cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models exhibited satisfactory etp performance the comprehensive evaluation results revealed that the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models were the most accurate data driven models for time series prediction of both the peak river stage and time to peak river stage 5 conclusion this study proposed a predictor corrector multiple hour ahead methodology for constructing river stage prediction models based on seven data driven models svr xgbr lgbmr cgbr gru lstm1 and lstm2 nearly 16 years of hydrological data for the upstream area of the cho shui river in taiwan were collected and used to construct the data driven models the proposed models were then successfully applied to predict the evolution of future river stages up to 24 h ahead the prediction performance of the seven models was compared based on nine evaluation criteria the results indicated that the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models achieved the most accurate river stage resolution among the seven proposed models the major findings and contributions of this study are as follows 1 this study focused on the sensitivity analysis for the optimal proportion of the training and test dataset and the optimal input features our research indicated that optimal proportion at the neimaobu baodan bridge renlun bridge yufong bridge and mingchu bridge were 1 41 1 55 1 26 1 21 and 0 58 respectively among the feature factors the combination of rainfall and river stage in the previous 6 h were found to be the most important factors than that considering only hourly rainfall or river stage also the optimal residual error prediction model was determined using seven models combined with svr overall the gru model is effective at learning the time series relationship between the provided input and output variables yielding accurate residual error prediction of the river stage this new understanding could help improve river stage predictions by data driven models 2 this research highlights the importance of residual error correction for river stage prediction the present findings indicated that the seven proposed models that employed the gec model obtained significantly higher improvements relative to the models that did not employ the gec model for river stage prediction with the dermse ranging from 65 6 to 73 7 and the iense ranging from 46 9 to 56 4 3 this is the first comprehensive investigation of seven data driven models with and without a gec model including a quantitative analysis of model training and validation although the svr gec model had overall poor etp performance it performed well in terms of pwe in addition the gru model provided accurate residual error prediction but its combined error correction i e gru gec was insufficient for river stage prediction to conclude the overall average pwe value for both the cgbr gec and lstm1 gec models was within than 0 30 m for the 24 hr ahead prediction indicating the models are useful for advancing existing knowledge in the field of flood prediction the primary advantage of the proposed methodology is its simplicity and high efficiency the methodology only employs hourly rainfall and river stage measurements as its input therefore the proposed methodology can quickly solve global flood problems with limited hydrological data future research should establish a real time flood forecasting system using the framework of the proposed methodology to maximize the practical application more broadly further research should explore the operational integration of a physically based rainfall forecasting model with a data driven flood prediction model in response to climate change or extreme weather conditions more detailed studies and tests on the data driven approach concerning spatial and temporal precipitation resolution require further study duan et al 2019 2022 zhao et al 2022 the combination of the data driven models with the radar rainfall forecasting of images would be helpful for flood early warning and could be future research scope credit authorship

7646,study region the bosten lake basin study focus the irrigated agriculture distributed in arid semi arid areas is of great significance for food security and sustainable development however the shortage of water resources limits agricultural development in these areas and the water distribution pattern under climate change is also uncertain in this research the bosten lake basin was selected as the study area and the monthly agricultural water supply aws and demand awd in the historical and future periods were evaluated new hydrological insights for the region supported by the hydrological model and evapotranspiration model the aws and awd of the watershed were first evaluated and 37 gcms under cmip6 were used to expand the study to future periods a novel downscaling scheme consisting of idw and bma is used to increase the reliability of the results the supply and demand of agricultural water in the future scenarios within the region are revealed in the forthcoming future the 2030 s the watershed will maintain the warming and wetting trend in the historical period in the long term future the 2060 s agricultural water scarcity will become more severe especially under the high emission scenario ssp585 the adaption strategies to address climate change have also been proposed and efficient water conveyance is highly recommended this study is expected to provide a reference for water resources management in arid semi arid watersheds graphical abstract ga1 keywords keywords agricultural water demand hydrological model climate change cmip6 arid area data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation is the leading way of water resource utilization for human beings constituting over 70 of consumptive water use in the world boretti and rosa 2019 brauman et al 2016 equivalently irrigated farmland can yield about 30 40 of the global food calories as reciprocation qin et al 2020 in a changing world food needs will increase considerably in the foreseeable future with population expansion and growth in the usage of biofuels davis et al 2017 given the adverse effects of land expansion efficient irrigation agriculture is the right way to fill the gap between limited land area and large food demand assouline et al 2015 barnosky et al 2012 on the other hand agricultural water scarcity rapidly developing around the world due to the competition from non agricultural sectors like domestic units industries environmental flow etc flörke et al 2018 jiang et al 2016 especially in arid and semi arid regions water scarcity is a principal contributor to hindering agricultural production xue et al 2021 moreover a series of problems caused by agricultural water scarcity such as poverty hunger and potential ecological impact will threaten human beings survival and development meanwhile climate change may alter the water resource distribution by accelerating the hydrological cycle huntington 2006 in the arid region of central asia the distribution of water resources is more concentrated and the frequency of drought events is also increasing huang et al 2020a luo et al 2019b guo et al 2018 nevertheless the current high intensity of water extractions remains the predominant factor in aggravating water shortage grafton et al 2013 a warming climate amplifies the agricultural water demand by increasing the evaporation and transpiration in the growing season of crops mishra et al 2017 the food and agriculture organization fao reported that irrigation water withdrawal will increase by 6 from 2007 to 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 considering the mitigation of land expansion and the improvement of irrigation techniques berbel et al 2018 bruinsma 2009 climate change is crucial for the increment in agricultural water demand awd other than that the awd may vary substantially across growing periods for crops garcía tejero et al 2010 in the case of climate warming the advance of the spring flood period may lead to water scarcity during the later irrigation period of some crops consequently related scientific subjects are keen interest of policymakers and water resources managers which will increase the need for the quantification of agricultural water supply aws and awd in a changing climate more than 80 of arable land in central asia is irrigated which is an important part of global irrigation agriculture taking five central asia countries and xinjiang of china into consideration this region accounts for about 25 and 7 of the world s total production of cotton and grapes respectively fao 2019 ning et al 2021 as a typical arid region central asia has experienced frequent drought events which leads to serious water shortage and ecological damage guo et al 2018 liu et al 2019a su et al 2021 moreover previous studies show that the water scarcity in this area will not be ameliorated under a warming climate luo et al 2019a luo et al 2019b tian and zhang 2020 however there are few studies on aws and awd in this region some of the limited studies focus on historical periods e g the awd trend of amu darya river basin and xinjiang khaydar et al 2021 li et al 2020 while other focus on specific crop types e g the awd of spring wheat and cotton in central asia under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 tian and zhang 2020 and studies are rare on the relationship between aws and awd in a changing climate in addition the cmip6 scenario is rarely used in the field of agriculture at present considering the improvement of cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 compared with cmip5 stouffer et al 2017 the application of the new scenario cmip6 in the analysis of the aws and the awd is worth performing based on the above considerations the aim of the present study is thus to assess the gap between available water resources and the need for irrigation under climate change in an arid watershed in this study the monthly aws and awd are evaluated at the basin scale both in the historical period and future scenarios and a typical arid watershed in central asia the bosten lake is selected as the study area the meteorological data of six ground stations in the recent 60 years are used for historical period evaluation and gcms dataset training nine climate variables of 37 gcms under two cmip6 scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 are extracted for future period assessment the soil and water assessment tool swat and fao penman monteith equation are adopted as the evaluation approach of aws and awd respectively and the downscaling method and bayesian model averaging technology bma are applied to the integration of future climate variables to make the results more reliable the results of this study are helpful to understand the relationship development of the aws awd under climate change and are expected to provide a reference for local policymakers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bosten lake watershed is located at the southern slope of tianshan mountain within the latitude from 41 25 to 43 21 n and longitude from 82 56 to 88 20 e the area of the whole basin is about 4 40 104 km2 while the producing area upstream is about 1 86 104 km2 the agrarian oases are mainly distributed in the yanqi basin downstream fig 1 the main water source of the basin comes from the kaidu river with an average annual runoff of 3 38 billion m3 the yanqi basin is a typical arid oasis green space distributed in the desert and gobi with water and vegetation in central asia the growing season is mainly from april to september the climate of the downstream area is hot and dry with an average temperature of 19 56 c wind speed of 1 96 m s and relative humidity of 47 accordingly the annual potential evapotranspiration can reach 1200 mm while the annual average precipitation was only 77 01 mm in the past 60 years the main crop types in yanqi basin are maize spring wheat cotton pepper tomato and grape after flowing through the irrigation area the kaidu river flows into bosten lake national wetland park which is maintained by environmental flows mainly evapotranspiration of 0 85 billion m3 every year accounting for about 24 of the water resources of the basin 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 station based dataset and agricultural statistics the meteorological data used in this study include mean temperature t maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin precipitation pcp relative humidity rh wind speed ws sunshine hours sh and atmospheric pressure ap these data daily data from 1961 to 2020 come from six national meteorological stations within the watershed three of the stations are distributed in the irrigation area downstream and the rest are located upstream fig 1 the hydrological data monthly data from 1991 to 2010 comes from the dashankou national hydrological station at the mountain pass of the kaidu river the crop area data in the recent 30 years comes from the statistical yearbook of bayingolin and the second agricultural division of the xinjiang production and construction corps the sowing and harvesting time rotation regime and crop coefficient of each crop are obtained from the local agricultural department and the related materials published by fao are also integrated allen et al 1998 the irrigation efficiency coefficient refers to the previous studies in the same area li et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 2 2 2 gcms dataset thirty seven cmip6 global circulation models of twenty five institutes from fifteen countries are selected as the climate change dataset among which the climatic variables including tmax tmin rh ws and pcp are directly used to quantify the future aws and demand and the net solar radiation nr is used after being calculated by the equation in a previous study chen et al 2020 the resolution country of origin and availability of each variable are listed in a table supplementary table s1 meanwhile the data from 1991 to 2010 the 2000 s in the historical period of the gcms is extracted as a training dataset to determine the weight of each gcm and the data from 2021 to 2040 the 2030 s and from 2051 to 2070 the 2060 s are taken out to determine the future climate signal all the gcms datasets of the selected period are obtained via the data portal of the earth system grid federation https esgf node llnl gov two shared socioeconomic pathways ssps are selected as the future scenario among them the ssp245 ssp2 4 5 reaching 4 5 w m 2 by 2100 medium forcing middle of the road pathway follows a path in which social economic and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns while the ssp585 ssp5 8 5 reaching 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 high end forcing pathway marks the upper edge of the ssp scenario range with a high reference scenario in a high fossil fuel development world throughout the 21st century riahi et al 2017 2 3 methods 2 3 1 determination of awd the reference evapotranspiration et0 is the key to the calculation of crop water requirements in this study the fao penman monteith equation is adopted allen et al 1998 which has been widely used in previous studies pereira et al 2021 and the equation is as follows 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 15 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where the is slope vapor pressure curve kpa 1 the r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 the g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 the t is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 meter height the u 2 is the wind speed at a 2 meter height m s 1 the e s and e a are saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure respectively kpa and the γ is psychrometric constant kpa 1 eventually the awd is determined by eq 2 2 awd i 1 n et 0 k ci i c 1 where the k ci represent the crop coefficient of the i th crop the i c stand for the irrigation efficiency coefficient ranging from 0 no water is utilized by crops to 1 water is fully utilized without losses the n illustrates the number of crop species for historical periods the water demand is determined by the evaporation capacity et0 irrigation coefficient crop area and crop coefficient of each period for the future period the agricultural water demand assessment is also based on the fao p m formula and the input variables tmax tmin nr ws and rh are the historical data 1991 2010 treated by climate signals obtained from bma results section 2 3 3 likewise the future agricultural water supply is obtained by inputting the future climate factors pcp tmax and tmin of four stations into a well calibrated hydrological model section 2 3 2 the analysis of et0 and its related climatic variables factors is based on the ground meteorological stations three national meteorological stations hejing hoxud and yanqi are evenly distributed in the downstream agricultural oasis fig 1 and their observation can be directly used for the calculation of et0 it should be mentioned that there is little difference between the observation of the three stations since they have adjacent locations less than 40 km and close elevations 1101 m 1085 m and 1055 m a s l for hejing hoxud and yanqi consequently all the calculations about evapotranspiration or water demand downstream are based on the average of the three stations 2 3 2 hydrological model the aws in the future period is projected by the swat model and the applicability of the swat model in the study area has been proved in several studies fang et al 2015 huang et al 2020b the input data of the model include the climate data of the tmax tmin and pcp and the grid data including terrain the digital elevation model of the shuttle radar topography mission from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov land use obtained from national cryosphere desert data center http www ncdc ac cn and soil type harmonized world soil database created by fao http www fao org soils portal the detailed information of dataset used in hydrological modeling is shown in table s4 of supplementary the simulation procedure of the future aws includes the model establishment calibration validation and the input of future climate variables the intervals from 1991 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2010 were set as the calibration and validation period of the model respectively the parameter selection of calibration referred to the previous studies luo et al 2018 peng et al 2021 based on a calibrated model the sufi 2 algorithm in swatcup software is applied to adjust model parameters after more than 10000 samples the accuracy of the model is further improved compared with the previous studies nash sutcliffe efficiency reaches 0 86 and 0 85 in the calibration and validation period respectively the result of the historical simulation was shown in fig s1 of supplementary the model performs very good in both periods according to the model evaluation guideline n moriasi et al 2007 and can be utilized for the forecast of water resources and the sensitive parameters determined in the calibration were sorted by p value in table s2 of supplementary materials 2 3 3 downscaling and integration of future climate datasets the application of future climate scenarios is realized by calculating the change rate of climate parameters and the agricultural water supply and demand in the future period can be obtained by integrating the climate change rate with the historical hydrological model and evapotranspiration model in particular inverse distance weighting idw was used to interpolate large scale climate change data to points while bayesian model averaging bma is utilized to synthesize 37 gcm models to determine a reliable climate change rate the highest resolution of the gcm datasets is 100 km therefore it is necessary to downscale them to specific points in space to suit the ground observed data inverse distance weighting is a widely used and straightforward interpolation method which takes the distance between the unknown points and the sample points as the weight for interpolation shepard 1968 wagner et al 2012 the equation is expressed as 3 z x y i 1 n d i 2 j 1 n d j 2 z x i y i where the z x y and z x i y i illustrate the value of unknown points and sample points the d represents the distance between the unknown points and the i th sample points and n stands for the number of sample points however the downscaled data cannot be directly utilized due to the large variation and unknown precision of the gcm datasets in consequence the bayesian model averaging bma technique is adopted to validate and integrate datasets the bma can ensemble models via the probability distribution which is calculated by the training of observation and model simulated value duan et al 2007 jennifer et al 1999 in this study suppose y is a certain climate variable the y t is the station observation of the climate variable and the f k k 1 2 k is the historical simulation result of the k th gcm model in a total amount of k models then the probability prediction of bma can be represented as 4 p y k 1 k p y f k p f k y t where the p y stand for the probability prediction climate variable of y from k gcm models p f k y t illustrate the posterior probability of the k th model f k given the observed data y t the p y f k represent the conditional probability of the climate variable y under k th model f k the k is the number of gcm models i e thirty seven for precipitation in this study when the probability distribution of the climate variable can be seen as a normal distribution tmax tmin and nr then the expectation of the variable y is the linear function a k b k f k and the standard deviation is σ k and the rest of the other climatic variables pcp ws and rh can be approximated by the gamma distribution in the calculation the regression coefficient a k and b k was estimated by the least squares method while the posterior probability p f k y t and the variance σ k 2 was estimated by the expectation maximization algorithm raftery et al 2005 2 3 4 trend analysis and evaluation indexes the mann kendall mk test theil sen estimator and pettitt test are used in the trend analysis among them the mk test was used to detect the significance of the trend mann 1945 theil sen estimator was adopted for estimating the change rate sen 1968 theil 1950 and the pettitt test served to detect the year when the trend changed pettitt 1979 the evaluation indexes include the evaluation of the hydrological model and the relationship between water supply and demand to evaluate the performance of the swat model four widely used indexes are selected including nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the ratio of mean square error to the standard deviation of the observed data rsr and the detailed calculation process is shown in supplementary equation s1 s4 the water stress index wsi is introduced into the evaluation of water supply and demand wsi values 0 below 0 3 denote slight water stress values ranging from 0 3 to 0 59 mean a medium stress level values ranging from 0 6 to 1 illustrate a high stress level while values above 1 indicate an extreme stress level notably the precipitation in the arid oasis is rare and scattered which can be assumed fully utilized by crops thus the precipitation is added to the assessment and the wsi equation is modified as 5 wsi awd aws p where the p awd and aws illustrate the precipitation within the oasis boundary agricultural water demand and agricultural water supply respectively m 3 3 results 3 1 historical trends of reference evapotranspiration 3 1 1 variation and trend analysis of climatic variables three variables showed an increasing trend of which the tmin was the most markedly fig 2b and table 1 and its annual mk statistical value reached 5 96 which was the largest of all variables the annual linear increase rate of tmin was about 0 28 c 10 a accordingly the warming trend of the tmin in four seasons was as follows winter 0 42 c 10 a spring 0 31 c 10 a autumn 0 22 c 10 a summer 0 14 c 10 a another variable with a rising state was the tmax the annual mk statistical value of the tmax was 3 59 next to that of the tmin fig 2a and table1 and its annual linear increase rate was about 0 20 c 10 a correspondingly the warming trend of the tmax ranked as autumn 0 23 c 10 a spring 0 23 c 10 a summer 0 19 c 10 a winter 0 06 c 10 a moreover winter tmax was the only temperature related variable that failed to pass the significance test table 1 the rh also showed an increasing trend fig 2e although its significance was weaker than that of temperature table 1 the annual mk statistical value and linear increase rate of rh were 2 98 and 0 67 10 a respectively and the wetting rate of four seasons ranked as winter 1 06 10 a autumn 1 01 10 a summer 0 72 10 a spring 0 12 10 a in addition the results of pettitt s test show that the change point of the warming trend occurred in the late 1990 s while the wetting trend changed in the late 1980 s table 1 contrastingly the ws and sh showed a significant downward trend with an annual decreasing rate of 0 07 m s 10 a and 0 08 h 10 a figs 2d and 2c and corresponding mk statistical values were 2 56 and 2 02 table 1 respectively from a seasonal point of view the downward trend of ws in spring 0 10 m s 10 a and summer 0 11 m s 10 a was significant while the downward trend of sh in summer 0 12 h 10 a and winter 0 21 h 10 a was significant the result of pettitt s test proved that the ws s decreasing trend changed around the 1970 s and sh s decreasing trend changed around the 1980 s except for spring in particular the ap had remained almost unchanged for the past 60 years 3 1 2 variation and trend analysis of historical reference evapotranspiration generally the et0 of an arid agricultural oasis is much larger than that of pcp in this case the multi year average value of et0 899 34 mm was about twelvefold that of the pcp 75 69 mm and even worse in spring 309 96 mm for et0 and 16 30 mm for pcp in the past 60 years the et0 showed a downward trend with a yearly decreasing rate of 22 68 mm 10 a however after the change point in the 1970 s table 2 et0 the et0 turned into a significant upward trend with a yearly increasing rate of 45 27 mm 10 a table 3 top half in each season after the 1970 s the rising rate was 17 32 mm 10 a spring 15 66 mm 10 a summer 15 38 mm 10 a autumn and 2 64 mm 10 a winter respectively table 3 top half furthermore after the change point of temperature in the late 1990 s table 1 tmax and tmin the rising trend of et0 was even more obvious the yearly increase rate surged up greatly 139 69 mm 10 a as did in all seasons table 3 lower half on the other hand the trend of pcp was not obvious except for spring even in spring the rising rate of pcp was only 1 87 mm 10 a which was far behind the increase of et0 the same situation was also found in the period from 1978 to 2020 and the period from 1997 to 2020 supplementary table s3 the slight increment of precipitation is very small compared with a large amount of transpiration 3 2 historical trends of agricultural water supply and demand 3 2 1 the fluctuation of water supply in this study the eemd which has been widely used in the field of signal processing is applied to hydrological analysis consequently four intrinsic mode function imf components were obtained based on the streamflow observation of dashankou station from 1991 to 2018 fig 4a the imf components reflected the oscillation of the original streamflow time series from high frequency to low frequency corresponding to the fluctuation characteristics of different time scales the average oscillation period t and the variance contribution rate vc of imf1 were 2 88a and 42 85 which indicated that the 2 3 year periodic oscillation was the main trend of the streamflow but the periodicity was insignificant p value 0 1 the t of the imf2 was 6 75a p value 0 05 which also showed that the oasis water supply had experienced 4 times rising and falling processes in the cycle of 6 7 years furthermore the water supply had been declining since the high flow in 2002 but the declining trend had slowed down fig 4a imf3 and the imf4 was ignored due to insufficient contribution vc 2 54 the water supply in summer accounted for 44 79 of the annual water resources in yanqi oasis and the water quantity ranking of the four seasons was summer 17 39 10 8 m 3 a autumn 8 41 10 8 m 3 a spring 8 28 10 8 m 3 a winter 4 74 10 8 m 3 a on a monthly scale fig 4b similarly all the months show nonlinear characteristics of fluctuation the average annual streamflow in june july and august all exceeded half billion cubic meters providing sufficient water for crop growth in the other months the annual water quantities of april may september and october were all around 0 32 billion cubic meters which was relatively less in the growing season of crops besides the non linear trend analysis of each month was consistent with the annual runoffs supplementary fig s1 3 2 2 the rapid growth of water demand the change in crop area from 1991 to 2018 was shown as a stacked bar figure fig 5a with a total of 19 crop species counted which account for more than 97 of all crop area every year the total crop area had been increasing until 2013 when it reached the maximum value of 19 49 hundred km 2 which rose by 111 74 compared with the value in 1991 then the crop area dropped for four consecutive years after 2014 with an average annual decrease of 2 80 compared with the previous year affected by government policies and market conditions the agricultural planting structure of the study area has changed a lot the planting proportion of some crops shrank significantly and their decline rate ranked as spring wheat 9 00 10 a sugarbeet 3 31 10 a sunflower 2 27 10 a alfalfa for green manure 1 51 10 a apple 1 29 10 a rape 0 97 10 a paddy rice 0 44 10 a in contrast the percentage of other crops had expanded a lot and the sequence of their rising rate was pepper 9 32 10 a grape 3 97 10 a tomato 3 53 10 a jujube 1 63 10 a in addition the trend of the rest of the other crops did not pass the significance test the agricultural water demand for each month since 1991 was presented by the stacked area chart fig 5b it was worth mentioning that only the water demand from march to november was considered due to the small value of other months overall the crop water demand experienced a process from a steep rise to stability before the later 2010 s the increasing trend of water demand was more obvious than that of et0 fig 3 and crop area fig 5a due to their additive effect nevertheless the water demand began to fall after the 2010 s and because of that the et0 and crop area gradually stabilized and the irrigation efficiency was also improved for each month the water was mainly consumed by crops from april to september accounting for 98 90 of the whole year the multi year average monthly water demand in the order from large to small was june 4 11 10 8 m 3 july 3 50 10 8 m 3 may 2 78 10 8 m 3 august 1 73 10 8 m 3 april 0 83 10 8 m 3 and september 0 45 10 8 m 3 furthermore the growth rate of each month ranked as follows july 1 21 10 8 m 3 10 a june 0 96 10 8 m 3 10 a august 0 69 10 8 m 3 10 a may 0 50 10 8 m 3 10 a september 0 17 10 8 m 3 10 a and the large difference in each month was due to the change in planting structure exceptionally the water demand in april and november did not increase but slightly decreased for the reason that some crops with the reduced area such as spring wheat and apple all grow in this period while many crops with the increased area do not such as pepper and tomato 3 3 climate variables under future scenarios 3 3 1 climate variables related to water demand the change between the past period 1991 2010 and two future periods 2021 2040 and 2051 2070 from april to september was specified in which the absolute change was adopted for tmax tmin and nr while the relative change rate was adopted for ws and rh the projection of temperature was consistent among all gcms and the outliers of the tmax and tmin were fewer than other climate variables all gcms results showed that the temperature of the study area would continue to rise in the future both the tmax and the tmin fig 6a and b among them august was the month with the highest warming range while april and may were relatively small in the 2030 s figs 6 a2 and b2 there was a limited difference between the scenario ssp245 and scenario ssp585 the warming range of the tmax and tmin in both scenarios was between 0 c and 4 c and their median ranges from 1 c and 2 c table 4 in the 2060 s figs 6 a1 and b1 the difference between the two scenarios was magnified the median range of tmax and tmin under ssp245 was about 2 3 c compared with about 3 4 c under ssp585 moreover the difference between each month was more evident in the period of the 2060 s likewise the monthly differences also existed in the change of nr fig 6c the third quartile of april and may were all close to zero in two periods under two scenarios about 75 of gcms results indicated that nr would increase in these two months meanwhile the nr in july august and september would tend to be less in the future due to the increasing heat loss caused by warming compared with the 2030 s the increasing trend of nr in april and may in the 2060 s was strengthened while the decreasing trend in july august and september was weakened contrary to temperature the projection of ws has great uncertainty and it has the most outliers among all climate variables fig 6d in the 2030 s although the overall trend was decreasing a considerable part of gcms results show an increasing trend figure 6d2 the medians of 36 gcms in each month of two periods under two scenarios were all between 2 5 and 0 5 table 4 which can be seen that there would be almost unchanged compared with the historical ws trend fig 2 in terms of rh change a remarkable discrepancy existed between the two periods the trend of decline was obvious in the 2030 s figure 6e2 all the median values were negative except may under ssp585 table 4 in the 2060 s figure 6e1 the wetting trend get consolidated from june to september however it changed to a drying trend in april and may the ensemble values of gcms by bma were listed in the right half of table 4 in terms of tmax and tmin the integrated value of bma was consistent with the medians and the integrated value of bma was slightly larger than the median of gcms except for the tmin in the 2030 s when the median was larger on the nr compared with the median the results of bma were more conservative under the scenario ssp245 with a smaller range of incline or decline but more radical under the scenario ssp585 unlike the overall decreasing trend in the median of ws the results of bma in some months were positive but the amplitude was still small for the rh the bma results tended to keep the historical wetting trend from april to july in the 2030 s which was different from the medians 3 3 2 future temperature and precipitation in contributing area the water supply from the upper reaches is mainly affected by temperature and precipitation hence the tmax tmin and pcp are selected for analysis the upstream climate is quite heterogeneous due to its complex terrain thus three stations are adopted to represent different areas of upper reaches i e balguntay station 1732 m above sea level for the mountainous area daxigou station 3539 m above sea level for high mountain area and bayanbulak station for high altitude basin 2458 m above sea level as a comparison between downstream and upstream the hejing station 1101 m above sea level is also analyzed since the differences between the gcms value and the bma results have been explained and compared in the previous section 3 3 1 this section will show the climate change upstream directly based on the integrated results of bma the precipitation showed an overall increasing trend especially in high altitude areas fig 7a among the two high altitude stations the daxigou station had the largest annual precipitation increment under the spp245 scenario while the bayanbulak station stood out under the ssp585 scenario for the two stations in the mountainous area daxigou and balguntay their increment of the pcp was weakened under the ssp585 scenario especially in the 2060 s the increment was even lower than that under the ssp245 scenario for comparison the growth rate of pcp in two stations of the basin area bayanbulak and hejing all got accelerated under ssp585 relative to ssp245 on a monthly scale the pcp growth was more reflected from march to july for balguntay bayanbulak and hejing their total increase from march to july accounts for 60 70 of the whole year in particular as the station with the highest altitude the pcp of daxigou station was still increasing strongly from september to november in future periods accounting for 30 40 of the yearly increment while the proportion from march to july was about 50 besides the pcp change of the hejing station showed that the difference in pcp distribution between upstream and downstream would be further expanded in the future for example the largest annual pcp increment of the hejing station was 30 28 mm in the 2060 s under the ssp585 scenario which was even smaller than the value of the other 3 stations upstream under any scenarios in any future periods in contrast the warming trend was more likely to depend on altitude namely it tended to be hotter at lower altitudes in terms of the tmax fig 7b the warming trend of daxigou station 3539 m a s l was weaker than that of the other three stations i g in the 2060 s under the ssp585 scenario the warming rate of the daxigou station was 3 36 c while the range of the other stations was from 3 78 c to 3 88 c as for the tmin fig 7c the warming trend began to slow down at the station above 2000 m a s l bayanbulak the average warming rate of low altitude stations balguntay and hejing was 0 12 0 25 c higher than that of high altitude stations daxigou and bayanbulak from a monthly perspective the warming trend of the tmax was more obvious from june to august while for tmin the sharp temperature rise could last from july to january 3 4 agricultural water supply and demand in the future in the 2030 s fig 8a the awd would increase apparently in july and august remain almost unchanged in june and september and decrease in april and may and the awd would be almost the same each month between the ssp245 and ssp585 on the other hand aws would increase significantly especially from june to august under the ssp585 scenario as a consequence with the change of wsi in the 2030 s the water shortage from april to june would be alleviated although the wsi would increase in july and august a sufficient water supply would prevent a serious shortage of water resources in addition the wsi result under the ssp585 scenario would be more optimistic due to the surge of precipitation table 5 in the 2060 s fig 8b the awd would show an upward trend in almost every month excluding april and may and it can be seen that more water would be needed under the ssp585 scenario in terms of aws the increasing trend would be weakened and the trend would be almost the same under the two scenarios compared with the historical period there would be no obvious change in august and september and even a slight decrease in may the wsi results reflected that the current water shortage in the study area would intensify in the 2060 s especially in the ssp585 scenario the wsi would rise in all months from may to september table 5 additionally the precipitation increase within the oasis area had little to contribute to compensate for the water demand it would even drop in july and august 4 discussion 4 1 climate change past and future the continuous increase of temperature with the decrease of sunshine hours appears in the analysis of historical climate variables fig 2 a b c this phenomenon which seems to be a contradiction actually appears in many regions of the world fan et al 2016 matuszko 2014 chen et al 2023 it is the increasing air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels in the last century that resulted in lesser shortwave radiation reaching the ground at the same time the warming climate will lead to the further increase of upward longwave radiation based on the above facts the surface net radiation will decrease and this phenomenon will continue until the 2030 s fig 6 c2 and table 4 which is an important reason why awd did not rise significantly in the 2030 s that is the increase of temperature and the decrease of net radiation offset to certain content but in the 2060 s the compensation effect of net radiation disappeared which together with the rising temperature led to a surge in awd the increasing rate of the minimum temperature in winter is the highest in all seasons fig 2b which confirms the widespread mild winter phenomenon all over the world van oldenborgh et al 2015 watanabe et al 2020 besides the mild winter will likely continue in the lower altitude regions in the study area especially under scenario ssp585 fig 7c however this phenomenon can cause adverse effects on crops a warmer winter can reduce renewable water resources through snow melting qin et al 2020 and it can also directly affect the yield of many crops that rely on cold weather such as apples and wine grapes darbyshire et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2018 it can be seen from the trend of precipitation and humidity that the situation of a wetter climate won t last long table 4 and fig 7a which is also one of the viewpoints of previous studies on climate change in central asia luo et al 2019a ozturk et al 2017 the growing rate slowdown or even reduction of precipitation in the mid 21st century will undoubtedly aggravate the current situation of agricultural water shortage meanwhile the trend of climate change in different altitudes shows that the uneven distribution of water resources in the basin will be more serious in the future the oasis precipitation will be more dispensable while the disastrous events such as flood and debris flow upstream will continue to increase in the future luo et al 2020 4 2 development of the aws and awd in april and may of the 2030 s the awd and wsi unexpectedly decreased in a warming climate fig 8a and table 5 in addition to the compensation effect of net radiation mentioned above another important reason is the change in farming structure in the future period the planting proportion is assumed to remain at the level of 2018 when the area of many early growing crops e g spring wheat and apple has decreased compared with that in the 2000 s fig 5a for sure the current farming structure in the study area is more reasonable against the 2000 s the proportion of many low water consuming vegetables such as tomatoes and peppers and fruits such as grapes has increased significantly and the results show that the rationalization of the farming structure mentioned in some studies guo and shen 2016 li et al 2020 to some degree does alleviate the agricultural water shortage in the historical period the drought situation gets improved in the recent decade with the cessation of land expansion fig 5 and stabilization of water supply fig 4 this positive trend also exists in other regions of central asia baig et al 2020 guo et al 2019 miao et al 2020 the agricultural water shortage condition will continue to be alleviated in the forthcoming future the 2030 s as the evapotranspiration will not increase significantly but the inflows will fig 8a in the extended future the 2060 s whereas the unsustainability of water resources abundance and significant warming the irrigated agriculture in the study area will face unprecedented pressure whether under the ssp245 or ssp585 scenario fig 8b and table 5 these trends in wsi short term mitigation and long term intensification are also found in the sevier river basin of the united state moursi et al 2017 which indicate that the warming induced abundance of water resources in high altitude areas is non permanent the climate change will eventually harm agriculture in arid lands generally speaking the estimation of awd is fairly conservative in the present study the crop coefficients are assumed to remain unchanged in the future scenario due to the shortage of continuous observation of the local crop coefficient but the crop coefficient is more like to increase in a warming climate le page et al 2021 additionally winter irrigation which started in october and ended in late november is an uncertain factor for awd which has not been widely emphasized in the study area currently however winter irrigation has many positive effects on crops including disease prevention pest elimination and soil improvement liu et al 2019b shao et al 2011 in the forthcoming future scientific agriculture will be an inevitable trend and the water demand for winter will be greater taking into consideration the above mentioned the water shortage is likely to be more serious than estimated in future periods 4 3 adaption strategies to cope with the negative impact of climate change on agriculture the key point is to identify where when and which crops are most vulnerable to a warming climate thus the water resource managers can formulate water resource allocation plans in advance for policymakers relevant strategies include the formulation of a climate change response regime the promotion of resilient crops and water saving irrigation and reward measures for the early adopter for a specific watershed or region the adaptation strategy must be formulated according to the actual situation for this study the space for crop types conversion has been limited at present for the reason that structural adjustment has been implemented for many years and many high water consuming crops have already decreased or even disappeared e g paddy rice given the low irrigation efficiency of the bosten lake watershed compared with the adjacent areas li et al 2020 efficient water conveyance measures e g seepage prevention and underground channels are highly recommended in the study area 4 4 limitations and further studies the details of aws awd have been shown as much as possible however to avoid redundancy and limited by data availability this study is still insufficient in the following aspects 1 the variability of crop coefficients under future scenarios is omitted the further studies are recommended to explore the response mechanism of local crop coefficients to climate change to assesses water demand more precisely 2 the water demand before sowing was not taken into account and from this perspective the next work can discuss the appropriate soil water condition before the growing period 5 conclusions in this study the aws and awd are estimated under two cmip6 scenarios the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 in two future periods the 2030 s and 2060 s the swat model and fao penman monteith equation are used to estimate water volume nine climate variables from 27 to 37 gcms were extracted for future projection and the downscaling method and bma technique are adopted to improve the reliability of the results the main conclusions are as follows in the historical period the water demand has increased sharply double in 2018 compared to 1991 in the past 28 years which is affected by land expansion and climate change while the water supply is very unstable in the period of the 2030 s the agrarian oasis will continue the warming 0 46 c decade and 0 55 c decade under ssp245 and ssp585 and wetting trend in recent years and the nr will decrease in the 2060 s the warming rate was almost unchanged under ssp245 but accelerate under ssp585 0 55 c decade under climate change the distribution of water resources will be further unbalanced within the watershed oasis agriculture will rely more heavily on irrigation than precipitation the shortage of water resources will be alleviated shortly with the control of land expansion and temporal abundance of water supplies but eventually global warming will worsen agricultural water scarcity the future condition is prone to be more severe than estimated relevant measures should be taken in the study area and the improvement of water conveyance efficiency is highly recommended credit authorship

7646,study region the bosten lake basin study focus the irrigated agriculture distributed in arid semi arid areas is of great significance for food security and sustainable development however the shortage of water resources limits agricultural development in these areas and the water distribution pattern under climate change is also uncertain in this research the bosten lake basin was selected as the study area and the monthly agricultural water supply aws and demand awd in the historical and future periods were evaluated new hydrological insights for the region supported by the hydrological model and evapotranspiration model the aws and awd of the watershed were first evaluated and 37 gcms under cmip6 were used to expand the study to future periods a novel downscaling scheme consisting of idw and bma is used to increase the reliability of the results the supply and demand of agricultural water in the future scenarios within the region are revealed in the forthcoming future the 2030 s the watershed will maintain the warming and wetting trend in the historical period in the long term future the 2060 s agricultural water scarcity will become more severe especially under the high emission scenario ssp585 the adaption strategies to address climate change have also been proposed and efficient water conveyance is highly recommended this study is expected to provide a reference for water resources management in arid semi arid watersheds graphical abstract ga1 keywords keywords agricultural water demand hydrological model climate change cmip6 arid area data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigation is the leading way of water resource utilization for human beings constituting over 70 of consumptive water use in the world boretti and rosa 2019 brauman et al 2016 equivalently irrigated farmland can yield about 30 40 of the global food calories as reciprocation qin et al 2020 in a changing world food needs will increase considerably in the foreseeable future with population expansion and growth in the usage of biofuels davis et al 2017 given the adverse effects of land expansion efficient irrigation agriculture is the right way to fill the gap between limited land area and large food demand assouline et al 2015 barnosky et al 2012 on the other hand agricultural water scarcity rapidly developing around the world due to the competition from non agricultural sectors like domestic units industries environmental flow etc flörke et al 2018 jiang et al 2016 especially in arid and semi arid regions water scarcity is a principal contributor to hindering agricultural production xue et al 2021 moreover a series of problems caused by agricultural water scarcity such as poverty hunger and potential ecological impact will threaten human beings survival and development meanwhile climate change may alter the water resource distribution by accelerating the hydrological cycle huntington 2006 in the arid region of central asia the distribution of water resources is more concentrated and the frequency of drought events is also increasing huang et al 2020a luo et al 2019b guo et al 2018 nevertheless the current high intensity of water extractions remains the predominant factor in aggravating water shortage grafton et al 2013 a warming climate amplifies the agricultural water demand by increasing the evaporation and transpiration in the growing season of crops mishra et al 2017 the food and agriculture organization fao reported that irrigation water withdrawal will increase by 6 from 2007 to 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 considering the mitigation of land expansion and the improvement of irrigation techniques berbel et al 2018 bruinsma 2009 climate change is crucial for the increment in agricultural water demand awd other than that the awd may vary substantially across growing periods for crops garcía tejero et al 2010 in the case of climate warming the advance of the spring flood period may lead to water scarcity during the later irrigation period of some crops consequently related scientific subjects are keen interest of policymakers and water resources managers which will increase the need for the quantification of agricultural water supply aws and awd in a changing climate more than 80 of arable land in central asia is irrigated which is an important part of global irrigation agriculture taking five central asia countries and xinjiang of china into consideration this region accounts for about 25 and 7 of the world s total production of cotton and grapes respectively fao 2019 ning et al 2021 as a typical arid region central asia has experienced frequent drought events which leads to serious water shortage and ecological damage guo et al 2018 liu et al 2019a su et al 2021 moreover previous studies show that the water scarcity in this area will not be ameliorated under a warming climate luo et al 2019a luo et al 2019b tian and zhang 2020 however there are few studies on aws and awd in this region some of the limited studies focus on historical periods e g the awd trend of amu darya river basin and xinjiang khaydar et al 2021 li et al 2020 while other focus on specific crop types e g the awd of spring wheat and cotton in central asia under rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 tian and zhang 2020 and studies are rare on the relationship between aws and awd in a changing climate in addition the cmip6 scenario is rarely used in the field of agriculture at present considering the improvement of cmip6 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 compared with cmip5 stouffer et al 2017 the application of the new scenario cmip6 in the analysis of the aws and the awd is worth performing based on the above considerations the aim of the present study is thus to assess the gap between available water resources and the need for irrigation under climate change in an arid watershed in this study the monthly aws and awd are evaluated at the basin scale both in the historical period and future scenarios and a typical arid watershed in central asia the bosten lake is selected as the study area the meteorological data of six ground stations in the recent 60 years are used for historical period evaluation and gcms dataset training nine climate variables of 37 gcms under two cmip6 scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 are extracted for future period assessment the soil and water assessment tool swat and fao penman monteith equation are adopted as the evaluation approach of aws and awd respectively and the downscaling method and bayesian model averaging technology bma are applied to the integration of future climate variables to make the results more reliable the results of this study are helpful to understand the relationship development of the aws awd under climate change and are expected to provide a reference for local policymakers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the bosten lake watershed is located at the southern slope of tianshan mountain within the latitude from 41 25 to 43 21 n and longitude from 82 56 to 88 20 e the area of the whole basin is about 4 40 104 km2 while the producing area upstream is about 1 86 104 km2 the agrarian oases are mainly distributed in the yanqi basin downstream fig 1 the main water source of the basin comes from the kaidu river with an average annual runoff of 3 38 billion m3 the yanqi basin is a typical arid oasis green space distributed in the desert and gobi with water and vegetation in central asia the growing season is mainly from april to september the climate of the downstream area is hot and dry with an average temperature of 19 56 c wind speed of 1 96 m s and relative humidity of 47 accordingly the annual potential evapotranspiration can reach 1200 mm while the annual average precipitation was only 77 01 mm in the past 60 years the main crop types in yanqi basin are maize spring wheat cotton pepper tomato and grape after flowing through the irrigation area the kaidu river flows into bosten lake national wetland park which is maintained by environmental flows mainly evapotranspiration of 0 85 billion m3 every year accounting for about 24 of the water resources of the basin 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 station based dataset and agricultural statistics the meteorological data used in this study include mean temperature t maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin precipitation pcp relative humidity rh wind speed ws sunshine hours sh and atmospheric pressure ap these data daily data from 1961 to 2020 come from six national meteorological stations within the watershed three of the stations are distributed in the irrigation area downstream and the rest are located upstream fig 1 the hydrological data monthly data from 1991 to 2010 comes from the dashankou national hydrological station at the mountain pass of the kaidu river the crop area data in the recent 30 years comes from the statistical yearbook of bayingolin and the second agricultural division of the xinjiang production and construction corps the sowing and harvesting time rotation regime and crop coefficient of each crop are obtained from the local agricultural department and the related materials published by fao are also integrated allen et al 1998 the irrigation efficiency coefficient refers to the previous studies in the same area li et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 2 2 2 gcms dataset thirty seven cmip6 global circulation models of twenty five institutes from fifteen countries are selected as the climate change dataset among which the climatic variables including tmax tmin rh ws and pcp are directly used to quantify the future aws and demand and the net solar radiation nr is used after being calculated by the equation in a previous study chen et al 2020 the resolution country of origin and availability of each variable are listed in a table supplementary table s1 meanwhile the data from 1991 to 2010 the 2000 s in the historical period of the gcms is extracted as a training dataset to determine the weight of each gcm and the data from 2021 to 2040 the 2030 s and from 2051 to 2070 the 2060 s are taken out to determine the future climate signal all the gcms datasets of the selected period are obtained via the data portal of the earth system grid federation https esgf node llnl gov two shared socioeconomic pathways ssps are selected as the future scenario among them the ssp245 ssp2 4 5 reaching 4 5 w m 2 by 2100 medium forcing middle of the road pathway follows a path in which social economic and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns while the ssp585 ssp5 8 5 reaching 8 5 w m 2 by 2100 high end forcing pathway marks the upper edge of the ssp scenario range with a high reference scenario in a high fossil fuel development world throughout the 21st century riahi et al 2017 2 3 methods 2 3 1 determination of awd the reference evapotranspiration et0 is the key to the calculation of crop water requirements in this study the fao penman monteith equation is adopted allen et al 1998 which has been widely used in previous studies pereira et al 2021 and the equation is as follows 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 15 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where the is slope vapor pressure curve kpa 1 the r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 the g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 the t is the mean daily air temperature at a 2 meter height the u 2 is the wind speed at a 2 meter height m s 1 the e s and e a are saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure respectively kpa and the γ is psychrometric constant kpa 1 eventually the awd is determined by eq 2 2 awd i 1 n et 0 k ci i c 1 where the k ci represent the crop coefficient of the i th crop the i c stand for the irrigation efficiency coefficient ranging from 0 no water is utilized by crops to 1 water is fully utilized without losses the n illustrates the number of crop species for historical periods the water demand is determined by the evaporation capacity et0 irrigation coefficient crop area and crop coefficient of each period for the future period the agricultural water demand assessment is also based on the fao p m formula and the input variables tmax tmin nr ws and rh are the historical data 1991 2010 treated by climate signals obtained from bma results section 2 3 3 likewise the future agricultural water supply is obtained by inputting the future climate factors pcp tmax and tmin of four stations into a well calibrated hydrological model section 2 3 2 the analysis of et0 and its related climatic variables factors is based on the ground meteorological stations three national meteorological stations hejing hoxud and yanqi are evenly distributed in the downstream agricultural oasis fig 1 and their observation can be directly used for the calculation of et0 it should be mentioned that there is little difference between the observation of the three stations since they have adjacent locations less than 40 km and close elevations 1101 m 1085 m and 1055 m a s l for hejing hoxud and yanqi consequently all the calculations about evapotranspiration or water demand downstream are based on the average of the three stations 2 3 2 hydrological model the aws in the future period is projected by the swat model and the applicability of the swat model in the study area has been proved in several studies fang et al 2015 huang et al 2020b the input data of the model include the climate data of the tmax tmin and pcp and the grid data including terrain the digital elevation model of the shuttle radar topography mission from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov land use obtained from national cryosphere desert data center http www ncdc ac cn and soil type harmonized world soil database created by fao http www fao org soils portal the detailed information of dataset used in hydrological modeling is shown in table s4 of supplementary the simulation procedure of the future aws includes the model establishment calibration validation and the input of future climate variables the intervals from 1991 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2010 were set as the calibration and validation period of the model respectively the parameter selection of calibration referred to the previous studies luo et al 2018 peng et al 2021 based on a calibrated model the sufi 2 algorithm in swatcup software is applied to adjust model parameters after more than 10000 samples the accuracy of the model is further improved compared with the previous studies nash sutcliffe efficiency reaches 0 86 and 0 85 in the calibration and validation period respectively the result of the historical simulation was shown in fig s1 of supplementary the model performs very good in both periods according to the model evaluation guideline n moriasi et al 2007 and can be utilized for the forecast of water resources and the sensitive parameters determined in the calibration were sorted by p value in table s2 of supplementary materials 2 3 3 downscaling and integration of future climate datasets the application of future climate scenarios is realized by calculating the change rate of climate parameters and the agricultural water supply and demand in the future period can be obtained by integrating the climate change rate with the historical hydrological model and evapotranspiration model in particular inverse distance weighting idw was used to interpolate large scale climate change data to points while bayesian model averaging bma is utilized to synthesize 37 gcm models to determine a reliable climate change rate the highest resolution of the gcm datasets is 100 km therefore it is necessary to downscale them to specific points in space to suit the ground observed data inverse distance weighting is a widely used and straightforward interpolation method which takes the distance between the unknown points and the sample points as the weight for interpolation shepard 1968 wagner et al 2012 the equation is expressed as 3 z x y i 1 n d i 2 j 1 n d j 2 z x i y i where the z x y and z x i y i illustrate the value of unknown points and sample points the d represents the distance between the unknown points and the i th sample points and n stands for the number of sample points however the downscaled data cannot be directly utilized due to the large variation and unknown precision of the gcm datasets in consequence the bayesian model averaging bma technique is adopted to validate and integrate datasets the bma can ensemble models via the probability distribution which is calculated by the training of observation and model simulated value duan et al 2007 jennifer et al 1999 in this study suppose y is a certain climate variable the y t is the station observation of the climate variable and the f k k 1 2 k is the historical simulation result of the k th gcm model in a total amount of k models then the probability prediction of bma can be represented as 4 p y k 1 k p y f k p f k y t where the p y stand for the probability prediction climate variable of y from k gcm models p f k y t illustrate the posterior probability of the k th model f k given the observed data y t the p y f k represent the conditional probability of the climate variable y under k th model f k the k is the number of gcm models i e thirty seven for precipitation in this study when the probability distribution of the climate variable can be seen as a normal distribution tmax tmin and nr then the expectation of the variable y is the linear function a k b k f k and the standard deviation is σ k and the rest of the other climatic variables pcp ws and rh can be approximated by the gamma distribution in the calculation the regression coefficient a k and b k was estimated by the least squares method while the posterior probability p f k y t and the variance σ k 2 was estimated by the expectation maximization algorithm raftery et al 2005 2 3 4 trend analysis and evaluation indexes the mann kendall mk test theil sen estimator and pettitt test are used in the trend analysis among them the mk test was used to detect the significance of the trend mann 1945 theil sen estimator was adopted for estimating the change rate sen 1968 theil 1950 and the pettitt test served to detect the year when the trend changed pettitt 1979 the evaluation indexes include the evaluation of the hydrological model and the relationship between water supply and demand to evaluate the performance of the swat model four widely used indexes are selected including nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 percent bias pbias and the ratio of mean square error to the standard deviation of the observed data rsr and the detailed calculation process is shown in supplementary equation s1 s4 the water stress index wsi is introduced into the evaluation of water supply and demand wsi values 0 below 0 3 denote slight water stress values ranging from 0 3 to 0 59 mean a medium stress level values ranging from 0 6 to 1 illustrate a high stress level while values above 1 indicate an extreme stress level notably the precipitation in the arid oasis is rare and scattered which can be assumed fully utilized by crops thus the precipitation is added to the assessment and the wsi equation is modified as 5 wsi awd aws p where the p awd and aws illustrate the precipitation within the oasis boundary agricultural water demand and agricultural water supply respectively m 3 3 results 3 1 historical trends of reference evapotranspiration 3 1 1 variation and trend analysis of climatic variables three variables showed an increasing trend of which the tmin was the most markedly fig 2b and table 1 and its annual mk statistical value reached 5 96 which was the largest of all variables the annual linear increase rate of tmin was about 0 28 c 10 a accordingly the warming trend of the tmin in four seasons was as follows winter 0 42 c 10 a spring 0 31 c 10 a autumn 0 22 c 10 a summer 0 14 c 10 a another variable with a rising state was the tmax the annual mk statistical value of the tmax was 3 59 next to that of the tmin fig 2a and table1 and its annual linear increase rate was about 0 20 c 10 a correspondingly the warming trend of the tmax ranked as autumn 0 23 c 10 a spring 0 23 c 10 a summer 0 19 c 10 a winter 0 06 c 10 a moreover winter tmax was the only temperature related variable that failed to pass the significance test table 1 the rh also showed an increasing trend fig 2e although its significance was weaker than that of temperature table 1 the annual mk statistical value and linear increase rate of rh were 2 98 and 0 67 10 a respectively and the wetting rate of four seasons ranked as winter 1 06 10 a autumn 1 01 10 a summer 0 72 10 a spring 0 12 10 a in addition the results of pettitt s test show that the change point of the warming trend occurred in the late 1990 s while the wetting trend changed in the late 1980 s table 1 contrastingly the ws and sh showed a significant downward trend with an annual decreasing rate of 0 07 m s 10 a and 0 08 h 10 a figs 2d and 2c and corresponding mk statistical values were 2 56 and 2 02 table 1 respectively from a seasonal point of view the downward trend of ws in spring 0 10 m s 10 a and summer 0 11 m s 10 a was significant while the downward trend of sh in summer 0 12 h 10 a and winter 0 21 h 10 a was significant the result of pettitt s test proved that the ws s decreasing trend changed around the 1970 s and sh s decreasing trend changed around the 1980 s except for spring in particular the ap had remained almost unchanged for the past 60 years 3 1 2 variation and trend analysis of historical reference evapotranspiration generally the et0 of an arid agricultural oasis is much larger than that of pcp in this case the multi year average value of et0 899 34 mm was about twelvefold that of the pcp 75 69 mm and even worse in spring 309 96 mm for et0 and 16 30 mm for pcp in the past 60 years the et0 showed a downward trend with a yearly decreasing rate of 22 68 mm 10 a however after the change point in the 1970 s table 2 et0 the et0 turned into a significant upward trend with a yearly increasing rate of 45 27 mm 10 a table 3 top half in each season after the 1970 s the rising rate was 17 32 mm 10 a spring 15 66 mm 10 a summer 15 38 mm 10 a autumn and 2 64 mm 10 a winter respectively table 3 top half furthermore after the change point of temperature in the late 1990 s table 1 tmax and tmin the rising trend of et0 was even more obvious the yearly increase rate surged up greatly 139 69 mm 10 a as did in all seasons table 3 lower half on the other hand the trend of pcp was not obvious except for spring even in spring the rising rate of pcp was only 1 87 mm 10 a which was far behind the increase of et0 the same situation was also found in the period from 1978 to 2020 and the period from 1997 to 2020 supplementary table s3 the slight increment of precipitation is very small compared with a large amount of transpiration 3 2 historical trends of agricultural water supply and demand 3 2 1 the fluctuation of water supply in this study the eemd which has been widely used in the field of signal processing is applied to hydrological analysis consequently four intrinsic mode function imf components were obtained based on the streamflow observation of dashankou station from 1991 to 2018 fig 4a the imf components reflected the oscillation of the original streamflow time series from high frequency to low frequency corresponding to the fluctuation characteristics of different time scales the average oscillation period t and the variance contribution rate vc of imf1 were 2 88a and 42 85 which indicated that the 2 3 year periodic oscillation was the main trend of the streamflow but the periodicity was insignificant p value 0 1 the t of the imf2 was 6 75a p value 0 05 which also showed that the oasis water supply had experienced 4 times rising and falling processes in the cycle of 6 7 years furthermore the water supply had been declining since the high flow in 2002 but the declining trend had slowed down fig 4a imf3 and the imf4 was ignored due to insufficient contribution vc 2 54 the water supply in summer accounted for 44 79 of the annual water resources in yanqi oasis and the water quantity ranking of the four seasons was summer 17 39 10 8 m 3 a autumn 8 41 10 8 m 3 a spring 8 28 10 8 m 3 a winter 4 74 10 8 m 3 a on a monthly scale fig 4b similarly all the months show nonlinear characteristics of fluctuation the average annual streamflow in june july and august all exceeded half billion cubic meters providing sufficient water for crop growth in the other months the annual water quantities of april may september and october were all around 0 32 billion cubic meters which was relatively less in the growing season of crops besides the non linear trend analysis of each month was consistent with the annual runoffs supplementary fig s1 3 2 2 the rapid growth of water demand the change in crop area from 1991 to 2018 was shown as a stacked bar figure fig 5a with a total of 19 crop species counted which account for more than 97 of all crop area every year the total crop area had been increasing until 2013 when it reached the maximum value of 19 49 hundred km 2 which rose by 111 74 compared with the value in 1991 then the crop area dropped for four consecutive years after 2014 with an average annual decrease of 2 80 compared with the previous year affected by government policies and market conditions the agricultural planting structure of the study area has changed a lot the planting proportion of some crops shrank significantly and their decline rate ranked as spring wheat 9 00 10 a sugarbeet 3 31 10 a sunflower 2 27 10 a alfalfa for green manure 1 51 10 a apple 1 29 10 a rape 0 97 10 a paddy rice 0 44 10 a in contrast the percentage of other crops had expanded a lot and the sequence of their rising rate was pepper 9 32 10 a grape 3 97 10 a tomato 3 53 10 a jujube 1 63 10 a in addition the trend of the rest of the other crops did not pass the significance test the agricultural water demand for each month since 1991 was presented by the stacked area chart fig 5b it was worth mentioning that only the water demand from march to november was considered due to the small value of other months overall the crop water demand experienced a process from a steep rise to stability before the later 2010 s the increasing trend of water demand was more obvious than that of et0 fig 3 and crop area fig 5a due to their additive effect nevertheless the water demand began to fall after the 2010 s and because of that the et0 and crop area gradually stabilized and the irrigation efficiency was also improved for each month the water was mainly consumed by crops from april to september accounting for 98 90 of the whole year the multi year average monthly water demand in the order from large to small was june 4 11 10 8 m 3 july 3 50 10 8 m 3 may 2 78 10 8 m 3 august 1 73 10 8 m 3 april 0 83 10 8 m 3 and september 0 45 10 8 m 3 furthermore the growth rate of each month ranked as follows july 1 21 10 8 m 3 10 a june 0 96 10 8 m 3 10 a august 0 69 10 8 m 3 10 a may 0 50 10 8 m 3 10 a september 0 17 10 8 m 3 10 a and the large difference in each month was due to the change in planting structure exceptionally the water demand in april and november did not increase but slightly decreased for the reason that some crops with the reduced area such as spring wheat and apple all grow in this period while many crops with the increased area do not such as pepper and tomato 3 3 climate variables under future scenarios 3 3 1 climate variables related to water demand the change between the past period 1991 2010 and two future periods 2021 2040 and 2051 2070 from april to september was specified in which the absolute change was adopted for tmax tmin and nr while the relative change rate was adopted for ws and rh the projection of temperature was consistent among all gcms and the outliers of the tmax and tmin were fewer than other climate variables all gcms results showed that the temperature of the study area would continue to rise in the future both the tmax and the tmin fig 6a and b among them august was the month with the highest warming range while april and may were relatively small in the 2030 s figs 6 a2 and b2 there was a limited difference between the scenario ssp245 and scenario ssp585 the warming range of the tmax and tmin in both scenarios was between 0 c and 4 c and their median ranges from 1 c and 2 c table 4 in the 2060 s figs 6 a1 and b1 the difference between the two scenarios was magnified the median range of tmax and tmin under ssp245 was about 2 3 c compared with about 3 4 c under ssp585 moreover the difference between each month was more evident in the period of the 2060 s likewise the monthly differences also existed in the change of nr fig 6c the third quartile of april and may were all close to zero in two periods under two scenarios about 75 of gcms results indicated that nr would increase in these two months meanwhile the nr in july august and september would tend to be less in the future due to the increasing heat loss caused by warming compared with the 2030 s the increasing trend of nr in april and may in the 2060 s was strengthened while the decreasing trend in july august and september was weakened contrary to temperature the projection of ws has great uncertainty and it has the most outliers among all climate variables fig 6d in the 2030 s although the overall trend was decreasing a considerable part of gcms results show an increasing trend figure 6d2 the medians of 36 gcms in each month of two periods under two scenarios were all between 2 5 and 0 5 table 4 which can be seen that there would be almost unchanged compared with the historical ws trend fig 2 in terms of rh change a remarkable discrepancy existed between the two periods the trend of decline was obvious in the 2030 s figure 6e2 all the median values were negative except may under ssp585 table 4 in the 2060 s figure 6e1 the wetting trend get consolidated from june to september however it changed to a drying trend in april and may the ensemble values of gcms by bma were listed in the right half of table 4 in terms of tmax and tmin the integrated value of bma was consistent with the medians and the integrated value of bma was slightly larger than the median of gcms except for the tmin in the 2030 s when the median was larger on the nr compared with the median the results of bma were more conservative under the scenario ssp245 with a smaller range of incline or decline but more radical under the scenario ssp585 unlike the overall decreasing trend in the median of ws the results of bma in some months were positive but the amplitude was still small for the rh the bma results tended to keep the historical wetting trend from april to july in the 2030 s which was different from the medians 3 3 2 future temperature and precipitation in contributing area the water supply from the upper reaches is mainly affected by temperature and precipitation hence the tmax tmin and pcp are selected for analysis the upstream climate is quite heterogeneous due to its complex terrain thus three stations are adopted to represent different areas of upper reaches i e balguntay station 1732 m above sea level for the mountainous area daxigou station 3539 m above sea level for high mountain area and bayanbulak station for high altitude basin 2458 m above sea level as a comparison between downstream and upstream the hejing station 1101 m above sea level is also analyzed since the differences between the gcms value and the bma results have been explained and compared in the previous section 3 3 1 this section will show the climate change upstream directly based on the integrated results of bma the precipitation showed an overall increasing trend especially in high altitude areas fig 7a among the two high altitude stations the daxigou station had the largest annual precipitation increment under the spp245 scenario while the bayanbulak station stood out under the ssp585 scenario for the two stations in the mountainous area daxigou and balguntay their increment of the pcp was weakened under the ssp585 scenario especially in the 2060 s the increment was even lower than that under the ssp245 scenario for comparison the growth rate of pcp in two stations of the basin area bayanbulak and hejing all got accelerated under ssp585 relative to ssp245 on a monthly scale the pcp growth was more reflected from march to july for balguntay bayanbulak and hejing their total increase from march to july accounts for 60 70 of the whole year in particular as the station with the highest altitude the pcp of daxigou station was still increasing strongly from september to november in future periods accounting for 30 40 of the yearly increment while the proportion from march to july was about 50 besides the pcp change of the hejing station showed that the difference in pcp distribution between upstream and downstream would be further expanded in the future for example the largest annual pcp increment of the hejing station was 30 28 mm in the 2060 s under the ssp585 scenario which was even smaller than the value of the other 3 stations upstream under any scenarios in any future periods in contrast the warming trend was more likely to depend on altitude namely it tended to be hotter at lower altitudes in terms of the tmax fig 7b the warming trend of daxigou station 3539 m a s l was weaker than that of the other three stations i g in the 2060 s under the ssp585 scenario the warming rate of the daxigou station was 3 36 c while the range of the other stations was from 3 78 c to 3 88 c as for the tmin fig 7c the warming trend began to slow down at the station above 2000 m a s l bayanbulak the average warming rate of low altitude stations balguntay and hejing was 0 12 0 25 c higher than that of high altitude stations daxigou and bayanbulak from a monthly perspective the warming trend of the tmax was more obvious from june to august while for tmin the sharp temperature rise could last from july to january 3 4 agricultural water supply and demand in the future in the 2030 s fig 8a the awd would increase apparently in july and august remain almost unchanged in june and september and decrease in april and may and the awd would be almost the same each month between the ssp245 and ssp585 on the other hand aws would increase significantly especially from june to august under the ssp585 scenario as a consequence with the change of wsi in the 2030 s the water shortage from april to june would be alleviated although the wsi would increase in july and august a sufficient water supply would prevent a serious shortage of water resources in addition the wsi result under the ssp585 scenario would be more optimistic due to the surge of precipitation table 5 in the 2060 s fig 8b the awd would show an upward trend in almost every month excluding april and may and it can be seen that more water would be needed under the ssp585 scenario in terms of aws the increasing trend would be weakened and the trend would be almost the same under the two scenarios compared with the historical period there would be no obvious change in august and september and even a slight decrease in may the wsi results reflected that the current water shortage in the study area would intensify in the 2060 s especially in the ssp585 scenario the wsi would rise in all months from may to september table 5 additionally the precipitation increase within the oasis area had little to contribute to compensate for the water demand it would even drop in july and august 4 discussion 4 1 climate change past and future the continuous increase of temperature with the decrease of sunshine hours appears in the analysis of historical climate variables fig 2 a b c this phenomenon which seems to be a contradiction actually appears in many regions of the world fan et al 2016 matuszko 2014 chen et al 2023 it is the increasing air pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels in the last century that resulted in lesser shortwave radiation reaching the ground at the same time the warming climate will lead to the further increase of upward longwave radiation based on the above facts the surface net radiation will decrease and this phenomenon will continue until the 2030 s fig 6 c2 and table 4 which is an important reason why awd did not rise significantly in the 2030 s that is the increase of temperature and the decrease of net radiation offset to certain content but in the 2060 s the compensation effect of net radiation disappeared which together with the rising temperature led to a surge in awd the increasing rate of the minimum temperature in winter is the highest in all seasons fig 2b which confirms the widespread mild winter phenomenon all over the world van oldenborgh et al 2015 watanabe et al 2020 besides the mild winter will likely continue in the lower altitude regions in the study area especially under scenario ssp585 fig 7c however this phenomenon can cause adverse effects on crops a warmer winter can reduce renewable water resources through snow melting qin et al 2020 and it can also directly affect the yield of many crops that rely on cold weather such as apples and wine grapes darbyshire et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2018 it can be seen from the trend of precipitation and humidity that the situation of a wetter climate won t last long table 4 and fig 7a which is also one of the viewpoints of previous studies on climate change in central asia luo et al 2019a ozturk et al 2017 the growing rate slowdown or even reduction of precipitation in the mid 21st century will undoubtedly aggravate the current situation of agricultural water shortage meanwhile the trend of climate change in different altitudes shows that the uneven distribution of water resources in the basin will be more serious in the future the oasis precipitation will be more dispensable while the disastrous events such as flood and debris flow upstream will continue to increase in the future luo et al 2020 4 2 development of the aws and awd in april and may of the 2030 s the awd and wsi unexpectedly decreased in a warming climate fig 8a and table 5 in addition to the compensation effect of net radiation mentioned above another important reason is the change in farming structure in the future period the planting proportion is assumed to remain at the level of 2018 when the area of many early growing crops e g spring wheat and apple has decreased compared with that in the 2000 s fig 5a for sure the current farming structure in the study area is more reasonable against the 2000 s the proportion of many low water consuming vegetables such as tomatoes and peppers and fruits such as grapes has increased significantly and the results show that the rationalization of the farming structure mentioned in some studies guo and shen 2016 li et al 2020 to some degree does alleviate the agricultural water shortage in the historical period the drought situation gets improved in the recent decade with the cessation of land expansion fig 5 and stabilization of water supply fig 4 this positive trend also exists in other regions of central asia baig et al 2020 guo et al 2019 miao et al 2020 the agricultural water shortage condition will continue to be alleviated in the forthcoming future the 2030 s as the evapotranspiration will not increase significantly but the inflows will fig 8a in the extended future the 2060 s whereas the unsustainability of water resources abundance and significant warming the irrigated agriculture in the study area will face unprecedented pressure whether under the ssp245 or ssp585 scenario fig 8b and table 5 these trends in wsi short term mitigation and long term intensification are also found in the sevier river basin of the united state moursi et al 2017 which indicate that the warming induced abundance of water resources in high altitude areas is non permanent the climate change will eventually harm agriculture in arid lands generally speaking the estimation of awd is fairly conservative in the present study the crop coefficients are assumed to remain unchanged in the future scenario due to the shortage of continuous observation of the local crop coefficient but the crop coefficient is more like to increase in a warming climate le page et al 2021 additionally winter irrigation which started in october and ended in late november is an uncertain factor for awd which has not been widely emphasized in the study area currently however winter irrigation has many positive effects on crops including disease prevention pest elimination and soil improvement liu et al 2019b shao et al 2011 in the forthcoming future scientific agriculture will be an inevitable trend and the water demand for winter will be greater taking into consideration the above mentioned the water shortage is likely to be more serious than estimated in future periods 4 3 adaption strategies to cope with the negative impact of climate change on agriculture the key point is to identify where when and which crops are most vulnerable to a warming climate thus the water resource managers can formulate water resource allocation plans in advance for policymakers relevant strategies include the formulation of a climate change response regime the promotion of resilient crops and water saving irrigation and reward measures for the early adopter for a specific watershed or region the adaptation strategy must be formulated according to the actual situation for this study the space for crop types conversion has been limited at present for the reason that structural adjustment has been implemented for many years and many high water consuming crops have already decreased or even disappeared e g paddy rice given the low irrigation efficiency of the bosten lake watershed compared with the adjacent areas li et al 2020 efficient water conveyance measures e g seepage prevention and underground channels are highly recommended in the study area 4 4 limitations and further studies the details of aws awd have been shown as much as possible however to avoid redundancy and limited by data availability this study is still insufficient in the following aspects 1 the variability of crop coefficients under future scenarios is omitted the further studies are recommended to explore the response mechanism of local crop coefficients to climate change to assesses water demand more precisely 2 the water demand before sowing was not taken into account and from this perspective the next work can discuss the appropriate soil water condition before the growing period 5 conclusions in this study the aws and awd are estimated under two cmip6 scenarios the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 in two future periods the 2030 s and 2060 s the swat model and fao penman monteith equation are used to estimate water volume nine climate variables from 27 to 37 gcms were extracted for future projection and the downscaling method and bma technique are adopted to improve the reliability of the results the main conclusions are as follows in the historical period the water demand has increased sharply double in 2018 compared to 1991 in the past 28 years which is affected by land expansion and climate change while the water supply is very unstable in the period of the 2030 s the agrarian oasis will continue the warming 0 46 c decade and 0 55 c decade under ssp245 and ssp585 and wetting trend in recent years and the nr will decrease in the 2060 s the warming rate was almost unchanged under ssp245 but accelerate under ssp585 0 55 c decade under climate change the distribution of water resources will be further unbalanced within the watershed oasis agriculture will rely more heavily on irrigation than precipitation the shortage of water resources will be alleviated shortly with the control of land expansion and temporal abundance of water supplies but eventually global warming will worsen agricultural water scarcity the future condition is prone to be more severe than estimated relevant measures should be taken in the study area and the improvement of water conveyance efficiency is highly recommended credit authorship

7647,study region iowa and the nishnabotna watershed iowa midwest u s study focus historically iowa and the midwest have faced floods during the summer season some historical floods on record are the 2008 and 2013 floods in march 2019 a meteorological bomb cyclone set the conditions for an unexpected major snow related flood this study 1 presents a comprehensive analysis of the march 2019 flood and asses the early spring peak flows trends 2 explores the use of a parsimonious hydrological model with a snow component and 3 validates the model performance for the last 20 years new hydrological insights the march 2019 event was an extreme flood event that set records on at least 10 of the usgs gauges in iowa moreover the early spring peak flow analysis showed a significant increasing trend between february and april in this period the trend is positive for most gauges with more than a 30 increase at an annual rate of 4 of the mean yearly peak flow these findings showed the relevance of snow detonated floods and their regional understanding considering the results significance we provided evidence that hlm and a conceptual snow component can represent forecast and provide insights regarding snow detonated events graphical abstract ga1 keywords hlm snow processes early spring peaks floods data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction southwestern iowa was one of the areas more severely affected by the bomb cyclone event in the u s midwest in march 2019 the cyclone induced a flood with estimated damages of around 12 4b in the region ncei 2022 the event combined frozen ground conditions rain on snow ros temperatures above the melting point and snowmelt resulting in a massive flood flanagan et al 2020 over eastern nebraska and western iowa the flood event increased due to the surface conditions in the nishnabotna watershed iowa snow water equivalent swe packs around 60 mm melted bringing devastating floods to hamburg iowa temperature and rainfall oscillations derived into swe accumulation and eventual melting in the watershed fig 1a and b respectively in this period two successive precipitation events took place one march 9 under freezing conditions blue area in fig 1 and another march 13 under melting conditions orange area in fig 1 in overall the swe accumulations rain on snow and warm temperatures generated the runoff for a historic flood in the region flanagan et al 2020 the described mechanism is uncommon and happens mainly in the early stages of spring mccabe et al 2007 however in northeastern and western europe and some north american regions floods involving rain on snow and accelerated snowmelt progressively occurring earlier in the year blöschl et al 2017 il jeong and sushama 2018 the march 2019 event may be an isolated case however it is also likely that these events will become more frequent in the coming years if that is the case it is relevant for the u s midwest region to understand them better analyzing ways to forecast them and explore their historical and future trends to better understand this flooding mechanism it is essential to account for the weather processes before and during the event in the winter to spring transition temperatures usually oscillate around the freezing point with chances of snowpack melting anderson 1973 2006 follum et al 2019 and precipitation shifts between snowfall and rainfall gray and prowse 1993 also the soil surface is typically frozen reducing water infiltration into the soil and increasing the runoff ratio quinton et al 2004 suzuki et al 2006 the mentioned factors describe a complex system that can be represented using energy balance eb or temperature index ti models eb models simulate processes through physically based equations making use of several input forcings some examples of eb models are isnobal marks et al 1999 shaw flerchinger et al 1989 ueb tarboton and luce 1996 and snowpack lehning et al 2002 eb models have proven skillful when there is enough data kumar et al 2013 shakoor et al 2018 skaugen et al 2018 however they require forcing data that is usually scarce or uncertain franz et al 2008 and unavailable in several operational forecasting cases on the other hand temperature index ti models compensate for the data limitation by using empirical relationships with the air temperature some ti methods include the cemaniege module valéry 2010 the threshold method the linear method jordan 1991 and the sigmoid method wang et al 2019 in contrast with eb ti models are parsimonious lehning et al 2006 lundquist and flint 2006 and adequate when the topography is less complex zaramella et al 2019 considering the given descriptions and the goal of contributing to the iowa flood center ifc operational forecast demir and krajewski 2013 we opted to explore snow detonated floods using a ti model in this work our goals are to assess the magnitude of the march 2019 flood and test the suitability of simulating snow detonated floods using a parsimonious hydrological model we first contrasted the march 2019 event with the peak flows recorded in iowa during the last two decades and searched for early spring events trends in the region then we tested the modeling suitability using the hillslope link model hlm witoldld f krajewski et al 2017 along with the snow component described by koya et al 2023 hlm snow we assessed the suitability of the hlm snow module by simulating the flood event of march 2019 at the nishnabotna river basin in southwestern iowa we compared hlm snow streamflow simulations to observations at five usgs gauges we also evaluated the model swe spatial accuracy by comparing it with observed swe fields in the watershed finally we expanded the model validation to iowa running an open loop simulation between 2002 and 2020 using stage iv rainfall we validated the open loop simulation by comparing the model results at 150 usgs streamflow gauges historically the u s midwest specifically iowa has experienced significant floods mostly during summer budikova et al 2010 krajewski and mantilla 2010 however the march 2019 event has shown that early spring floods can be as devastating and a technical gap in our understanding of floods at a regional level our study aims to 1 explore the relevance and trends of the snow detonated floods in iowa for the period 2002 2020 2 present a comprehensive validation of the proposed hlm snow model using during the march 2019 event and 3 provide a robust validation of hlm snow by comparing long term simulations at 150 usgs gauges the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area the data the adopted hydrological modules and the experiment setup section 3 presents the 2019 flood magnitude analysis results early spring events trends assessment and modeling performance section 4 expands the discussion of our results finally section 5 presents the conclusions and future work 2 materials and methods 2 1 iowa and the nishnabotna river iowa is a midwestern u s state between the mississippi and missouri rivers fig 2 it is characterized by a landscape dominated by rolling plains and its agricultural activity in addition to the rolling plains iowa landscapes include wetlands over the des moines lobe silt deposits known as the loess hills alluvial plains and sedimentary bedrock valleys the paleozoic plateau some of its larger rivers are the iowa river and the des moines river with areas of 32 374 and 36 358 k m 2 respectively due to the regional weather and landscape conditions iowa has been historically affected by floods 1876 1952 1965 1993 and 2008 flood events usually occur between the late spring and the summer and are associated with moist soils and intense rainfall storms nevertheless the early spring 2019 event had a magnitude comparable to the historical records affecting mainly southwest iowan communities in the surroundings of the nishnabotna river the nishnabotna river watershed is in southwest iowa and has 7300 km2 see fig 2a the river is a direct tributary of the missouri river the intersection of both rivers occurs at the missouri river alluvial landform close to the city of hamburg the landform is characterized by a wide flat floodplain covered with sediment deposited by the missouri river its flat terrain makes it particularly susceptible to flooding previous floods include one in 1958 that took 19 lives nelson 1959 and one in 2011 the flood that affected hamburg during the 2019 event combined the flows coming from both rivers where the flow dynamics of the nishnabotna played a significant role in contrast with the confluence area at the missouri alluvial most of the nishnabona watershed develops over the loess hills and the southern iowa drift landforms the watershed has two main branches the east and west nishnabotna rivers both tributaries flow through a region of rolling hills and valleys making the watershed relatively steep the land use is dedicated to farmlands and a significant portion of its main river channels have been artificially straightened due to the steep slopes and artificial changes over the main streamflows the nishnabotna river responds relatively quickly during flood events 2 2 the hydrological hillslope link model hlm hlm represents the hydrological processes at the hillslope scale and routes the streamflow through the channel network the model is highly flexible allowing the representation of rainfall runoff processes using different modules but always having in common that the hydrologic response units are the hillslopes and that the water flows downstream through the river network in this work we represent the hillslope runoff processes using three storages ponded surface s p m topsoil s t m and subsurface storage s s m rainfall p t m m 3 s 1 goes into the ponded storage of each hillslope the ponded water can either infiltrate the topsoil q pt m mi n 1 or flow as runoff to the channel link q pl m mi n 1 the water in the topsoil percolates q ts m mi n 1 to the soil storage finally the water in the soil storage seeps into the channel link as subsurface runoff q sl m mi n 1 evaporation e i m mi n 1 occurs from the three storages weigthed by their available water fig 3a presents a schematic of the model structure and its components the differential equations describing the changes in storage are given by 1 d s p dt p q pl q pt e p 2 d s t dt q pt q ts e t 3 d s s dt q ts q sl e s the subsurface flow q sl has a linear q l sl and an exponential q e sl component fonley et al 2020 describe the exponential formulation validated for iowa by velasquez et al 2021 once in the river network hlm transports the channel water q m 3 s 1 downstream a detailed description of the streamflow routing and hillslope flows processes can be found in mantilla and gupta 2005 quintero et al 2019 in this study we used three modules of hlm with incremental complexity levels hlm nosnow hlm fsnow and hlm snow fig 3 described in the following subsections the three modules use the formulation described in eqs 1 to 3 and the same channel routing scheme they only differ in their representation of the snow processes we use the incremental complexity approach to analyze the relevance of the snow process during the flood event and determine the strengths and limitations of hlm snow 2 2 1 hlm nosnow hlm nosnow is the most straightforward configuration of the three modules and does not include a representation of snow processes in this module the p term in eq 1 is the input from liquid precipitation we used this configuration as a reference to contrast the effects caused by the inclusion of snow processes 2 2 2 hlm fsnow this module includes inputs from liquid precipitation and snowmelt changing eq 1 to 4 d s p dt p q melt q pl q pt e p where p is liquid precipitation and q melt is snowmelt forcing fig 3b the term q melt is obtained as the difference of sequential swe fields for each time interval with swe records greater than zero we estimate the snowmelt rate q melt m s 1 as follows 5 q melt swe t swe t 1 where swe t is the snow water equivalent at time interval t estimated with the high resolution rapid refresh hrrr model benjamin et al 2016 in hlm fsnow the added complexity is the extra forcing however this module does not represent swe accumulation and melting processes 2 2 3 hlm snow following the formulation proposed by koya et al 2023 we implemented hlm snow to represent snow accumulation and melting processes at the hillslopes hlm snow adds a storage s snow and uses the temperature threshold tt method to represent swe accumulation and melting compared to other ti schemes tt is among the most simpler ones kienzle 2008 adding just two parameters to the model and keeping its parsimony in tt depending on a threshold temperature t b precipitation falls as liquid rainfall or swe if the air temperature t t is lower than t b precipitation accumulates in the snow storage s snow as swe when t t is above t b snowmelt take place at s snow with a rate d the given description can be expressed as follows 6 q snow p t t b 0 t t b in eq 5 q snow represents the rainfall p becoming swe s snow in the threshold scheme p is equal to zero when t t b moreover snowmelt q melt p subtracts water from s sw e when t t b as follows 7 q melt p min d t s swe after q melt p is computed s swe is updated as follows 8 ds swe dt q snow q melt p the melted water from s swe updates the ponded storage s p modifying eq 1 as follows 9 d s p dt p q pl q pt q melt p e p additionally when t t b we assume zero flow from the ponded storage to the topsoil q pt 0 representing that the ground is frozen fig 3c shows the described processes at the hillslope scale 2 3 model inputs and configurations we used two model setups to assess the hlm snow suitability to forecast snow related events in the nishnabotna setup we explore with more detail the model representation of the observed flood while in the iowa setup we assess the model performance over the last 18 years both experiments use the same river network and hillslope delineation derived from nhdplusv2 and a dem with a resolution of 10 m usgs 2017 also both used the monthly average evapotranspiration estimates derived from modis running et al 2017 however we used different rainfall and temperature forcings in each setup in the nishnabotna case we used mrms which corresponds to the operational product used by ifc krajewski et al 2017 for iowa we used stage iv since its records started in 2002 allowing us to validate the model more robustly table 1 summarizes both configurations moreover we used usgs gauges to validate both setups in the case of the nishnabotna river we compare the results with observed flows at five gauges inside the watershed green dots in fig 2 for iowa we used the 150 usgs gauges available the three hlm modules represent runoff and routing processes with the same parameterization the runoff generation parameters follow the parameters described in fonley et al 2021 and velasquez et al 2021 hlm snow has two additional parameters the threshold temperature t b set to 0 and the melting rate d set to 4 8 mm 1 day 1 the selected t b value is within the range reported by several authors as described by kienzle 2008 and the range suggested in the national engineering handbook hydrology of 1 6 6 mm 1 day 1 mockus et al 2007 2 3 1 nishnabotna for the nishnabotna setup we used mrms hourly rainfall estimates with a resolution of 4 km zhang et al 2016 temperature records were obtained from the lewis armstrong station operated by iowa mesonet https mesonet agron iastate edu blue square in fig 2a to validate hlm snow we used daily swe estimates from the national snow and ice data center nsidc we performed discharge simulations of the nishnabotna between march 5 and march 30 of 2019 for the three configurations we use the same initial conditions setting s p 0 0 s t 0 05 and s s 1 6 in the case of hlm snow we assumed s snow equal to the mean value of the ndsic accumulated swe before the event around 60 cm 2 3 2 iowa for iowa we used stage iv hourly estimates between 2002 and 2020 du 2011 with a resolution of 4 km we used the north american regional reanalysis narr noa 2022 for the temperature records the initial states of the model follow the ones described for nishnabotna with the difference that swe has assumed equals to zero 2 4 validation experiment we compared the simulated flows to observations at five usgs stations in the nishnabotna case and to 150 gauges in iowa to measure the performance of each module we computed the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 peak flow difference δ q p and the volume bias p bias at each gauge using the following performance indexes 9 kge 1 μ 2 1 σ 2 1 γ 2 10 nse 1 t q s t q o t t q o t q o 11 δ q p 100 q o p q s p q o p 12 p bias 100 t 1 n qo t qs t t 1 n qo t in eq 9 μ σ and γ correspond to the mean bias deviation bias and correlation respectively from eqs 9 to 12 qo m 3 s 1 is the observed flows and qs m 3 s 1 the simulated ones in eq 12 q o p and q s p correspond to the observed and simulated peak flows respectively in the nishnabotna case we also validated the hlm snow swe estimates by comparing the average basin values from nsidc observations in this comparison we compute the performance indexes of kge nse and p bias using a daily timestep we included a visual comparison of the observed and simulated swe fields 3 results 3 1 2019 flood magnitude in addition to nishnabotna the bomb cyclone also affected other surrounding watersheds over nebraska and iowa to assess its magnitude we compute the ratio between the march 2019 event peak flow q p 2019 and the maximum peak flow observed between 2002 and 2020 q p h at each usgs gauge in iowa see fig 4a ratios near 1 correspond to q p 2019 values close to q p h or higher according to fig 4a the 2019 event significantly impacted the west of iowa with several gauges reporting ratios near 1 white dots and above 0 5 to contrast the 2019 event magnitude we computed the peak flows ratios between the early spring peaks observed before 2019 q p b 2019 and q p h see fig 4b we defined early spring events as the peaks recorded between december and april each year in this case there are also many gauges with ratios near one and most of them near the state s north central area nevertheless considering the length of the historical records the 2019 event has a remarkable count of gauges with high ratios blue line in fig 4c the described results highlight the relevance of the 2019 event in terms of magnitude it also emphasizes that early spring events related to snowmelt and frozen ground have been significant in some watersheds of iowa over the past 3 2 an increasing trend for early spring events moreover we analyzed if the 2019 event was an isolated case or if there had been a magnitude increase in the early spring peaks we estimated the peak increase by computing their slope using the records between 2002 and 2020 at the 150 usgs gauges in iowa the gauges watershed areas range between 7 and 36 358 k m 2 creating significant differences among the observed peak flows therefore we normalized them by dividing by each gauge s interannual maximum mean flow we analyzed the peaks for four windows of three months starting in january and ending in april each window corresponds to different stages covering the end of winter the spring and the start of summer the january to march and february to april windows correspond to the late winter and early spring stages and the march to may and april to jun windows to the late spring and early summer our results show that peaks tend to increase between january and april in most gauges fig 5a and b this trend changes between march and june where the gauges around the center of iowa exhibit a decreasing trend fig 5c and d the most significant positive changes are observed in the february to april window fig 5b where several west gauges present slopes of about 6 the event of march 2019 likely explains the trends obtained over the west see fig 4a nevertheless central and east iowa exhibit trends between 2 and 4 in gauges where the march 2019 event was relatively low suggesting that the peaks have been increasing during the early spring season during the last two decades fig 6 shows a marked difference between the winter to spring and the spring to summer transition the most significant trends correspond to the february to april window orange it has a mean slope of around 2 and more than 10 of the gauges exhibit slopes over 4 the january to march window also shows an overall positive peak flow increase however its mean value is around 1 and most slopes are between 0 and 3 in contrast the march to may and april to june windows exhibit a similar frequency distribution centered around zero highlighting the positive trend obtained for the february to april period our results highlight the early spring event s relevance for iowa the 2019 event turned on the alarms regarding snow related flood events in the u s midwest our analysis shows similar flood events will likely occur in the coming years comparable results have been reported for the northern regions of europe blöschl et al 2017 canada and the north of the u s il jeong and sushama 2018 however there is still significant uncertainty regarding their future recurrence magnitude and economic implications aghakouchak et al 2020 shirzaei et al 2021 therefore there is an urge to explore them more in depth using observations and models 3 3 hydrologic model representation 3 3 1 nishnabotna fig 7 shows the simulated and observed flows at the five usgs gauges according to the hydrographs plots hlm nosnow underestimates the total volume and peak flows evidencing the snow processes relevance in contrast hlm fsnow overestimates both variables in the five gauges on the other hand hlm snow accurately represents them besides compared with hlm fsnow hlm snow matches the observations simulating one peak instead of two we explore further the described behavior of the streamflow simulations by computing the kge index and the peak flow difference δ q p at each gauge fig 8 following the results of fig 7 hlm nosnow and hlm fsnow exhibit the lowest kge and δ q p performance in most of the gauges in both cases several gauges have negative kge values and δ q p values around 100 indicating large peak differences on the other hand hlm snow shows positive kge values in all the gauges and δ q p values around 0 we summarized the described results in table 2 by presenting the median value of the performance indexes at the five usgs gauges according to the table hlm nosnow has kge and nse values above their respective benchmarks of 0 41 see knoben et al 2019 and 0 0 respectively however both values are relatively low also hlm nosnow has the largest δ q p difference with a value of 49 hlm fsnow exhibits the lower kge and nse values and the largest pbias overestimation 50 on the other hand hlm snow displays kge and nse values of 0 74 and 0 86 respectively and the lowest δ q p and pbias 3 3 1 1 swe estimation accuracy according to the results summarized in table 2 snow processes included in hlm snow are essential in representing the march 2019 event using a simple ti snow model hlm snow outperformed hlm nosnow and hlm fsnow nevertheless streamflow comparisons do not prove if the model is accurately estimating the swe therefore we compared the hlm snow simulated swe against the one reported by nsidc we compared the daily nsidc reports between march 3 and march 16 2019 in this period hlm snow accurately estimates the swe oscillations fig 9a this accuracy is evidenced by a kge of 0 93 an nse of 0 87 and a volumetric difference of 1 25 in addition to the temporal comparisons we present spatial differences between both swe products at four dates fig 9b and c dates 1 and 2 compare the initial swe storage and its initial accumulation date 3 compares swe values after the precipitation event of march 9 see fig 9b and swe during the flood event around march 13 date 4 in the four dates hlm snow provides a spatial distribution that follows nsidc however there are some differences between dates 2 and 4 nsidc swe exhibits the more significant accumulations over the west and north while hlm swe accumulations also include the east also we noticed that nsidc swe fields are more heterogeneous than the hlm swe ones we attribute most of these differences to rainfall uncertainties the ti method s simplicity and the use of temperature derived from one weather gauge regardless of the reason the overall performance of hlm snow indicates that capturing the swe total is more relevant than capturing its spatial distribution 3 3 2 iowa we validate further the proposed hlm snow by running it open loop between 2002 and 2020 in this run we used stage iv rainfall and narr surface temperature we measured the model performance by comparing simulated and observed flows at 150 usgs gauges in iowa to calculate the performance we used the kge and δ q p although the run includes an extended period we focus most of our performance analysis on the winter to spring transition and the 2019 event we assessed the model performance using three temporal windows the total length of the simulation 2002 2020 the transition period december to april and march 2019 fig 10 according to the results the transition period performs worse than the total length of the records and the march 2019 event we attribute the transition period performance decrease to larger uncertainties in the radar rainfall during this time of the year and the simplicity of the snow model nevertheless despite the kge reduction the performance is still acceptable for this time of the year we also evaluated the spatial variability of the kge for the three mentioned cases fig 11 the highest performance is observed for the kge computed using the length of the records over iowa s center and east regions fig 11a the winter to spring transition exhibits a similar pattern with an overall decrease in performance fig 11b on the other hand the march 2019 event kge fig 11c has higher values over the central east and the west region coinciding with the maximum recorded peak flows fig 4a the described results highlight to some extent the hlm snow limitations when representing snow related processes however the coincidence between the march 2019 peak flows and the higher kge reveals the model performance to represent snow related high flows in fig 12a and c we present the δ q p and kge obtained during march 2019 versus the ratio of the observed peak flows q max 2019 q max according to it both the δ q p and the kge improve with the magnitude of the event a similar result is observed in the spatial distribution of δ q p fig 12b where most of the gauges with an accurate peak flow estimation are over the west and center of iowa moreover around 60 of the gauges have a δ q p value below 50 fig 12d the results suggest that hlm snow can represent snow related peak flows during the winter to spring transition according to the kge and δ q p the model captures a significant portion of the observed oscillations and the large peaks however we also evidence the model limitations to represent low flows at this time of the year rainfall uncertainty and the snow model simplicity could be the leading causes of these limitations exploring further the development of the model and the variables involved in its performance during this transition period is of significant relevance however that exploratory work is outside the scope of our work 4 discussion this study explores the magnitude of a snow detonated flood event between nebraska and iowa in march 2019 we also assessed the suitability of representing these events using a parsimonious distributed hydrological model according to our results snow detonated events are increasing and likely becoming larger in the coming years if the increasing trend persists the risks of similar events can be devastating costing human lives infrastructure and economic losses however iowa and the surrounding regions have not paid enough attention to these events if we do not model them correctly we will face consequences in planning flood forecasting and food growth aghakouchak et al 2020 shirzaei et al 2021 therefore it is of significant relevance to iowa and to the u s midwest to explore further models and methods to assess snow processes and their interaction with the regional infrastructure and economic needs using a simple temperature index model we showed good flow and swe representations in a region with a relatively simple topography similar results were reported in an italian watershed zaramella et al 2019 here we present how a straightforward approach that uses only temperature can capture the flow and swe oscillations in a region of the u s midwest the u s midwest has historically faced floods during summer however the march 2019 event detonated a historical flood over a significant portion of iowa and nebraska highlighting the relevance of snow detonated events considering its significance we contrast the event s magnitude with iowa s last 20 years records we found that the march 2019 event set historical flows in most of the gauges over the west of the state nevertheless march 2019 was not unique according to our results previous winter to spring events reached maximum flows at some gauges over the north central region of iowa moreover winter to spring transition events seem to increase at around 4 of the mean annual peak flow other authors have reported expected increases in north europe blöschl et al 2017 and the north region of the u s and canada villarini et al 2011 slater et al 2017 jeong sushama 2018 in the nishnabotna watershed we assessed hlm snow by contrasting its performance with the original model hlm nosnow and the model using hrrr snowmelt estimations hlm fsnow we ran hlm snow and hlm nosnow using the same input rainfall however hlm nosnow reported a significant underestimation of the total flow volume suggesting that the infiltration rate loss due to the frozen ground plays a crucial role during snow detonated events quinton et al 2004 suzuki et al 2006 and follum et al 2019 on the other hand hlm fsnow exhibits a significant overestimation of the total flow attributed to a total precipitation excess in hlm fsnow we used liquid rainfall mrms and snow melt estimations hrrr the observed overestimation suggests that using different input sources induces uncertainties and the need for additional steps in their coupled use renard et al 2010 frozen ground and air temperature play a crucial role when representing snow related floods hlm nosnow and hlm fsnow exhibited a double peak signal not present in the observations attributed to two successive rainfall events over the watershed and the lack of a temperature related process able to represent the snowmelt occasioned by the temperature increase shown in fig 1 hlm snow provided an accurate streamflow estimation for the nishnabotna watershed however its swe estimations were more spatially homogeneous than the observations the homogeneity may be attributed to the ti method s simplifications and the use of only one weather station to represent temperatures depending on the temperature the threshold method converts all the precipitation into snow or melts it at a constant rate d an s shaped function can improve this behavior kienzle 2008 other improvements include the hillslopes aspect cazorzi and dalla fontana 1996 zaramella et al 2019 and the combination of the temperature index with simplified radiation balance kustas and rango 1994 cazorzi and dalla fontana 1996 follum et al 2019 we are aware that the described modifications may lead to better results nevertheless hlm snow provided accurate swe totals along with reasonable streamflow estimations the described result follows the results reported by ayalew et al 2014 where the total input and timing are one of the most crucial variables when forecasting floods in addition to the nishnabotna case we evaluated hlm snow for iowa using 18 years of usgs and stage iv records the model exhibited an overall acceptable performance however according to our results hlm snow reduces its kge performance during the winter to spring transition we attribute this reduction to the simplicity of the snow model and the rainfall uncertainties increase during this time of the year smith et al 1996 ciach et al 1996 germann et al 2006 future work may involve the evaluation of more complex snow models ground based rainfall measurements and swe measurements 5 conclusions we tested a simple approach to simulate snow accumulation and melting processes in hlm using a new hlm snow module we checked the ability of the new module to reproduce the runoff generation processes that took place in march 2019 in the nishnabotna river and to simulate the historical observations at iowa in the nishnabotna case we contrasted the results with a module that does not include snow processes and a module that uses snowmelt data as forcing moreover we validated our results by comparing simulated flows with usgs streamflow observations and nsidc swe estimations to emulate a closer case to the ifc operational forecast in the nishnabotna we used mrms rainfall according to our results hlm snow can forecast snow detonated floods we explore further its capability by validating the model performance using stage iv rainfall between 2002 and 2020 the described long term validation also presents promising results however we must perform additional tests to validate the hlm snow forecast performance the results obtained for nishnabotna suggest that the ti model captures the main swe oscillations during snow related floods however we found limitations in representing spatial swe accumulations we attribute those limitations to using one weather station and the simplifications of the ti model we further explore the temperature effect in the long term simulation using narr surface temperature estimations in this case we obtain an acceptable streamflow performance however testing the swe differences in the long term case is still missing and may be performed in future work in this work we present that a ti model can capture the swe and peak flow for the region of iowa however we also evidenced performance limitations regarding the simulation of both variables improving our understanding of snow related processes is essential considering the described increasing trends of snow related floods therefore future work may involve using elevation data to correct the temperature inputs daly et al 2000 franz and karsten 2013 assess the effect of the hillslope orientation cazorzi

7647,study region iowa and the nishnabotna watershed iowa midwest u s study focus historically iowa and the midwest have faced floods during the summer season some historical floods on record are the 2008 and 2013 floods in march 2019 a meteorological bomb cyclone set the conditions for an unexpected major snow related flood this study 1 presents a comprehensive analysis of the march 2019 flood and asses the early spring peak flows trends 2 explores the use of a parsimonious hydrological model with a snow component and 3 validates the model performance for the last 20 years new hydrological insights the march 2019 event was an extreme flood event that set records on at least 10 of the usgs gauges in iowa moreover the early spring peak flow analysis showed a significant increasing trend between february and april in this period the trend is positive for most gauges with more than a 30 increase at an annual rate of 4 of the mean yearly peak flow these findings showed the relevance of snow detonated floods and their regional understanding considering the results significance we provided evidence that hlm and a conceptual snow component can represent forecast and provide insights regarding snow detonated events graphical abstract ga1 keywords hlm snow processes early spring peaks floods data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction southwestern iowa was one of the areas more severely affected by the bomb cyclone event in the u s midwest in march 2019 the cyclone induced a flood with estimated damages of around 12 4b in the region ncei 2022 the event combined frozen ground conditions rain on snow ros temperatures above the melting point and snowmelt resulting in a massive flood flanagan et al 2020 over eastern nebraska and western iowa the flood event increased due to the surface conditions in the nishnabotna watershed iowa snow water equivalent swe packs around 60 mm melted bringing devastating floods to hamburg iowa temperature and rainfall oscillations derived into swe accumulation and eventual melting in the watershed fig 1a and b respectively in this period two successive precipitation events took place one march 9 under freezing conditions blue area in fig 1 and another march 13 under melting conditions orange area in fig 1 in overall the swe accumulations rain on snow and warm temperatures generated the runoff for a historic flood in the region flanagan et al 2020 the described mechanism is uncommon and happens mainly in the early stages of spring mccabe et al 2007 however in northeastern and western europe and some north american regions floods involving rain on snow and accelerated snowmelt progressively occurring earlier in the year blöschl et al 2017 il jeong and sushama 2018 the march 2019 event may be an isolated case however it is also likely that these events will become more frequent in the coming years if that is the case it is relevant for the u s midwest region to understand them better analyzing ways to forecast them and explore their historical and future trends to better understand this flooding mechanism it is essential to account for the weather processes before and during the event in the winter to spring transition temperatures usually oscillate around the freezing point with chances of snowpack melting anderson 1973 2006 follum et al 2019 and precipitation shifts between snowfall and rainfall gray and prowse 1993 also the soil surface is typically frozen reducing water infiltration into the soil and increasing the runoff ratio quinton et al 2004 suzuki et al 2006 the mentioned factors describe a complex system that can be represented using energy balance eb or temperature index ti models eb models simulate processes through physically based equations making use of several input forcings some examples of eb models are isnobal marks et al 1999 shaw flerchinger et al 1989 ueb tarboton and luce 1996 and snowpack lehning et al 2002 eb models have proven skillful when there is enough data kumar et al 2013 shakoor et al 2018 skaugen et al 2018 however they require forcing data that is usually scarce or uncertain franz et al 2008 and unavailable in several operational forecasting cases on the other hand temperature index ti models compensate for the data limitation by using empirical relationships with the air temperature some ti methods include the cemaniege module valéry 2010 the threshold method the linear method jordan 1991 and the sigmoid method wang et al 2019 in contrast with eb ti models are parsimonious lehning et al 2006 lundquist and flint 2006 and adequate when the topography is less complex zaramella et al 2019 considering the given descriptions and the goal of contributing to the iowa flood center ifc operational forecast demir and krajewski 2013 we opted to explore snow detonated floods using a ti model in this work our goals are to assess the magnitude of the march 2019 flood and test the suitability of simulating snow detonated floods using a parsimonious hydrological model we first contrasted the march 2019 event with the peak flows recorded in iowa during the last two decades and searched for early spring events trends in the region then we tested the modeling suitability using the hillslope link model hlm witoldld f krajewski et al 2017 along with the snow component described by koya et al 2023 hlm snow we assessed the suitability of the hlm snow module by simulating the flood event of march 2019 at the nishnabotna river basin in southwestern iowa we compared hlm snow streamflow simulations to observations at five usgs gauges we also evaluated the model swe spatial accuracy by comparing it with observed swe fields in the watershed finally we expanded the model validation to iowa running an open loop simulation between 2002 and 2020 using stage iv rainfall we validated the open loop simulation by comparing the model results at 150 usgs streamflow gauges historically the u s midwest specifically iowa has experienced significant floods mostly during summer budikova et al 2010 krajewski and mantilla 2010 however the march 2019 event has shown that early spring floods can be as devastating and a technical gap in our understanding of floods at a regional level our study aims to 1 explore the relevance and trends of the snow detonated floods in iowa for the period 2002 2020 2 present a comprehensive validation of the proposed hlm snow model using during the march 2019 event and 3 provide a robust validation of hlm snow by comparing long term simulations at 150 usgs gauges the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area the data the adopted hydrological modules and the experiment setup section 3 presents the 2019 flood magnitude analysis results early spring events trends assessment and modeling performance section 4 expands the discussion of our results finally section 5 presents the conclusions and future work 2 materials and methods 2 1 iowa and the nishnabotna river iowa is a midwestern u s state between the mississippi and missouri rivers fig 2 it is characterized by a landscape dominated by rolling plains and its agricultural activity in addition to the rolling plains iowa landscapes include wetlands over the des moines lobe silt deposits known as the loess hills alluvial plains and sedimentary bedrock valleys the paleozoic plateau some of its larger rivers are the iowa river and the des moines river with areas of 32 374 and 36 358 k m 2 respectively due to the regional weather and landscape conditions iowa has been historically affected by floods 1876 1952 1965 1993 and 2008 flood events usually occur between the late spring and the summer and are associated with moist soils and intense rainfall storms nevertheless the early spring 2019 event had a magnitude comparable to the historical records affecting mainly southwest iowan communities in the surroundings of the nishnabotna river the nishnabotna river watershed is in southwest iowa and has 7300 km2 see fig 2a the river is a direct tributary of the missouri river the intersection of both rivers occurs at the missouri river alluvial landform close to the city of hamburg the landform is characterized by a wide flat floodplain covered with sediment deposited by the missouri river its flat terrain makes it particularly susceptible to flooding previous floods include one in 1958 that took 19 lives nelson 1959 and one in 2011 the flood that affected hamburg during the 2019 event combined the flows coming from both rivers where the flow dynamics of the nishnabotna played a significant role in contrast with the confluence area at the missouri alluvial most of the nishnabona watershed develops over the loess hills and the southern iowa drift landforms the watershed has two main branches the east and west nishnabotna rivers both tributaries flow through a region of rolling hills and valleys making the watershed relatively steep the land use is dedicated to farmlands and a significant portion of its main river channels have been artificially straightened due to the steep slopes and artificial changes over the main streamflows the nishnabotna river responds relatively quickly during flood events 2 2 the hydrological hillslope link model hlm hlm represents the hydrological processes at the hillslope scale and routes the streamflow through the channel network the model is highly flexible allowing the representation of rainfall runoff processes using different modules but always having in common that the hydrologic response units are the hillslopes and that the water flows downstream through the river network in this work we represent the hillslope runoff processes using three storages ponded surface s p m topsoil s t m and subsurface storage s s m rainfall p t m m 3 s 1 goes into the ponded storage of each hillslope the ponded water can either infiltrate the topsoil q pt m mi n 1 or flow as runoff to the channel link q pl m mi n 1 the water in the topsoil percolates q ts m mi n 1 to the soil storage finally the water in the soil storage seeps into the channel link as subsurface runoff q sl m mi n 1 evaporation e i m mi n 1 occurs from the three storages weigthed by their available water fig 3a presents a schematic of the model structure and its components the differential equations describing the changes in storage are given by 1 d s p dt p q pl q pt e p 2 d s t dt q pt q ts e t 3 d s s dt q ts q sl e s the subsurface flow q sl has a linear q l sl and an exponential q e sl component fonley et al 2020 describe the exponential formulation validated for iowa by velasquez et al 2021 once in the river network hlm transports the channel water q m 3 s 1 downstream a detailed description of the streamflow routing and hillslope flows processes can be found in mantilla and gupta 2005 quintero et al 2019 in this study we used three modules of hlm with incremental complexity levels hlm nosnow hlm fsnow and hlm snow fig 3 described in the following subsections the three modules use the formulation described in eqs 1 to 3 and the same channel routing scheme they only differ in their representation of the snow processes we use the incremental complexity approach to analyze the relevance of the snow process during the flood event and determine the strengths and limitations of hlm snow 2 2 1 hlm nosnow hlm nosnow is the most straightforward configuration of the three modules and does not include a representation of snow processes in this module the p term in eq 1 is the input from liquid precipitation we used this configuration as a reference to contrast the effects caused by the inclusion of snow processes 2 2 2 hlm fsnow this module includes inputs from liquid precipitation and snowmelt changing eq 1 to 4 d s p dt p q melt q pl q pt e p where p is liquid precipitation and q melt is snowmelt forcing fig 3b the term q melt is obtained as the difference of sequential swe fields for each time interval with swe records greater than zero we estimate the snowmelt rate q melt m s 1 as follows 5 q melt swe t swe t 1 where swe t is the snow water equivalent at time interval t estimated with the high resolution rapid refresh hrrr model benjamin et al 2016 in hlm fsnow the added complexity is the extra forcing however this module does not represent swe accumulation and melting processes 2 2 3 hlm snow following the formulation proposed by koya et al 2023 we implemented hlm snow to represent snow accumulation and melting processes at the hillslopes hlm snow adds a storage s snow and uses the temperature threshold tt method to represent swe accumulation and melting compared to other ti schemes tt is among the most simpler ones kienzle 2008 adding just two parameters to the model and keeping its parsimony in tt depending on a threshold temperature t b precipitation falls as liquid rainfall or swe if the air temperature t t is lower than t b precipitation accumulates in the snow storage s snow as swe when t t is above t b snowmelt take place at s snow with a rate d the given description can be expressed as follows 6 q snow p t t b 0 t t b in eq 5 q snow represents the rainfall p becoming swe s snow in the threshold scheme p is equal to zero when t t b moreover snowmelt q melt p subtracts water from s sw e when t t b as follows 7 q melt

pl q pt q melt p e p additionally when t t b we assume zero flow from the ponded storage to the topsoil q pt 0 representing that the ground is frozen fig 3c shows the described processes at the hillslope scale 2 3 model inputs and configurations we used two model setups to assess the hlm snow suitability to forecast snow related events in the nishnabotna setup we explore with more detail the model representation of the observed flood while in the iowa setup we assess the model performance over the last 18 years both experiments use the same river network and hillslope delineation derived from nhdplusv2 and a dem with a resolution of 10 m usgs 2017 also both used the monthly average evapotranspiration estimates derived from modis running et al 2017 however we used different rainfall and temperature forcings in each setup in the nishnabotna case we used mrms which corresponds to the operational product used by ifc krajewski et al 2017 for iowa we used stage iv since its records started in 2002 allowing us to validate the model more robustly table 1 summarizes both configurations moreover we used usgs gauges to validate both setups in the case of the nishnabotna river we compare the results with observed flows at five gauges inside the watershed green dots in fig 2 for iowa we used the 150 usgs gauges available the three hlm modules represent runoff and routing processes with the same parameterization the runoff generation parameters follow the parameters described in fonley et al 2021 and velasquez et al 2021 hlm snow has two additional parameters the threshold temperature t b set to 0 and the melting rate d set to 4 8 mm 1 day 1 the selected t b value is within the range reported by several authors as described by kienzle 2008 and the range suggested in the national engineering handbook hydrology of 1 6 6 mm 1 day 1 mockus et al 2007 2 3 1 nishnabotna for the nishnabotna setup we used mrms hourly rainfall estimates with a resolution of 4 km zhang et al 2016 temperature records were obtained from the lewis armstrong station operated by iowa mesonet https mesonet agron iastate edu blue square in fig 2a to validate hlm snow we used daily swe estimates from the national snow and ice data center nsidc we performed discharge simulations of the nishnabotna between march 5 and march 30 of 2019 for the three configurations we use the same initial conditions setting s p 0 0 s t 0 05 and s s 1 6 in the case of hlm snow we assumed s snow equal to the mean value of the ndsic accumulated swe before the event around 60 cm 2 3 2 iowa for iowa we used stage iv hourly estimates between 2002 and 2020 du 2011 with a resolution of 4 km we used the north american regional reanalysis narr noa 2022 for the temperature records the initial states of the model follow the ones described for nishnabotna with the difference that swe has assumed equals to zero 2 4 validation experiment we compared the simulated flows to observations at five usgs stations in the nishnabotna case and to 150 gauges in iowa to measure the performance of each module we computed the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 peak flow difference δ q p and the volume bias p bias at each gauge using the following performance indexes 9 kge 1 μ 2 1 σ 2 1 γ 2 10 nse 1 t q s t q o t t q o t q o 11 δ q p 100 q o p q s p q o p 12 p bias 100 t 1 n qo t qs t t 1 n qo t in eq 9 μ σ and γ correspond to the mean bias deviation bias and correlation respectively from eqs 9 to 12 qo m 3 s 1 is the observed flows and qs m 3 s 1 the simulated ones in eq 12 q o p and q s p correspond to the observed and simulated peak flows respectively in the nishnabotna case we also validated the hlm snow swe estimates by comparing the average basin values from nsidc observations in this comparison we compute the performance indexes of kge nse and p bias using a daily timestep we included a visual comparison of the observed and simulated swe fields 3 results 3 1 2019 flood magnitude in addition to nishnabotna the bomb cyclone also affected other surrounding watersheds over nebraska and iowa to assess its magnitude we compute the ratio between the march 2019 event peak flow q p 2019 and the maximum peak flow observed between 2002 and 2020 q p h at each usgs gauge in iowa see fig 4a ratios near 1 correspond to q p 2019 values close to q p h or higher according to fig 4a the 2019 event significantly impacted the west of iowa with several gauges reporting ratios near 1 white dots and above 0 5 to contrast the 2019 event magnitude we computed the peak flows ratios between the early spring peaks observed before 2019 q p b 2019 and q p h see fig 4b we defined early spring events as the peaks recorded between december and april each year in this case there are also many gauges with ratios near one and most of them near the state s north central area nevertheless considering the length of the historical records the 2019 event has a remarkable count of gauges with high ratios blue line in fig 4c the described results highlight the relevance of the 2019 event in terms of magnitude it also emphasizes that early spring events related to snowmelt and frozen ground have been significant in some watersheds of iowa over the past 3 2 an increasing trend for early spring events moreover we analyzed if the 2019 event was an isolated case or if there had been a magnitude increase in the early spring peaks we estimated the peak increase by computing their slope using the records between 2002 and 2020 at the 150 usgs gauges in iowa the gauges watershed areas range between 7 and 36 358 k m 2 creating significant differences among the observed peak flows therefore we normalized them by dividing by each gauge s interannual maximum mean flow we analyzed the peaks for four windows of three months starting in january and ending in april each window corresponds to different stages covering the end of winter the spring and the start of summer the january to march and february to april windows correspond to the late winter and early spring stages and the march to may and april to jun windows to the late spring and early summer our results show that peaks tend to increase between january and april in most gauges fig 5a and b this trend changes between march and june where the gauges around the center of iowa exhibit a decreasing trend fig 5c and d the most significant positive changes are observed in the february to april window fig 5b where several west gauges present slopes of about 6 the event of march 2019 likely explains the trends obtained over the west see fig 4a nevertheless central and east iowa exhibit trends between 2 and 4 in gauges where the march 2019 event was relatively low suggesting that the peaks have been increasing during the early spring season during the last two decades fig 6 shows a marked difference between the winter to spring and the spring to summer transition the most significant trends correspond to the february to april window orange it has a mean slope of around 2 and more than 10 of the gauges exhibit slopes over 4 the january to march window also shows an overall positive peak flow increase however its mean value is around 1 and most slopes are between 0 and 3 in contrast the march to may and april to june windows exhibit a similar frequency distribution centered around zero highlighting the positive trend obtained for the february to april period our results highlight the early spring event s relevance for iowa the 2019 event turned on the alarms regarding snow related flood events in the u s midwest our analysis shows similar flood events will likely occur in the coming years comparable results have been reported for the northern regions of europe blöschl et al 2017 canada and the north of the u s il jeong and sushama 2018 however there is still significant uncertainty regarding their future recurrence magnitude and economic implications aghakouchak et al 2020 shirzaei et al 2021 therefore there is an urge to explore them more in depth using observations and models 3 3 hydrologic model representation 3 3 1 nishnabotna fig 7 shows the simulated and observed flows at the five usgs gauges according to the hydrographs plots hlm nosnow underestimates the total volume and peak flows evidencing the snow processes relevance in contrast hlm fsnow overestimates both variables in the five gauges on the other hand hlm snow accurately represents them besides compared with hlm fsnow hlm snow matches the observations simulating one peak instead of two we explore further the described behavior of the streamflow simulations by computing the kge index and the peak flow difference δ q p at each gauge fig 8 following the results of fig 7 hlm nosnow and hlm fsnow exhibit the lowest kge and δ q p performance in most of the gauges in both cases several gauges have negative kge values and δ q p values around 100 indicating large peak differences on the other hand hlm snow shows positive kge values in all the gauges and δ q p values around 0 we summarized the described results in table 2 by presenting the median value of the performance indexes at the five usgs gauges according to the table hlm nosnow has kge and nse values above their respective benchmarks of 0 41 see knoben et al 2019 and 0 0 respectively however both values are relatively low also hlm nosnow has the largest δ q p difference with a value of 49 hlm fsnow exhibits the lower kge and nse values and the largest pbias overestimation 50 on the other hand hlm snow displays kge and nse values of 0 74 and 0 86 respectively and the lowest δ q p and pbias 3 3 1 1 swe estimation accuracy according to the results summarized in table 2 snow processes included in hlm snow are essential in representing the march 2019 event using a simple ti snow model hlm snow outperformed hlm nosnow and hlm fsnow nevertheless streamflow comparisons do not prove if the model is accurately estimating the swe therefore we compared the hlm snow simulated swe against the one reported by nsidc we compared the daily nsidc reports between march 3 and march 16 2019 in this period hlm snow accurately estimates the swe oscillations fig 9a this accuracy is evidenced by a kge of 0 93 an nse of 0 87 and a volumetric difference of 1 25 in addition to the temporal comparisons we present spatial differences between both swe products at four dates fig 9b and c dates 1 and 2 compare the initial swe storage and its initial accumulation date 3 compares swe values after the precipitation event of march 9 see fig 9b and swe during the flood event around march 13 date 4 in the four dates hlm snow provides a spatial distribution that follows nsidc however there are some differences between dates 2 and 4 nsidc swe exhibits the more significant accumulations over the west and north while hlm swe accumulations also include the east also we noticed that nsidc swe fields are more heterogeneous than the hlm swe ones we attribute most of these differences to rainfall uncertainties the ti method s simplicity and the use of temperature derived from one weather gauge regardless of the reason the overall performance of hlm snow indicates that capturing the swe total is more relevant than capturing its spatial distribution 3 3 2 iowa we validate further the proposed hlm snow by running it open loop between 2002 and 2020 in this run we used stage iv rainfall and narr surface temperature we measured the model performance by comparing simulated and observed flows at 150 usgs gauges in iowa to calculate the performance we used the kge and δ q p although the run includes an extended period we focus most of our performance analysis on the winter to spring transition and the 2019 event we assessed the model performance using three temporal windows the total length of the simulation 2002 2020 the transition period december to april and march 2019 fig 10 according to the results the transition period performs worse than the total length of the records and the march 2019 event we attribute the transition period performance decrease to larger uncertainties in the radar rainfall during this time of the year and the simplicity of the snow model nevertheless despite the kge reduction the performance is still acceptable for this time of the year we also evaluated the spatial variability of the kge for the three mentioned cases fig 11 the highest performance is observed for the kge computed using the length of the records over iowa s center and east regions fig 11a the winter to spring transition exhibits a similar pattern with an overall decrease in performance fig 11b on the other hand the march 2019 event kge fig 11c has higher values over the central east and the west region coinciding with the maximum recorded peak flows fig 4a the described results highlight to some extent the hlm snow limitations when representing snow related processes however the coincidence between the march 2019 peak flows and the higher kge reveals the model performance to represent snow related high flows in fig 12a and c we present the δ q p and kge obtained during march 2019 versus the ratio of the observed peak flows q max 2019 q max according to it both the δ q p and the kge improve with the magnitude of the event a similar result is observed in the spatial distribution of δ q p fig 12b where most of the gauges with an accurate peak flow estimation are over the west and center of iowa moreover around 60 of the gauges have a δ q p value below 50 fig 12d the results suggest that hlm snow can represent snow related peak flows during the winter to spring transition according to the kge and δ q p the model captures a significant portion of the observed oscillations and the large peaks however we also evidence the model limitations to represent low flows at this time of the year rainfall uncertainty and the snow model simplicity could be the leading causes of these limitations exploring further the development of the model and the variables involved in its performance during this transition period is of significant relevance however that exploratory work is outside the scope of our work 4 discussion this study explores the magnitude of a snow detonated flood event between nebraska and iowa in march 2019 we also assessed the suitability of representing these events using a parsimonious distributed hydrological model according to our results snow detonated events are increasing and likely becoming larger in the coming years if the increasing trend persists the risks of similar events can be devastating costing human lives infrastructure and economic losses however iowa and the surrounding regions have not paid enough attention to these events if we do not model them correctly we will face consequences in planning flood forecasting and food growth aghakouchak et al 2020 shirzaei et al 2021 therefore it is of significant relevance to iowa and to the u s midwest to explore further models and methods to assess snow processes and their interaction with the regional infrastructure and economic needs using a simple temperature index model we showed good flow and swe representations in a region with a relatively simple topography similar results were reported in an italian watershed zaramella et al 2019 here we present how a straightforward approach that uses only temperature can capture the flow and swe oscillations in a region of the u s midwest the u s midwest has historically faced floods during summer however the march 2019 event detonated a historical flood over a significant portion of iowa and nebraska highlighting the relevance of snow detonated events considering its significance we contrast the event s magnitude with iowa s last 20 years records we found that the march 2019 event set historical flows in most of the gauges over the west of the state nevertheless march 2019 was not unique according to our results previous winter to spring events reached maximum flows at some gauges over the north central region of iowa moreover winter to spring transition events seem to increase at around 4 of the mean annual peak flow other authors have reported expected increases in north europe blöschl et al 2017 and the north region of the u s and canada villarini et al 2011 slater et al 2017 jeong sushama 2018 in the nishnabotna watershed we assessed hlm snow by contrasting its performance with the original model hlm nosnow and the model using hrrr snowmelt estimations hlm fsnow we ran hlm snow and hlm nosnow using the same input rainfall however hlm nosnow reported a significant underestimation of the total flow volume suggesting that the infiltration rate loss due to the frozen ground plays a crucial role during snow detonated events quinton et al 2004 suzuki et al 2006 and follum et al 2019 on the other hand hlm fsnow exhibits a significant overestimation of the total flow attributed to a total precipitation excess in hlm fsnow we used liquid rainfall mrms and snow melt estimations hrrr the observed overestimation suggests that using different input sources induces uncertainties and the need for additional steps in their coupled use renard et al 2010 frozen ground and air temperature play a crucial role when representing snow related floods hlm nosnow and hlm fsnow exhibited a double peak signal not present in the observations attributed to two successive rainfall events over the watershed and the lack of a temperature related process able to represent the snowmelt occasioned by the temperature increase shown in fig 1 hlm snow provided an accurate streamflow estimation for the nishnabotna watershed however its swe estimations were more spatially homogeneous than the observations the homogeneity may be attributed to the ti method s simplifications and the use of only one weather station to represent temperatures depending on the temperature the threshold method converts all the precipitation into snow or melts it at a constant rate d an s shaped function can improve this behavior kienzle 2008 other improvements include the hillslopes aspect cazorzi and dalla fontana 1996 zaramella et al 2019 and the combination of the temperature index with simplified radiation balance kustas and rango 1994 cazorzi and dalla fontana 1996 follum et al 2019 we are aware that the described modifications may lead to better results nevertheless hlm snow provided accurate swe totals along with reasonable streamflow estimations the described result follows the results reported by ayalew et al 2014 where the total input and timing are one of the most crucial variables when forecasting floods in addition to the nishnabotna case we evaluated hlm snow for iowa using 18 years of usgs and stage iv records the model exhibited an overall acceptable performance however according to our results hlm snow reduces its kge performance during the winter to spring transition we attribute this reduction to the simplicity of the snow model and the rainfall uncertainties increase during this time of the year smith et al 1996 ciach et al 1996 germann et al 2006 future work may involve the evaluation of more complex snow models ground based rainfall measurements and swe measurements 5 conclusions we tested a simple approach to simulate snow accumulation and melting processes in hlm using a new hlm snow module we checked the ability of the new module to reproduce the runoff generation processes that took place in march 2019 in the nishnabotna river and to simulate the historical observations at iowa in the nishnabotna case we contrasted the results with a module that does not include snow processes and a module that uses snowmelt data as forcing moreover we validated our results by comparing simulated flows with usgs streamflow observations and nsidc swe estimations to emulate a closer case to the ifc operational forecast in the nishnabotna we used mrms rainfall according to our results hlm snow can forecast snow detonated floods we explore further its capability by validating the model performance using stage iv rainfall between 2002 and 2020 the described long term validation also presents promising results however we must perform additional tests to validate the hlm snow forecast performance the results obtained for nishnabotna suggest that the ti model captures the main swe oscillations during snow related floods however we found limitations in representing spatial swe accumulations we attribute those limitations to using one weather station and the simplifications of the ti model we further explore the temperature effect in the long term simulation using narr surface temperature estimations in this case we obtain an acceptable streamflow performance however testing the swe differences in the long term case is still missing and may be performed in future work in this work we present that a ti model can capture the swe and peak flow for the region of iowa however we also

7648,study region urmia lake basin iran study focus an accurate estimation of baseflow provides useful information for various aspects of water resources management baseflow estimation is subject to many uncertainties because it cannot be measured directly this study aims to quantify the influence of uncertainties on the baseflow separation in the urmia lake basin iran herein long term observational data was used to evaluate the stability and reliability of baseflow estimation seven baseflow separation methods were compared with the mass balance filter mbf as a reference method here two indicators including the average annual baseflow coefficient bfc and the baseflow index bfi were used to assess the impact of climate condition on baseflow separation in addition we investigated two sources of uncertainty in the digital filter methods the recession constant α value and the approximation of groundwater recharge new hydrological insights for the region eckhardt s method exhibited a better estimate of the baseflow during both wet and dry years and exhibited acceptable accuracy during peak flows even during multiple events the results of uncertainties among the filter methods revealed that the lynie holick lh algorithm and eckhardt s method were more sensitive to the amount of α moreover eckhardt s method demonstrated a more reliable estimation of the ratio of groundwater recharge to streamflow graphical abstract ga1 keywords baseflow separation electrical conductivity ec mbf method uncertainty evaluation climate condition groundwater recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent decades the water level of urmia lake in iran has decreased and this has been attributed to several factors such as reduced precipitation and increased temperature hosseini moghari et al 2020 sheibani et al 2020 increased water consumption in the agriculture sector owing to the construction of more dams hosseini moghari et al 2020 and the overuse of groundwater resources for irrigation heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 demonstrated that the water level of urmia lake depends on the discharge of groundwater and 70 of the runoff from rivers that drain into the lake is formed from baseflow caused by groundwater discharge baseflow has an important impact on several aspects of water resources management such as water consumption water quality and water flow forecasting thus it is essential to accurately estimate the baseflow of rivers in the basin kissel and schmalz 2020 baseflow separation methods can be classified into two categories including non tracer and tracer methods non tracer methods are divided into graphical and filter methods hagedorn 2020 lott and stewart 2016 rammal et al 2018 xie et al 2020 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 and tracer based approaches are generally recognized as the most objective baseflow separation method as they consider actual physical and chemical processes that occur in the watershed yang et al 2021 tracer methods are widely utilized as a reference to analyse and compare other baseflow separation methods or to calibrate the parameter of other methods lott and stewart 2013 lott and stewart 2016 saraiva okello et al 2018 stewart et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 however this approach relies on the assumption that solute sources can be reliably identified which is challenging hagedorn 2020 expensive and labour intensive kissel and schmalz 2020 xie et al 2020 as electrical conductivity ec is a natural geochemical tracer and streamflow conductivity measurements are available it can be used to estimate the baseflow fraction of total flow kissel and schmalz 2020 stewart et al 2007 yang et al 2021 non tracer methods comprise graphical and filter methods which rely solely on streamflow data eckhardt 2008 lyu et al 2020 nathan and mcmahon 1990 in graphical methods the baseflow is calculated by determining the minimum streamflow points within the hydrograph and connecting them duncan 2019 eckhardt 2008 sloto and crouse 1996 stewart et al 2007 however despite the ease of use these methods to separate baseflow at most stations these methods often do not reflect natural baseflow transport yang et al 2021 are unsuitable for automation and are susceptible to subjective interpretations chapman 1999 furey and gupta 2001 additionally they do not rely on hydrological basin characteristics arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2008 furey and gupta 2001 huyck et al 2005 lyu et al 2020 nathan and mcmahon 1990 the digital filter methods have emerged as the most commonly used methods for estimating baseflow in recent years digital filter methods estimate the baseflow using signal analysis under the assumption that baseflow is the low frequency component of streamflow chapman 1991 eckhardt 2005 furey and gupta 2001 huyck et al 2005 lin et al 2007 lyne and hollick 1979 tularam and ilahee 2007 xie et al 2020 the first digital filter technique was proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 after which chapman 1991 eckhardt 2005 and tularam and ilahee 2008 have proposed various algorithm formulations xie et al 2020 eckhardt s method is the most commonly used method among various digital filtering methods owing to its satisfactory performance in a variety of catchments its ease of usage guzmán et al 2015 hagedorn 2020 li et al 2014 xie et al 2020 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 and its enhanced reflection of groundwater recharge rate compared to other methods xie et al 2020 this method requires the determination of a two parameter recursive filtering algorithm and several studies have reported that uncertainties can be more effectively reduced by calibrating these parameters with another separation method such as the mass balance filter mbf method as a reference lott and stewart 2016 rammal et al 2018 saraiva okello et al 2018 yang et al 2021 according to mbf method the chemical characteristics of baseflow are different from those of surface runoff due to their different flow paths and based on the concentration of each component the total streamflow can be divided into different components mbf relies on basin specific physical processes responses that are recorded and stored in the relevant monitoring datasets moreover there is considerable support for the mbf method especially when investigating systems with large nonlinear complex connectivity and threshold dominated processes driven or influenced by climatic conditions stewart 2015 cuomo and guida 2016 as baseflow cannot be directly measured previous studies have compared the performance of various baseflow separation methods using indicators such as baseflow index bfi which refers to the ratio of the total daily baseflow to the total daily streamflow or using a tracer method nathan and mcmahon 1990 examined the differences between the lh digital filter method and the graphic method in relation to estimating bfi and they found the performance of lh digital filter method is better chapman 1999 used 11 basins to compare three digital filter methods concluding that the two parameter method provides a smooth baseflow peak and is more realistic than the one parameter or three parameter methods the quantitative nature of these evaluations seems to be more reasonable however these methods have noticeable limitations in terms of baseflow estimation digital filter methods have their uncertainties in baseflow separation due to the sensitivity of two parameters according to the aforementioned description this study in addition to comparing different methods of baseflow separation attempts to investigate the uncertainties of baseflow separation with special emphasis on the role of climatic factors and groundwater resources because investigating the parameters in digital filter methods that cause uncertainties in baseflow separation can be a useful approach to increase the accuracy of the methods used for baseflow separation in summary the purposes of this research are to 1 evaluate the stability and reliability of baseflow separation using the mbf method in terms of different catchment characteristics 2 assess the influence of climate conditions on baseflow separation during wet and dry years and 3 investigate two main sources of uncertainty related to the digital filter methods including the recession constant α value and the approximation of groundwater recharge 2 study area and data used the urmia lake basin located in northeast of iran has a land area of 51 876 km2 which the urmia lake occupying 10 of its total area in this basin a total of 17 permanent rivers and 12 seasonal rivers flow into the urmia lake it is characterized by a semi arid and dry cold climate with a mean annual rainfall value of 359 1 mm a minimum temperature of 4 3 c maximum temperature of 17 7 c and an average streamflow of 18 2 m3 s heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 this study considered the observation data of long term daily streamflow from 14 hydrometric stations annual rainfall data from 12 rain gauge stations and long term monthly ec from 12 stations these data were obtained from the two websites of the iran water resources management company https www wrm ir and https stu wrm ir login asp fig 1 shows the location of stations in the study area and table 1 provides more specific information about the stations including data period average streamflow and rainfall the 14 hydrometric stations were selected based on two conditions less human intervention and a long data period with high accuracy the information about human intervention including water harvesting dam building irrigation and land use change was collected from iran water resources management company https www wrm ir station 14 sarighmish station was only used to determine the performance of the filter methods for estimating the rate of groundwater recharge to quick flow since there are no upstream rain gauges for stations 11 bardesoor station and 12 arbakpol station so we considered the rainfall data from the nearest rain gauge station rain gauge stations j and k for hydrometric stations 11 and 12 respectively typically at each hydrometric station chemical parameters such as ec are measured in the urmia lake basin in iran the ec is measured several times each month but the ec is not measured in seasonal rivers when the streamflow is low therefore in this study we calculated the monthly ec by averaging the observational data collected throughout the month the observation ec data were used for each of the selected hydrometric stations but for stations 8 and 9 which are located close to each other on the same river observation ec data from station ec1 were utilized in the case of station 6 ec data from the upstream station named station ec2 was used in this study 3 methodology 3 1 baseflow separation methods in this study three graphical methods from the hydrograph separation program hysep and four digital filter methods were employed for the baseflow separation as a function of the streamflow moreover microsoft excel python and matlab platform were used for data analysis and result visualization the detailed information is summarized below 3 1 1 graphical methods the hysep method was introduced by sloto and crouse 1996 and it consists of three methods fixed interval method sliding interval method and local minimum method based on a streamflow hydrograph these methods can identify specific low flow points and then connect them as a baseflow line however the algorithms select the low flow points differently first the number of days it takes for runoff to ceases is determined through an empirical equation and then the minimum value of that point is assigned to all days of the interval period xie et al 2020 1 n a 0 2 where a is the area of the basin km 2 in the fixed interval method the lowest discharge at every interval n is assigned to all days in the interval the sliding interval method determines the lowest discharge in half of the interval minus one day 0 5 2n 1 days before and after the day selected and assigns it to that day the local minimum method checks each day to determine if it is the lowest discharge in 0 5 2n 1 days before and after the considered day if this requirement is met the discharge value for that day is referred to as a local minimum and it is linked to other local minimum values hosseini duki et al 2017 shao et al 2020 xie et al 2020 3 1 2 digital filter methods this study utilized four digital filter methods the lynie holick algorithm lyne and hollick 1979 the chapman algorithm chapman 1991 the eckhardt filter eckhardt 2005 and the exponentially weighted moving average filter ewma tularam and ilahee 2008 table 2 provides the detailed equations of the utilized digital filter methods for baseflow separation the recession constant α should be estimated for all the methods and the maximum value among the ratio of baseflow to streamflow bfi max should be determined in the eckhardt method to calculate α this study considered the average value from three different methods a master recession curve rimmer and hartmann 2014 a correlation method eckhardt 2008 and the mean value of the ratio q t 1 to q t rimmer and hartmann 2014 rimmer and hartmann 2014 employed a master recession curve based on the daily streamflow of several dry seasons which overlapped during the recession period from may to september days 121 250 of the year in this study the master recession curve was derived by averaging the flow during all seasons and α was calculate using the exponent that best fits the recession equation subsequently α was determined as the exponential of k eq 7 by obtaining coefficient k from eq 6 rimmer and hartmann 2014 6 q t q 0 exp k t t t 0 where q 0 is the streamflow in the first day t 0 of the recession period t t is the time day and k is the slope of fitting the recession curve in this study we utilized the streamflow data of all stations from 2015 to 2019 to calculate α by creating a master recession curve rimmer and hartmann 2014 7 α exp k the correlation method which is the second method employed in this study to calculate α was proposed by eckhardt 2008 this method considers a scatter plot of daily streamflow q t 1 against q t during a recession period of at least five days during the data period all points should lie on a line through the origin with slope α in this study α was calculated using this method by analysing the time series from 2008 to 2019 eckhardt 2008 8 q t 3 q t 2 q t 1 q t q t 1 q t 2 9 q t 1 α q t the third method used to calculate α in this study involved the calculation of the daily ratio of q t 1 q t during recession days using a time series of daily streamflow from 2015 to 2019 and the mean value of the statistically analyzed ratio was considered as α according to eckhardt 2008 the bfi max values for perennial streams with porous aquifers ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and perennial streams with hard rock aquifers are 0 8 0 5 and 0 25 respectively however gonzales et al 2009 and lim et al 2010 found that the optimal bfi max values might be entirely different from those proposed by eckhardt 2005 collischonn and fan 2013 proposed a backward filter method for calculating bfi max this method is an algorithm that iterates in the reverse direction by dividing the baseflow in the next time step with the α parameter eq 10 to obtain the maximum daily baseflow after which the sum can be divided by the total streamflow to obtain the bfi max eq 11 collischonn and fan 2013 however there is a restriction in every time step where b t 1 q t 1 and at the end with a recession in time step t where b t q t 10 b t 1 b t α b t 1 q t 1 and b t q t 11 bfi max 1 t b t 1 t q t 3 2 stability and reliability of baseflow separation the performance of the baseflow separation methods in the urmia lake basin was evaluated using three different approaches first the estimated baseflow was directly compared to that estimated by mbf method further temporal variations in bfc and bfi were investigated in the observation data between wet and dry years the impact of changes in the α and bfi values on the baseflow was further analysed to quantify uncertainties in the filter methods in addition the ability of the filter methods to consider the rate of groundwater recharge on quick flow was assessed the methodology and the detailed information was summarized in fig 2 3 2 1 mass balance filter mbf the mbf method is represented in eq 12 in which streamflow and tracer data are used to separate flow components and ec was considered as the tracer to calculate the baseflow in each station ec runoff and ec baseflow in the equation correspond to the ec values of the runoff and baseflow components respectively which are assumed to be constant variables during the period and must be determined stewart et al 2007 suggested that ec baseflow and ec runoff can be estimated during periods of extreme low and high flow respectively accordingly ec baseflow was derived by analyzing streamflow conductivity values during extreme low flow periods in which the streamflow was assumed to be the entire baseflow ec runoff was determined by analyzing streamflow conductivity values at hydrograph peaks during periods of high flow where runoff contributes a high percentage of streamflow stewart et al 2007 12 q ba seflow t q streamflow t ec t ec runoff ec baseflow ec runoff in eq 12 q streamflow t and ec t are the streamflow and conductivity of the streamflow at time t respectively the long term monthly observation ec data and streamflow at each station were evaluated to identify the appropriate period for the estimation of ec baseflow and ec runoff in the urmia lake basin then the monthly baseflow was calculated using eq 12 for the 2017 2018 water year here the accuracy of the baseflow separation methods was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse taylor skill source ts and modified kling gupta efficiency as follows kge kling et al 2012 knoben et al 2019 xie et al 2020 13 rmse t 1 n q m t q o t 2 n where q o t is the baseflow estimated by the mbf method at date t q m t is the baseflow estimated by a baseflow separation method at date t and n is the number of monthly data 14 ts 4 1 r 2 σ 0 σ m σ m σ 0 2 1 r 0 2 where σ m and σ 0 are the standard deviation of the baseflow separation methods and mbf method respectively r is the spatial correlation coefficient between baseflow separation methods and the mbf method r 0 represents the highest possible correlation coefficient this study used 0 999 therefore score 1 shows a perfect match between baseflow separation methods and the mbf method and score 0 shows an inverse method performance knoben et al 2019 xie et al 2020 in this study we used a slightly modified version of the kge statistic kling et al 2012 to measure agreement between the baseflow separation methods and mbf method as follows 15 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 β μ s μ o γ σ s μ s σ o μ o where kge represents the modified kge statistic β shows the bias ratio γ is the variability ratio σ s and σ 0 are the standard deviation of the baseflow separation methods and mbf method respectively and μ s and μ o are the mean value of the baseflow estimated by seven baseflow separation methods and the mbf method respectively r is the correlation between the mbf method and baseflow separation methods kge ranges from to 1 which a value of 1 is considered a perfect match between baseflow separation methods and mbf method 3 2 2 temporal variations in bfc and bfi between wet and dry years the impact of climate conditions on baseflow separation in wet and dry years was evaluated using two indicators bfc and bfi the bfc is the ratio of mean annual baseflow to rainfall eq 16 and the bfi is the ratio of the total daily baseflow to the total daily streamflow eq 17 rumsey et al 2020 for each dry and wet year bfi and bfc were calculated and the mean value of these indicators in wet and dry years was compared for each method wang and wu 2013 utilized bfc as an index to demonstrate the impact of climatic factors on baseflow cheng et al 2021 suggested that this ratio is controlled by the aridity index and storage capacity in this study we utilized this index to evaluate the effect of climate factors on the performance of baseflow separation methods wang and wu 2013 rumsey et al 2020 16 bfc mean annual q b p 17 bfi mean daily q b mean daily q t standardized precipitation index spi was used to determine the dry and wet years spi describes the real rainfall as a standard deviation from its probability distribution a negative value was considered a dry year and a positive value a wet year in order to calculate the deviation from normal rainfall we used the following equation naresh kumar et al 2009 18 rainfall division actual rainfall normal rainfall normal rainfall 100 19 normalized value x x sd normal rainfall indicates the normalized average monthly precipitation using the eq 19 which x represents sum of monthly data x is average of monthly data and sd describes standard deviation additionally the performance of the baseflow separation methods were compared during peak flow particularly after multiple events had occurred the baseflow estimation results from station 4 were used during the 2017 2018 water year 3 2 3 uncertainties related to digital filter methods xie et al 2020 reported two uncertainty sources in the filter methods the first uncertainty is the estimation of the recession constant α filter methods consider α a linear reservoir assumption that is static in time however according to previous studies the relationship between baseflow and groundwater storage is non linear and should vary over time because of changes in soil moisture xie et al 2020 in this study we evaluated the relationship between uncertainty in the baseflow estimation of the filter methods and the α value using sensitivity analysis to this end we selected station 3 for the sensitivity analysis of the α value for the 2018 2019 water year as it is located on a permanent river zarinerood river with high streamflow that is less affected by human activities see fig 1 we changed α value from 0 80 to 0 98 at a step of 0 2 the second uncertainty is that the ratio of groundwater recharge to quick flow in filter methods remains constant over time the eckhardt s method exhibited a more reasonable performance than the other filter methods because it considers this ratio as the average ratio of groundwater recharge to streamflow bfi max 1 bfi max xie et al 2020 to investigate this uncertainty stations 14 and 4 were selected as both were located on the same permanent river and exhibit almost the same climate conditions the over five year average streamflow and rainfall for station 14 were 36 9 m3 s and 325 3 mm respectively and those for station 4 were 24 8 m3 s and 259 5 mm respectively the difference in the values of these two stations could be attributed to the presence of the miandoab aquifer around station 4 which creates a drop of approximately 0 08 m fig 1 and this is considered an important factor for demonstrating the relationship between groundwater sources and baseflow for stations 14 and 4 the bfi and bfc were calculated annually from 2010 to 2018 4 results 4 1 parameter estimation for the baseflow separation methods parameters n and α were estimated to apply in the graphical and filter methods respectively and bfi max was estimated to apply in the eckhardt s method at each station the calculated values are shown in table 3 for the overland flow duration n days stations 2 7 and 11 with basin covered areas of 263 415 and 182 km 2 respectively exhibited the lowest estimated value of 3 days whereas stations 1 and 4 with basin covered areas of 5635 and 11 963 km 2 respectively exhibited the highest values of 6 and 7 days in addition station 12 represented the lowest α with the value of 0 768 and the highest value in station 13 with 0 96 further station 12 exhibited the lowest bfi max with the value of 0 43 4 2 comparison results of the baseflow separation to that of the mbf method we analyzed the observation data from 13 stations with long term records of streamflow and ec to determine whether there is a relationship between the streamflow and ec in the urmia lake basin during wet and dry months fig 3 shows the long term average monthly observation of ec and streamflow for each station within the urmia lake basin among the 13 stations nine had more than 13 years of observational ec and streamflow data four stations had between eight and 10 years and only one station e g station 2 had three years eight stations had missing data for year 2015 the analysis results revealed that station 1 exhibited significantly higher ec values than other stations with minimum and maximum ec values of 8033 and 120 900 μs cm 1 respectively in addition the average ec values of station 2 were lower than those of the other stations in which the minimum and the maximum ec were 104 5 μs cm 1 and 298 μs cm 1 respectively generally the minimum and maximum ec of the other stations were 215 36 and 885 μs cm 1 respectively fig 3 illustrates the inverse relationship between the ec and streamflow rate during dry and wet months in april and may the streamflow values at all stations were higher than the annual average whereas the ec value was lower than the annual average additionally from september to january the amount of ec exceeded the annual average in more than 10 stations whereas the flow value was lower than the annual average fig 4 shows the monthly observation ec and streamflow data at station 3 from 2002 to 2015 to illustrate the relationship between ec and streamflow during the wet and dry months there were missing data in some months during the data period the amount of monthly streamflow from march to may was higher than the mean annual streamflow and that from november to february was lower than the mean annual streamflow in addition the ec values during the wet months ranged from 193 89 to 309 33 μs cm 1 and those during the dry months ranged from 262 to 425 μs cm 1 these results confirmed the inverse relationship between streamflow and ec the ec values were lower during the wet months than the dry months fig 4 and the results of the analysis of ec data for each station indicated that november to february is a suitable period for determining the ec baseflow and the peak flow in spring suitable for measuring the ec runoff the lowest ec during the wet months and the highest ec during the dry months were considered as the ec runoff and ec baseflow respectively table 4 presents the estimated ec baseflow and ec runoff at each station from 2017 to 2018 period fig 5 compares the results of different baseflow separation methods with mbf method for the period of 2017 2018 as can be seen from fig 5 the median line in 10 stations were located inside the box of the mbf indicating that there should be no significant difference between all methods however the median line of the chapman method was slightly closer to the middle of that of the mbf method and the box length of the chapman method was shorter than those of other methods indicating that the data were less dispersed the following results were derived from the subjective comparison of fig 5 first among all stations the mbf method exhibited high stability and followed the distribution of streamflow which was not symmetrical and was oriented toward the peak flow in addition the filter methods generally exhibited greater stability than the graphical methods moreover the local method did not follow this distribution at stations 1 4 and 6 second the fixed and sliding methods exhibited a similar pattern for the estimation of the baseflow in 10 stations and the local method obtained the same estimation in five stations the local method estimated the baseflow to a greater degree than the streamflow in some stations such as stations 3 7 and 9 last among the filter methods the median lines of the chapman method and the lh method were closer to that of the mbf method the ewma method estimated the amount of baseflow close to the amount of streamflow at all stations in addition there was a close match between the median line of the eckhardt method and that of the mbf method at station 12 and its boxes were shorter than those at other stations indicating a lower level of dispersion fig 6 illustrates the evaluation results of the baseflow separation methods with the mbf method as the reference method for the 13 stations the median values for the lh chapman eckhardt ewma local fixed and sliding methods were 3 8 1 8 4 4 4 7 3 3 3 7 and 3 7 using rmse method were 0 26 0 49 0 33 0 17 0 30 0 26 and 0 24 using ts method and were 0 9 0 1 0 8 1 8 0 4 0 9 and 1 3 using kge method respectively these results indicated that the chapman and local methods performed better the fixed and sliding methods exhibited almost similar performances and the rmse values for the graphical methods were generally lower than those for the filter methods e g lh eckhardt and ewma methods 4 3 influence of climate factors on baseflow separation we determined the effects of climatic factors on the performance of the baseflow separation methods using bfc and bfi values during wet and dry years at different stations the results are shown in fig 7 in both wet and dry years there was no significant change in the bfc value the ratio of baseflow to rainfall it is worth noting that the ewma and chapman methods exhibited the highest and lowest bfc respectively the values of the bfc index in fixed sliding and lh methods were almost similar in all stations after the ewma method the eckhardt s method exhibited the highest bfc value in all stations except station 8 in addition the local method represented the lowest bfc index after the chapman method even though stations 4 5 and 6 had almost the same values as in the chapman method for the ewma method bfc and bfi exhibited similar patterns in wet and dry years and the values of the bfi were higher than those of other methods the average bfi values for the ewma method were between 98 5 and 99 7 in dry years and 66 4 and 99 7 in wet years moreover the average values of the bfi for the chapman method were between 42 8 and 49 9 in dry years and 31 7 and 49 6 in wet years in both wet and dry years the average values of the bfi for the chapman method were lower than those for other baseflow separation methods at 10 stations the eckhardt method exhibited the second highest bfi results in nine stations its bfi values were lower than those of other methods for stations 6 and 12 additionally the performance of the eckhardt s method differed from those of other methods in stations 8 and 9 these stations are located on the same river since station 8 is upstream and exhibited a higher bfc it was also expected to exhibit a higher bfi but eckhardt s method estimated a lower bfi in station 8 compared to station 9 there was a strong relationship between changes in the values of bfi and bfc in both fixed and sliding methods stations with a high bfc value exhibited a high bfi value and vice versa the fixed method exhibited a lower bfi value than the sliding method however their results were almost equal at five stations generally the bfi value was lower in wet years compared to dry years in both methods fig 8 shows the performance of the baseflow separation methods at station 4 in the dry year of 2016 2017 and in the wet year of 2017 2018 the chapman and lh methods estimated the baseflow at a time lag peak flow which was longer during the wet year in addition eckhardt s method exhibited a better performance during peak flow in both wet and dry years for the graphical methods the sliding method exhibited a better performance although it did not follow the peak flow trend in the wet year additionally the local method did not provide an accurate estimate of the baseflow at the peak flow in the wet year and it provided an estimate of the lowest amount of baseflow during the dry year 4 4 uncertainties evaluation of the digital filter methods table 5 and fig 9 show the effects of a change in the α value from 0 8 to 0 98 on the bfi value in filter methods in the lh method an increase in the α value from 0 8 to 0 92 resulted in a decrease in the bfi value from 0 878 to 0 808 in addition a further increase in the α value from 0 94 to 0 98 resulted in an even more significant reduction from 0 778 to 0 621 and the lh method did not provide an accurate estimation of the baseflow during peak events in contrast the chapman method was less sensitive to an increase in the α value for example the bfi value remains constant 0 490 for the α value from 0 8 to 0 92 however a further increase in the α value from 0 94 to 0 98 resulted in a decrease in the bfi value from 0 49 to 0 43 it is noteworthy that the chapman method did not provide an accurate estimation of baseflow during peak flow for the eckhardt s method the value of the bfi max parameter for the baseflow calculation was determined for each α compared to other methods the eckhardt s method was more sensitive to changes in the α value also the bfi value decreased from 0 98 to 0 023 with an increase in the α value from 0 8 to 0 98 it is noticeable that the eckhardt s method provided accurate estimates of the baseflow from an α value of 0 8 0 92 particularly during peak flow compared to the other filter methods the ewma method demonstrated a direct relationship between the bfi value and the α therefore increasing the α value from 0 8 to 0 98 increased the bfi from 0 983 to 0 998 the second uncertainty relates to the amount of approximated groundwater recharge in the digital filter methods table 6 shows the statistical result of the performance of the digital filter methods at stations 4 and 14 from 2010 to 2017 the mean bfc index values for the lh chapman eckhardt and ewma methods were 34 4 22 16 5 and 48 5 respectively at station 14 and 17 4 11 7 19 7 and 25 respectively at station 4 at both stations the bfi estimations by the lh chapman and ewma methods were similar whereas the eckhardt s method exhibited a completely different result bfi of 34 and 78 at stations 14 and 4 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the baseflow separation using the mbf method for this study long term monthly observation ec and streamflow data were obtained from 13 stations to estimate the ec baseflow and ec runoff for the mbf method an ec analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between ec and streamflow in dry and wet months lyu et al 2020 analyzed the response of the conductivity to streamflow in 201 stations located throughout the major mississippi river basin they demonstrated that there was an inverse relationship between the streamflow discharge and conductivity with the correlation being influenced by a number of factors including topography altitude stream discharge and location in addition they found that sites with an inverse relationship between conductivity and streamflow were more likely to be located along tributaries than on mainstems in this study the ec analyses revealed that there was an inverse relationship between the ec and streamflow based on results of the ec analysis in this study and the results of previous studies this hypothesis can be considered valid thereby the amount of ec baseflow and ec runoff can be determined in dry and wet seasons respectively in the urmia lake basin may march and april are considered the wet months and september to january are considered the dry months thus these are the ideal months to determine ec baseflow and ec runoff owing to the limitations in measuring the amount of daily ec the results indicated that the monthly ec can be utilized to calculate the baseflow using the mbf method kissel and schmalz 2020 also demonstrated that weekly ec results like daily continuous ec results can be used to estimate baseflow using the mbf method additionally saraiva okello et al 2018 employed weekly and monthly ec data from four stations to estimate the catchment baseflow in south africa using the tracer method as a reference the results of the baseflow estimation by the mbf method in all stations demonstrated the stability and reliability of this method as a reference for evaluating baseflow separation methods or calibrating their parameters this result is consistent with the results previous studies lott and stewart 2013 lott and stewart 2016 saraiva okello et al 2018 stewart et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 the evaluation of the performance of the baseflow separation methods using the mbf method revealed that the chapman method exhibited the best performance as its rmse and kge were lower than those of other methods and its ts was higher than those of other methods chapman method s statistical parameters were similar to those of the mbf method at all stations the baseflow estimated by the ewma method was between 95 and 99 of streamflow at all stations and it exhibited higher rmse and kge values and lower ts value hosseini duki et al 2017 evaluated the performance of the baseflow separation methods in the gorganrood basin in iran and found that the ewma method overestimated the baseflows by a significant margin almost equal to the flow rate and thus could not be used to calculate baseflow within the study area which is consistent with the results obtained for the urmia lake basin the eckhardt method exhibited a higher rmse and kge than the chapman method and the local method shows a lower ts value than the chapman method fig 6 although the comparison of its performance in different stations indicated its high stability fig 5 as can be seen from the fig 5 the eckhardt s method exhibited a better performance at station 12 where the bfi max value 0 43 was lower than at other stations table 3 which ranged from 0 69 to 0 97 the high rmse and kge values for this method could be attributed to the inaccurate estimation of the bfi max parameter previous studies lott and stewart 2016 rammal et al 2018 saraiva okello et al 2018 yang et al 2021 have concluded that the bfi max parameter value can be calibrated to improve the performance of the eckhardt method xie et al 2020 evaluated the accuracy of baseflow estimation methods by comparing them to a reference baseflow method and calculating their nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values the local method exhibited a lower nse than other methods and they attributed this to the use of 2 n as the sliding window interval to traverse the entire period of the streamflow while using the local method thus the overestimation of n results in more baseflow that cannot be separated which results in a lower nse in this study we obtained the same result and the local method exhibited lower rmse and kge values at some stations the local method overestimated the baseflow this weakness of the local method has been reported by hosseini duki et al 2017 other graphical methods such as the fixed and sliding methods exhibited a similar baseflow estimation pattern at 10 stations and the local method exhibited the same estimation pattern at 5 stations which could be attributed to the poor estimation of the parameter n xie et al 2020 5 2 baseflow separation during wet and dry years during wet years climatic factors exhibited a more significant effect on the performance of the ewma method particularly at stations 5 and 12 in contrast climatic factors did not significantly affect the bfi values of the chapman method in stations with different characteristics its performance during peak flow had a lag time particularly during wet years and this was also for the lh method in both wet and dry years the bfcs and bfis of the lh method indicated that it is controlled by climate conditions as the bfi and bfc exhibited similar trends the eckhardt s method exhibited the best performance during peak flow in both wet and dry years this method exhibited satisfactory performance in connection with climatic conditions such that the bfi value changed with a change in the bfc value in addition its performance exhibited a high level of reliability accordingly in both dry and wet years the bfi values for stations 6 and 12 were lower than those of other methods an additional feature of this method is its bfi estimate at stations 8 and station 9 these stations are located on the same river station 8 is upstream and exhibited a higher bfc so it is expected to also exhibit a higher bfi however compared to other methods the bfi value estimated by the eckhardt s method for station 8 was lower than that for station 9 the estimated α and bfi max were 0 93 and 0 743 for station 8 and were 0 887 and 0 954 for station 9 respectively these results indicated that the performance of the eckhartd s method was highly dependent on estimated α and bfimax parameters the fixed and sliding methods exhibited similar performance even under different climate conditions in the local method the trends in the bfi value were similar in wet and dry years but this method estimated a lower bfi value in wet years than in dry years in other words in dry years the local method assumed that baseflow is influenced by climatic conditions when it is rather largely influenced by groundwater resources in addition graphical methods did not perform well in peak flow particularly when two events occurred consecutively 5 3 the digital filter methods uncertainties this study evaluated two sources of uncertainty in the filtering methods first there was uncertainty associated with the value of the α parameter on the estimated baseflow sensitivity analysis of the α parameter was conducted at station 3 and the results revealed that the eckhardt and lh methods exhibited the highest sensitivity to the α value whereas chapman and ewma methods exhibited the lowest sensitivity compared to other filtering methods the ewma method demonstrated a direct relationship between the bfi and the α based on the ewma equation table 2 baseflow and α are linearly related so the baseflow increased with an increase in α the α value was obtained by averaging the values obtained from three different methods a recession curve a correlation method and the mean value of the ratio q t 1 to q t the α value at station 3 was determined to be 0 92 the sensitivity analysis revealed that all the filter methods did not accurately estimate baseflow with α values of above 0 92 this study found that averaging the result of the three methods gave a reasonable estimate for α the second uncertainty was the determination of groundwater recharge ratios using the filter methods to evaluate this uncertainty we compared the performance of the filter methods at stations 4 and 14 these two stations differ by the presence of an aquifer around station 4 which is considered an important factor for demonstrating the relationship between groundwater resources and baseflow here the bfi obtained for station 4 was expected to be higher than that for station 14 among the methods employed in this study only the eckhardt s method calculated the bfi differently the bfi values calculated by the lh chapman and ewma methods revealed that the groundwater recharge rate in these methods was constant the bfi values calculated by the eckhardt s method at stations 14 and 4 were 34 and 78 respectively indicating that this method was more reliable for determining the rate of groundwater recharge on quick flow 6 conclusion this study evaluated seven baseflow separation methods three graphical methods and four digital filter methods and utilized long term observation of daily streamflow data annual rainfall and monthly ec data in addition we used the mbf method as a reference method to evaluate other methods the ec baseflow and ec runoff parameters were estimated to apply the mbf method and the analysis of the long term monthly observation ec data revealed that march april and may are appropriate times to measure ec runoff and september to january are the appropriate times to measure ec baseflow further we utilized the monthly measurement of the ec to calculate the monthly baseflow using the mbf method the results obtained from different stations revealed that the mbf method can be used as a reference for calibrating the parameters of the other baseflow separation methods in the urmia lake basin the chapman method exhibited the best performance as it exhibited the lowest rmse and kge values among the methods however its performance was not satisfactory in response to climatic factors as well as in stations with different characteristics further sensitivity analysis of the α parameter revealed that averaging the three methods including a recession curve a correlation method and the mean value of the ratio q t 1 to q t provided a reasonable estimate for α the eckhardt s method exhibited high stability in different stations and performed well in both wet and dry years and exhibited high accuracy during peak flows even when there were multiple events generally this method was sensitive to value of the α parameter as well as to the characteristics of the basin in addition this method was able to determine the groundwater recharge rate more accurately than other filter methods and obtained a more reasonable value thus we strongly recommend our framework of methodology for baseflow estimation under uncertain conditions in this study we have collected a lot of observation data in the urmia lake basin for investigating the use of several methods with uncertain sources but it can be considered in other basins without any limitations under the same or similar conditions moreover this work can be extended by investigating the performance of filter methods particularly the eckhardt s method calibrating their parameters using hydrological and basin characteristics and groundwater recharge rates at stations and basins with different climatic characteristics to establish a reasonable groundwater recharge rate credit authorship contribution statement roya narimani conceptualization methodology data curation software investigation writing original revised draft

7648,study region urmia lake basin iran study focus an accurate estimation of baseflow provides useful information for various aspects of water resources management baseflow estimation is subject to many uncertainties because it cannot be measured directly this study aims to quantify the influence of uncertainties on the baseflow separation in the urmia lake basin iran herein long term observational data was used to evaluate the stability and reliability of baseflow estimation seven baseflow separation methods were compared with the mass balance filter mbf as a reference method here two indicators including the average annual baseflow coefficient bfc and the baseflow index bfi were used to assess the impact of climate condition on baseflow separation in addition we investigated two sources of uncertainty in the digital filter methods the recession constant α value and the approximation of groundwater recharge new hydrological insights for the region eckhardt s method exhibited a better estimate of the baseflow during both wet and dry years and exhibited acceptable accuracy during peak flows even during multiple events the results of uncertainties among the filter methods revealed that the lynie holick lh algorithm and eckhardt s method were more sensitive to the amount of α moreover eckhardt s method demonstrated a more reliable estimation of the ratio of groundwater recharge to streamflow graphical abstract ga1 keywords baseflow separation electrical conductivity ec mbf method uncertainty evaluation climate condition groundwater recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in recent decades the water level of urmia lake in iran has decreased and this has been attributed to several factors such as reduced precipitation and increased temperature hosseini moghari et al 2020 sheibani et al 2020 increased water consumption in the agriculture sector owing to the construction of more dams hosseini moghari et al 2020 and the overuse of groundwater resources for irrigation heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 demonstrated that the water level of urmia lake depends on the discharge of groundwater and 70 of the runoff from rivers that drain into the lake is formed from baseflow caused by groundwater discharge baseflow has an important impact on several aspects of water resources management such as water consumption water quality and water flow forecasting thus it is essential to accurately estimate the baseflow of rivers in the basin kissel and schmalz 2020 baseflow separation methods can be classified into two categories including non tracer and tracer methods non tracer methods are divided into graphical and filter methods hagedorn 2020 lott and stewart 2016 rammal et al 2018 xie et al 2020 yang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 and tracer based approaches are generally recognized as the most objective baseflow separation method as they consider actual physical and chemical processes that occur in the watershed yang et al 2021 tracer methods are widely utilized as a reference to analyse and compare other baseflow separation methods or to calibrate the parameter of other methods lott and stewart 2013 lott and stewart 2016 saraiva okello et al 2018 stewart et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 however this approach relies on the assumption that solute sources can be reliably identified which is challenging hagedorn 2020 expensive and labour intensive kissel and schmalz 2020 xie et al 2020 as electrical conductivity ec is a natural geochemical tracer and streamflow conductivity measurements are available it can be used to estimate the baseflow fraction of total flow kissel and schmalz 2020 stewart et al 2007 yang et al 2021 non tracer methods comprise graphical and filter methods which rely solely on streamflow data eckhardt 2008 lyu et al 2020 nathan and mcmahon 1990 in graphical methods the baseflow is calculated by determining the minimum streamflow points within the hydrograph and connecting them duncan 2019 eckhardt 2008 sloto and crouse 1996 stewart et al 2007 however despite the ease of use these methods to separate baseflow at most stations these methods often do not reflect natural baseflow transport yang et al 2021 are unsuitable for automation and are susceptible to subjective interpretations chapman 1999 furey and gupta 2001 additionally they do not rely on hydrological basin characteristics arnold and allen 1999 eckhardt 2008 furey and gupta 2001 huyck et al 2005 lyu et al 2020 nathan and mcmahon 1990 the digital filter methods have emerged as the most commonly used methods for estimating baseflow in recent years digital filter methods estimate the baseflow using signal analysis under the assumption that baseflow is the low frequency component of streamflow chapman 1991 eckhardt 2005 furey and gupta 2001 huyck et al 2005 lin et al 2007 lyne and hollick 1979 tularam and ilahee 2007 xie et al 2020 the first digital filter technique was proposed by lyne and hollick 1979 after which chapman 1991 eckhardt 2005 and tularam and ilahee 2008 have proposed various algorithm formulations xie et al 2020 eckhardt s method is the most commonly used method among various digital filtering methods owing to its satisfactory performance in a variety of catchments its ease of usage guzmán et al 2015 hagedorn 2020 li et al 2014 xie et al 2020 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 and its enhanced reflection of groundwater recharge rate compared to other methods xie et al 2020 this method requires the determination of a two parameter recursive filtering algorithm and several studies have reported that uncertainties can be more effectively reduced by calibrating these parameters with another separation method such as the mass balance filter mbf method as a reference lott and stewart 2016 rammal et al 2018 saraiva okello et al 2018 yang et al 2021 according to mbf method the chemical characteristics of baseflow are different from those of surface runoff due to their different flow paths and based on the concentration of each component the total streamflow can be divided into different components mbf relies on basin specific physical processes responses that are recorded and stored in the relevant monitoring datasets moreover there is considerable support for the mbf method especially when investigating systems with large nonlinear complex connectivity and threshold dominated processes driven or influenced by climatic conditions stewart 2015 cuomo and guida 2016 as baseflow cannot be directly measured previous studies have compared the performance of various baseflow separation methods using indicators such as baseflow index bfi which refers to the ratio of the total daily baseflow to the total daily streamflow or using a tracer method nathan and mcmahon 1990 examined the differences between the lh digital filter method and the graphic method in relation to estimating bfi and they found the performance of lh digital filter method is better chapman 1999 used 11 basins to compare three digital filter methods concluding that the two parameter method provides a smooth baseflow peak and is more realistic than the one parameter or three parameter methods the quantitative nature of these evaluations seems to be more reasonable however these methods have noticeable limitations in terms of baseflow estimation digital filter methods have their uncertainties in baseflow separation due to the sensitivity of two parameters according to the aforementioned description this study in addition to comparing different methods of baseflow separation attempts to investigate the uncertainties of baseflow separation with special emphasis on the role of climatic factors and groundwater resources because investigating the parameters in digital filter methods that cause uncertainties in baseflow separation can be a useful approach to increase the accuracy of the methods used for baseflow separation in summary the purposes of this research are to 1 evaluate the stability and reliability of baseflow separation using the mbf method in terms of different catchment characteristics 2 assess the influence of climate conditions on baseflow separation during wet and dry years and 3 investigate two main sources of uncertainty related to the digital filter methods including the recession constant α value and the approximation of groundwater recharge 2 study area and data used the urmia lake basin located in northeast of iran has a land area of 51 876 km2 which the urmia lake occupying 10 of its total area in this basin a total of 17 permanent rivers and 12 seasonal rivers flow into the urmia lake it is characterized by a semi arid and dry cold climate with a mean annual rainfall value of 359 1 mm a minimum temperature of 4 3 c maximum temperature of 17 7 c and an average streamflow of 18 2 m3 s heydari tasheh kabood et al 2020 this study considered the observation data of long term daily streamflow from 14 hydrometric stations annual rainfall data from 12 rain gauge stations and long term monthly ec from 12 stations these data were obtained from the two websites of the iran water resources management company https www wrm ir and https stu wrm ir login asp fig 1 shows the location of stations in the study area and table 1 provides more specific information about the stations including data period average streamflow and rainfall the 14 hydrometric stations were selected based on two conditions less human intervention and a long data period with high accuracy the information about human intervention including water harvesting dam building irrigation and land use change was collected from iran water resources management company https www wrm ir station 14 sarighmish station was only used to determine the performance of the filter methods for estimating the rate of groundwater recharge to quick flow since there are no upstream rain gauges for stations 11 bardesoor station and 12 arbakpol station so we considered the rainfall data from the nearest rain gauge station rain gauge stations j and k for hydrometric stations 11 and 12 respectively typically at each hydrometric station chemical parameters such as ec are measured in the urmia lake basin in iran the ec is measured several times each month but the ec is not measured in seasonal rivers when the streamflow is low therefore in this study we calculated the monthly ec by averaging the observational data collected throughout the month the observation ec data were used for each of the selected hydrometric stations but for stations 8 and 9 which are located close to each other on the same river observation ec data from station ec1 were utilized in the case of station 6 ec data from the upstream station named station ec2 was used in this study 3 methodology 3 1 baseflow separation methods in this study three graphical methods from the hydrograph separation program hysep and four digital filter methods were employed for the baseflow separation as a function of the streamflow moreover microsoft excel python and matlab platform were used for data analysis and result visualization the detailed information is summarized below 3 1 1 graphical methods the hysep method was introduced by sloto and crouse 1996 and it consists of three methods fixed interval method sliding interval method and local minimum method based on a streamflow hydrograph these methods can identify specific low flow points and then connect them as a baseflow line however the algorithms select the low flow points differently first the number of days it takes for runoff to ceases is determined through an empirical equation and then the minimum value of that point is assigned to all days of the interval period xie et al 2020 1 n a 0 2 where a is the area of the basin km 2 in the fixed interval method the lowest discharge at every interval n is assigned to all days in the interval the sliding interval method determines the lowest discharge in half of the interval minus one day 0 5 2n 1 days before and after the day selected and assigns it to that day the local minimum method checks each day to determine if it is the lowest discharge in 0 5 2n 1 days before and after the considered day if this requirement is met the discharge value for that day is referred to as a local minimum and it is linked to other local minimum values hosseini duki et al 2017 shao et al 2020 xie et al 2020 3 1 2 digital filter methods this study utilized four digital filter methods the lynie holick algorithm lyne and hollick 1979 the chapman algorithm chapman 1991 the eckhardt filter eckhardt 2005 and the exponentially weighted moving average filter ewma tularam and ilahee 2008 table 2 provides the detailed equations of the utilized digital filter methods for baseflow separation the recession constant α should be estimated for all the methods and the maximum value among the ratio of baseflow to streamflow bfi max should be determined in the eckhardt method to calculate α this study considered the average value from three different methods a master recession curve rimmer and hartmann 2014 a correlation method eckhardt 2008 and the mean value of the ratio q t 1 to q t rimmer and hartmann 2014 rimmer and hartmann 2014 employed a master recession curve based on the daily streamflow of several dry seasons which overlapped during the recession period from may to september days 121 250 of the year in this study the master recession curve was derived by averaging the flow during all seasons and α was calculate using the exponent that best fits the recession equation subsequently α was determined as the exponential of k eq 7 by obtaining coefficient k from eq 6 rimmer and hartmann 2014 6 q t q 0 exp k t t t 0 where q 0 is the streamflow in the first day t 0 of the recession period t t is the time day and k is the slope of fitting the recession curve in this study we utilized the streamflow data of all stations from 2015 to 2019 to calculate α by creating a master recession curve rimmer and hartmann 2014 7 α exp k the correlation method which is the second method employed in this study to calculate α was proposed by eckhardt 2008 this method considers a scatter plot of daily streamflow q t 1 against q t during a recession period of at least five days during the data period all points should lie on a line through the origin with slope α in this study α was calculated using this method by analysing the time series from 2008 to 2019 eckhardt 2008 8 q t 3 q t 2 q t 1 q t q t 1 q t 2 9 q t 1 α q t the third method used to calculate α in this study involved the calculation of the daily ratio of q t 1 q t during recession days using a time series of daily streamflow from 2015 to 2019 and the mean value of the statistically analyzed ratio was considered as α according to eckhardt 2008 the bfi max values for perennial streams with porous aquifers ephemeral streams with porous aquifers and perennial streams with hard rock aquifers are 0 8 0 5 and 0 25 respectively however gonzales et al 2009 and lim et al 2010 found that the optimal bfi max values might be entirely different from those proposed by eckhardt 2005 collischonn and fan 2013 proposed a backward filter method for calculating bfi max this method is an algorithm that iterates in the reverse direction by dividing the baseflow in the next time step with the α parameter eq 10 to obtain the maximum daily baseflow after which the sum can be divided by the total streamflow to obtain the bfi max eq 11 collischonn and fan 2013 however there is a restriction in every time step where b t 1 q t 1 and at the end with a recession in time step t where b t q t 10 b t 1 b t α b t 1 q t 1 and b t q t 11 bfi max 1 t b t 1 t q t 3 2 stability and reliability of baseflow separation the performance of the baseflow separation methods in the urmia lake basin was evaluated using three different approaches first the estimated baseflow was directly compared to that estimated by mbf method further temporal variations in bfc and bfi were investigated in the observation data between wet and dry years the impact of changes in the α and bfi values on the baseflow was further analysed to quantify uncertainties in the filter methods in addition the ability of the filter methods to consider the rate of groundwater recharge on quick flow was assessed the methodology and the detailed information was summarized in fig 2 3 2 1 mass balance filter mbf the mbf method is represented in eq 12 in which streamflow and tracer data are used to separate flow components and ec was considered as the tracer to calculate the baseflow in each station ec runoff and ec baseflow in the equation correspond to the ec values of the runoff and baseflow components respectively which are assumed to be constant variables during the period and must be determined stewart et al 2007 suggested that ec baseflow and ec runoff can be estimated during periods of extreme low and high flow respectively accordingly ec baseflow was derived by analyzing streamflow conductivity values during extreme low flow periods in which the streamflow was assumed to be the entire baseflow ec runoff was determined by analyzing streamflow conductivity values at hydrograph peaks during periods of high flow where runoff contributes a high percentage of streamflow stewart et al 2007 12 q ba seflow t q streamflow t ec t ec runoff ec baseflow ec runoff in eq 12 q streamflow t and ec t are the streamflow and conductivity of the streamflow at time t respectively the long term monthly observation ec data and streamflow at each station were evaluated to identify the appropriate period for the estimation of ec baseflow and ec runoff in the urmia lake basin then the monthly baseflow was calculated using eq 12 for the 2017 2018 water year here the accuracy of the baseflow separation methods was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse taylor skill source ts and modified kling gupta efficiency as follows kge kling et al 2012 knoben et al 2019 xie et al 2020 13 rmse t 1 n q m t q o t 2 n where q o t is the baseflow estimated by the mbf method at date t q m t is the baseflow estimated by a baseflow separation method at date t and n is the number of monthly data 14 ts 4 1 r 2 σ 0 σ m σ m σ 0 2 1 r 0 2 where σ m and σ 0 are the standard deviation of the baseflow separation methods and mbf method respectively r is the spatial correlation coefficient between baseflow separation methods and the mbf method r 0 represents the highest possible correlation coefficient this study used 0 999 therefore score 1 shows a perfect match between baseflow separation methods and the mbf method and score 0 shows an inverse method performance knoben et al 2019 xie et al 2020 in this study we used a slightly modified version of the kge statistic kling et al 2012 to measure agreement between the baseflow separation methods and mbf method as follows 15 kge 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 β μ s μ o γ σ s μ s σ o μ o where kge represents the modified kge statistic β shows the bias ratio γ is the variability ratio σ s and σ 0 are the standard deviation of the baseflow separation methods and mbf method respectively and μ s and μ o are the mean value of the baseflow estimated by seven baseflow separation methods and the mbf method respectively r is the correlation between the mbf method and baseflow separation methods kge ranges from to 1 which a value of 1 is considered a perfect match between baseflow separation methods and mbf method 3 2 2 temporal variations in bfc and bfi between wet and dry years the impact of climate conditions on baseflow separation in wet and dry years was evaluated using two indicators bfc and bfi the bfc is the ratio of mean annual baseflow to rainfall eq 16 and the bfi is the ratio of the total daily baseflow to the total daily streamflow eq 17 rumsey et al 2020 for each dry and wet year bfi and bfc were calculated and the mean value of these indicators in wet and dry years was compared for each method wang and wu 2013 utilized bfc as an index to demonstrate the impact of climatic factors on baseflow cheng et al 2021 suggested that this ratio is controlled by the aridity index and storage capacity in this study we utilized this index to evaluate the effect of climate factors on the performance of baseflow separation methods wang and wu 2013 rumsey et al 2020 16 bfc mean annual q b p 17 bfi mean daily q b mean daily q t standardized precipitation index spi was used to determine the dry and wet years spi describes the real rainfall as a standard deviation from its probability distribution a negative value was considered a dry year and a positive value a wet year in order to calculate the deviation from normal rainfall we used the following equation naresh kumar et al 2009 18 rainfall division actual rainfall normal rainfall normal rainfall 100 19 normalized value x x sd normal rainfall indicates the normalized average monthly precipitation using the eq 19 which x represents sum of monthly data x is average of monthly data and sd describes standard deviation additionally the performance of the baseflow separation methods were compared during peak flow particularly after multiple events had occurred the baseflow estimation results from station 4 were used during the 2017 2018 water year 3 2 3 uncertainties related to digital filter methods xie et al 2020 reported two uncertainty sources in the filter methods the first uncertainty is the estimation of the recession constant α filter methods consider α a linear reservoir assumption that is static in time however according to previous studies the relationship between baseflow and groundwater storage is non linear and should vary over time because of changes in soil moisture xie et al 2020 in this study we evaluated the relationship between uncertainty in the baseflow estimation of the filter methods and the α value using sensitivity analysis to this end we selected station 3 for the sensitivity analysis of the α value for the 2018 2019 water year as it is located on a permanent river zarinerood river with high streamflow that is less affected by human activities see fig 1 we changed α value from 0 80 to 0 98 at a step of 0 2 the second uncertainty is that the ratio of groundwater recharge to quick flow in filter methods remains constant over time the eckhardt s method exhibited a more reasonable performance than the other filter methods because it considers this ratio as the average ratio of groundwater recharge to streamflow bfi max 1 bfi max xie et al 2020 to investigate this uncertainty stations 14 and 4 were selected as both were located on the same permanent river and exhibit almost the same climate conditions the over five year average streamflow and rainfall for station 14 were 36 9 m3 s and 325 3 mm respectively and those for station 4 were 24 8 m3 s and 259 5 mm respectively the difference in the values of these two stations could be attributed to the presence of the miandoab aquifer around station 4 which creates a drop of approximately 0 08 m fig 1 and this is considered an important factor for demonstrating the relationship between groundwater sources and baseflow for stations 14 and 4 the bfi and bfc were calculated annually from 2010 to 2018 4 results 4 1 parameter estimation for the baseflow separation methods parameters n and α were estimated to apply in the graphical and filter methods respectively and bfi max was estimated to apply in the eckhardt s method at each station the calculated values are shown in table 3 for the overland flow duration n days stations 2 7 and 11 with basin covered areas of 263 415 and 182 km 2 respectively exhibited the lowest estimated value of 3 days whereas stations 1 and 4 with basin covered areas of 5635 and 11 963 km 2 respectively exhibited the highest values of 6 and 7 days in addition station 12 represented the lowest α with the value of 0 768 and the highest value in station 13 with 0 96 further station 12 exhibited the lowest bfi max with the value of 0 43 4 2 comparison results of the baseflow separation to that of the mbf method we analyzed the observation data from 13 stations with long term records of streamflow and ec to determine whether there is a relationship between the streamflow and ec in the urmia lake basin during wet and dry months fig 3 shows the long term average monthly observation of ec and streamflow for each station within the urmia lake basin among the 13 stations nine had more than 13 years of observational ec and streamflow data four stations had between eight and 10 years and only one station e g station 2 had three years eight stations had missing data for year 2015 the analysis results revealed that station 1 exhibited significantly higher ec values than other stations with minimum and maximum ec values of 8033 and 120 900 μs cm 1 respectively in addition the average ec values of station 2 were lower than those of the other stations in which the minimum and the maximum ec were 104 5 μs cm 1 and 298 μs cm 1 respectively generally the minimum and maximum ec of the other stations were 215 36 and 885 μs cm 1 respectively fig 3 illustrates the inverse relationship between the ec and streamflow rate during dry and wet months in april and may the streamflow values at all stations were higher than the annual average whereas the ec value was lower than the annual average additionally from september to january the amount of ec exceeded the annual average in more than 10 stations whereas the flow value was lower than the annual average fig 4 shows the monthly observation ec and streamflow data at station 3 from 2002 to 2015 to illustrate the relationship between ec and streamflow during the wet and dry months there were missing data in some months during the data period the amount of monthly streamflow from march to may was higher than the mean annual streamflow and that from november to february was lower than the mean annual streamflow in addition the ec values during the wet months ranged from 193 89 to 309 33 μs cm 1 and those during the dry months ranged from 262 to 425 μs cm 1 these results confirmed the inverse relationship between streamflow and ec the ec values were lower during the wet months than the dry months fig 4 and the results of the analysis of ec data for each station indicated that november to february is a suitable period for determining the ec baseflow and the peak flow in spring suitable for measuring the ec runoff the lowest ec during the wet months and the highest ec during the dry months were considered as the ec runoff and ec baseflow respectively table 4 presents the estimated ec baseflow and ec runoff at each station from 2017 to 2018 period fig 5 compares the results of different baseflow separation methods with mbf method for the period of 2017 2018 as can be seen from fig 5 the median line in 10 stations were located inside the box of the mbf indicating that there should be no significant difference between all methods however the median line of the chapman method was slightly closer to the middle of that of the mbf method and the box length of the chapman method was shorter than those of other methods indicating that the data were less dispersed the following results were derived from the subjective comparison of fig 5 first among all stations the mbf method exhibited high stability and followed the distribution of streamflow which was not symmetrical and was oriented toward the peak flow in addition the filter methods generally exhibited greater stability than the graphical methods moreover the local method did not follow this distribution at stations 1 4 and 6 second the fixed and sliding methods exhibited a similar pattern for the estimation of the baseflow in 10 stations and the local method obtained the same estimation in five stations the local method estimated the baseflow to a greater degree than the streamflow in some stations such as stations 3 7 and 9 last among the filter methods the median lines of the chapman method and the lh method were closer to that of the mbf method the ewma method estimated the amount of baseflow close to the amount of streamflow at all stations in addition there was a close match between the median line of the eckhardt method and that of the mbf method at station 12 and its boxes were shorter than those at other stations indicating a lower level of dispersion fig 6 illustrates the evaluation results of the baseflow separation methods with the mbf method as the reference method for the 13 stations the median values for the lh chapman eckhardt ewma local fixed and sliding methods were 3 8 1 8 4 4 4 7 3 3 3 7 and 3 7 using rmse method were 0 26 0 49 0 33 0 17 0 30 0 26 and 0 24 using ts method and were 0 9 0 1 0 8 1 8 0 4 0 9 and 1 3 using kge method respectively these results indicated that the chapman and local methods performed better the fixed and sliding methods exhibited almost similar performances and the rmse values for the graphical methods were generally lower than those for the filter methods e g lh eckhardt and ewma methods 4 3 influence of climate factors on baseflow separation we determined the effects of climatic factors on the performance of the baseflow separation methods using bfc and bfi values during wet and dry years at different stations the results are shown in fig 7 in both wet and dry years there was no significant change in the bfc value the ratio of baseflow to rainfall it is worth noting that the ewma and chapman methods exhibited the highest and lowest bfc respectively the values of the bfc index in fixed sliding and lh methods were almost similar in all stations after the ewma method the eckhardt s method exhibited the highest bfc value in all stations except station 8 in addition the local method represented the lowest bfc index after the chapman method even though stations 4 5 and 6 had almost the same values as in the chapman method for the ewma method bfc and bfi exhibited similar patterns in wet and dry years and the values of the bfi were higher than those of other methods the average bfi values for the ewma method were between 98 5 and 99 7 in dry years and 66 4 and 99 7 in wet years moreover the average values of the bfi for the chapman method were between 42 8 and 49 9 in dry years and 31 7 and 49 6 in wet years in both wet and dry years the average values of the bfi for the chapman method were lower than those for other baseflow separation methods at 10 stations the eckhardt method exhibited the second highest bfi results in nine stations its bfi values were lower than those of other methods for stations 6 and 12 additionally the performance of the eckhardt s method differed from those of other methods in stations 8 and 9 these stations are located on the same river since station 8 is upstream and exhibited a higher bfc it was also expected to exhibit a higher bfi but eckhardt s method estimated a lower bfi in station 8 compared to station 9 there was a strong relationship between changes in the values of bfi and bfc in both fixed and sliding methods stations with a high bfc value exhibited a high bfi value and vice versa the fixed method exhibited a lower bfi value than the sliding method however their results were almost equal at five stations generally the bfi value was lower in wet years compared to dry years in both methods fig 8 shows the performance of the baseflow separation methods at station 4 in the dry year of 2016 2017 and in the wet year of 2017 2018 the chapman and lh methods estimated the baseflow at a time lag peak flow which was longer during the wet year in addition eckhardt s method exhibited a better performance during peak flow in both wet and dry years for the graphical methods the sliding method exhibited a better performance although it did not follow the peak flow trend in the wet year additionally the local method did not provide an accurate estimate of the baseflow at the peak flow in the wet year and it provided an estimate of the lowest amount of baseflow during the dry year 4 4 uncertainties evaluation of the digital filter methods table 5 and fig 9 show the effects of a change in the α value from 0 8 to 0 98 on the bfi value in filter methods in the lh method an increase in the α value from 0 8 to 0 92 resulted in a decrease in the bfi value from 0 878 to 0 808 in addition a further increase in the α value from 0 94 to 0 98 resulted in an even more significant reduction from 0 778 to 0 621 and the lh method did not provide an accurate estimation of the baseflow during peak events in contrast the chapman method was less sensitive to an increase in the α value for example the bfi value remains constant 0 490 for the α value from 0 8 to 0 92 however a further increase in the α value from 0 94 to 0 98 resulted in a decrease in the bfi value from 0 49 to 0 43 it is noteworthy that the chapman method did not provide an accurate estimation of baseflow during peak flow for the eckhardt s method the value of the bfi max parameter for the baseflow calculation was determined for each α compared to other methods the eckhardt s method was more sensitive to changes in the α value also the bfi value decreased from 0 98 to 0 023 with an increase in the α value from 0 8 to 0 98 it is noticeable that the eckhardt s method provided accurate estimates of the baseflow from an α value of 0 8 0 92 particularly during peak flow compared to the other filter methods the ewma method demonstrated a direct relationship between the bfi value and the α therefore increasing the α value from 0 8 to 0 98 increased the bfi from 0 983 to 0 998 the second uncertainty relates to the amount of approximated groundwater recharge in the digital filter methods table 6 shows the statistical result of the performance of the digital filter methods at stations 4 and 14 from 2010 to 2017 the mean bfc index values for the lh chapman eckhardt and ewma methods were 34 4 22 16 5 and 48 5 respectively at station 14 and 17 4 11 7 19 7 and 25 respectively at station 4 at both stations the bfi estimations by the lh chapman and ewma methods were similar whereas the eckhardt s method exhibited a completely different result bfi of 34 and 78 at stations 14 and 4 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 evaluation of the baseflow separation using the mbf method for this study long term monthly observation ec and streamflow data were obtained from 13 stations to estimate the ec baseflow and ec runoff for the mbf method an ec analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between ec and streamflow in dry and wet months lyu et al 2020 analyzed the response of the conductivity to streamflow in 201 stations located throughout the major mississippi river basin they demonstrated that there was an inverse relationship between the streamflow discharge and conductivity with the correlation being influenced by a number of factors including topography altitude stream discharge and location in addition they found that sites with an inverse relationship between conductivity and streamflow were more likely to be located along tributaries than on mainstems in this study the ec analyses revealed that there was an inverse relationship between the ec and streamflow based on results of the ec analysis in this study and the results of previous studies this hypothesis can be considered valid thereby the amount of ec baseflow and ec runoff can be determined in dry and wet seasons respectively in the urmia lake basin may march and april are considered the wet months and september to january are considered the dry months thus these are the ideal months to determine ec baseflow and ec runoff owing to the limitations in measuring the amount of daily ec the results indicated that the monthly ec can be utilized to calculate the baseflow using the mbf method kissel and schmalz 2020 also demonstrated that weekly ec results like daily continuous ec results can be used to estimate baseflow using the mbf method additionally saraiva okello et al 2018 employed weekly and monthly ec data from four stations to estimate the catchment baseflow in south africa using the tracer method as a reference the results of the baseflow estimation by the mbf method in all stations demonstrated the stability and reliability of this method as a reference for evaluating baseflow separation methods or calibrating their parameters this result is consistent with the results previous studies lott and stewart 2013 lott and stewart 2016 saraiva okello et al 2018 stewart et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 the evaluation of the performance of the baseflow separation methods using the mbf method revealed that the chapman method exhibited the best performance as its rmse and kge were lower than those of other methods and its ts was higher than those of other methods chapman method s statistical parameters were similar to those of the mbf method at all stations the baseflow estimated by the ewma method was between 95 and 99 of streamflow at all stations and it exhibited higher rmse and kge values and lower ts value hosseini duki et al 2017 evaluated the performance of the baseflow separation methods in the gorganrood basin in iran and found that the ewma method overestimated the baseflows by a significant margin almost equal to the flow rate and thus could not be used to calculate baseflow within the study area which is consistent with the results obtained for the urmia lake basin the eckhardt method exhibited a higher rmse and kge than the chapman method and the local method shows a lower ts value than the chapman method fig 6 although the comparison of its performance in different stations indicated its high stability fig 5 as can be seen from the fig 5 the eckhardt s method exhibited a better performance at station 12 where the bfi max value 0 43 was lower than at other stations table 3 which ranged from 0 69 to 0 97 the high rmse and kge values for this method could be attributed to the inaccurate estimation of the bfi max parameter previous studies lott and stewart 2016 rammal et al 2018 saraiva okello et al 2018 yang et al 2021 have concluded that the bfi max parameter value can be calibrated to improve the performance of the eckhardt method xie et al 2020 evaluated the accuracy of baseflow estimation methods by comparing them to a reference baseflow method and calculating their nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values the local method exhibited a lower nse than other methods and they attributed this to the use of 2 n as the sliding window interval to traverse the entire period of the streamflow while using the local method thus the overestimation of n results in more baseflow that cannot be separated which results in a lower nse in this study we obtained the same result and the local method exhibited lower rmse and kge values at some stations the local method overestimated the baseflow this weakness of the local method has been reported by hosseini duki et al 2017 other graphical methods such as the fixed and sliding methods exhibited a similar baseflow estimation pattern at 10 stations and the local method exhibited the same estimation pattern at 5 stations which could be attributed to the poor estimation of the parameter n xie et al 2020 5 2 baseflow separation during wet and dry years during wet years climatic factors exhibited a more significant effect on the performance of the ewma method particularly at stations 5 and 12 in contrast climatic factors did not significantly affect the bfi values of the chapman method in stations with different characteristics its performance during peak flow had a lag time particularly during wet years and this was also for the lh method in both wet and dry years the bfcs and bfis of the lh method indicated that it is controlled by climate conditions as the bfi and bfc exhibited similar trends the eckhardt s method exhibited the best performance during peak flow in both wet and dry years this method exhibited satisfactory performance in connection with climatic conditions such that the bfi value changed with a change in the bfc value in addition its performance exhibited a high level of reliability accordingly in both dry and wet years the bfi values for stations 6 and 12 were lower than those of other methods an additional feature of this method is its bfi estimate at stations 8 and station 9 these stations are located on the same river station 8 is upstream and exhibited a higher bfc so it is expected to also exhibit a higher bfi however compared to other methods the bfi value estimated by the eckhardt s method for station 8 was lower than that for station 9 the estimated α and bfi max were 0 93 and 0 743 for station 8 and were 0 887 and 0 954 for station 9 respectively these results indicated that the performance of the eckhartd s method was highly dependent on estimated α and bfimax parameters the fixed and sliding methods exhibited similar performance even under different climate conditions in the local method the trends in the bfi value were similar in wet and dry years but this method estimated a lower bfi value in wet years than in dry years in other words in dry years the local method assumed that baseflow is influenced by climatic conditions when it is rather largely influenced by groundwater resources in addition graphical methods did not perform well in peak flow particularly when two events occurred consecutively 5 3 the digital filter methods uncertainties this study evaluated two sources of uncertainty in the filtering methods first there was uncertainty associated with the value of the α parameter on the estimated baseflow sensitivity analysis of the α parameter was conducted at station 3 and the results revealed that the eckhardt and lh methods exhibited the highest sensitivity to the α value whereas chapman and ewma methods exhibited the lowest sensitivity compared to other filtering methods the ewma method demonstrated a direct relationship between the bfi and the α based on the ewma equation table 2 baseflow and α are linearly related so the baseflow increased with an increase in α the α value was obtained by averaging the values obtained from three different methods a recession curve a correlation method and the mean value of the ratio q t 1 to q t the α value at station 3 was determined to be 0 92 the sensitivity analysis revealed that all the filter methods did not accurately estimate baseflow with α values of above 0 92 this study found that averaging the result of the three methods gave a reasonable estimate for α the second uncertainty was the determination of groundwater recharge ratios using the filter methods to evaluate this uncertainty we compared the performance of the filter methods at stations 4 and 14 these two stations differ by the presence of an aquifer around station 4 which is considered an important factor for demonstrating the relationship between groundwater resources and baseflow here the bfi obtained for station 4 was expected to be higher than that for station 14 among the methods employed in this study only the eckhardt s method calculated the bfi differently the bfi values calculated by the lh chapman and ewma methods revealed that the groundwater recharge rate in these methods was constant the bfi values calculated by the eckhardt s method at stations 14 and 4 were 34 and 78 respectively indicating that this method was more reliable for determining the rate of groundwater recharge on quick flow 6 conclusion this study evaluated seven baseflow separation methods three graphical methods and four digital filter methods and utilized long term observation of daily streamflow data annual rainfall and monthly ec data in addition we used the mbf method as a reference method to evaluate other methods the ec baseflow and ec runoff parameters were estimated to apply the mbf method and the analysis of the long term monthly observation ec data revealed that march april and may are appropriate times to measure ec runoff and september to january are the appropriate times to measure ec baseflow further we utilized the monthly measurement of the ec to calculate the monthly baseflow using the mbf method the results obtained from different stations revealed that the mbf method can be used as a reference for calibrating the parameters of the other baseflow separation methods in the urmia lake basin the chapman method exhibited the best performance as it exhibited the lowest rmse and kge values among the methods however its performance was not satisfactory in response to climatic factors as well as in stations with different characteristics further sensitivity analysis of the α parameter revealed that averaging the three methods including a recession curve a correlation method and the mean value of the ratio q t 1 to q t provided a reasonable estimate for α the eckhardt s method exhibited high stability in different stations and performed well in both wet and dry years and exhibited high accuracy during peak flows even when there were multiple events generally this method was sensitive to value of the α parameter as well as to the characteristics of the basin in addition this method was able to determine the groundwater recharge rate more accurately than other filter methods and obtained a more reasonable value thus we strongly recommend our framework of methodology for baseflow estimation under uncertain conditions in this study we have collected a lot of observation data in the urmia lake basin for investigating the use of several methods with uncertain sources but it can be considered in other basins without any limitations under the same or similar conditions moreover this work can be extended by investigating the performance of filter methods particularly the eckhardt s method calibrating their parameters using hydrological and basin characteristics and groundwater recharge rates at stations and basins with different climatic characteristics to establish a reasonable groundwater recharge rate credit authorship contribution statement roya narimani conceptualization methodology data curation software investigation writing original revised draft

7649,study region the damodar fan delta west bengal india study focus the depletion of groundwater resources worldwide is escalating due to its profuse demand for drinking irrigation domestic and industrial uses overexploitation of groundwater in a subtropical fan delta region with rapid population growth like the damodar fan delta in india is of great concern for sustainable mapping monitoring and managing water resources during 2000 2020 the damodar fan delta portrayed an increase in semi critical community development blocks implying a decline in groundwater level to this end the present study intends to show the groundwater level dynamics including its future prediction using machine learning algorithms based on the seasonal groundwater level data from 2013 14 to 2020 21 for 30 wells new hydrological insights for the region post monsoon kharif and rabi depicted a higher fall rate in the groundwater level compared to the pre monsoon and monsoon periods future predictions using the best fit model indicated an increasing trend in the depth of groundwater levels in the future 2025 26 the extreme gradient boost regressor appeared to be the best model while the decision tree regressor was the worst performer the major controlling factors of groundwater level dynamics were decreasing rainfall and increasing groundwater abstraction due to population growth and increased demand for irrigation domestic and industrial water graphical abstract ga1 keywords damodar fan delta gwl dynamics sktime taylor diagram gwl prediction semi critical blocks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a vital source of freshwater that supplies the world s large portion of water demanded for drinking irrigation and industrial purposes due to its good quality and occurrence over a large area mahammad and islam 2021a additionally it promotes economic development environmental management and ecosystem sustainability kombo et al 2020 seifi et al 2020 groundwater resources have increased significantly as external factors influence them less than surface water jeong and park 2019 in india the extraction of groundwater which is greater than in any other country in the world has been reported at 89 for irrigation 9 for domestic and 2 for industrial purposes margat and van der gun 2013 ahada and suthar 2018 mahammad and islam 2021b like other resources groundwater has certain limitations for example extreme climatic conditions such as droughts as well as anthropogenic activities including rapid population growth industrial development expansion of agricultural activities and domestic uses escalate the demand for groundwater which may cause a tremendous fall in groundwater level gwl zhang et al 2020 pandey et al 2020 a decline in gwl triggers serious environmental constraints including deterioration of groundwater quality ecosystem degradation low agricultural production land subsidence and seawater intrusions bierkens and wada 2019 zhang et al 2020 chi et al 2021 in this regard efficient management of water resources is highly required therefore accurate monitoring simulation and prediction of gwl dynamics are vital to helping water planners manage regionally sustainable water resources zhou et al 2017 jafari et al 2020 physically descriptive models and data driven statistical models are the two classes of groundwater dynamics prediction models tian et al 2016 the main limitations of the physical model are that they usually need a large amount of data such as volumetric water content hydraulic conductivity matric suction precipitation groundwater exploitation soil nature and human activities such as the operation of channels and dam projects wei et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 therefore data driven statistical models are considered an attractive alternative for groundwater depth predictions in an area with limited data and complex groundwater systems traditional statistical models such as multivariate linear regression models mlr and time series modes like the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and seasonal autoregressive moving average sarima models have been applied to predict the gwl dynamics by several researchers choubin and malekian 2017 rahaman et al 2019 arima is widely used in predicting social engineering and economic problems saha et al 2022 though it has not always had satisfactory performance and accuracy yan and ma 2016 the sarima is generally employed for making future predictions using the input and output of groundwater data kochhar et al 2021 the mlr for groundwater prediction adamowski et al 2012 and time series models for groundwater prediction sahoo and jha 2013 are considered to be linear fitting models it would be advantageous for the prediction to use time series models because they account for the correlations that appear between data points nielsen et al 2019 in recent decades with the progress of soft computational data driven models numerous machine learning ml algorithms have been used to predict the dynamics of gwl pham et al 2022 taormina et al 2012 compared the feed forward neural network ffann to a regression model and a statistical model to predict gwl similarly mohanty et al 2015 employed a neural network while li et al 2016 applied the artificial neural network ann and support vector regressor svr models for predicting the gwl based on the literature survey it is observed that several studies used ml algorithms to predict gwl although most studies focused on ann svr and the adaptive neuro fuzzy interference system anfis approach bilali et al 2021 moreover a few researchers koch et al 2019 kenda et al 2018 hikouei et al 2023 used random forest rf decision tree dt and extreme gradient boost xgb models to predict gwl however applying ml algorithms to univariate time series gwl data and the geostatistics based comparative suitability of the methods for predicting gwl dynamics are rare in the past literature therefore the present study intends to predict the gwl based on the univariate time series datasets using ml algorithms besides it also focused on comparing different ml algorithms and used the best fit one to predict gwl additionally experimental variograms were applied to analyze the spatial pattern of the gwl in the study area the present study area is dominated by semi critical blocks and characterized by hydrological data scarcity therefore to assess the gwl dynamics of the study area in a local context data driven statistical models have been applied which require only input and output variables knotters and bierkens 2000 however the approach of the present study regarding the implication of ml algorithms and their comparative analysis can attract researchers to evaluate the gwl dynamics in semi arid and arid data scarce regions throughout the world choubin and choubin and malekian et al 2020 2017 because it is well known for its rice cultivation in west bengal india agricultural activities predominate in the damodar fan delta dfd the study area faces a fall in gwl increasing semi critical community development cd blocks from 2004 to 2013 cgwb 2006 cgwb 2017 several studies regarding arsenic contamination acharyya and shah 2007 pal and mukherjee 2009 pal and mukherjee 2010 groundwater budgeting majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2014 majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2016 as well as groundwater quality mahammad and islam 2021a mahammad et al 2022 have been carried out however the dynamics of gwl and their future predictions in the present study have not been attempted so far which is an essential measurement for the water resource management of the semi critical blocks of the study area thus the present investigation will focus on the following objectives 1 to assess the dynamics of groundwater and its future predictions using machine learning algorithms 2 to find out the driving forces governing the groundwater dynamics and its future changes 3 to indicate the geo environmental consequences for sustainable groundwater restoration 2 datasets and methodology 2 1 study area the damodar fan delta dfd is

area comprises a part of the purba barddhaman hooghly and howrah districts which are highly populated areas of west bengal agricultural activities are the dominant occupation of the study area which depends on the groundwater especially in the lean period 2 2 datasets the groundwater level data measured from the ground surface in mbgl from 2013 14 to 2020 21 were collected from the central ground

and industrial sectors hence rainfall data was collected from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps data from 2013 to 2021 moreover to assess the growth of the population of the study area cd block wise census data for 1961 1971 1981 1991 2001 and 2011 were collected from the district census handbooks apart from that information about the stage of groundwater development

10 4 1 the idw interpolation method is widely used in the field of giscience and it estimates the spatial data of unknown sites from the adjacent known sites chen and liu 2012 for the present study the class boundary for the spatial distribution of different season s gwl was chosen as the five class system 0 5 mbgl or metre below ground level very low 5 10 mbgl low 10 15 mbgl moderate 15 20 mbgl high and 20 25 mbgl very high in the present analysis to have a better comparative picture of different scenarios for different wells the chosen class boundary system has been kept the same in doing so if any range is absent for the given distribution that class boundary is excluded and a three or four class system has resulted b experimental variogram the geostatistical analysis of the spatial distribution of the gwl in different periods has been shown using the experimental variogram that can be measured using eq 1 following bárdossy 1997 1 γ h 1 2 n h u i u j h z u i z u j 2 where n h indicates the number of pairs of locations separated by the vector h the distributional pattern as derived through the experimental variogram is fitted with power regression using eq 2 following webster 2021 2 γ h c 0 qh b the shape of the model power curve indicates the nature of spatial inequality in the distribution in respect of distance and direction the exponent of the model curve b varies from 0 to 2 the exponent around 1 indicates a straight line implying homogeneity in the spatial distribution while value 1 indicates the concave shape of the curve and 1 convex upward pattern implying unequal spatiality and variance in the distribution 2 3 2 machine learning algorithms in the present study six widely used ml algorithms 1 linear regression 2 decision tree regressor 3

km2 2 34 in the monsoon period the gwl ranged from 7 17 to 19 25 mbgl with a mean of 7 72 0 55 mbgl in this season the gwl of 5 10 mbgl was found to cover the areal extension of 672 92 km2 20 98 spreading over the western northern and southern areas the gwl of 10 15 mbgl class accounted for 2351 46 km2 73 3 covering the central part of the study area in addition the gwl of 15 20 mbgl was

area i e 226 76 km2 7 07 distributed in the northern part of the study area the gwl of 10 15 mbgl accounted for 1976 49 km2 61 61 which was the minimum area located in the northern and southern parts of the study region besides class 15 20 mbgl was found to occupy an area of 1004 69 km2 31 32 confined in the central and eastern parts additionally like 2013 14 the gwl class of 20 25 mbgl was not found in the monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif seasons the change detection of gwl from 2013 14 to 2020 21 in the pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif season and their spatial distribution were demonstrated fig s1 the maximum positive and negative changes of gwl were taken place in the post monsoon kharif season followed by pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon rabi season in the pre monsoon season the maximum decline 8 m of gwl was found at the bara dhamas located in the northern part of the study area the central part experienced a moderate decline in gwl the eastern part faced low increases in gwl 2 m in the monsoon period a decline in gwl was found in the northern southern and western most of the study area while the western and eastern parts exhibited a negative change in gwl in the post monsoon rabi season the declining trend of gwl was observed in a few locations in the northern middle and southern sections and the increasing trend was found on a small scale 1 m besides maximum change of the gwl was observed in the post monsoon kharif season ranging from 6 95 to 9 22 m in which increasing gwl was found around the parahati area and the remaining area comprised a decline of gwl up to 9 m in depth the spatial distributional pattern of the gwl in the study area was assessed using an experimental variogram that depicts spatial inequality in different periods fig 6a h for the assessment year 2013 14 in pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif depict that there is a gradual shift of the distributional pattern towards a linear trend from a convex upward pattern during the pre to post monsoon season fig 6a d this implies that relative spatial equality is due to the prevalence of almost similar withdrawal of water from different wells for the boro rice cultivations however in recent times 2020 21 there has been a slight decrease in boro rice cultivation in some areas though other areas continue their boro cultivation this has resulted in spatial inequality in the gwl withdrawal especially in the post monsoon kharif season this has induced a convex upward pattern in the distribution during this period of observations fig 6e h 3 3 model findings and performance of the models based on the reliability tests and taylor diagram out of six models the best fit model has been computed for every well w1 to w30 fig 7 for every well data was trained with the best fit model with 24 periods while testing has been accomplished using eight periods the result shows that maximum wells w6 w7 w9 w14 w15 w16 w17 w23 w24 w25 w26 and w30 have predictions on par with training and testing data that is these wells imply good accuracy for the prediction however such wells e g w1 w2 w27 and w24 show that prediction does not correspond to the training and testing datasets the difference in this respect implies less reliability for the prediction in the future resting the temporal changes the prediction tool portrays that wells e g w2 w6 w7 w9 w11 w14 w15 and w27 will show an increasing trend of groundwater depth while w1 w22 w26 and w29 wells will show a decreasing trend of groundwater depth however many wells e g w3 w5 w8 w10 w11 and w24 show fluctuating trends in the present study several regression models were employed to discover the precious prediction of gwl hence the performance of the models was scrutinized based on the r and rmse was measured from observed and predicted values during the training phase table s4 it is mentioned that the model having a higher value of r indicates a more precise model whereas in the case of rmse the model with a lower value implies the accurate one fig 8 the results illustrated that the xgb regressor is the best model with an r value ranging from 0 72 to 0 9 and an rmse ranging from 4 73 to 0 52 followed by the rf lr knn svr and dt regressors including r and rmse values the dt regressor demonstrated the worst performance among the sample wells with a lower r value ranging from 0 24 to 0 91 and the highest rmse differing from 0 64 to 7 07 the validity and reliability of different ml algorithms have also been tested using the taylor diagram for other wells n 30 a taylor diagram is a graphical construction of sd r and rmse the different models fitted on the taylor diagram are assessed regarding the observed values concerning sd r and rmse the best fit model has a maximum r minimum sd and rmse this locates the best fit model close to the observed line this way the 30 taylor diagrams show that the xgb regressor becomes the most reliable model for prediction fig 8 this implies that the distribution of water levels in most of the wells fluctuates 3 4 future predictions the distribution of the gwl of 2025 26 has been predicted based on the regression model that proved to be a best fit model in terms of accuracy assessment the results of the simulated gwl portray that the gwl with 10 mbgl tremendously decreased while the gwl of 15 mbgl increased more significantly in terms of all the pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi as well as post monsoon kharif seasons fig 9 the spatial distribution of the predicted gwl depicted that in the pre monsoon season gwl of 0 5 mbgl was absent while gwl of 5 10 mbgl was found to extend for 128 16 km2 4 and is decreased by 9 km2 from 2020 to 21 the gwl of 10 15 mbgl comprised 1987 4 km2 which was the maximum in this season 61 95 the gwl of 15 20 and 20 25 mbgl covers 32 37 and 1 69 respectively of the study area located mostly in the northern and central parts of the area in the monsoon period the study area comprises mostly the gwl of 10 15 mbgl 85 33 and the rest of the part is covered by the gwl of 5 10 15 20 and 20 25 which is confined to a very few locations during the post monsoon rabi season gwl of 0 5 mbgl in the northernmost part of the study area and 5 10 mbgl in a small area extension across the study area comprised 0 05 and 13 5 respectively the class of 10 15 mbgl covered 67 65 of the study area and the class of 15 20 mbgl accounted for 18 23 of the study area besides unlike in the post monsoon rabi seasons of 2013 14 and 2020 21 the gwl of 20 25 mbgl is found in the predicted year which covers 18 14 km2 in the post monsoon kharif season gwl of 0 5 mbgl is located in the simlon village the northernmost part of the study area the gwl of 5 10 mbgl is located in the same region and 10 15 mbgl covers the maximum extension in the study area of 854 92 km2 61 91 the class of 15 20 mbgl spread over the study area accounting for 1064 35 km2 located in the westernmost and middle eastern parts of the study area besides 20 25 mbgl were found in the post monsoon kharif season of the predicted year compared to the previous year the change analysis for the predicted year 2025 26 was made from 2020 21 which revealed that a decline of gwl occurred up to 16 m fig s2 it was also observed that the decline of gwl occurred mainly in the westernmost part of the study area around barddhaman town among all the seasons additionally increases of gwl have occurred in a few locations which is limited to up to 3 m 4 discussion 4 1 application of ml models in gwl prediction as other researchers e g di nunno et al 2022 pham et al 2022 elbeltagi et al 2022 have discovered ml models are well suited to anticipate gwls for varied geological situations globally this study uses six innovative ml algorithms to predict the seasonal dfd gwl despite significant progress in the gwl model utilizing ml tools in the previous decades sahoo et al 2017 rashid et al 2022 there are still numerous vital concerns to solve to improve the dependability of ml tools based on their theoretical and physical foundation koch et al 2019 this work provided novel regressor models for long term gwl prediction which has benefits first they re easier to use than numerical models second they can anticipate complex physical processes using information with varied scales and non linearity khosravi et al 2018 regressor algorithms may predict unknown occurrences based on past data without using hydrogeological factors these regressor algorithms evaluate complicated datasets to make predictions short and mid term forecast accuracy may be increased using time series records of gw recharge discharge pumping and evapotranspiration this study shows an xgb based regressor other than standard regressors is well suited to predict gwl for 30 observation wells even with a single input variable the xgb is straightforward to operate because of its simple input variable the xgb model s superior prediction power is due to various factors first the xgb method configuration is developed by numerical evidence giving it a solid and adaptable framework it provides a straightforward algorithm pattern since their average and covariance commands are represented second the suggested xgb model can simulate input output relationships robustly and handle a wide variety of imitator behaviors third modelers might utilize past information to create a replacement model the xgb regressor feature is crucial in hydrological modeling especially when pumping and measuring all input parameters is expensive and time consuming compared to lr the xgb model predicts a monthly time series dataset without computational losses thus the suggested paradigm is more useful in real world applications hydrological professionals and politicians should utilize it since it has a sensible output with appropriate input parameters and accurately predicts gwl hydrogeological processes should not be overlooked despite using sophisticated models and soft computing technologies in gwl prediction research the current study found that xgb is a robust technique for gwl prediction in a subtropical dfd area to assess the models relative performance compare them to the lr dt rf svr and knn models the suggested xgb algorithm may also anticipate groundwater pollution susceptibility and controlled aquifer recharge islam et al 2022 4 2 driving forces for gwl dynamics the present study illustrated that a continuous decline in gwl has been observed for all seasons from 2013 14 to 2020 21 the decline of gwl has resulted from variations in recharge withdrawal and flow of groundwater broadly the driving forces are of two types 1 supply of water and 2 demand for groundwater with time supply is decreasing while demand is increasing exponentially islam 2012 therefore in this analysis the major focus was given to the relationship between the gwl and rainfall as well as the population dynamics of the study area fig 10 a e where rainfall is related to the recharge factor of the gwl and population growth is associated with the discharge factor of the gwl in the comparison of gwl and rainfall it is observed that the average gwl of all wells from 2013 14 to 2020 21 has a positive trend r2 0 15 which depicts the depth of groundwater increasing gradually fig 10a it is also observed that the amount of rainfall in the pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif seasons decreases from 2013 14 to 2020 21 with an r2 value of 0 006 the seasonal variation of the gwl can be interpreted in terms of the seasonal occurrence of rainfall in the study area the maximum amount of rainfall is found in the monsoon season july to september whereas the least amount of rainfall is found in the post monsoon kharif season january to march however the maximum depth of groundwater was observed during the pre monsoon season while the minimum depth of groundwater occurs in the post monsoon rabi season therefore there is a time difference between the maximum rainfall and the minimum depth of gwl and vice versa this indicates the infiltration lag time of groundwater recharge therefore it is implied that rainfall is a significant factor in changing the gwl of the present study area choubin et al 2020 suggested that precipitation is considered an important factor for gwl dynamics the study area is agriculture dominated and groundwater is the principal source for irrigation drinking and domestic and industrial uses mahammad and islam 2021a increased population size and their growing water demand resulted in the depletion of gwl katpatal et al 2014 fig 10b portrays the growth of population at an exponential rate in the study districts of purba barddhaman hooghly and howrah which results in increased withdrawal of water for irrigation and domestic purposes fig 10 c e thus the depth of gwl was found to increase in the study area gradually which is reflected in the stage of groundwater development central groundwater board cgwb computes the stage of groundwater development based on the existing gross draft of all uses and net annual groundwater availability additionally cgwb categorized cd blocks as 1 safe 70 2 semi critical 70 to 90 3 critical 90 to 100 and 4 over exploited 100 depending on the stage of groundwater development and long term decline of gwl in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons according to cgwb 2006 2017 in the barddhaman district the stage of groundwater development increased from 43 2004 to 44 2013 and the number of semi critical blocks increases from 1 to 3 in case of the hooghly district the stage of groundwater development increased from 39 in 2004 to 49 in 2013 and the number of semi critical blocks reached 10 in 2013 the stage of groundwater development also increased for the howrah district from 21 to 25 the use of groundwater for irrigation and domestic and industrial uses in all three districts increased fig 10 d e population growth especially the urban population accelerates the deficiency of gwl due to urbanization and industrialization in the study area 41 of urban population growth was found from 2001 to 2011 in chanditala i cd block census 2001 census 2011 according to the census of india more than 6 growth in urban population from 2001 to 2011 was found in the cd blocks located in the eastern part of the study area where maximum depletion of gwl was observed apart from that the present study indicates the decline of gwl even in the near future 2025 26 due to the effects of precipitation distribution and variations in groundwater extractions for domestic and commercial purposes induced by the rapid growth of the population in the study area our study findings are supported by kardan moghaddam et al 2021 yadav et al 2020 and moshfika et al 2022 the spatial distribution of predicted gwl in the future depicts a higher fall rate in the urban area of the dfd our findings are similar to the findings of sekhar et al 2017 who found a higher depletion of gwl due to the maximum drafting of groundwater from the urban area moreover the recharge of the groundwater in urban areas is lower due to the presence of impervious surfaces yadav et al 2020 4 3 geo environmental consequences and sustainable groundwater restoration deficiencies of groundwater have a tremendous impact on the environment as well as society and the economy the study area is a part of the purba barddhaman hooghly and howrah districts which fall in the arsenic enriched zone of west bengal acharyya and shah 2007 gwl has a significant impact on arsenic contamination pyrite and arsenopyrite are the main sources of arsenic which decompose to release arsenic by the excessive withdrawal of groundwater causing oxidation of aquifer pal et al 2002 hence the study area experiences a decline in gwl which may cause the arsenic contamination of groundwater resulting in deteriorating health conditions in addition the depletion of gwl reduces the storage capacity of unconfined and confined aquifer systems shah 2010 small spill channels of the damodar river stagnant water bodies and dvc canals are surface water that depends on the monsoon rainfall the surface water bodies play an important role in the ecological balance and occupational status of the study area the decline of gwl increases pressure on the surface water bodies resulting in environmental degradation as well as poor economic conditions moreover the dfd is an agricultural dominated area especially paddy cultivation which requires plenty of water throughout the year a large share of the population is engaged in agricultural activity and its dependency on it increasing rapidly due to population growth due to the erratic nature of monsoon rainfall groundwater provides irrigation water therefore the decline of gwl reduces crop productivity and increases expenditure resulting in poor economic conditions river water usage aquifers optimal yields management natural and artificial aquifers replenishing rainfall harvesting and wastewater utilization may reduce groundwater pressure and avoid gwl decline mulching increases agricultural soils water holding capacity and reduces evaporation mulching may help replenish groundwater by increasing soil organic matter population expansion fast urbanization climate change and inadequate water management threaten groundwater in the study region making sustainable management difficult salam et al 2020 elbeltagi et al 2022 thus artificial aquifer recharge rainfall harvesting water saving technology and integrated water resources management are needed overuse of groundwater elevated high yield rice cultivation scarcity of surface water levels decline in wetland regions decrease in annual and dry season precipitation loss of water conservation through artificial replenishment and low recharge potentiality of soil texture are huge challenges to sustainable groundwater use for irrigation these causes have depleted the gwl to the point that it cannot be restored during the wet season hydro geologic and climatic conditions affect gwl depletion the present trend in the gwl coupled with future predictions clearly indicates an increase in the depth of the gwl which represents the gradual fall in the availability of water for agriculture industrial development and domestic purposes the gradual fall in the water supply and its grave consequences as indicated will act as a baseline assessment for the regional planners of the study regions though a few studies e g majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2014 majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2016 on the gwl have been carried out in the context of the dfd the future alarming trend using sophisticated ml is rare groundwater resources are vital to india s dfd for drinking and agricultural water gwl declination may also affect drinking water and human health groundwater resource management requires continual monitoring of gwl fluctuations using a simple instrument the proposed training method may be used for datasets from various alluvial aquifers boosting global learning capabilities thus the study findings will certainly help the various stakeholders including government organizations gos non government organizations ngos local planners and others who are concerned with these water stressed areas in an integrated manner embracing a participatory approach to regional planning fig 11 the study findings indicate that groundwater recharge has to be elevated this could be done through the recharge at some points of the existing palaeochannels identified by mahammad and islam 2021b and majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2014 which have a high potential for groundwater recharge though rainfall is falling with time a huge amount of run off water is passing through this region to meet the hooghly river inducing floods in most cases during the monsoon period ghosh and mistri 2015 this surplus water could potentially be used to recharge these wells for ameliorating gwl health in this perspective palaeochannels could also potentially be developed as ponds managed by individual and community initiatives in the context of dfd it is observed that in the water stressed areas local people are already using small ponds 100 m2 locally called doba for capturing rainwater during the monsoon months or excess water from dvc canals the doba or individual pond is managed at the household level while sech pukur 100 000 m2 is maintained at the community level it is found that local people are well aware of the surplus water passing through the dvc canal during monsoon interaction with the household members during 2022 clearly indicates their inclination for using this excess floodwater in their ponds or govt managed large community ponds located in the palaeochannel area for storing excess water for groundwater recharge and its use for irrigation and other purposes during the lean seasons also demand side management is suggested for the area under study because it is known for growing boro rice post monsoon kharif which needs a lot of irrigation water besides the mushrooming of cold storage for potato storage and rice mills and other industrial expanses with urban culture also led to the huge consumption of water salam et al 2020 elbeltagi et al 2022 that water demand may be reduced through changing cropping patterns or by increasing water supply from the dvc canals the study suggested that the local community could to some extent manage the increasing nature of water demand they can take baths in the pond instead of the bathroom when necessary they can reuse the water in some cases such as cattle feeding with the water already used for washing the vegetables which is notable in the area thus the present study strongly advocates for further work in this direction in the dfd region 5 conclusions the present study analyzed the dynamics of gwl during the pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif seasons from 2013 to 2020 21 based on the gwl of 30 wells along with the prediction of gwl for 2025 26 the major findings of the study are mentioned in the following sections the temporal variation of the study implies that except for a few locations most of the wells have a increasing trend in the groundwater depth the spatial distribution of gwl revealed that maximum changes in gwl occurred in the post monsoon kharif season followed by the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon rabi out of the six ml algorithms the xgb regressor became the most reliable model for future prediction while the dt proved the least efficient for portraying the gwl dynamics the predicted gwl of 2025 2026 also indicates a declining trend in gwl for most of the wells its higher fall rate in the gwl is located in the western part of the study area especially around barddhaman town changes in gwl over space and time are strongly linked to changes in rainfall and population in the study area it implies that an increase in groundwater depth is associated with a decrease in rainfall moreover an increase in population urbanization industrialization and agricultural expansions led to the over extraction of groundwater resources for irrigation domestic and industrial sectors increasing the number of semicritical blocks in the study the study found that a decline in the gwl leads to a few environmental issues like a dwindling agricultural economy thus the study recommends sustainable water resource management through supply side management e g artificial groundwater recharge through the paleochannels and demand side management e g a change in cropping

7649,study region the damodar fan delta west bengal india study focus the depletion of groundwater resources worldwide is escalating due to its profuse demand for drinking irrigation domestic and industrial uses overexploitation of groundwater in a subtropical fan delta region with rapid population growth like the damodar fan delta in india is of great concern for sustainable mapping monitoring and managing water resources during 2000 2020 the damodar fan delta portrayed an increase in semi critical community development blocks implying a decline in groundwater level to this end the present study intends to show the groundwater level dynamics including its future prediction using machine learning algorithms based on the seasonal groundwater level data from 2013 14 to 2020 21 for 30 wells new hydrological insights for the region post monsoon kharif and rabi depicted a higher fall rate in the groundwater level compared to the pre monsoon and monsoon periods future predictions using the best fit model indicated an increasing trend in the depth of groundwater levels in the future 2025 26 the extreme gradient boost regressor appeared to be the best model while the decision tree regressor was the worst performer the major controlling factors of groundwater level dynamics were decreasing rainfall and increasing groundwater abstraction due to population growth and increased demand for irrigation domestic and industrial water graphical abstract ga1 keywords damodar fan delta gwl dynamics sktime taylor diagram gwl prediction semi critical blocks data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a vital source of freshwater that supplies the world s large portion of water demanded for drinking irrigation and industrial purposes due to its good quality and occurrence over a large area mahammad and islam 2021a additionally it promotes economic development environmental management and ecosystem sustainability kombo et al 2020 seifi et al 2020 groundwater resources have increased significantly as external factors influence them less than surface water jeong and park 2019 in india the extraction of groundwater which is greater than in any other country in the world has been reported at 89 for irrigation 9 for domestic and 2 for industrial purposes margat and van der gun 2013 ahada and suthar 2018 mahammad and islam 2021b like other resources groundwater has certain limitations for example extreme climatic conditions such as droughts as well as anthropogenic activities including rapid population growth industrial development expansion of agricultural activities and domestic uses escalate the demand for groundwater which may cause a tremendous fall in groundwater level gwl zhang et al 2020 pandey et al 2020 a decline in gwl triggers serious environmental constraints including deterioration of groundwater quality ecosystem degradation low agricultural production land subsidence and seawater intrusions bierkens and wada 2019 zhang et al 2020 chi et al 2021 in this regard efficient management of water resources is highly required therefore accurate monitoring simulation and prediction of gwl dynamics are vital to helping water planners manage regionally sustainable water resources zhou et al 2017 jafari et al 2020 physically descriptive models and data driven statistical models are the two classes of groundwater dynamics prediction models tian et al 2016 the main limitations of the physical model are that they usually need a large amount of data such as volumetric water content hydraulic conductivity matric suction precipitation groundwater exploitation soil nature and human activities such as the operation of channels and dam projects wei et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 therefore data driven statistical models are considered an attractive alternative for groundwater depth predictions in an area with limited data and complex groundwater systems traditional statistical models such as multivariate linear regression models mlr and time series modes like the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model and seasonal autoregressive moving average sarima models have been applied to predict the gwl dynamics by several researchers choubin and malekian 2017 rahaman et al 2019 arima is widely used in predicting social engineering and economic problems saha et al 2022 though it has not always had satisfactory performance and accuracy yan and ma 2016 the sarima is generally employed for making future predictions using the input and output of groundwater data kochhar et al 2021 the mlr for groundwater prediction adamowski et al 2012 and time series models for groundwater prediction sahoo and jha 2013 are considered to be linear fitting models it would be advantageous for the prediction to use time series models because they account for the correlations that appear between data points nielsen et al 2019 in recent decades with the progress of soft computational data driven models numerous machine learning ml algorithms have been used to predict the dynamics of gwl pham et al 2022 taormina et al 2012 compared the feed forward neural network ffann to a regression model and a statistical model to predict gwl similarly mohanty et al 2015 employed a neural network while li et al 2016 applied the artificial neural network ann and support vector regressor svr models for predicting the gwl based on the literature survey it is observed that several studies used ml algorithms to predict gwl although most studies focused on ann svr and the adaptive neuro fuzzy interference system anfis approach bilali et al 2021 moreover a few researchers koch et al 2019 kenda et al 2018 hikouei et al 2023 used random forest rf decision tree dt and extreme gradient boost xgb models to predict gwl however applying ml algorithms to univariate time series gwl data and the geostatistics based comparative suitability of the methods for predicting gwl dynamics are rare in the past literature therefore the present study intends to predict the gwl based on the univariate time series datasets using ml algorithms besides it also focused on comparing different ml algorithms and used the best fit one to predict gwl additionally experimental variograms were applied to analyze the spatial pattern of the gwl in the study area the present study area is dominated by semi critical blocks and characterized by hydrological data scarcity therefore to assess the gwl dynamics of the study area in a local context data driven statistical models have been applied which require only input and output variables knotters and bierkens 2000 however the approach of the present study regarding the implication of ml algorithms and their comparative analysis can attract researchers to evaluate the gwl dynamics in semi arid and arid data scarce regions throughout the world choubin and choubin and malekian et al 2020 2017 because it is well known for its rice cultivation in west bengal india agricultural activities predominate in the damodar fan delta dfd the study area faces a fall in gwl increasing semi critical community development cd blocks from 2004 to 2013 cgwb 2006 cgwb 2017 several studies regarding arsenic contamination acharyya and shah 2007 pal and mukherjee 2009 pal and mukherjee 2010 groundwater budgeting majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2014 majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2016 as well as groundwater quality mahammad and islam 2021a mahammad et al 2022 have been carried out however the dynamics of gwl and their future predictions in the present study have not been attempted so far which is an essential measurement for the water resource management of the semi critical blocks of the study area thus the present investigation will focus on the following objectives 1 to assess the dynamics of groundwater and its future predictions using machine learning algorithms 2 to find out the driving forces governing the groundwater dynamics and its future changes 3 to indicate the geo environmental consequences for sustainable groundwater restoration 2 datasets and methodology 2 1 study area the damodar fan delta dfd is geographically located between 22 31 09 n to 23 20 n latitude and 87 49 00 e 88 29 33 e longitude spreading over an area of 3200 km2 fig 1 it shares the boundary with hooghly river in the east damodar river in the west and kusumgram fan in the north the study area was built with holocene deposits in deltaic form acharyya and shah 2007 geologically the dfd is a part of the stable self zone of the bengal basin sengupta 1972 it is characterized by a low elevated area ranging from 7 m near amta to 37 m near barddhaman town with a gentle slope towards the east and southeast the dfd is dominated by four types of soil texture such as very fine fine fine loamy and coarse loamy mahammad and islam 2021b damodar river is the main river in the study area for a few centuries the study area has suffered from the tremendous flood of the damodar river hence it is known as the sorrow of bengal rudra 2010 the study area is dominated by tropical humid to sub humid climatic conditions with four major seasons including pre monsoon april to june monsoon july to september and post monsoon rabi october to december and post monsoon kharif january to march cgwb 2017 the temperature differs from 31 8 c in may to 19 85 c in december bhattacharyya 2011 the annual rainfall received in the study area is 1600 mm of which maximum occurrence is observed in the monsoon period bhattacharyya 2011 the study area comprises a part of the purba barddhaman hooghly and howrah districts which are highly populated areas of west bengal agricultural activities are the dominant occupation of the study area which depends on the groundwater especially in the lean period 2 2 datasets the groundwater level data measured from the ground surface in mbgl from 2013 14 to 2020 21 were collected from the central ground water board cgwb the government of india table s1 following the standard of the cgwb 2017 the gwl of pre monsoon april june monsoon july september post monsoon rabi october december and post monsoon kharif january march of available 30 wells have been studied besides the controlling factors of gwl changes were analysed from rainfall population growth use of groundwater in irrigation and domestic and industrial sectors hence rainfall data was collected from climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps data from 2013 to 2021 moreover to assess the growth of the population of the study area cd block wise census data for 1961 1971 1981 1991 2001 and 2011 were collected from the district census handbooks apart from that information about the stage of groundwater development sgwd and uses of groundwater for irrigation domestic and industrial purposes was collected from the reports regarding the dynamics of groundwater resources published by the cgwb 2006 cgwb 2011 cgwb 2014 cgwb 2017 2 3 methodology the present study has been executed using a robust methodology fig 2 shows the detailed flowchart of the research processes used in the present investigation 2 3 1 geostatistical analysis a spatial analysis and interpolation the spatial dispersion of the gwl was executed using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method using arcgis software version 10 4 1 the idw interpolation method is widely used in the field of giscience and it estimates the spatial data of unknown sites from the adjacent known sites chen and liu 2012 for the present study the class boundary for the spatial distribution of different season s gwl was chosen as the five class system 0 5 mbgl or metre below ground level very low 5 10 mbgl low 10 15 mbgl moderate 15 20 mbgl high and 20 25 mbgl very high in the present analysis to have a better comparative picture of different scenarios for different wells the chosen class boundary system has been kept the same in doing so if any range is absent for the given distribution that class boundary is excluded and a three or four class system has resulted b experimental variogram the geostatistical analysis of the spatial distribution of the gwl in different periods has been shown using the experimental variogram that can be measured using eq 1 following bárdossy 1997 1 γ h 1 2 n h u i u j h z u i z u j 2 where n h indicates the number of pairs of locations separated by the vector h the distributional pattern as derived through the experimental variogram is fitted with power regression using eq 2 following webster 2021 2 γ h c 0 qh b the shape of the model power curve indicates the nature of spatial inequality in the distribution in respect of distance and direction the exponent of the model curve b varies from 0 to 2 the exponent around 1 indicates a straight line implying homogeneity in the spatial distribution while value 1 indicates the concave shape of the curve and 1 convex upward pattern implying unequal spatiality and variance in the distribution 2 3 2 machine learning algorithms in the present study six widely used ml algorithms 1 linear regression 2 decision tree regressor 3 support vector regressor 4 random forest regressor 5 k nearest neighbors regressor 6 extreme gradient boost regressor were used to predict gwl the algorithms and performance matrix were implemented using the scikit learn and sktime library in the anaconda python distribution version 2020 07 linear regression lr is the simplest machine learning algorithm that is used to measure the relationship between the variables and the model maulud and abdulazeez 2020 lr infers the influence of the independent variable from the interaction of the dependent variable maulud and abdulazeez 2020 the linear regression model can be computed using eq 3 3 y α β x where β is the slope of the line and α denotes the y intercept of the linear relationship between the regression y dependent variable and x independent variable the decision tree dt is an effective ml algorithm used in supervised learning it is a divide and conquers approach that uses for both classification and regression purposes myles et al 2004 it is associated with a simple tree like structure of nodes and branches of decision the structure started from the root top most nodes and the leaf nodes bottom most nodes in this algorithm the nodes depict the decision of the inputs and the branches show the outcomes of the nodes singh et al 2021 a random forest rf is an ensemble ml used for classification and regression problems malakar et al 2021 rf is an assembly of multiple decision trees used to overcome the overfitting problem of decision trees rodriguez galiano et al 2015 in this algorithm the datasets are divided randomly into several subsets with replacements and each subplot forms the decision trees singh et al 2021 the output of the decision trees is averaged by the maximum vote to get stable and accurate results singh et al 2021 the splitting of the subsets is executed based on the input variable having the lowest gini index i g eq 4 4 i g t x x i 1 j 1 m f t x x i j 2 where f t x x i j is the proportion of samples with the value x i belonging to leave j as node t in this algorithm the number of regression trees ntree the default value is 500 trees and the number of input variables per node mtree the default value is 1 3 of the total number of variables is optimized wang et al 2016 k nearest neighbors knn regression is a non parametric approach used in the prediction of a data point based on the information about the neighboring observed point bilali et al 2021 the knn algorithm is applied to estimate the density function of the test data and classify the test data based on the test pattern shabani et al 2020 for this purpose euclidean distance is used to determine the distance between training and testing data eq 5 5 d x y i 1 n x i y i 2 where x represents the training data with specific parameters and y represents the training data with the same number of parameters in this algorithm the predicted value is obtained by the averaging value of k nearest neighbor and maximum weights are given to the nearest point singh et al 2021 a support vector is a deterministic approach which is used to solve classification and regression problems bilali et al 2021 the main objective of the support vector regressor svr includes defining the hyperplane as having a maximum margin between the nearest training data points to minimize the error mohapatra et al 2021 it reduces the sum of the distance between data points and the hyperplane in the higher dimensional space hussein et al 2020 the accuracy of the svr model depends on the loss function ε error penalty factor c and kernel function k in the present study radial basis function rbf kernel has been used eq 6 6 k x x i exp x x i 2 2 σ 2 extreme gradient boost xgb is an ensemble learning technique of gradient boosting machine which is efficiently employed in supervised learning the implementation of the xgb is included in both the classification and regression applications it is preferred due to the high execution speed out of core computation osman et al 2021 in this model the prediction accuracy is measured by the deviation and variation of the model osman et al 2021 for example d x i y i is considered a data set with n sample size and m features and the prediction value is generated using the following equations eqs 7 and 8 7 y i ˆ k 1 k f k x i f k ϵ φ 8 φ f x w s x s r m t w s ϵ r t where x i represents one sample f k x i a prediction score φ is the set of regression trees f x is each tree s is the structural parameters w is the leaf weight t is the number of leaves in the tree k is the number of trees used to ensemble the results and y i ˆ is the predicted label for each observation well the gwl data were grouped into 1 training and 2 testing datasets in a 75 25 ratio all the ml regression models were trained and tested with the same training and testing data sets for the assessment of the best fit model 2 3 3 performance assessment of the models to evaluate the accuracy of the models in terms of observed and predicted values two statistical matrices including correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse were implemented in the present study the correlation coefficient r is an important statistical technique to determine the type of relationship and its strength between two variables taylor 1990 in the present work a correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between observed and predicted gwl using the following equation eq 9 9 r x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 where r is the correlation coefficient x i is the values of the x variable in a sample x is the mean of the values of the x variable y i is the values of the y variable in a sample y is the mean of the values of the y variable root mean square error rmse is a standardized statistical metric that is widely employed in the measurement of model performance chai and draxler 2014 in the current work rmse was performed to evaluate the model accuracy based on the observed and prediction values using the following equation eq 10 10 rmse 1 n i n n y i obs y i pred 2 where y i obs is the observed value y i pred is the predicted value n is the number of samples 3 results 3 1 dynamics of groundwater level in the present study the groundwater level dynamics from 2013 14 to 2020 21 have been analyzed from the thirty wells in pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif seasons table s2 the analysis shows that the variation of gwl is significant throughout the seasons as well as the years fig 3a in the assessment period 2013 14 to 2020 21 it was observed that gwl differs significantly in pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif season in the pre monsoon season of 2013 14 the maximum depth of groundwater was 21 45 mbgl

the northern part during post monsoon kharif season gwl differed from 6 73 to 19 6 mbgl with an average of 9 03 2 3 mbgl the spatial pattern reported that the gwl of 5 10 mbgl class occupied a minimum area i e 226 76 km2 7 07 distributed in the northern part of the study area the gwl of 10 15 mbgl accounted for 1976 49 km2 61 61 which was the minimum area located in the northern and southern parts of the study region besides class 15 20 mbgl was found to occupy an area of 1004 69 km2 31 32 confined in the central and eastern parts additionally like 2013 14 the gwl class of 20 25 mbgl was not found in the monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif seasons the change detection of gwl from 2013 14 to 2020 21 in the pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif season and their spatial distribution were demonstrated fig s1 the maximum positive and negative changes of gwl were taken place in the post monsoon kharif season followed by pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon rabi season in the pre monsoon season the maximum decline 8 m of gwl was found at the bara dhamas located in the northern part of the study area the central part experienced a moderate decline in gwl the eastern part faced low increases in gwl 2 m in the monsoon period a decline in gwl was found in the northern southern and western most of the study area while the western and eastern parts exhibited a negative change in gwl in the post monsoon rabi season the declining trend of gwl was observed in a few locations in the northern middle and southern sections and the increasing trend was found on a small scale 1 m besides maximum change of the gwl was observed in the post monsoon kharif season ranging from 6 95 to 9 22 m in which increasing gwl was found around the parahati area and the remaining area comprised a decline of gwl up to 9 m in depth the spatial distributional pattern of the gwl in the study area was assessed using an experimental variogram that depicts spatial inequality in different periods fig 6a h for the assessment year 2013 14 in pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif depict that there is a gradual shift of the distributional pattern towards a linear trend from a convex upward pattern during the pre to post monsoon season fig 6a d this implies that relative spatial equality is due to the prevalence of almost similar withdrawal of water from different wells for the boro rice cultivations however in recent times 2020 21 there has been a slight decrease in boro rice cultivation in some areas though other areas continue their boro cultivation this has resulted in spatial inequality in the gwl withdrawal especially in the post monsoon kharif season this has induced a convex upward pattern in the distribution during this period of observations fig 6e h 3 3 model findings and performance of the models based on the reliability tests and taylor diagram out of six models the best fit model has been computed for every well w1 to w30 fig 7 for every well data was trained with the best fit model with 24 periods while testing has been accomplished using eight periods the result shows that maximum wells w6 w7 w9 w14 w15 w16 w17 w23 w24 w25 w26 and w30 have predictions on par with training and testing data that is these wells imply good accuracy for the prediction however such wells e g w1 w2 w27 and w24 show that prediction does not correspond to the training and testing datasets the difference in this respect implies less reliability for the prediction in the future resting the temporal changes the prediction tool portrays that wells e g w2 w6 w7 w9 w11 w14 w15 and w27 will show an increasing trend of groundwater depth while w1 w22 w26 and w29 wells will show a decreasing trend of groundwater depth however many wells e g w3 w5 w8 w10 w11 and w24 show fluctuating trends in the present study several regression models were employed to discover the precious prediction of gwl hence the performance of the models was scrutinized based on the r and rmse was measured from observed and predicted values during the training phase table s4 it is mentioned that the model having a higher value of r indicates a more precise model whereas in the case of rmse the model with a lower value implies the accurate one fig 8 the results illustrated that the xgb regressor is the best model with an r value ranging from 0 72 to 0 9 and an rmse ranging from 4 73 to 0 52 followed by the rf lr knn svr and dt regressors including r and rmse values the dt regressor demonstrated the worst performance among the sample wells with a lower r value ranging from 0 24 to 0 91 and the highest rmse differing from 0 64 to 7 07 the validity and reliability of different ml algorithms have also been tested using the taylor diagram for other wells n 30 a taylor diagram is a graphical construction of sd r and rmse the different models fitted on the taylor diagram are assessed regarding the observed values concerning sd r and rmse the best fit model has a maximum r minimum sd and rmse this locates the best fit model close to the observed line this way the 30 taylor diagrams show that the xgb regressor becomes the most reliable model for prediction fig 8 this implies that the distribution of water levels in most of the wells fluctuates 3 4 future predictions the distribution of the gwl of 2025 26 has been predicted based on the regression model that proved to be a best fit model in terms of accuracy assessment the results of the simulated gwl portray that the gwl with 10 mbgl tremendously decreased while the gwl of 15 mbgl increased more significantly in terms of all the pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi as well as post monsoon kharif seasons fig 9 the spatial distribution of the predicted gwl depicted that in the pre monsoon season gwl of 0 5 mbgl was absent while gwl of 5 10 mbgl was found to extend for 128 16 km2 4 and is decreased by 9 km2 from 2020 to 21 the gwl of 10 15 mbgl comprised 1987 4 km2 which was the maximum in this season 61 95 the gwl of 15 20 and 20 25 mbgl covers 32 37 and 1 69 respectively of the study area located mostly in the northern and central parts of the area in the monsoon period the study area comprises mostly the gwl of 10 15 mbgl 85 33 and the rest of the part is covered by the gwl of 5 10 15 20 and 20 25 which is confined to a very few locations during the post monsoon rabi season gwl of 0 5 mbgl in the northernmost part of the study area and 5 10 mbgl in a small area extension across the study area comprised 0 05 and 13 5 respectively the class of 10 15 mbgl covered 67 65 of the study area and the class of 15 20 mbgl accounted for 18 23 of the study area besides unlike in the post monsoon rabi seasons of 2013 14 and 2020 21 the gwl of 20 25 mbgl is found in the predicted year which covers 18 14 km2 in the post monsoon kharif season gwl of 0 5 mbgl is located in the simlon village the northernmost part of the study area the gwl of 5 10 mbgl is located in the same region and 10 15 mbgl covers the maximum extension in the study area of 854 92 km2 61 91 the class of 15 20 mbgl spread over the study area accounting for 1064 35 km2 located in the westernmost and middle eastern parts of the study area besides 20 25 mbgl were found in the post monsoon kharif season of the predicted year compared to the previous year the change analysis for the predicted year 2025 26 was made from 2020 21 which revealed that a decline of gwl occurred up to 16 m fig s2 it was also observed that the decline of gwl occurred mainly in the westernmost part of the study area around barddhaman town among all the seasons additionally increases of gwl have occurred in a few locations which is limited to up to 3 m 4 discussion 4 1 application of ml models in gwl prediction as other researchers e g di nunno et al 2022 pham et al 2022 elbeltagi et al 2022 have discovered ml models are well suited to anticipate gwls for varied geological situations globally this study uses six innovative ml algorithms to predict the seasonal dfd gwl despite significant progress in the gwl model utilizing ml tools in the previous decades sahoo et al 2017 rashid et al 2022 there are still numerous vital concerns to solve to improve the dependability of ml tools based on their theoretical and physical foundation koch et al 2019 this work provided novel regressor models for long term gwl prediction which has benefits first they re easier to use than numerical models second they can anticipate complex physical processes using information with varied scales and non linearity khosravi et al 2018 regressor algorithms may predict unknown occurrences based on past data without using hydrogeological factors these regressor algorithms evaluate complicated datasets to make predictions short and mid term forecast accuracy may be increased using time series records of gw recharge discharge pumping and evapotranspiration this study shows an xgb based regressor other than standard regressors is well suited to predict gwl for 30 observation wells even with a single input variable the xgb is straightforward to operate because of its simple input variable the xgb model s superior prediction power is due to various factors first the xgb method configuration is developed by numerical evidence giving it a solid and adaptable framework it provides a straightforward algorithm pattern since their average and covariance commands are represented second the suggested xgb model can simulate input output relationships robustly and handle a wide variety of imitator behaviors third modelers might utilize past information to create a replacement model the xgb regressor feature is crucial in hydrological modeling especially when pumping and measuring all input parameters is expensive and time consuming compared to lr the xgb model predicts a monthly time series dataset without computational losses thus the suggested paradigm is more useful in real world applications hydrological professionals and politicians should utilize it since it has a sensible output with appropriate input parameters and accurately predicts gwl hydrogeological processes should not be overlooked despite using sophisticated models and soft computing technologies in gwl prediction research the current study found that xgb is a robust technique for gwl prediction in a subtropical dfd area to assess the models relative performance compare them to the lr dt rf svr and knn models the suggested xgb algorithm may also anticipate groundwater pollution susceptibility and controlled aquifer recharge islam et al 2022 4 2 driving forces for gwl dynamics the present study illustrated that a continuous decline in gwl has been observed for all seasons from 2013 14 to 2020 21 the decline of gwl has resulted from variations in recharge withdrawal and flow of groundwater broadly the driving forces are of two types 1 supply of water and 2 demand for groundwater with time supply is decreasing while demand is increasing exponentially islam 2012 therefore in this analysis the major focus was given to the relationship between the gwl and rainfall as well as the population dynamics of the study area fig 10 a e where rainfall is related to the recharge factor of the gwl and population growth is associated with the discharge factor of the gwl in the comparison of gwl and rainfall it is observed that the average gwl of all wells from 2013 14 to 2020 21 has a positive trend r2 0 15 which depicts the depth of groundwater increasing gradually fig 10a it is also observed that the amount of rainfall in the pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif seasons decreases from 2013 14 to 2020 21 with an r2 value of 0 006 the seasonal variation of the gwl can be interpreted in terms of the seasonal occurrence of rainfall in the study area the maximum amount of rainfall is found in the monsoon season july to september whereas the least amount of rainfall is found in the post monsoon kharif season january to march however the maximum depth of groundwater was observed during the pre monsoon season while the minimum depth of groundwater occurs in the post monsoon rabi season therefore there is a time difference between the maximum rainfall and the minimum depth of gwl and vice versa this indicates the infiltration lag time of groundwater recharge therefore it is implied that rainfall is a significant factor in changing the gwl of the present study area choubin et al 2020 suggested that precipitation is considered an important factor for gwl dynamics the study area is agriculture dominated and groundwater is the principal source for irrigation drinking and domestic and industrial uses mahammad and islam 2021a increased population size and their growing water demand resulted in the depletion of gwl katpatal et al 2014 fig 10b portrays the growth of population at an exponential rate in the study districts of purba barddhaman hooghly and howrah which results in increased withdrawal of water for irrigation and domestic purposes fig 10 c e thus the depth of gwl was found to increase in the study area gradually which is reflected in the stage of groundwater development central groundwater board cgwb computes the stage of groundwater development based on the existing gross draft of all uses and net annual groundwater availability additionally cgwb categorized cd blocks as 1 safe 70 2 semi critical 70 to 90 3 critical 90 to 100 and 4 over exploited 100 depending on the stage of groundwater development and long term decline of gwl in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons according to cgwb 2006 2017 in the barddhaman district the stage of groundwater development increased from 43 2004 to 44 2013 and the number of semi critical blocks increases from 1 to 3 in case of the hooghly district the stage of groundwater development increased from 39 in 2004 to 49 in 2013 and the number of semi critical blocks reached 10 in 2013 the stage of groundwater development also increased for the howrah district from 21 to 25 the use of groundwater for irrigation and domestic and industrial uses in all three districts increased fig 10 d e population growth especially the urban population accelerates the deficiency of gwl due to urbanization and industrialization in the study area 41 of urban population growth was found from 2001 to 2011 in chanditala i cd block census 2001 census 2011 according to the census of india more than 6 growth in urban population from 2001 to 2011 was found in the cd blocks located in the eastern part of the study area where maximum depletion of gwl was observed apart from that the present study indicates the decline of gwl even in the near future 2025 26 due to the effects of precipitation distribution and variations in groundwater extractions for domestic and commercial purposes induced by the rapid growth of the population in the study area our study findings are supported by kardan moghaddam et al 2021 yadav et al 2020 and moshfika et al 2022 the spatial distribution of predicted gwl in the future depicts a higher fall rate in the urban area of the dfd our findings are similar to the findings of sekhar et al 2017 who found a higher depletion of gwl due to the maximum drafting of groundwater from the urban area moreover the recharge of the groundwater in urban areas is lower due to the presence of impervious surfaces yadav et al 2020 4 3 geo environmental consequences and sustainable groundwater restoration deficiencies of groundwater have a tremendous impact on the environment as well as society and the economy the study area is a part of the purba barddhaman hooghly and howrah districts which fall in the arsenic enriched zone of west bengal acharyya and shah 2007 gwl has a significant impact on arsenic contamination pyrite and arsenopyrite are the main sources of arsenic which decompose to release arsenic by the excessive withdrawal of groundwater causing oxidation of aquifer pal et al 2002 hence the study area experiences a decline in gwl which may cause the arsenic contamination of groundwater resulting in deteriorating health conditions in addition the depletion of gwl reduces the storage capacity of unconfined and confined aquifer systems shah 2010 small spill channels of the damodar river stagnant water bodies and dvc canals are surface water that depends on the monsoon rainfall the surface water bodies play an important role in the ecological balance and occupational status of the study area the decline of gwl increases pressure on the surface water bodies resulting in environmental degradation as well as poor economic conditions moreover the dfd is an agricultural dominated area especially paddy cultivation which requires plenty of water throughout the year a large share of the population is engaged in agricultural activity and its dependency on it increasing rapidly due to population growth due to the erratic nature of monsoon rainfall groundwater provides irrigation water therefore the decline of gwl reduces crop productivity and increases expenditure resulting in poor economic conditions river water usage aquifers optimal yields management natural and artificial aquifers replenishing rainfall harvesting and wastewater utilization may reduce groundwater pressure and avoid gwl decline mulching increases agricultural soils water holding capacity and reduces evaporation mulching may help replenish groundwater by increasing soil organic matter population expansion fast urbanization climate change and inadequate water management threaten groundwater in the study region making sustainable management difficult salam et al 2020 elbeltagi et al 2022 thus artificial aquifer recharge rainfall harvesting water saving technology and integrated water resources management are needed overuse of groundwater elevated high yield rice cultivation scarcity of surface water levels decline in wetland regions decrease in annual and dry season precipitation loss of water conservation through artificial replenishment and low recharge potentiality of soil texture are huge challenges to sustainable groundwater use for irrigation these causes have depleted the gwl to the point that it cannot be restored during the wet season hydro geologic and climatic conditions affect gwl depletion the present trend in the gwl coupled with future predictions clearly indicates an increase in the depth of the gwl which represents the gradual fall in the availability of water for agriculture industrial development and domestic purposes the gradual fall in the water supply and its grave consequences as indicated will act as a baseline assessment for the regional planners of the study regions though a few studies e g majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2014 majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2016 on the gwl have been carried out in the context of the dfd the future alarming trend using sophisticated ml is rare groundwater resources are vital to india s dfd for drinking and agricultural water gwl declination may also affect drinking water and human health groundwater resource management requires continual monitoring of gwl fluctuations using a simple instrument the proposed training method may be used for datasets from various alluvial aquifers boosting global learning capabilities thus the study findings will certainly help the various stakeholders including government organizations gos non government organizations ngos local planners and others who are concerned with these water stressed areas in an integrated manner embracing a participatory approach to regional planning fig 11 the study findings indicate that groundwater recharge has to be elevated this could be done through the recharge at some points of the existing palaeochannels identified by mahammad and islam 2021b and majumder and sivaramakrishnan 2014 which have a high potential for groundwater recharge though rainfall is falling with time a huge amount of run off water is passing through this region to meet the hooghly river inducing floods in most cases during the monsoon period ghosh and mistri 2015 this surplus water could potentially be used to recharge these wells for ameliorating gwl health in this perspective palaeochannels could also potentially be developed as ponds managed by individual and community initiatives in the context of dfd it is observed that in the water stressed areas local people are already using small ponds 100 m2 locally called doba for capturing rainwater during the monsoon months or excess water from dvc canals the doba or individual pond is managed at the household level while sech pukur 100 000 m2 is maintained at the community level it is found that local people are well aware of the surplus water passing through the dvc canal during monsoon interaction with the household members during 2022 clearly indicates their inclination for using this excess floodwater in their ponds or govt managed large community ponds located in the palaeochannel area for storing excess water for groundwater recharge and its use for irrigation and other purposes during the lean seasons also demand side management is suggested for the area under study because it is known for growing boro rice post monsoon kharif which needs a lot of irrigation water besides the mushrooming of cold storage for potato storage and rice mills and other industrial expanses with urban culture also led to the huge consumption of water salam et al 2020 elbeltagi et al 2022 that water demand may be reduced through changing cropping patterns or by increasing water supply from the dvc canals the study suggested that the local community could to some extent manage the increasing nature of water demand they can take baths in the pond instead of the bathroom when necessary they can reuse the water in some cases such as cattle feeding with the water already used for washing the vegetables which is notable in the area thus the present study strongly advocates for further work in this direction in the dfd region 5 conclusions the present study analyzed the dynamics of gwl during the pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon rabi and post monsoon kharif seasons from 2013 to 2020 21 based on the gwl of 30 wells along with the prediction of gwl for 2025 26 the major findings of the study are mentioned in the following sections the temporal variation of the study implies that except for a few locations most of the wells have a increasing trend in the groundwater depth the spatial distribution of gwl revealed that maximum changes in gwl occurred in the post monsoon kharif season followed by the pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon rabi out of the six ml algorithms the xgb regressor became the most reliable model for future prediction while the dt proved the least efficient for portraying the gwl dynamics the predicted gwl of 2025 2026 also indicates a declining trend in gwl for most of the wells its higher fall rate in the gwl is located in the western part of the study area especially around barddhaman town changes in gwl over space and time are strongly linked to changes in rainfall and population in the study area it implies that an increase in groundwater depth is associated with a decrease in rainfall moreover an increase in population urbanization industrialization and agricultural expansions led to the over extraction of groundwater resources for irrigation domestic and industrial sectors increasing the number of semicritical blocks in the study the study found that a decline in the gwl leads to a few environmental issues like a dwindling agricultural economy thus the study recommends sustainable water resource management through supply side management e g artificial groundwater recharge through the paleochannels and demand side management e g a change in cropping
