6560,accurate spatiotemporal analysis of surface water is important for managing water resources the main objectives of this study were 1 to assess different remote sensing algorithms ability to accurately determine flood extent using modis imagery and 2 to study the temporal dynamics of inundated areas and corresponding return periods in a large catchment in new south wales australia the different water detection alternatives used included the open water likelihood owl algorithm the brakenridge algorithm for single images brak and composite images brakc the islam methodology isl a combination of normalized difference indices ndis and an ensemble of these landsat thematic mapper tm images were used as a reference to benchmark the performance of the algorithms occurrence probability maps derived from inundation images and estimated flood extent frequency curves were compared against the global surface water gsw dataset of the joint research centre the isl methodology indicated the best performance compared with ground truth inundated images derived from landsat while the temporal performance of the brak algorithm indicated significant noise based on daily imagery the remaining approaches generally matched stream discharge peaks maximum cross correlation coefficients between daily discharge and inundated areas were calculated for different time lags indicating high spatial variability across the catchment accumulated rainfall accounted for up to 40 and 60 of the variation in inundation extent in daily and composite images respectively the ensemble technique outperformed the other algorithms to describe the dynamics of flooding followed by the ndis and isl algorithms the occurrence probability images and flood frequency curves indicated a higher inundation extent than the gsw product for return periods greater than two years which can be explained by the different temporal resolutions the results of this study can be applied in water resources planning and flood mitigation efforts keywords flood flooded area frequency analysis remote sensing modis 1 introduction global climate change is likely to impose several constraints on the environmental suitability of human settlements increasing global temperatures under climate change may result in increasing water demand which will be accompanied by a decrease in freshwater volumes because of the melting of continental ice masses meehl et al 2007 scanlon et al 2016 however precipitation intensity is also expected to increase thereby leading to increasing flood magnitudes even in areas where a decrease in flood frequency is expected arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 misra 2014 this increase in flood risk will not only have a direct catastrophic effect on the population but may also affect water availability for instance several studies have demonstrated that flood events are important for groundwater recharge in arid and semiarid areas benito et al 2010 doble et al 2014 eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 harrington et al 2002 this may increase pressure on agriculture and ecosystems that are dependent on these floods therefore improved understanding of flood dynamics will help improve the management of water scarcity meehl et al 2007 mueller et al 2016 ticehurst et al 2015a there are different methods to estimate flood frequency and extent while gauging stations allow a direct estimate of flood occurrence they provide little information about the spatial distribution of inundation huang et al 2014 in contrast hydrodynamic models retrieve spatial and temporal flood information yet are computationally expensive for large catchments at high spatiotemporal resolutions ticehurst et al 2015a this indicates remote sensing as an interesting alternative to evaluate flood dynamics which can also be used to validate and calibrate hydrological and hydrodynamic models schumann and moller 2015 given that water absorbs a significant fraction of the light in infrared wavelengths yet less of the other wavelengths compared with other landscape features its spectral signature can be used in remote sensing to detect water in the landscape ji et al 2009 surface reflectance products such as those derived from modis and landsat satellites contain information in the visible and infrared wavelength ranges and so may be used to detect water in flooded areas the landsat project has been operating since the early 1970s landsat images have a relatively high spatial resolution mainly 30 m yet at a low temporal resolution 16 days on average in contrast the modis satellites aqua and terra have been operating since 2002 and 2000 respectively their images have a moderate spatial resolution 250 m and a daily temporal resolution landsat images tend to be better for water detection because of the higher spatial resolution however the higher temporal resolution of modis images renders them more suitable for studying dynamic processes such as floods sakai et al 2015 schnebele et al 2014 to take advantage of the positive aspects of landsat and modis it is possible to couple both products for example dao and liou 2015 and ticehurst et al 2015a used landsat as a ground truth to estimate the accuracy of modis for flood detection another alternative is to downscale the modis imagery through spatiotemporal fusion models heimhuber et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 2013 however given the high computational requirements to apply these models their use has been limited to small areas short time spans and low temporal resolutions one of the most common approaches for surface water detection is the use of water indices and thresholds rokni et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 while the normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 appears to accurately detect surface water based on the range of near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir wavelengths it has also been highlighted that its performance decreases when water on the surface is found in combination with other features such as vegetation and buildings which are often found in flood waters singh et al 2015 therefore other indices have been developed to improve water detection under such conditions chandrasekar et al 2010 danaher and collett 2006 feyisa et al 2014 the modified ndwi mndwi is one example of these xu 2006 in addition to the water indices mentioned above other alternatives for surface water detection from reflectance images have been developed these require either 1 an empirical statistical model that combines the surface reflectance bands with terrain information guerschman et al 2011 2 a combination of water and vegetation indices in a series of decision trees islam et al 2010 or 3 a combination of thresholds for the different surface reflectance bands nigro et al 2014 although flood extents have been derived from modis imagery using different algorithms guerschman et al 2011 islam et al 2010 nigro et al 2014 there is still a need to better understand the ability of these algorithms to reproduce the spatial and temporal flooding dynamics accurately to date no studies have compared the performance of these algorithms in both the temporal and spatial domain moreover the inundated extents allow the comparison of specific return periods which can be contrasted with gauge data further in combination with rainfall estimates satellite inundation extent can characterize the space time variation in flood dynamics at different gauging stations therefore using modis imagery this study compares the performance of different remote sensing algorithms to determine flood extents as well as their ability to describe the space time dynamics of flood inundation at a catchment scale subsequently we compare the flood return periods by combining remote sensing and stream gauge data to better understand the catchment response to floods this in turn can aid water resources planning and flood mitigation projects 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the case study area is the namoi river basin located in the state of new south wales nsw in australia the catchment is approximately 42 000 km2 in area the main rivers are the mooki peel manilla mcdonald and namoi rivers the catchment has three major water storage dams chaffey dam split rock dam and keepit dam and a natural ephemeral lake the goran lake rainfall in the catchment ranges from 400 to 1300 mm per year its spatial distribution changes with elevation and decreases to the west the annual precipitation at gunnedah in the center of the catchment is highest in summer and lowest in autumn evaporation increases from east to west ranging from approximately 1000 to over 2200 mm per year green et al 2011 floods occur frequently in the catchment and are a natural feature of the flat floodplain area floods inundate approximately half of the wetlands 46 398 ha in the catchment on average every two years green et al 2011 floods also periodically inundate the town of narrabri causing significant economic losses urs 2014 further floods in january february 2012 november 2011 and june 2011 affected the towns of tamworth armidale dumaresq guyra gunnedah narrabri and walcha 2 2 data and preprocessing gauging station data for surface water was obtained from the office of water of the nsw government table 1 in this study 71 hydrological gauging stations were initially used which provided daily information of the discharge rate and water level in the streams fig 1 daily rainfall from 2000 to 2017 was obtained from the scientific information for land owners silo gridded rainfall data at 0 05 resolution http www longpaddock qld gov au silo and summed over all the pixels in the basin which resulted in a time series of daily lumped rainfall over the catchment the australian one second shuttle radar topography mission srtm hydrologically enforced digital elevation model dem h geoscience australia 2015 was used to calculate a multiresolution index of valley bottom flatness mrvbf map of the catchment which was used as an input for the open water likelihood owl algorithm this study used modis daily reflectance images of the terra satellite with a 500 m spatial resolution at daily frequency and as an eight day composite products mod09ga and mod09a1 respectively it also used the modis 250 m resolution daily and eight day composite reflectance datasets mod09gq and mod09q1 which contained bands 1 and 2 red and nir in the case of the aqua satellite images the daily surface reflectance products myd09ga and myd09gq were only used for the composite image using the brakenridge algorithm for single images brak because of a higher presence of clouds ticehurst et al 2015b and the malfunctioning of some sensors in the range of the swir wavelengths li et al 2014 for this period landsat thematic mapper tm surface reflectance images were also used the global surface water gsw mapping recurrence layer v1 0 1984 2015 pekel et al 2016 from the joint research centre was used as a reference to compare the occurrence probability maps obtained with modis rather than the water observations from space wofs product mueller et al 2016 because the gsw has a high spatial resolution is accurate has global coverage and is available in the google earth engine platform this product corresponds to the frequency with which water is found in a specific location from year to year and was derived from all the landsat scenes between 1984 and 2015 in addition the mod44w product was used to mask permanent surface waters when flood extent was analyzed relative to rainfall and discharge values in order to use just those areas that are periodically inundated all images were managed and processed through the google earth engine platform https code earthengine google com for both the modis imageries and landsat tm imagery masking of clouds and cloud shadows had been previously undertaken in the case of the landsat images a focal median was applied with a window size of three pixels to reduce noise the modis daily images were subsequently masked to reduce the noise at the edge of tiles and in stripes caused by the malfunctioning of the swir sensors in addition a mask based on the aerosol quantity was applied because it was found that fires affected the performance of the algorithm detecting water when there was none ticehurst et al 2014 2 3 water detection methods as indicated to determine the flood extent with modis images different algorithms were compared table 2 the owl algorithm was developed for australia by guerschman et al 2011 it calculates the likelihood of water in a modis pixel using eq 1 1 f w 1 1 e x p z where z can be formulated according to eq 2 2 z β 0 i 0 5 β i x i here the original parameterization was used and β0 3 4137 β1 0 000959 β2 0 0041 β3 14 1927 β4 0 4304 β5 0 09619 x 1 corresponds to the swir band 6 of modis images x 2 corresponds to the swir band 7 of surface reflectance images x 3 is the ndvi x 4 is the ndwi gao 1996 and x 5 corresponds to the mrvbf obtained from a strm dem image pixel values fw range from 0 to 1 and indicate the probability of finding water on the surface a second algorithm is the brakenridge algorithm brak for water detection with modis images nigro et al 2014 which can enable access to near real time flood maps at a global scale this algorithm has the advantage of using the mod09gq and mod09q1 datasets which have a higher resolution 250 m the nir and red bands of mod09gq and mod09q1 are combined with the swir band of the lower resolution mod09ga and mod09a1 products considering a series of threshold values and can be applied to both single and composite images brakc using the aqua products myd09ga and myd09gq and a three day window size however the use of single daily images to obtain flood images does not provide a standard product from the near real time global flood mapping webpage http oas gsfc nasa gov floodmap surface water is detected when the following conditions are met band 2 13 5 band 1 1081 0 7 a n d band 1 2027 a n d band 7 676 another approach is the algorithm modified by islam et al isl 2010 which combines the lswi and evi in a decision tree to obtain flooded pixels in this case inundated pixels are identified after removing pixels with evi values greater than 0 3 and with a difference in values between evi and lswi dvel greater than 0 05 subsequently inundated pixels are identified from the remaining pixels with evi values lower than or equal to 0 1 islam et al 2010 these algorithms were also compared with a commonly applied technique that uses ndis dao and liou 2015 zhou et al 2017 with thresholds to detect surface water in this case the ndwi and ndvi were combined where ndwi greater than 0 01 and ndvi lower than 0 2 were assumed to indicate flooded areas the ndvi threshold was empirically selected based on an improved performance of the classification compared with the ground truth landsat inundation images in addition since multi model combinations can diminish prediction errors li and sankarasubramanian 2012 an ensemble of the different algorithms was created multi model average in this case for each day the result of the different algorithms was summed and divided by the number of algorithms flooded pixels were then assumed for values greater than or equal to 3 classified as inundated in at least three of the five algorithms used 2 4 performance assessment landsat and modis image pairs taken on the same date were selected based on a window of 10 days after and before the peak of 90th percentile discharge events measured at the walgett gauge station furthest downstream gauging station in the catchment this approach constrained the image pairs to the period november to january when most of the rainfall occurs in the catchment flood extent images during flood periods were generated by applying the mndwi algorithm to the landsat tm images these images were used as the baseline for evaluating the flood extent applying the different water detection algorithms table 2 allowed comparison of the flood extents obtained from modis with the ground truth landsat flood extents for the same dates through a confusion matrix or error matrix congalton 1991 the confusion matrix enables calculation of the overall accuracy that is the ratio between correctly classified pixels and the total number of pixels eq 3 3 p o c p n where po stands for the overall accuracy cp are the correctly classified pixels and n is the total number of pixels the confusion matrix can be used to derive the kappa coefficient eq 4 chen et al 2014 which considers the random probability of agreement between the reference and classified image eq 5 4 k p o p r 1 p r 5 p r a 1 x b 1 a 0 x b 0 nxn where k is the kappa coefficient pr is the probability of random agreement a1 and b1 correspond to inundated pixels in both modis and landsat images and a0 and b0 are non flooded pixels in both sources commission and omission errors can also be estimated which correspond to pixels that are classified as a specific class yet are not actually that class and pixels of a specific class that were not classified as such bastarrika et al 2011 reference values for kappa coefficients are such that kappa 0 8 reflects a strong agreement 0 8 kappa 0 6 corresponds to a substantial agreement 0 6 kappa 0 4 can be interpreted as a moderate agreement and kappa values 0 4 indicate a poor agreement chen et al 2014 2 5 owl threshold the threshold to maximize the performance of the owl algorithm was determined empirically by selecting the median of the maximum kappa values calculated for each image fig 2 instead of using the overall accuracy performance measure this was undertaken because the different pixel classes between inundated and dry were unbalanced and this greatly influenced the overall accuracy performance measure at the scale of landsat images the values calculated by the algorithm in the pixels without surface water were generally more than one order of magnitude greater than the values in the inundated pixels thereby making the selection of an accurate threshold value difficult ticehurst et al 2015a as shown in fig 2 the kappa curves from the owl algorithm generally had a maximum around a fw threshold of 0 8 with the highest median at 0 87 a value that was subsequently used in this study to identify flooded areas 2 6 flood dynamics and frequency analysis to evaluate the spatial and temporal dynamics of flood extents this study calculated cross correlations between the catchment wide derived flood extents and the daily lumped rainfall over the catchment here the catchment average rainfall was used for two reasons first it was used because we were interested in the flood extent for the whole catchment rather than for individual sub catchments second it was used because the rainfall totals decrease rapidly going downstream in the catchment as a result local rainfall events at the downstream end of the catchment are unlikely to cause major flooding in contrast catchment wide events or events in the upper catchment can cause widespread flooding across the catchment given that these upstream rainfall events ultimately also reach the lower catchment using catchment lumped rainfall was reasonable following the cross correlations regressions were undertaken between backward cumulative daily lumped rainfalls at increasing time lags of up to 30 days and catchment wide flooded extents obtained from daily and eight day composite images the flood dynamics were also assessed using the maximum cross correlation values between flood extents and the daily discharge at the different gauging stations in the catchment permanently and episodically inundated areas were analyzed using a frequency distribution for each year the maximum inundated area was estimated using the different algorithms subsequently the per pixel occurrence probability pi j was estimated in the google earth engine platform by eq 6 6 p i j m i j n 1 where n is the number of years on record 18 from 2000 until 2018 and m is the number of recorded occurrences of inundation during the period n being i and j the row and column index of each pixel in the image respectively return periods were calculated as the inverse of the occurrence probability to create inundated area frequency curves at the catchment scale the same analysis was undertaken for streamflow data at the gauging stations located at walgett and bugilbone along the namoi river limiting the period of analysis to the number of years in which modis satellites have been in operation 3 results and discussion 3 1 general comparison and performance as an initial comparison fig 3 presents a log scale boxplot of the inundated area distributions calculated using the different algorithms the isl algorithm estimated the highest maximum inundated area and an intermediate interquartile range iqr 37 km2 while brakc estimated the smallest mean inundated extent and the lowest iqr 12 km2 given that a smoothing window was applied in the brakc algorithm nigro et al 2014 the peak and variability of flood extents tended to decrease which led to a narrower detection range of inundated areas the owl algorithm predicted the highest mean inundated areas and the highest iqr 56 km2 yet with the highest value lower than the isl maximum given that the iqr is a resistant measure of data variability and considering that flood events are mostly found above the third quartile in fig 3 it can be inferred that the owl algorithm could miss some flooded areas during large flood events compared with the isl algorithm whether this relates to over or underestimation will be addressed later in this study by comparing the flood extents with ground truth inundations the ensemble of the algorithms on the right of the plot resembles ndis yet with a lower iqr 15 km2 compared with 38 km2 thereby suggesting that it predicts a smaller range of inundated extents this behavior is a result of the ensemble technique in which flooded pixels need to be classified as inundated in at least three of the five algorithms used which leads to intermediate inundated extents table 3 presents the spatial performance of the different inundation algorithms using daily modis imagery for dates at which both satellites provided data landsat and modis terra the performance can be described as having poor moderate and substantial agreement for the different algorithms the isl algorithm performed best presenting the highest kappa coefficients and lowest commission errors this was followed by the ensemble of the algorithms comparing the rest of the algorithms the performance was quite similar except for the composite technique applied to the brak algorithm which performed poorly this may be related to the dynamic nature of flooding where the inundation extent can change rapidly within hours therefore this is not captured in the three day smoothing window of the brakc algorithm thus while it has been shown that the composite technique brakc can generally assess the temporal dynamics of floods nigro et al 2014 a spatial comparison with a snapshot of the inundation extents indicated poor performance in the case of the ensemble it performed slightly worse than isl for single events it has been recognized that the simplest multi model average can outperform single models when modeling time series data by reducing the spread of the residuals ajami et al 2006 however because single events are evaluated in table 3 the benefits of multi model averaging may not arise commission errors were generally higher than omission errors the resolution difference between landsat and modis 30 m and 500 m respectively introduced inaccuracies in the classification which can affect both omission and commission errors especially when mixed coverage classes are present such as in this study boschetti et al 2004 further the misclassification observed in the commission errors was caused by the difficulty in detecting flooded areas using the wavelength range of the bands contained in the surface reflectance product similarly the omission errors were on average greater than 0 15 which was again a consequence of the different resolutions for example small flooded areas cannot be captured at the modis resolution moreover increased zenith angles at the moment of image capture may lead to failure to detect water surfaces ticehurst et al 2014 in general there was a positive correlation between the kappa coefficients and the flood extent correlation coefficients ranging from 0 42 to 0 72 while the commission and omission errors were logically inversely correlated with flood extent with correlation coefficients averaging 0 52 and 0 64 respectively not shown meaning that the greater the inundated area in the catchment the better the performance of the water detection algorithms thus an increase of inundated extent improved the spatial performance because bigger inundated areas are more likely to be detected at the coarse resolution of modis which leads to smaller omission errors the same behavior was observed for the commission errors water detection algorithms based on modis take advantage of the low reflectance of water which also occurs with dark objects when developing an algorithm for water detection based on modis imagery guerschman et al 2011 observed that black clayey soils tended to be misclassified as water the same clays occur across the western floodplain of the namoi catchment green et al 2011 and are periodically inundated during flood events black clayey soils in the catchment cover a large extent for example just the central black earth floodplains which contain mainly black clayey soils cover an area of over 3478 km2 8 of the catchment surface and include only a fraction of the black clayey soils of the catchment welsh et al 2014 thus during major flood events misclassifications are reduced because these soils tend to be flooded thereby contributing to reduced commission errors and improving the spatial performance some examples of the performance of the inundation detection are presented in fig a1 of the supplementary data 3 2 flood dynamics and relation with covariates to evaluate the temporal prediction of the flood areas using the different approaches the daily reflectance images were filtered to those with less than 25 of the area masked by clouds shadows or smoke from fires the resulting flooded extents were plotted by selecting two years that presented large flood events including daily discharges in the namoi river at walgett fig 4 in general the different approaches matched the discharge peaks recorded at the gauge station and were related to several of the major rainfall events however some discharge peaks also resulted in no peaks in the inundated areas result not shown and some flood detection occurred with no associated flood peak even though the modis imagery has a daily resolution rain events and consequently discharge peaks are sometimes followed by several cloudy days which precludes flood detection in some cases schumann and moller 2015 leading to some missed floods related to discharge peaks or heavy rain events comparing the different approaches the method with the highest noise was the brak algorithm as a result the isl owl ndis brakc and ensemble technique detected the flood events more correctly in a time series and presented clear recession behavior fig 5 presents the relationship between the inundated areas using the different algorithms and the daily discharge at gauging stations at walgett and bugilbone the ensemble of the algorithms had a higher correlation with the river daily discharges followed closely by the ndis and isl algorithms in general the correlation coefficients r in fig 5 based on linear associations between the discharge and flood extents at both gauge stations suggested reasonably strong correlations in this case the relationship between the discharge and inundated extent was approximated as linear even though this is probably an over simplification of the data given the scatter of the points in contrast ticehurst et al 2014 on an area of 178 km2 including the victoria lake in australia used second order polynomial relationships in the current study the gauge stations and inundation occurred on flat areas of the catchment where infiltration rates were low because of clay dominated soils and open shrubland land cover which may explain the different relationship the cross correlation between daily discharge at different locations of the catchment and the daily inundated areas allowed identification of maximum cross correlation coefficients and associated time lags fig 6 displays this relationship for the isl algorithm noting that the main flow direction in the catchment is westward although the maximum cross correlation values can be unrelated to the runoff flood response especially at high time lags the moderate and strong associations between the variables the relationship with the time lags and the spatial relationship with other gauges a similar general trend and within the catchment suggest that these reflect the catchment runoff flood behavior in contrast gauges with weak correlations between flood extent and discharge and whose time lags differ from the surrounding gauges must be interpreted as not representative of the overall catchment behavior this can be observed in the gauges located just below the chaffey dam which regulates downstream water flow thereby affecting the natural streamflow pattern green et al 2011 in general cross correlation coefficients depend on the location of the stations in the catchment with values ranging from 0 to 0 87 in general downstream gauges which receive greater amounts of the accumulated flow upstream in the catchment and for longer periods have higher cross correlations however this general trend which considers the flow path length is also affected by the reach of the river for instance higher correlations occur in the namoi river than in the pian creek the temporal response of floods which can be interpreted as the time taken for flow waves to propagate downstream shows a delay relative to the river discharge in the higher elevation eastern sectors of the catchment with positive time lags of up to 15 days this delay is reduced downstream and in the lower areas of the catchment discharge peaks recorded at the stations occur after the maximum flood signal from the satellite negative time lags however some areas have propagation times that differ from those observed immediately downstream which are likely to be associated with local conditions affecting the flow hirpa et al 2013 this time lag difference between signals can help determine the main areas where floods would occur although the downstream stations tended to be more representative of the general hydrological behavior of the catchment which led to higher cross correlation coefficients between daily discharges and daily flood extents most had a delay in the flood discharge response which excluded any predictive capacity flood forecasting by using gauge stations requires selection of gauge stations within a catchment that have a close discharge flood relationship turner 2012 and where the discharge peak occurs some days before the flood response occurs this creates an opportunity to investigate whether the inundation images may be able to provide information on downstream flooding conditions some days in advance the analysis undertaken enables the selection of stations that could be useful for flood forecasts stations with good cross correlation values light green dots in the cross correlation values of fig 6 and long time lags blue dots in the time lag values of fig 6 are suitable to be included in an early warning flood forecasting system given that rainfall is the main driver of floods the rainfall flood relationship was also assessed fig 7 displays a cross correlation between daily lumped rainfall over the catchment and inundated extents for the different algorithms according to fig 7 the strongest correlation occurred consistently in all algorithms between 10 and 15 days other peaks in the correlation graph fig 7 could be caused by different types of runoff responses such as infiltration excess leading to correlation at lower time lags in the 40 000 km2 catchment or saturation excess leading to correlations at longer time lags however they are more likely an artefact of the analysis based on catchment average rainfall this removes the spatial variability of the rainfall and shorter time lag peaks could be related to locally concentrated heavy rainfall while the longer time lag peaks could relate to widespread rainfall and catchment flooding we did not investigate this routing problem further here another way to evaluate this relationship is to examine the relationship between inundation extent and accumulated rainfall this should detect temporal relationships between inundation areas from the algorithms for both the daily and eight day composite images of the surface reflectance modis products fig 8 clearly not all variation in the flood extents was explained by rainfall using a simple second degree polynomial to describe the non linear relationship between rainfall and flood extent other factors such as soil properties land cover irrigation schedules and the opportunity for water storage may affect the surface water extent in the catchment pekel et al 2016 in addition antecedent soil moisture conditions also affect the catchment response which indirectly highlights the relationship with the accumulated rainfall at different time lags in the case of the daily reflectance imagery the highest r2 related to ndis and 23 days of accumulated rainfall followed closely by the ensemble technique using the composite reflectance product the r2 reached a value greater than 0 6 with 13 days of accumulated rainfall as was the case for the spatial performance and the assessment against daily discharges the smoothing in the brakc algorithm led to lower correlations for daily rainfalls because it could miss the maximum flood extent table a1 of supplementary data the overall accumulated rainfall accounted for approximately 60 of the variation of the inundated extent using the composite reflectance imagery the assessment of the flood dynamics improved most likely because the output of the algorithms using the eight day imagery was less noisy 3 3 frequency analysis comparing the different occurrence probability maps fig 9 indicated that the inundated probabilities in the gsw landsat product were significantly smaller than those obtained from the modis imagery this suggests that the different flood extents were not just caused by the difference in the spatial resolution between the satellites more specifically despite the longer period of operation the lower temporal resolution of the landsat data compared with modis could lead to missing flood events and under prediction of flood extents mueller et al 2016 ticehurst et al 2014 the flood frequency curves calculated from the probability maps fig 10 differed from the standard flood frequency curves because the current study plotted the flooded area instead of discharge on the y axis the gsw recurrence layer derived from landsat imagery pekel et al 2016 was used as a reference noting that the flooded areas were smaller than those based on modis imagery despite the difference in behavior between the gsw product and modis imagery the general behavior of the gsw curve was similar to the curves using the isl and owl algorithm below a return period of approximately two years after this threshold the modis images had an inflection in the curves leading to higher inundation areas this inflection was probably caused by the topography of the catchment which could also be observed in the river flood frequency data in general flood areas were slightly greater for all algorithms using daily reflectance imagery compared with the eight day composite images data not shown which confirms that larger temporal spacing can result in a loss of flood extent information comparing the curves from the different algorithms indicated that below return periods of 10 years the inundation areas using the ndis were considerably smaller than the others yet all the modis flood detection approaches from the same reflectance product tended to have the same large return period threshold both the inundated area frequency curves derived from modis and the flood frequency curves derived from the gauging stations followed similar trends as neither of them flattened out even at large return periods of 20 years this finding contrasts with the gsw product which started to flatten out at approximately three years thereby reducing its applicability in hydrological studies thus an event with a return period of 10 years represents an inundated area of over 99 9 of the maximum inundated area of the gsw derived frequency curve while with the modis based algorithms the same event represented on average 62 of the maximum inundation extent from the frequency curves in the case of the river flood frequency curves the same event for both stations accounted for an average of 65 of the maximum discharge obtained in the period studied which was similar to the percentage estimated using modis imagery this confirms that modis despite its lower spatial resolution is more useful than the landsat imagery when analyzing processes that change rapidly such as floods 3 4 final ranking of the algorithms a qualitative ranking of the different algorithms table 4 summarizes the results of this study the ranking is based on how well the algorithms performed against the benchmark landsat image derived flood areas and how well they captured the flood dynamics relative to the gauge discharges the algorithms that performed the best are ranked first and the algorithms that performed the worst are ranked third based on the performance against the flood occurrence from the landsat images and considering the mean kappa values table 3 algorithms ranked first had mean kappa coefficients greater than or equal to 0 55 algorithms ranked second had mean kappa coefficients between 0 5 and 0 55 and algorithms with mean kappa coefficients lower than 0 5 were ranked third then based on the flood dynamics and considering the lower limit of a strong association between variables correlation coefficients 0 7 and the mean correlation coefficients between inundated areas and discharges at the walgett and bugilbone stations fig 5 algorithms that had mean correlation coefficients greater than 0 7 were ranked first mean correlation coefficients between 0 65 and 0 7 were ranked second and mean correlation coefficients smaller than or equal to 0 65 were ranked third the final rank was based on selecting the worst of the ranks previously mentioned based on table 4 the best methods in both spatial performance and capturing the flood dynamics were the isl algorithm and ensemble technique it is important to point out that when evaluating the spatial performance images with higher inundated areas should be considered especially if these present low sensor zenith angles because they represent more of the inundated areas which might lead to lower uncertainty in flood modeling 3 5 general discussion a few previous studies compared mapping of water occurrence among different satellites ticehurst et al 2015b in general two products were developed from landsat imagery that calculate the inundation probability in time one of these was used as reference in this study pekel et al 2016 the other was developed for australia and is available from the geoscience australia webpage mueller et al 2016 inundation probability maps from modis imagery have been generated at a smaller scale huang et al 2014 but without the use of a landsat reference and without development of frequency curves to assess the flood extent over time to our knowledge comparison of inundation probability frequencies between satellites has not previously been undertaken and such a comparison increases understandings of the reliability of the different methods for flood studies this study compared flood extents derived from modis and landsat gsw at different spatial and temporal resolution and highlighted the importance of high temporal resolution when studying dynamic processes such as floods however this subject requires further analysis especially for validating the inundation frequencies with ground measurements a comparison of the accuracy of different flood detection techniques using landsat imageries was recently published munasinghe et al 2018 however no studies comparing modis based algorithms for surface water detection have been performed moreover most studies evaluating these algorithms using modis imagery have focused on assessing their spatial performance by using high spatial resolution images as a reference the present study which compared different modis based algorithms also considered flood dynamics by using daily discharges from gauge stations and total daily rainfall as references in this case the daily temporal resolution of modis imagery is able to capture some of the rapid changes occurring during flood events which are frequently missed when using low temporal resolution datasets an advantage of capturing the dynamic nature of floods at a catchment scale is that it may help establish early warning flood forecasting systems by detecting gauging stations whose discharges present a strong correlation with flood extents and where discharge peaks are recorded some days before the floods occur similarly by understanding how floods are spatially located and their recurrence flood mitigation strategies can be implemented thus the information derived from the present study can be used to direct flood prevention investment and to select design thresholds to prevent damage to public and private infrastructure it can also support water resources planning by improving the quantification of changes in water volumes future work may involve downscaling modis images to the spatial resolution of landsat however an initial priority is reducing the computation requirements of the alternatives to achieve this further synthetic aperture radar sources which can be obtained from the copernicus satellites might allow greater precision in water detection and be used to improve the accuracy of the modis derived flood extents via both validation and downscaling however because these data are only just coming available online this will be a matter for future research 4 conclusions surface water can be detected using different modis based algorithms based on the approaches used in this research the isl algorithm provided the highest spatial performance compared with the ground truth derived from landsat images and had the greatest inundation extent when analyzing the temporal dynamic of floods the best performance was obtained using the ndis the isl and the ensemble of algorithms the brak algorithm created noisy estimates with days with large inundation areas but without matching discharges or rainfall in contrast the other algorithms captured the discharge peaks reasonably accurately and even indicated distinct recession behavior the relationship between rainfall and flood extents based on composite images explained around 60 of the flood extent variation at a rainfall lag of 13 days the relationship between stream discharge and the flooded area was spatially variable in the catchment with generally higher correlations at gauges located downstream in the catchment cross correlation coefficients reached up to 0 87 with a delay in recording the discharge peaks at the lowest stations of the catchment the gsw recurrence product captured significantly smaller inundated extents than did the modis derived inundation which can be explained by the lower temporal resolution of landsat images the gsw flood frequency curve was similar to the modis products for short return periods however at longer return periods the inundated area derived from the modis imagery was considerably greater than the gsw estimates in general the daily imagery identified greater inundated areas than did the composite images because of the higher temporal resolution which improved the estimates of the flood dynamics the results of this study can reduce the uncertainty in flood volume estimates for real time water resource planning and flood mitigation declaration of interest none acknowledgement the

6560,accurate spatiotemporal analysis of surface water is important for managing water resources the main objectives of this study were 1 to assess different remote sensing algorithms ability to accurately determine flood extent using modis imagery and 2 to study the temporal dynamics of inundated areas and corresponding return periods in a large catchment in new south wales australia the different water detection alternatives used included the open water likelihood owl algorithm the brakenridge algorithm for single images brak and composite images brakc the islam methodology isl a combination of normalized difference indices ndis and an ensemble of these landsat thematic mapper tm images were used as a reference to benchmark the performance of the algorithms occurrence probability maps derived from inundation images and estimated flood extent frequency curves were compared against the global surface water gsw dataset of the joint research centre the isl methodology indicated the best performance compared with ground truth inundated images derived from landsat while the temporal performance of the brak algorithm indicated significant noise based on daily imagery the remaining approaches generally matched stream discharge peaks maximum cross correlation coefficients between daily discharge and inundated areas were calculated for different time lags indicating high spatial variability across the catchment accumulated rainfall accounted for up to 40 and 60 of the variation in inundation extent in daily and composite images respectively the ensemble technique outperformed the other algorithms to describe the dynamics of flooding followed by the ndis and isl algorithms the occurrence probability images and flood frequency curves indicated a higher inundation extent than the gsw product for return periods greater than two years which can be explained by the different temporal resolutions the results of this study can be applied in water resources planning and flood mitigation efforts keywords flood flooded area frequency analysis remote sensing modis 1 introduction global climate change is likely to impose several constraints on the environmental suitability of human settlements increasing global temperatures under climate change may result in increasing water demand which will be accompanied by a decrease in freshwater volumes because of the melting of continental ice masses meehl et al 2007 scanlon et al 2016 however precipitation intensity is also expected to increase thereby leading to increasing flood magnitudes even in areas where a decrease in flood frequency is expected arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 misra 2014 this increase in flood risk will not only have a direct catastrophic effect on the population but may also affect water availability for instance several studies have demonstrated that flood events are important for groundwater recharge in arid and semiarid areas benito et al 2010 doble et al 2014 eckhardt and ulbrich 2003 harrington et al 2002 this may increase pressure on agriculture and ecosystems that are dependent on these floods therefore improved understanding of flood dynamics will help improve the management of water scarcity meehl et al 2007 mueller et al 2016 ticehurst et al 2015a there are different methods to estimate flood frequency and extent while gauging stations allow a direct estimate of flood occurrence they provide little information about the spatial distribution of inundation huang et al 2014 in contrast hydrodynamic models retrieve spatial and temporal flood information yet are computationally expensive for large catchments at high spatiotemporal resolutions ticehurst et al 2015a this indicates remote sensing as an interesting alternative to evaluate flood dynamics which can also be used to validate and calibrate hydrological and hydrodynamic models schumann and moller 2015 given that water absorbs a significant fraction of the light in infrared wavelengths yet less of the other wavelengths compared with other landscape features its spectral signature can be used in remote sensing to detect water in the landscape ji et al 2009 surface reflectance products such as those derived from modis and landsat satellites contain information in the visible and infrared wavelength ranges and so may be used to detect water in flooded areas the landsat project has been operating since the early 1970s landsat images have a relatively high spatial resolution mainly 30 m yet at a low temporal resolution 16 days on average in contrast the modis satellites aqua and terra have been operating since 2002 and 2000 respectively their images have a moderate spatial resolution 250 m and a daily temporal resolution landsat images tend to be better for water detection because of the higher spatial resolution however the higher temporal resolution of modis images renders them more suitable for studying dynamic processes such as floods sakai et al 2015 schnebele et al 2014 to take advantage of the positive aspects of landsat and modis it is possible to couple both products for example dao and liou 2015 and ticehurst et al 2015a used landsat as a ground truth to estimate the accuracy of modis for flood detection another alternative is to downscale the modis imagery through spatiotemporal fusion models heimhuber et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 2013 however given the high computational requirements to apply these models their use has been limited to small areas short time spans and low temporal resolutions one of the most common approaches for surface water detection is the use of water indices and thresholds rokni et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 while the normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 appears to accurately detect surface water based on the range of near infrared nir and shortwave infrared swir wavelengths it has also been highlighted that its performance decreases when water on the surface is found in combination with other features such as vegetation and buildings which are often found in flood waters singh et al 2015 therefore other indices have been developed to improve water detection under such conditions chandrasekar et al 2010 danaher and collett 2006 feyisa et al 2014 the modified ndwi mndwi is one example of these xu 2006 in addition to the water indices mentioned above other alternatives for surface water detection from reflectance images have been developed these require either 1 an empirical statistical model that combines the surface reflectance bands with terrain information guerschman et al 2011 2 a combination of water and vegetation indices in a series of decision trees islam et al 2010 or 3 a combination of thresholds for the different surface reflectance bands nigro et al 2014 although flood extents have been derived from modis imagery using different algorithms guerschman et al 2011 islam et al 2010 nigro et al 2014 there is still a need to better understand the ability of these algorithms to reproduce the spatial and temporal flooding dynamics accurately to date no studies have compared the performance of these algorithms in both the temporal and spatial domain moreover the inundated extents allow the comparison of specific return periods which can be contrasted with gauge data further in combination with rainfall estimates satellite inundation extent can characterize the space time variation in flood dynamics at different gauging stations therefore using modis imagery this study compares the performance of different remote sensing algorithms to determine flood extents as well as their ability to describe the space time dynamics of flood inundation at a catchment scale subsequently we compare the flood return periods by combining remote sensing and stream gauge data to better understand the catchment response to floods this in turn can aid water resources planning and flood mitigation projects 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the case study area is the namoi river basin located in the state of new south wales nsw in australia the catchment is approximately 42 000 km2 in area the main rivers are the mooki peel manilla mcdonald and namoi rivers the catchment has three major water storage dams chaffey dam split rock dam and keepit dam and a natural ephemeral lake the goran lake rainfall in the catchment ranges from 400 to 1300 mm per year its spatial distribution changes with elevation and decreases to the west the annual precipitation at gunnedah in the center of the catchment is highest in summer and lowest in autumn evaporation increases from east to west ranging from approximately 1000 to over 2200 mm per year green et al 2011 floods occur frequently in the catchment and are a natural feature of the flat floodplain area floods inundate approximately half of the wetlands 46 398 ha in the catchment on average every two years green et al 2011 floods also periodically inundate the town of narrabri causing significant economic losses urs 2014 further floods in january february 2012 november 2011 and june 2011 affected the towns of tamworth armidale dumaresq guyra gunnedah narrabri and walcha 2 2 data and preprocessing gauging station data for surface water was obtained from the office of water of the nsw government table 1 in this study 71 hydrological gauging stations were initially used which provided daily information of the discharge rate and water level in the streams fig 1 daily rainfall from 2000 to 2017 was obtained from the scientific information for land owners silo gridded rainfall data at 0 05 resolution http www longpaddock qld gov au silo and summed over all the pixels in the basin which resulted in a time series of daily lumped rainfall over the catchment the australian one second shuttle radar topography mission srtm hydrologically enforced digital elevation model dem h geoscience australia 2015 was used to calculate a multiresolution index of valley bottom flatness mrvbf map of the catchment which was used as an input for the open water likelihood owl algorithm this study used modis daily reflectance images of the terra satellite with a 500 m spatial resolution at daily frequency and as an eight day composite products mod09ga and mod09a1 respectively it also used the modis 250 m resolution daily and eight day composite reflectance datasets mod09gq and mod09q1 which contained bands 1 and 2 red and nir in the case of the aqua satellite images the daily surface reflectance products myd09ga and myd09gq were only used for the composite image using the brakenridge algorithm for single images brak because of a higher presence of clouds ticehurst et al 2015b and the malfunctioning of some sensors in the range of the swir wavelengths li et al 2014 for this period landsat thematic mapper tm surface reflectance images were also used the global surface water gsw mapping recurrence layer v1 0 1984 2015 pekel et al 2016 from the joint research centre was used as a reference to compare the occurrence probability maps obtained with modis rather than the water observations from space wofs product mueller et al 2016 because the gsw has a high spatial resolution is accurate has global coverage and is available in the google earth engine platform this product corresponds to the frequency with which water is found in a specific location from year to year and was derived from all the landsat scenes between 1984 and 2015 in addition the mod44w product was used to mask permanent surface waters when flood extent was analyzed relative to rainfall and discharge values in order to use just those areas that are periodically inundated all images were managed and processed through the google earth engine platform https code earthengine google com for both the modis imageries and landsat tm imagery masking of clouds and cloud shadows had been previously undertaken in the case of the landsat images a focal median was applied with a window size of three pixels to reduce noise the modis daily images were subsequently masked to reduce the noise at the edge of tiles and in stripes caused by the malfunctioning of the swir sensors in addition a mask based on the aerosol quantity was applied because it was found that fires affected the performance of the algorithm detecting water when there was none ticehurst et al 2014 2 3 water detection methods as indicated to determine the flood extent with modis images different algorithms were compared table 2 the owl algorithm was developed for australia by guerschman et al 2011 it calculates the likelihood of water in a modis pixel using eq 1 1 f w 1 1 e x p z where z can be formulated according to eq 2 2 z β 0 i 0 5 β i x i here the original parameterization was used and β0 3 4137 β1 0 000959 β2 0 0041 β3 14 1927 β4 0 4304 β5 0 09619 x 1 corresponds to the swir band 6 of modis images x 2 corresponds to the swir band 7 of surface reflectance images x 3 is the ndvi x 4 is the ndwi gao 1996 and x 5 corresponds to the mrvbf obtained from a strm dem image pixel values fw range from 0 to 1 and indicate the probability of finding water on the surface a second algorithm is the brakenridge algorithm brak for water detection with modis images nigro et al 2014 which can enable access to near real time flood maps at a global scale this algorithm has the advantage of using the mod09gq and mod09q1 datasets which have a higher resolution 250 m the nir and red bands of mod09gq and mod09q1 are combined with the swir band of the lower resolution mod09ga and mod09a1 products considering a series of threshold values and can be applied to both single and composite images brakc using the aqua products myd09ga and myd09gq and a three day window size however the use of single daily images to obtain flood images does not provide a standard product from the near real time global flood mapping webpage http oas gsfc nasa gov floodmap surface water is detected when the following conditions are met band 2 13 5 band 1 1081 0 7 a n d band 1 2027 a n d band 7 676 another approach is the algorithm modified by islam et al isl 2010 which combines the lswi and evi in a decision tree to obtain flooded pixels in this case inundated pixels are identified after removing pixels with evi values greater than 0 3 and with a difference in values between evi and lswi dvel greater than 0 05 subsequently inundated pixels are identified from the remaining pixels with evi values lower than or equal to 0 1 islam et al 2010 these algorithms were also compared with a commonly applied technique that uses ndis dao and liou 2015 zhou et al 2017 with thresholds to detect surface water in this case the ndwi and ndvi were combined where ndwi greater than 0 01 and ndvi lower than 0 2 were assumed to indicate flooded areas the ndvi threshold was empirically selected based on an improved performance of the classification compared with the ground truth landsat inundation images in addition since multi model combinations can diminish prediction errors li and sankarasubramanian 2012 an ensemble of the different algorithms was created multi model average in this case for each day the result of the different algorithms was summed and divided by the number of algorithms flooded pixels were then assumed for values greater than or equal to 3 classified as inundated in at least three of the five algorithms used 2 4 performance assessment landsat and modis image pairs taken on the same date were selected based on a window of 10 days after and before the peak of 90th percentile discharge events measured at the walgett gauge station furthest downstream gauging station in the catchment this approach constrained the image pairs to the period november to january when most of the rainfall occurs in the catchment flood extent images during flood periods were generated by applying the mndwi algorithm to the landsat tm images these images were used as the baseline for evaluating the flood extent applying the different water detection algorithms table 2 allowed comparison of the flood extents obtained from modis with the ground truth landsat flood extents for the same dates through a confusion matrix or error matrix congalton 1991 the confusion matrix enables calculation of the overall accuracy that is the ratio between correctly classified pixels and the total number of pixels eq 3 3 p o c p n where po stands for the overall accuracy cp are the correctly classified pixels and n is the total number of pixels the confusion matrix can be used to derive the kappa coefficient eq 4 chen et al 2014 which considers the random probability of agreement between the reference and classified image eq 5 4 k p o p r 1 p r 5 p r a 1 x b 1 a 0 x b 0 nxn where k is the kappa coefficient pr is the probability of random agreement a1 and b1 correspond to inundated pixels in both modis and landsat images and a0 and b0 are non flooded pixels in both sources commission and omission errors can also be estimated which correspond to pixels that are classified as a specific class yet are not actually that class and pixels of a specific class that were not classified as such bastarrika et al 2011 reference values for kappa coefficients are such that kappa 0 8 reflects a strong agreement 0 8 kappa 0 6 corresponds to a substantial agreement 0 6 kappa 0 4 can be interpreted as a moderate agreement and kappa values 0 4 indicate a poor agreement chen et al 2014 2 5 owl threshold the threshold to maximize the performance of the owl algorithm was determined empirically by selecting the median of the maximum kappa values calculated for each image fig 2 instead of using the overall accuracy performance measure this was undertaken because the different pixel classes between inundated and dry were unbalanced and this greatly influenced the overall accuracy performance measure at the scale of landsat images the values calculated by the algorithm in the pixels without surface water were generally more than one order of magnitude greater than the values in the inundated pixels thereby making the selection of an accurate threshold value difficult ticehurst et al 2015a as shown in fig 2 the kappa curves from the owl algorithm generally had a maximum around a fw threshold of 0 8 with the highest median at 0 87 a value that was subsequently used in this study to identify flooded areas 2 6 flood dynamics and frequency analysis to evaluate the spatial and temporal dynamics of flood extents this study calculated cross correlations between the catchment wide derived flood extents and the daily lumped rainfall over the catchment here the catchment average rainfall was used for two reasons first it was used because we were interested in the flood extent for the whole catchment rather than for individual sub catchments second it was used because the rainfall totals decrease rapidly going downstream in the catchment as a result local rainfall events at the downstream end of the catchment are unlikely to cause major flooding in contrast catchment wide events or events in the upper catchment can cause widespread flooding across the catchment given that these upstream rainfall events ultimately also reach the lower catchment using catchment lumped rainfall was reasonable following the cross correlations regressions were undertaken between backward cumulative daily lumped rainfalls at increasing time lags of up to 30 days and catchment wide flooded extents obtained from daily and eight day composite images the flood dynamics were also assessed using the maximum cross correlation values between flood extents and the daily discharge at the different gauging stations in the catchment permanently and episodically inundated areas were analyzed using a frequency distribution for each year the maximum inundated area was estimated using the different algorithms subsequently the per pixel occurrence probability pi j was estimated in the google earth engine platform by eq 6 6 p i j m i j n 1 where n is the number of years on record 18 from 2000 until 2018 and m is the number of recorded occurrences of inundation during the period n being i and j the row and column index of each pixel in the image respectively return periods were calculated as the inverse of the occurrence probability to create inundated area frequency curves at the catchment scale the same analysis was undertaken for streamflow data at the gauging stations located at walgett and bugilbone along the namoi river limiting the period of analysis to the number of years in which modis satellites have been in operation 3 results and discussion 3 1 general comparison and performance as an initial comparison fig 3 presents a log scale boxplot of the inundated area distributions calculated using the different algorithms the isl algorithm estimated the highest maximum inundated area and an intermediate interquartile range iqr 37 km2 while brakc estimated the smallest mean inundated extent and the lowest iqr 12 km2 given that a smoothing window was applied in the brakc algorithm nigro et al 2014 the peak and variability of flood extents tended to decrease which led to a narrower detection range of inundated areas the owl algorithm predicted the highest mean inundated areas and the highest iqr 56 km2 yet with the highest value lower than the isl maximum given that the iqr is a resistant measure of data variability and considering that flood events are mostly found above the third quartile in fig 3 it can be inferred that the owl algorithm could miss some flooded areas during large flood events compared with the isl algorithm whether this relates to over or underestimation will be addressed later in this study by comparing the flood extents with ground truth inundations the ensemble of the algorithms on the right of the plot resembles ndis yet with a lower iqr 15 km2 compared with 38 km2 thereby suggesting that it predicts a smaller range of inundated extents this behavior is a result of the ensemble technique in which flooded pixels need to be classified as inundated in at least three of the five algorithms used which leads to intermediate inundated extents table 3 presents the spatial performance of the different inundation algorithms using daily modis imagery for dates at which both satellites provided data landsat and modis terra the performance can be described as having poor moderate and substantial agreement for the different algorithms the isl algorithm performed best presenting the highest kappa coefficients and lowest commission errors this was followed by the ensemble of the algorithms comparing the rest of the algorithms the performance was quite similar except for the composite technique applied to the brak algorithm which performed poorly this may be related to the dynamic nature of flooding where the inundation extent can change rapidly within hours therefore this is not captured in the three day smoothing window of the brakc algorithm thus while it has been shown that the composite technique brakc can generally assess the temporal dynamics of floods nigro et al 2014 a spatial comparison with a snapshot of the inundation extents indicated poor performance in the case of the ensemble it performed slightly worse than isl for single events it has been recognized that the simplest multi model average can outperform single models when modeling time series data by reducing the spread of the residuals ajami et al 2006 however because single events are evaluated in table 3 the benefits of multi model averaging may not arise commission errors were generally higher than omission errors the resolution difference between landsat and modis 30 m and 500 m respectively introduced inaccuracies in the classification which can affect both omission and commission errors especially when mixed coverage classes are present such as in this study boschetti et al 2004 further the misclassification observed in the commission errors was caused by the difficulty in detecting flooded areas using the wavelength range of the bands contained in the surface reflectance product similarly the omission errors were on average greater than 0 15 which was again a consequence of the different resolutions for example small flooded areas cannot be captured at the modis resolution moreover increased zenith angles at the moment of image capture may lead to failure to detect water surfaces ticehurst et al 2014 in general there was a positive correlation between the kappa coefficients and the flood extent correlation coefficients ranging from 0 42 to 0 72 while the commission and omission errors were logically inversely correlated with flood extent with correlation coefficients averaging 0 52 and 0 64 respectively not shown meaning that the greater the inundated area in the catchment the better the performance of the water detection algorithms thus an increase of inundated extent improved the spatial performance because bigger inundated areas are more likely to be detected at the coarse resolution of modis which leads to smaller omission errors the same behavior was observed for the commission errors water detection algorithms based on modis take advantage of the low reflectance of water which also occurs with dark objects when developing an algorithm for water detection based on modis imagery guerschman et al 2011 observed that black clayey soils tended to be misclassified as water the same clays occur across the western floodplain of the namoi catchment green et al 2011 and are periodically inundated during flood events black clayey soils in the catchment cover a large extent for example just the central black earth floodplains which contain mainly black clayey soils cover an area of over 3478 km2 8 of the catchment surface and include only a fraction of the black clayey soils of the catchment welsh et al 2014 thus during major flood events misclassifications are reduced because these soils tend to be flooded thereby contributing to reduced commission errors and improving the spatial performance some examples of the performance of the inundation detection are presented in fig a1 of the supplementary data 3 2 flood dynamics and relation with covariates to evaluate the temporal prediction of the flood areas using the different approaches the daily reflectance images were filtered to those with less than 25 of the area masked by clouds shadows or smoke from fires the resulting flooded extents were plotted by selecting two years that presented large flood events including daily discharges in the namoi river at walgett fig 4 in general the different approaches matched the discharge peaks recorded at the gauge station and were related to several of the major rainfall events however some discharge peaks also resulted in no peaks in the inundated areas result not shown and some flood detection occurred with no associated flood peak even though the modis imagery has a daily resolution rain events and consequently discharge peaks are sometimes followed by several cloudy days which precludes flood detection in some cases schumann and moller 2015 leading to some missed floods related to discharge peaks or heavy rain events comparing the different approaches the method with the highest noise was the brak algorithm as a result the isl owl ndis brakc and ensemble technique detected the flood events more correctly in a time series and presented clear recession behavior fig 5 presents the relationship between the inundated areas using the different algorithms and the daily discharge at gauging stations at walgett and bugilbone the ensemble of the algorithms had a higher correlation with the river daily discharges followed closely by the ndis and isl algorithms in general the correlation coefficients r in fig 5 based on linear associations between the discharge and flood extents at both gauge stations suggested reasonably strong correlations in this case the relationship between the discharge and inundated extent was approximated as linear even though this is probably an over simplification of the data given the scatter of the points in contrast ticehurst et al 2014 on an area of 178 km2 including the victoria lake in australia used second order polynomial relationships in the current study the gauge stations and inundation occurred on flat areas of the catchment where infiltration rates were low because of clay dominated soils and open shrubland land cover which may explain the different relationship the cross correlation between daily discharge at different locations of the catchment and the daily inundated areas allowed identification of maximum cross correlation coefficients and associated time lags fig 6 displays this relationship for the isl algorithm noting that the main flow direction in the catchment is westward although the maximum cross correlation values can be unrelated to the runoff flood response especially at high time lags the moderate and strong associations between the variables the relationship with the time lags and the spatial relationship with other gauges a similar general trend and within the catchment suggest that these reflect the catchment runoff flood behavior in contrast gauges with weak correlations between flood extent and discharge and whose time lags differ from the surrounding gauges must be interpreted as not representative of the overall catchment behavior this can be observed in the gauges located just below the chaffey dam which regulates downstream water flow thereby affecting the natural streamflow pattern green et al 2011 in general cross correlation coefficients depend on the location of the stations in the catchment with values ranging from 0 to 0 87 in general downstream gauges which receive greater amounts of the accumulated flow upstream in the catchment and for longer periods have higher cross correlations however this general trend which considers the flow path length is also affected by the reach of the river for instance higher correlations occur in the namoi river than in the pian creek the temporal response of floods which can be interpreted as the time taken for flow waves to propagate downstream shows a delay relative to the river discharge in the higher elevation eastern sectors of the catchment with positive time lags of up to 15 days this delay is reduced downstream and in the lower areas of the catchment discharge peaks recorded at the stations occur after the maximum flood signal from the satellite negative time lags however some areas have propagation times that differ from those observed immediately downstream which are likely to be associated with local conditions affecting the flow hirpa et al 2013 this time lag difference between signals can help determine the main areas where floods would occur although the downstream stations tended to be more representative of the general hydrological behavior of the catchment which led to higher cross correlation coefficients between daily discharges and daily flood extents most had a delay in the flood discharge response which excluded any predictive capacity flood forecasting by using gauge stations requires selection of gauge stations within a catchment that have a close discharge flood relationship turner 2012 and where the discharge peak occurs some days before the flood response occurs this creates an opportunity to investigate whether the inundation images may be able to provide information on downstream flooding conditions some days in advance the analysis undertaken enables the selection of stations that could be useful for flood forecasts stations with good cross correlation values light green dots in the cross correlation values of fig 6 and long time lags blue dots in the time lag values of fig 6 are suitable to be included in an early warning flood forecasting system given that rainfall is the main driver of floods the rainfall flood relationship was also assessed fig 7 displays a cross correlation between daily lumped rainfall over the catchment and inundated extents for the different algorithms according to fig 7 the strongest correlation occurred consistently in all algorithms between 10 and 15 days other peaks in the correlation graph fig 7 could be caused by different types of runoff responses such as infiltration excess leading to correlation at lower time lags in the 40 000 km2 catchment or saturation excess leading to correlations at longer time lags however they are more likely an artefact of the analysis based on catchment average rainfall this removes the spatial variability of the rainfall and shorter time lag peaks could be related to locally concentrated heavy rainfall while the longer time lag peaks could relate to widespread rainfall and catchment flooding we did not investigate this routing problem further here another way to evaluate this relationship is to examine the relationship between inundation extent and accumulated rainfall this should detect temporal relationships between inundation areas from the algorithms for both the daily and eight day composite images of the surface reflectance modis products fig 8 clearly not all variation in the flood extents was explained by rainfall using a simple second degree polynomial to describe the non linear relationship between rainfall and flood extent other factors such as soil properties land cover irrigation schedules and the opportunity for water storage may affect the surface water extent in the catchment pekel et al 2016 in addition antecedent soil moisture conditions also affect the catchment response which indirectly highlights the relationship with the accumulated rainfall at different time lags in the case of the daily reflectance imagery the highest r2 related to ndis and 23 days of accumulated rainfall followed closely by the ensemble technique using the composite reflectance product the r2 reached a value greater than 0 6 with 13 days of accumulated rainfall as was the case for the spatial performance and the assessment against daily discharges the smoothing in the brakc algorithm led to lower correlations for daily rainfalls because it could miss the maximum flood extent table a1 of supplementary data the overall accumulated rainfall accounted for approximately 60 of the variation of the inundated extent using the composite reflectance imagery the assessment of the flood dynamics improved most likely because the output of the algorithms using the eight day imagery was less noisy 3 3 frequency analysis comparing the different occurrence probability maps fig 9 indicated that the inundated probabilities in the gsw landsat product were significantly smaller than those obtained from the modis imagery this suggests that the different flood extents were not just caused by the difference in the spatial resolution between the satellites more specifically despite the longer period of operation the lower temporal resolution of the landsat data compared with modis could lead to missing flood events and under prediction of flood extents mueller et al 2016 ticehurst et al 2014 the flood frequency curves calculated from the probability maps fig 10 differed from the standard flood frequency curves because the current study plotted the flooded area instead of discharge on the y axis the gsw recurrence layer derived from landsat imagery pekel et al 2016 was used as a reference noting that the flooded areas were smaller than those based on modis imagery despite the difference in behavior between the gsw product and modis imagery the general behavior of the gsw curve was similar to the curves using the isl and owl algorithm below a return period of approximately two years after this threshold the modis images had an inflection in the curves leading to higher inundation areas this inflection was probably caused by the topography of the catchment which could also be observed in the river flood frequency data in general flood areas were slightly greater for all algorithms using daily reflectance imagery compared with the eight day composite images data not shown which confirms that larger temporal spacing can result in a loss of flood extent information comparing the curves from the different algorithms indicated that below return periods of 10 years the inundation areas using the ndis were considerably smaller than the others yet all the modis flood detection approaches from the same reflectance product tended to have the same large return period threshold both the inundated area frequency curves derived from modis and the flood frequency curves derived from the gauging stations followed similar trends as neither of them flattened out even at large return periods of 20 years this finding contrasts with the gsw product which started to flatten out at approximately three years thereby reducing its applicability in hydrological studies thus an event with a return period of 10 years represents an inundated area of over 99 9 of the maximum inundated area of the gsw derived frequency curve while with the modis based algorithms the same event represented on average 62 of the maximum inundation extent from the frequency curves in the case of the river flood frequency curves the same event for both stations accounted for an average of 65 of the maximum discharge obtained in the period studied which was similar to the percentage estimated using modis imagery this confirms that modis despite its lower spatial resolution is more useful than the landsat imagery when analyzing processes that change rapidly such as floods 3 4 final ranking of the algorithms a qualitative ranking of the different algorithms table 4 summarizes the results of this study the ranking is based on how well the algorithms performed against the benchmark landsat image derived flood areas and how well they captured the flood dynamics relative to the gauge discharges the algorithms that performed the best are ranked first and the algorithms that performed the worst are ranked third based on the performance against the flood occurrence from the landsat images and considering the mean kappa values table 3 algorithms ranked first had mean kappa coefficients greater than or equal to 0 55 algorithms ranked second had mean kappa coefficients between 0 5 and 0 55 and algorithms with mean kappa coefficients lower than 0 5 were ranked third then based on the flood dynamics and considering the lower limit of a strong association between variables correlation coefficients 0 7 and the mean correlation coefficients between inundated areas and discharges at the walgett and bugilbone stations fig 5 algorithms that had mean correlation coefficients greater than 0 7 were ranked first mean correlation coefficients between 0 65 and 0 7 were ranked second and mean correlation coefficients smaller than or equal to 0 65 were ranked third the final rank was based on selecting the worst of the ranks previously mentioned based on table 4 the best methods in both spatial performance and capturing the flood dynamics were the isl algorithm and ensemble technique it is important to point out that when evaluating the spatial performance images with higher inundated areas should be considered especially if these present low sensor zenith angles because they represent more of the inundated areas which might lead to lower uncertainty in flood modeling 3 5 general discussion a few previous studies compared mapping of water occurrence among different satellites ticehurst et al 2015b in general two products were developed from landsat imagery that calculate the inundation probability in time one of these was used as reference in this study pekel et al 2016 the other was developed for australia and is available from the geoscience australia webpage mueller et al 2016 inundation probability maps from modis imagery have been generated at a smaller scale huang et al 2014 but without the use of a landsat reference and without development of frequency curves to assess the flood extent over time to our knowledge comparison of inundation probability frequencies between satellites has not previously been undertaken and such a comparison increases understandings of the reliability of the different methods for flood studies this study compared flood extents derived from modis and landsat gsw at different spatial and temporal resolution and highlighted the importance of high temporal resolution when studying dynamic processes such as floods however this subject requires further analysis especially for validating the inundation frequencies with ground measurements a comparison of the accuracy of different flood detection techniques using landsat imageries was recently published munasinghe et al 2018 however no studies comparing modis based algorithms for surface water detection have been performed moreover most studies evaluating these algorithms using modis imagery have focused on assessing their spatial performance by using high spatial resolution images as a reference the present study which compared different modis based algorithms also considered flood dynamics by using daily discharges from gauge stations and total daily rainfall as references in this case the daily temporal resolution of modis imagery is able to capture some of the rapid changes occurring during flood events which are frequently missed when using low temporal resolution datasets an advantage of capturing the dynamic nature of floods at a catchment scale is that it may help establish early warning flood forecasting systems by detecting gauging stations whose discharges present a strong correlation with flood extents and where discharge peaks are recorded some days before the floods occur similarly by understanding how floods are spatially located and their recurrence flood mitigation strategies can be implemented thus the information derived from the present study can be used to direct flood prevention investment and to select design thresholds to prevent damage to public and private infrastructure it can also support water resources planning by improving the quantification of changes in water volumes future work may involve downscaling modis images to the spatial resolution of landsat however an initial priority is reducing the computation requirements of the alternatives to achieve this further synthetic aperture radar sources which can be obtained from the copernicus satellites might allow greater precision in water detection and be used to improve the accuracy of the modis derived flood extents via both validation and downscaling however because these data are only just coming available online this will be a matter for future research 4 conclusions surface water can be detected using different modis based algorithms based on the approaches used in this research the isl algorithm provided the highest spatial performance compared with the ground truth derived from landsat images and had the greatest inundation extent when analyzing the temporal dynamic of floods the best performance was obtained using the ndis the isl and the ensemble of algorithms the brak algorithm created noisy estimates with days with large inundation areas but without matching discharges or rainfall in contrast the other algorithms captured the discharge peaks reasonably accurately and even indicated distinct recession behavior the relationship between rainfall and flood extents based on composite images explained around 60 of the flood extent variation at a rainfall lag of 13 days the relationship between stream discharge and the flooded area was spatially variable in the catchment with generally higher correlations at gauges located downstream in the catchment cross correlation coefficients reached up to 0 87 with a delay in recording the discharge peaks at the lowest stations of the catchment the gsw recurrence product captured significantly smaller inundated extents than did the modis derived inundation which can be explained by the lower temporal resolution of landsat images the gsw flood frequency curve was similar to the modis products for short return periods however at longer return periods the inundated area derived from the modis imagery was considerably greater than the gsw estimates in general the daily imagery identified greater inundated areas than did the composite images because of the higher temporal resolution which improved the estimates of the flood dynamics the results of this study can reduce the uncertainty in flood volume estimates for real time water resource planning and flood mitigation declaration of interest none acknowledgement the

6561,climate change and increasing urbanization pose huge challenges in managing urban planning for a sustainable future intense urbanization resulting in the so called mega cites aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow routes statistics show that flood disasters are one of the most significant in terms of damages and losses urbanization rates are increasing rapidly and it is important to learn how to live with floods by alleviating their consequences in the present and future this concern points to the resilience concept by including the concept of resilience in flood risk analysis and decision making urban drainage design moves towards sustainable drainage systems this study discusses resilience in the flood risk contextwe considered three main drivers to define a quantitative measure of flood resilience the capability of a drainage system to resist and provide its service continuously over time the capability of an urban area to recover from flood losses and the capability of urban systems to evacuate floodwaters and return to a functional state consequently this paper describes how flood resilience can be modeled and spatialized by a multi criteria index called spatialized urban flood resilience index s fresi the s fresi composition according to the resilience definition adopted combines the hazard characteristics and the system exposure and susceptibility to represent flood resistance mapped over time the ability for material recovery from losses caused by inundation considering the income variable and the functional capacity of the drainage system represented by the flood duration s fresi can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience attained by different flood control measures as well as in future scenarios of population growth uncontrolled urbanization or climate change the index was tested with coherent and consistent results in the dona eugênia river catchment in rio de janeiro four different scenarios were formulated 1 the current situation 2 the current situation considering the implementation of sustainable flood control measures 3 a future situation with the same infrastructure as today and 4 a future situation with the considered flood control measures keywords sustainable urban drainage urban development urban floods flood risk flood resilience spatialized urban flood resilience index s fresi 1 introduction the combination of climate change and increasing urbanization brings great challenges to planning and managing cities for sustainability recent studies show that climate change is very likely to alter the hydrological cycle in many regions causing a higher probability of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods bates et al 2008 urbanization also aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow paths floods are part of a natural process but when they occur in urban watersheds they produce negative consequences for the people inhabiting these areas both in terms of damage to properties and threat to human health and lives in the extreme situation in a recent report on natural disasters unisdr cred 2015 the united nations pointed out that 43 of them in the period between 1995 and 2015 were related to floods these events affected more than half 56 of all people who suffered from any type of natural disaster killing about a quarter of them 26 in many parts of the world the intense urbanization process and rapid growth of the cities has led to the emergence of so called mega cities which are especially sensitive due to major land use changes and resource consumption mega cities especially in late urbanization countries tend to be densely populated with many areas that have grown fast often with insufficient infrastructure resulting in environmental degradation and greater flooding traditionally designing flood control measures goes through a logical sequence beginning with hydrological studies followed by the definition of a design storm related with a return period the assessment of its consequent river flow responses and the design of a structural system able to resist this design flow finally leading to the implementation of the defined solution plate 2002 however there is always the residual risk of a structural failure or even the occurrence of a hydrological event greater than that of the storm design considered disregarding the residual risk leads to a false sense of security causing increased exposure to hazard in urban development liao 2012 mentions that such control measures result in damage to river ecosystems and increased long term risk despite the growing concerns flood events continue to cause extensive damages worldwide even in developed countries where investment capacity is higher this situation indicates the need to change the strategy for urban flood management recent decades have witnessed a considerable evolution in urban storm water management concepts see for instance fletcher et al 2015 current urban storm water management emphasizes source control distributed over the watershed to minimize changes in the urban water cycle by proposing integrated solutions within the urban landscape ahiablame et al 2012 conducted an extensive review of these practices showing their effectiveness associated with different types of interventions both at the watershed scale and at the lot level roy et al 2008 analyzing american and australian experiences stated three basic premises sustainable urban storm water management should maintain the natural ecological structure of the receiving water bodies the existing technologies are already capable of recovering the natural water cycle s functions and the watershed is the basic unit for planning and management ahern 2011 stated that adaptability is fundamental in the resilience discussion and that sustainability concepts are evolving from fail safe goals to also consider fail to safe systems moving towards a resilient system concept in the same line pender and néelz 2007 observed that throughout the world the way policymakers deal with urban flooding is changing shifting from the strategy of defense against inundation to a flood risk management approach to reduce flood damages risk management combining structural and nonstructural measures to prevent mitigate prepare respond and recover from flooding is a key factor to be considered within the urban water context flood risk management introduces concerns about the socioeconomic variables affected by inundation an adequate planning approach can reduce flood impacts creating a more harmonious relationship between the natural and built environments improving the population s quality of life by creating a healthier city and reducing public expenditures over time in a simple interpretation risk can be defined as a product of hazard and its consequences concerning urban flooding studies hazard is the probability of occurrence of a flood event and the related consequences will depend on the magnitude of the flood itself as well as the vulnerability of the system furthermore vulnerability is defined by physical social economic and environmental aspects tingsanchali 2012 in general when discussing natural disasters the hazard usually cannot be managed however flood risk has a peculiarity that distinguishes its behavior since the hazard even though related to the probability of occurrence of a storm which is the natural event that triggers the process is materialized by the consequent flooding in turn flooding is the result of the storm transformed into discharges by the watershed that receives the rainfall and where the socioeconomic activities occur sayers et al 2013 considering this particularity related to flood risks the hazard results from the interactions between the storm and the watershed depending on the performance of the drainage system eventual defenses already implemented and floodplain interactions over the last two decades technical literature about urban water management often discusses the concept of flood resilience see for example andoh and iwugo 2002 gallopín 2006 brown et al 2009 liao 2012 sayers et al 2013 meerow et al 2016 johannessen and wamsler 2017 in general resilience may be defined sayers et al 2013 as the ability of an individual community city or nation to resist absorb or recover from a shock such as an extreme flood and or successfully adapt to adversity or a change in conditions such as climate change or an economic downturn in a timely and efficient manner in order to make resilience useful in the decision making process however it is important to be able to measure and evaluate it since resilience captures a general picture by putting many components together for a broader analysis it has great potential for use in creating the management tools of tomorrow storms are natural hazards but the truth is that there is nothing natural about disasters we know we can t prevent a hazard from happening but we can prevent it from becoming a disaster and we can mitigate the impact learn about risk bring people together review our policies and make our communities resilient unisdr 2012 miguez and veról 2017 designed a tool called integrated flood resilience index fresi aiming to include a resilience measure in the decision making process to compare different design concepts for flood control alternatives this index reports a mean value of resilience integrated in the watershed scale comparing flood risk behavior in the future in relation to its values in the present fresi in fact is part of a framework originally proposed by verol 2013 in which the urban flood problem is approached step by step by considering diagnosis of the current situation using hydrodynamic models flood risk assessment using a multi criteria approach and a resilience calculation weighting risks in the present and future modified or not by different design alternatives this approach however is integrated over the watershed and resilience is not mapped in spatial terms in this context the present study proposes a new index called s fresi providing a quantitative tool for mapping flood resilience in a spatialized way in an urban watershed 2 flood resilience the definition of resilience johannessen and wamsler 2017 batica 2015 european commission 2012 ipcc 2012 mcbain et al 2010 is a discussion very much present in urban studies nowadays international bank for reconstruction and development world bank 2013 unisdr 2012 holling 1973 1996 defined resilience of a system in two different ways the engineering resilience concentrates on stability near an equilibrium steady state where resistance to disturbance and speed of return to equilibrium are the features that characterize resilience the ecological resilience on the other side defines resilience in a dynamic way accepting different equilibrium possibilities where the capacity to absorb the disturbance magnitude before changing its structure is the main feature holling 1996 stresses that engineering resilience focuses on efficiency constancy and predictability while ecological resilience focuses on persistence change and unpredictability the concept of resilient cities proposed by wong and brown 2009 considers the city as an integrated system that has to be designed to better face the negative consequences of a hazard and diminish its damages many attempts to bring the concept of resilience to flood management were limited to a search for increasing the stability of the drainage systems rezende 2018 liao 2012 highlights that engineering resilience usually prevails in current definitions of community resilience however when discussing resilience to floods this same author ibid stresses that urbanized floodplains are human natural systems where climate socioeconomic trends built systems and riverine processes affect flood hazards and consequent disasters they are characterized by complex behaviors and such dynamic systems will not stay at or simply return to a predetermined state community resilience may involve three main features as defined by birkland and waterman 2009 damage prevention speedy recovery and preservation of community functionality similarly miguez and veról 2017 defined resilience in a context of city resilience to floods as the capacity of a system to continue resisting even if submitted to stressful conditions beyond those established by the design criteria the capacity of the system to structurally recover from damages and the capacity of the system to reestablish functions quickly continuing to offer its services considering however flood related disasters liao 2012 proposes the concept of ecological resilience can be more appropriate to flood risk management since it relies on a more realistic multi equilibrium paradigm focusing pragmatically on system persistence however flood risks are associated to what can be called hybrid system in which a city can be seen as a socio technical ecological system berkes and folke 1998 hollnagel et al 2008 and both concepts of engineering resilience and ecological resilience have been receiving increasing attention rezende 2018 suggests that the search for resilience in the urban system requires the adoption of a continuous and retro fed process adding values of adaptation and harmonization in this discussion we think that urban drainage system plays a crucial role balancing the needs of the natural environment and the urban demands this system provides passage to natural floods while maintaining safe areas for general city life in this context if an engineering approach to resilience is applied to the system as an urban service provider it would be necessary to jointly consider the ecological resilience approach to open alternatives for a dynamic equilibrium when interpreting the flood risk management cycle recovering from a disaster should always provide insights for a different and new reference status learning from the past and adapting to future challenges in the unesco interpretation sayers et al 2013 of flood risk resilience appears in the flood risk definition as a component of vulnerability taking this definition as reference vulnerability is composed of the intrinsic susceptibility to damage of system elements the value of these elements and the resilience in this definition vulnerability is high if susceptibility to damage and value are also high in turn resilience acts in the opposite sense decreasing vulnerability when its value is high it is important to note however that resilience is not an opposite quality of vulnerability in fact it can reduce vulnerability but it has its own characteristics understanding vulnerability may be important to compose a broad framework where resilience also appears different aspects of vulnerability appear in the technical literature mainly regarding infrastructural economic environmental and social characteristics birkmann 2005 for instance postulated five different possible vulnerability approaches the first considers vulnerability as an intrinsic characteristic of the affected element within the concept of risk the second analyzes vulnerability as the level of susceptibility to harm or cause damage the third is based on a dualistic view that contrasts susceptibility to harm and resilience including resilience in the vulnerability discussion the fourth individualizes a multiple structure that considers exposure susceptibility responsiveness and adaptation and the fifth has a multidimensional character addressing the physical social economic environmental and institutional features of vulnerability in a comprehensive interpretation when focusing on social aspects the vulnerability approach tends to be directly related with resilience discussion usually considering responsiveness recovery capability and adaptation aspects this situation is interesting in terms of gathering examples of quantitative measures since there are very few examples of resilience measures itself koks et al 2015 proposed a social vulnerability index which largely relates to low resilience the higher the social vulnerability index the lower the resilience d ercole et al 1994 and wisner et al 2003 made a contribution by establishing a cause and effect relationship generated by the interaction between nature and society recognizing that risk factors are associated with a certain degree of exposure to a critical natural or social hazard that reaches vulnerability in certain groups this contextualization incorporated a temporal future perspective in the concept of vulnerability establishing that the most vulnerable groups are also those that face the greatest difficulties to rebuild their lives after a disaster thus these same groups may become more vulnerable to the effects of subsequent disasters this interpretation again brings the concept of resilience for discussion which manifests itself over time the smaller resilience is the more difficult the recovery process will be consequently increasing vulnerability the occurrence of a disturbance brings in addition to the impact itself an opportunity to recombine structures to renew and create new trajectories batica 2015 that is to adapt to a new situation which may respond more appropriately to future disorders meerow et al 2016 stated that resilience has a dynamic character recognizing the importance of its temporal scale where systemic adaptability must apply this perception considers the urban system as being complex and adaptable composed of socio ecological and sociotechnical patterns that go through multiple spatial scales in this way the concept of resilience approaches the sustainability discussion xu et al 2015 folke et al 2010 turner 2010 lélé 1998 since both concepts involve integrated results in a period of time in which the systems must continue to function and provide adequate services now and in the future therefore resilience is a broad and complex concept difficult to express in quantitative terms in pragmatic terms few mathematical models quantify resilience in a tangible way our work in general lines has an engineering bias and tries to offer a quantitative resilience measure in a spatial scale to be considered in the urban storm water management one of the few examples of a quantitative resilience measure is the work of kotzee and reyers 2016 they stress that there is a need to move towards approaches that manage the resilience of the system to floods by understanding and managing drivers of vulnerability and adaptive capacity they present a quantitative method where 24 resilience indicators related to floods are mixed in a composite index able to map the spatial distribution of flood resilience the indicators cover aspects of relevant social ecological infrastructural and economic aspects of three municipalities in south africa the lowest flood resilience was found in the periphery of cities often in peri urban informal settlements these places also had the lowest social economic and ecological resilience mugume et al 2015 presented a resilience index with the objective of quantifying the residual functionality of the system shifting the target of analysis from the hazard to the system performance when subjected to a large number of failure scenarios with certain magnitude and duration leading to the proposal of adaptation strategies verol 2013 also made an attempt to measure resilience as already cited in her work she proposed an integrated resilience index intending to support decision making on flood control alternatives this index was formulated to measure the response of the city in terms of flood risk control when facing an uncommon adverse future situation not predicted in the design process and surpassing its horizon this index however was able to measure only the overall responses in that study a scenario of future uncontrolled urban growth was introduced to map flood responses of different flood control candidate alternatives the best alternative in terms of maintaining flood risks under control was a combination of urban river restoration and sustainable urban drainage measures like green roofs detention ponds rainwater harvesting the use of a conventional upstream in line dam was found to be efficient for controlling overflows in the present but not so resilient to face future challenges the sustainable approach was shown to be also resilient and this demonstration is one possible contribution of measuring resilience however at the municipal level and in practical terms the implementation of projects to deal with floods and their consequences usually does not specifically target resilience issues instead municipal plans tend to focus on flood mitigation rather than in flood risk reduction the present study attempts to show that resilience can at least to some extent be described and spatialized by mathematical models and therefore can be included in the decision making process in order to guarantee better and more consistent performance of the chosen design alternative over time it is possible to measure some of the elements of resilience and combine them into a model using a multi criteria approach frequently indicators representing certain key aspects can be joined in a composite index reflecting the main characteristics of the studied system as a whole modeling results can say more than the elements taken separately and can increase evaluation capacity in the planning phase offering a simple and representative preliminary result without the need to rigorously model the system itself however it is always important to be aware of the model s restrictions the use of multi criteria indexes is always related with simplifications where some key indicators are assessed and weighted usually representing a certain facet of the problem not the whole problem indicating directions but not really representing the phenomena as a whole simplicity and ease of finding information are characteristics that make this approach very useful in the planning phase in this way this study departs from the original concepts proposed in verol 2013 regarding an integrated flood resilience evaluation of an urban watershed but evolves to a spatialized proposition that intends to map resilience and identify fragile areas that deserve special attention allowing a fine tuned diagnosis in the watershed domain it is important to highlight that even though a model can give insight about flood resilience it would be extremely difficult to create a single model that can express the whole array that resilience can entail therefore the current study contributes to the discussion by offering a relatively simple way to measure resilience in spatialized form 3 study site description the index proposed in this paper was tested in the dona eugênia river basin fig 1 located within the metropolitan area of rio de janeiro brazil which has experienced a great increase in urbanization in recent decades magalhaes and xavier 2003 many of the new settlements are illegal and built in areas that are not suitable for habitation the dona eugênia river basin has been a case study to researchers of the federal university of rio de janeiro ufrj since 1996 which has resulted in valuable observations and modeling data the river basin has an area of 18 km2 and occupies the municipalities of mesquita and nova iguaçu these municipalities are located in a lowland region called baixada fluminense and it is part of the metropolitan region of rio de janeiro city the urban areas of the watershed are mainly located within mesquita an environmental protection area in the upper catchment lies within nova iguaçu the urban areas are located in flat lowlands containing only small variations in altitude the population in mesquita was estimated to be 170 751 inhabitants in 2015 ibge 2014 the city has a number of illegal settlements many of them located along the river banks fig 2 a and b the poor infrastructure throughout the city combined with the illegal settlements and the general poverty has negative effects on flooding the river suffers from many problems originating from the unregulated environment structures are constructed along river banks invading river space and restraining the flow which causes an improper confinement effect in long stretches of the river eliminating river interaction with floodplains fig 2b vegetation removal in urban areas is almost complete silting processes occur in various river stretches and there are many illegal connections discharging sewage directly into the river and a general accumulation of solid waste the lack of sufficient sewage and solid waste management makes the situation of inundation worse due to the increased risk of contamination and spread of water borne diseases the impacts of inundation affect the areas with illegal and uncontrolled settlements more than that of regulated structures the uncontrolled settlements often suffer higher risk of damage due to inadequate construction and unfavorable placement additionally debris from damaged buildings can be moved long stretches away by flowing water which potentially exposes a larger number of people to danger 4 methods 4 1 s fresi formulation the s fresi conception considers the resilience components as proposed by miguez and veról 2017 therefore this new index intends to represent resilience by modeling three aspects the capacity of maintaining resistance over a period of time the capacity of the affected communities to recover from material losses and the capacity of the drainage system to recover its functions and keep operating after the storm guaranteeing basic conditions for urban services to return to normality each of these aspects will be modeled as part of the final index equation however this model does not intend to capture all possible interpretations of resilience this would be impossible by considering these three it is possible to consider changes in the drainage system setup and distributed interventions over the watershed to reduce flooding diminishing the hazard but it is also possible to consider adaptation measures that put buildings in a safer condition by avoiding the water entrance using gates or simply by building on pilotis in this case exposure is reduced when considering insurance or specific financing lines the material recovery can be facilitated in another possible measurable action therefore these considerations are important to understand the meaning possibilities and limitations of the proposed model the s fresi is formulated to integrate infrastructural and socioeconomic aspects with flood hazard considering the above stated premises as shown in fig 3 therefore the s fresi is composed of three parts each part acts as a sub index and the three sub indices are calculated by subtracting the indicators from unity in order to have high numbers representing high resilience while numbers near zero represent low resilience this choice implies that high resilience occurs when negative consequences are minimized the interpretations for the three parts of the s fresi are discussed before showing the final formulation as follows 1 part o n e 1 i h n 1 i e n 2 i s n 3 in the context of resilience part one of the model eq 1 aims to represent the degree to which the population and dwellings are protected from harmful physical effects it combines hazard exposure and susceptibility ih ie is dimensions to evaluate the impact of the flood in the study area similarly to the risk definition in fact if considered isolated it is a measure of resistance but if resistance is sustained over time it implies achieving a greater resilience in other words this part of the equation introduces a measure for resistance and the s fresi has to be used comparatively the capacity of sustaining resistance over time is assessed when comparing a current situation with a future modified scenario where a certain project may be tested against urban growth or climate change for example the analysis for a horizon of time gives the resilience bias to the index 2 part t w o 1 i rm part two of the model eq 2 aims to show the economic ability to recover from flood related losses irm connected to damages to residential buildings and their contents the higher the income is the better will be the recovery component of resilience with little adaptation external aids in monetary terms may also be considered 3 part t h r e e 1 i de part three of the model eq 3 aims to show the capacity of the drainage system to recover from overflows maintaining its functionality after the storm event occurs draining the flooded areas it is usual although undesirable that part of the city remains flooded for long periods after the storm ends this can occur for instance due to insufficient minor drainage lack of previous maintenance or due to clogging during the flood event because of the solid waste carried by the surface flows while a certain area remains flooded it is not possible to return to normality of the urban systems and services as a whole hence eq 3 is related with the duration of the flood ide and the way it affects pedestrians mobility blocks traffic and damages buildings when combining the three parts the s fresi is represented by eq 4 4 s f r e s i 1 i h n 1 i e n 2 i s n 3 m 1 1 i mr m 2 1 i de m 3 each part can be weighted according to its importance or relevance to the case under analysis however the focus in this study is on evaluating the adequacy of the indicators and the formulation as a whole so testing the impact of the weights was not prioritized at this stage therefore the three parts of the proposed equation were assigned equal weights m1 m2 m3 0 333 the three sub indices ih ie is have exponential weights n1 0 5 n2 0 25 n3 0 25 note that n1 represents the weight of the hazard while n2 and n3 together summing also to 0 50 represent the consequences it is important to stress that these weights can be modified to adapt to a particular interpretation and shall need to be properly defined by city managers or decision makers besides a sensitivity analysis is recommended as a further step 4 2 detailing the indicators all indicators that compose the s fresi are normalized into values ranging between zero and one each of the indicators is described below 4 2 1 hazard ih the flood hazard is mainly related to the flood levels which were taken as reference for the indicator ih water depths were determined by using a hydrodynamic model called modcel mascarenhas and miguez 2002 miguez et al 2017 and developed by researchers of the federal university of rio de janeiro modcel is based on the concept of flow cells zanobetti and lorgeré 1968 and it was used to produce flood maps modcel integrates a simple distributed hydrological model with a pseudo 2d hydrodynamic model incorporating several hydraulic links among these links for example are the saint venant dynamic equation surface flows broad crested weirs orifices pumps flap gates inlets and storm drains its main feature refers to the simulation of the surface flows together with the storm drains and the main channels the flood depths were normalized by dividing them by a reference flood depth therefore the maximum ih value was assigned to flow cells with water levels above the reference flood depth for all other cases eq 5 was applied the reference flood depth should be considered a threshold flood level where significant if not total losses occur if this threshold is exceeded here the reference value was chosen to be one meter above ground level 5 i h h h ref where h water deph in the considered area h ref reference flood depth 4 2 2 exposure ie all the people that live in a floodable area of the watershed can potentially be affected directly or indirectly by a flood and are therefore exposed to flood hazard the sub index exposure aims to express the relative exposure of the population using household density as its indicator higher household densities will put more people in contact with flood water the future scenario considered an increase in the population leading to a consequent increase in the household density the household density was normalized by dividing it by a reference value this reference was calculated as the 75th percentile this choice avoids distorting the scale since isolated high density values could compress a great number of values in the lower part of the scale all household densities over the reference value were given the maximum ie value for all other cases eq 6 was be applied 6 i e hhd hh d ref where hhd household density hhd ref household density reference value 75 th percentile 4 2 3 susceptibility is susceptibility can be seen as the likelihood of being affected by a flood consequence the assumption is that the impact occurs as property damage when homes have direct contact with flood water this assumption refers to single houses or ground floors of multi story buildings residences at ground level are assumed to experience greater material loss while those on higher floors are not directly affected although their inhabitants may be affected regarding commuting the designed floor spaces of the buildings in the watershed are small reflecting the low income characteristic of the population in this case this characteristic led to the assumption that all multi story buildings have only one household on each floor this assumption is also corroborated by field inspection hence every building in a flooded area generates one inundated household this is a particularization related with this case study in order to replicate this index in another watershed the proper characteristics of the urban occupation have to be considered to calculate it in the context of flood resilience areas with single family dwellings are considered more susceptible than areas with apartment buildings since all families in a single house area will be directly affected while only part of the families the ones living on the ground floor will be directly affected in an multi story building the sub index susceptibility eq 7 is calculated by the ratio of flooded residences to the total number of residences within the particular flow cell where hhinundated inundated residences hhtotal total residences 4 2 4 material recovery imr the sub index material recovery eq 8 aims to give an indication of the ability to repair or replace flood damaged property including damages to buildings themselves and their contents it is calculated by correlating economic losses and income where l monetary losses i annual income the method for calculating monetary losses is based on the master theses of salgado 1995 and nagem 2008 where the economic loss was estimated from calculations based on depth damage curves using flood levels and income classes the total expected monetary losses are divided by 30 of a household s annual income the fraction of 30 is a typical financing limit associated with the real estate market in brazil and it is assumed to be the annual amount of savings that a family can spend on recovering from a flood in this approach we assumed that annual savings are not carried over to the following year it is important to note that the household financial ability to repair and replace damaged items and structures is in fact a proxy for all possible damages e g the public financial ability to repair and replace public assets like schools roads hospitals etc this consideration implies that the severity of property damages represents the severity of all damages 4 2 5 duration effect ide the longer an area stays inundated the greater the consequences will be the indicator chosen to express this is flood duration resilience also accounts for the functional recovery capacity of a system this way even if a drainage system fails when exposed to an intense storm of a greater return period than that of the design rainfall for example it is expected that this system will be able to recover quickly from its failure discharging the overflows in a short period of time guaranteeing that other urban services can also be reestablished an updated version of the permanence factor zonensein et al 2008 is used to create the sub index ide eq 9 water depths above 10 cm are considered to hinder pedestrians water depths over 25 cm are considered to be harmful to city mobility interrupting traffic water depths above 50 cm are likely to damage buildings and their contents the time above these thresholds tends to be more critical the more an area remains flooded therefore the permanence factor has been separated and coupled to two different indicators multiplying ie and is already presented before accounting for exposure and susceptibility basically ie indicates how many people are likely to be affected pedestrians and people using cars or public transportation while is indicates how many apartments or houses are likely to suffer material damage due to flooding inside 9 i de 0 2 t 10 0 3 t 25 i e 0 5 t 50 i s where t 10 t 25 t 50 normalized permanence times of water depths above thresholds of 10 25 and 50 cm t10 reaches the maximum value t10 1 remembering that all variables were normalized between 0 and 1 when flood duration reaches 3 h this reference duration was defined because in this interval it is probable that a large number of people will be affected going to or returning from work or schools the upper value for t25 refers to 1 h which is sufficient to create a traffic jam lastly the reference value for t50 was assumed to equal to 30 min it is sufficient to heavily damage the residential contents 4 3 case study analysis the analysis began by looking at the model results in the present time without the implementation of any action to mitigate floods the first step was to get an overview of the situation in the study area by observing geographical variations of income flood levels and household density the idea was to see which areas theoretically should present low or high resilience values as a primary reference for the subsequent analysis second the sub indices were analyzed separately and thoroughly by comparing similar areas and assessing the consistency of the indicators finally each sub index was compared with the s fresi values to see how they contributed to the final result four different s fresi scenarios were compared the present situation with and without the implementation of the sustainable urban drainage project and a future scenario of saturated urbanization complete occupation of the watershed with an impervious rate matching that of the worst current sector with and without the implementation of the sustainable urban drainage project to evaluate the accuracy of the s fresi a qualitative analysis of the watershed was performed by looking at the flood levels in combination with income and household density by combining the three data types it is possible to get an indication of which range the s fresi values should be in and thus make an evaluation of the plausibility of the mathematical model an area with high water levels poverty and high household density for example is expected to be associated with low s fresi values 4 4 test scenarios the model was tested in two time frames the present and future each time frame was tested with the implementation of measures intending to mitigate floods and without them the four scenarios are scenario i present without any modifications scenario ii present with the implementation of a sustainable urban drainage project scenario iii future without any modifications scenario iv future with the implementation of a sustainable urban drainage project the project scenario applied to scenarios ii and iv was taken from verol 2013 and consists of the implementation of a fluvial corridor within a river restoration context plus sustainable urban drainage solutions such as floodable parks on site detention tanks green roofs and pervious pavements it is not the main purpose of this paper to discuss the project itself and the modeling procedures but we consider it important to give a brief example of how the model works and how the floodable parks and the infiltration measures were considered in the model fig 4 shows an example of the approach for a small floodable square infiltration measures were considered as a reduction in the effective rainfall future here does not refer to a specific number of years forward but instead implies a time when the city has reached saturated urbanization and 90 of its surfaces are assumed to be impermeable this means that the runoff increases along with the flood hazard no consideration was given to increased precipitation due to climate change in this work we do not seek to foresee a real future but rather we intend to test the proposed index however testing the method against possible climate changes is another possibility to be explored in future works it is assumed that resilience is going to decrease in the future in the scenario of uncontrolled growth and that the implementation of a sustainable project will increase the resilience avoiding critical negative effects although losing part of its efficiency therefore in scenario iv the urban sprawl covered all free spaces in the basin but the sustainable urban drainage measures e g green roofs pervious pavements vegetated flood parks vegetation cover on the riverbanks were maintained and their coverage in the new urbanized areas was taken proportionally to that of scenario ii 4 5 data sources the watershed is a well studied area with a long research history flood levels and permanence time simulations have been made by verol 2013 in her doctoral work river restoration integrated with urban waters management for resilient cities all water related simulations are made with the urban flood modeling tool modcel using rain events with a return period of 25 years which is the standard return period used in brazil for major drainage calculations ministério das cidades 2011 demographic data were taken from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge the evaluation of monetary losses in this study is based on two previous master theses by nagem 2008 and salgado 1995 the two studies were combined to get a value of the expected monetary losses from a flood event regarding both residential structure and contents the permanence factor as previously explained is a concept developed by zonensein et al 2008 that was adapted and used in the duration effect sub index visualization and classification of the s fresi was done using geographic information system gis tools 5 results the maps in figs 5 6 7 and 8 show the results of the s fresi for each studied scenario considering the weights as previously discussed m1 m2 m3 they show a broad range of values and correspond to what was expected a large increase in resilience can be seen when comparing current scenario to a scenario with the implementation of a sustainable urban drainage project the green color represents high resilience and orange colored values represent low resilience the different scenarios were compared and analyzed mean maximum and minimum changes among the scenarios were calculated to observe general trends the percentage of flow cells showing a change larger than 10 and 50 were calculated to get an idea of the variation of the s fresi values the numerical results of the analysis can be seen in table 1 column one shows a decrease in s fresi from present to future the mean value declined by 19 column two compares scenario i and ii showing an increase of resilience with the implementation of the project column three compares scenarios iii and iv showing an even higher increase of resilience with the implementation of the project considering that our index is based on a weighted sum one additional comment about these results refers to the possibility of a very negative indicator being counterbalanced by a very positive one leading to apparently acceptable resilience therefore a complete analysis needs to map separately each of the sub indexes observing the behavior of the partial results to avoid omitting a particular critical situation for a set of complete results including the partial indicators maps and the whole analysis developed please refer to bertilsson and wiklund 2015 these results besides showing the adequacy of the developed tool also stress the importance of considering sustainable urban drainage concepts when discussing and proposing alternatives for mitigating floods 6 discussion it is not reasonable to believe that floods or any other natural disasters can be completely avoided or fully predicted people need to learn how to live with floods and how to alleviate their consequences the reason to develop the s fresi is to be able to pinpoint some of the flood resilience related aspects that are possible to express in mathematical terms a multi criteria approach allows working with variables having different characteristics which can be normalized and operated such as demographic characteristics and flood levels there will always be weaknesses in simplified models that try to assign numbers to complex concepts however the measurement offers the opportunity of acting effectively and therefore a simplified model can still be very important and push urban city planning in the right direction 6 1 testing of the model and limitations the s fresi responded as expected considering the theoretical framework found in the literature review however some of the indicators intend to measure very complex matters and it is difficult to precisely evaluate whether they actually express what they are constructed to measure considering this there is always room for discussion material recovery for example involves many complicated issues for example as formulated now it expresses how well one can repair and replace what was damaged in a flood but perhaps this is not sufficient the original condition could be substandard so simply returning to this situation would not represent a real gain in resilience another possible issue refers to the duration effect this effect is also connected with exposure and susceptibility since low flood levels are expected to affect to a greater extent people and transportation exposure while high flood levels are expected to damage property susceptibility this is reasonable when just looking at the indicator but it perhaps gives the exposure and susceptibility indices too much influence when looking at the complete s fresi there would be a point in keeping all the indicators independent in order to gain better control of what affects what it could be interesting to write a simpler expression relating flood duration with temporarily shutting down urban services and then comparing this alternative with the first results obtained here all these matters are issues for further development so they will be considered when evolving the method 6 2 decision making tool concerning urban drainage the obtained results suggest that the s fresi can be a useful tool for urban water planning and flood mitigation it can also be a convincing tool to show the adequacy of sustainable urban drainage projects to increase city resilience however in order to incorporate models like s fresi into the decision process it is extremely important for politicians to show interest and commitment to creating a resilient society the graphical output of the s fresi makes it accessible to laypersons but an understanding of flood resilience is necessary to make the best use of it each case study will imply scale and normalization adjustments for the indicators to make wise decisions about flood protective measures however additional information will also play a vital role one example refers to the intervention costs which will always be an important factor it would be beneficial to make a separate study of how the s fresi could be combined with a cost benefit analysis the s fresi would likely be of most benefit if incorporated into a broader program to increase the city s general resilience the local government in mesquita has shown interest in previous flood resilience work at ufrj and both mesquita and the neighboring city of são joão de meriti participated in the making cities resilient campaign by unisdr unisdr 2012 this suggests a local awareness of the problems and a desire to improve the city through resilience 6 3 fresi variations and responses it is important to mention how different interventions can change the indicators and affect fresi responses table 2 exemplifies this situation therefore to help understanding this table we consider the river restoration approach where flood plains were recovered as well as vegetation cover on the riverbanks while houses in risky riverbank areas were removed for safety purposes allowing recovery of lateral river connectivity in this situation the hydrodynamic model gives less flooded areas with smaller water depths and fewer people exposed to floods interpreting table 1 ih and ie decline due to storage effects and people relocation increasing the first and third parts of the s fresi considering a second example if the affected area is covered by flood insurance the indemnities received by households can be added to the annual savings reducing imr and increasing the final s fresi value 7 conclusion in order to define concrete goals for reaching a flood resilience status and to evaluate its progress it is desirable to measure flood resilience the s fresi showed promising test results by combining concepts regarding resilience into single values that can be spatialized the s fresi makes it easier to understand use and work with the available and disperse information for example it enables the comparison of different flood control measures against each other the spatialization of the index enhances the possibilities to better detail projects in order to enhance their outcomes it also enables the identification of sensitive areas that are in the greatest need of improvements information about the spatial distribution of resilience is particularly valuable since well targeted resilience projects can also enhance the surrounding areas considerably by spatializing the resilience results they can be displayed in maps making it possible to easily communicate these results and quickly get an overview of the studied area to guide project actions by presenting the information in maps it would also be possible to include additional spatial information such as the location of essential services hospitals and schools for example or other objects worthy of protection the s fresi in its current state needs further testing following up the research of the s fresi can make it a valuable tool in urban planning it can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience obtained by different flood control alternatives therefore helping in the urban planning and flood mitigation decision making process 
6561,climate change and increasing urbanization pose huge challenges in managing urban planning for a sustainable future intense urbanization resulting in the so called mega cites aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow routes statistics show that flood disasters are one of the most significant in terms of damages and losses urbanization rates are increasing rapidly and it is important to learn how to live with floods by alleviating their consequences in the present and future this concern points to the resilience concept by including the concept of resilience in flood risk analysis and decision making urban drainage design moves towards sustainable drainage systems this study discusses resilience in the flood risk contextwe considered three main drivers to define a quantitative measure of flood resilience the capability of a drainage system to resist and provide its service continuously over time the capability of an urban area to recover from flood losses and the capability of urban systems to evacuate floodwaters and return to a functional state consequently this paper describes how flood resilience can be modeled and spatialized by a multi criteria index called spatialized urban flood resilience index s fresi the s fresi composition according to the resilience definition adopted combines the hazard characteristics and the system exposure and susceptibility to represent flood resistance mapped over time the ability for material recovery from losses caused by inundation considering the income variable and the functional capacity of the drainage system represented by the flood duration s fresi can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience attained by different flood control measures as well as in future scenarios of population growth uncontrolled urbanization or climate change the index was tested with coherent and consistent results in the dona eugênia river catchment in rio de janeiro four different scenarios were formulated 1 the current situation 2 the current situation considering the implementation of sustainable flood control measures 3 a future situation with the same infrastructure as today and 4 a future situation with the considered flood control measures keywords sustainable urban drainage urban development urban floods flood risk flood resilience spatialized urban flood resilience index s fresi 1 introduction the combination of climate change and increasing urbanization brings great challenges to planning and managing cities for sustainability recent studies show that climate change is very likely to alter the hydrological cycle in many regions causing a higher probability of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods bates et al 2008 urbanization also aggravates floods by increasing the amount of impermeable surfaces and modifying flow paths floods are part of a natural process but when they occur in urban watersheds they produce negative consequences for the people inhabiting these areas both in terms of damage to properties and threat to human health and lives in the extreme situation in a recent report on natural disasters unisdr cred 2015 the united nations pointed out that 43 of them in the period between 1995 and 2015 were related to floods these events affected more than half 56 of all people who suffered from any type of natural disaster killing about a quarter of them 26 in many parts of the world the intense urbanization process and rapid growth of the cities has led to the emergence of so called mega cities which are especially sensitive due to major land use changes and resource consumption mega cities especially in late urbanization countries tend to be densely populated with many areas that have grown fast often with insufficient infrastructure resulting in environmental degradation and greater flooding traditionally designing flood control measures goes through a logical sequence beginning with hydrological studies followed by the definition of a design storm related with a return period the assessment of its consequent river flow responses and the design of a structural system able to resist this design flow finally leading to the implementation of the defined solution plate 2002 however there is always the residual risk of a structural failure or even the occurrence of a hydrological event greater than that of the storm design considered disregarding the residual risk leads to a false sense of security causing increased exposure to hazard in urban development liao 2012 mentions that such control measures result in damage to river ecosystems and increased long term risk despite the growing concerns flood events continue to cause extensive damages worldwide even in developed countries where investment capacity is higher this situation indicates the need to change the strategy for urban flood management recent decades have witnessed a considerable evolution in urban storm water management concepts see for instance fletcher et al 2015 current urban storm water management emphasizes source control distributed over the watershed to minimize changes in the urban water cycle by proposing integrated solutions within the urban landscape ahiablame et al 2012 conducted an extensive review of these practices showing their effectiveness associated with different types of interventions both at the watershed scale and at the lot level roy et al 2008 analyzing american and australian experiences stated three basic premises sustainable urban storm water management should maintain the natural ecological structure of the receiving water bodies the existing technologies are already capable of recovering the natural water cycle s functions and the watershed is the basic unit for planning and management ahern 2011 stated that adaptability is fundamental in the resilience discussion and that sustainability concepts are evolving from fail safe goals to also consider fail to safe systems moving towards a resilient system concept in the same line pender and néelz 2007 observed that throughout the world the way policymakers deal with urban flooding is changing shifting from the strategy of defense against inundation to a flood risk management approach to reduce flood damages risk management combining structural and nonstructural measures to prevent mitigate prepare respond and recover from flooding is a key factor to be considered within the urban water context flood risk management introduces concerns about the socioeconomic variables affected by inundation an adequate planning approach can reduce flood impacts creating a more harmonious relationship between the natural and built environments improving the population s quality of life by creating a healthier city and reducing public expenditures over time in a simple interpretation risk can be defined as a product of hazard and its consequences concerning urban flooding studies hazard is the probability of occurrence of a flood event and the related consequences will depend on the magnitude of the flood itself as well as the vulnerability of the system furthermore vulnerability is defined by physical social economic and environmental aspects tingsanchali 2012 in general when discussing natural disasters the hazard usually cannot be managed however flood risk has a peculiarity that distinguishes its behavior since the hazard even though related to the probability of occurrence of a storm which is the natural event that triggers the process is materialized by the consequent flooding in turn flooding is the result of the storm transformed into discharges by the watershed that receives the rainfall and where the socioeconomic activities occur sayers et al 2013 considering this particularity related to flood risks the hazard results from the interactions between the storm and the watershed depending on the performance of the drainage system eventual defenses already implemented and floodplain interactions over the last two decades technical literature about urban water management often discusses the concept of flood resilience see for example andoh and iwugo 2002 gallopín 2006 brown et al 2009 liao 2012 sayers et al 2013 meerow et al 2016 johannessen and wamsler 2017 in general resilience may be defined sayers et al 2013 as the ability of an individual community city or nation to resist absorb or recover from a shock such as an extreme flood and or successfully adapt to adversity or a change in conditions such as climate change or an economic downturn in a timely and efficient manner in order to make resilience useful in the decision making process however it is important to be able to measure and evaluate it since resilience captures a general picture by putting many components together for a broader analysis it has great potential for use in creating the management tools of tomorrow storms are natural hazards but the truth is that there is nothing natural about disasters we know we can t prevent a hazard from happening but we can prevent it from becoming a disaster and we can mitigate the impact learn about risk bring people together review our policies and make our communities resilient unisdr 2012 miguez and veról 2017 designed a tool called integrated flood resilience index fresi aiming to include a resilience measure in the decision making process to compare different design concepts for flood control alternatives this index reports a mean value of resilience integrated in the watershed scale comparing flood risk behavior in the future in relation to its values in the present fresi in fact is part of a framework originally proposed by verol 2013 in which the urban flood problem is approached step by step by considering diagnosis of the current situation using hydrodynamic models flood risk assessment using a multi criteria approach and a resilience calculation weighting risks in the present and future modified or not by different design alternatives this approach however is integrated over the watershed and resilience is not mapped in spatial terms in this context the present study proposes a new index called s fresi providing a quantitative tool for mapping flood resilience in a spatialized way in an urban watershed 2 flood resilience the definition of resilience johannessen and wamsler 2017 batica 2015 european commission 2012 ipcc 2012 mcbain et al 2010 is a discussion very much present in urban studies nowadays international bank for reconstruction and development world bank 2013 unisdr 2012 holling 1973 1996 defined resilience of a system in two different ways the engineering resilience concentrates on stability near an equilibrium steady state where resistance to disturbance and speed of return to equilibrium are the features that characterize resilience the ecological resilience on the other side defines resilience in a dynamic way accepting different equilibrium possibilities where the capacity to absorb the disturbance magnitude before changing its structure is the main feature holling 1996 stresses that engineering resilience focuses on efficiency constancy and predictability while ecological resilience focuses on persistence change and unpredictability the concept of resilient cities proposed by wong and brown 2009 considers the city as an integrated system that has to be designed to better face the negative consequences of a hazard and diminish its damages many attempts to bring the concept of resilience to flood management were limited to a search for increasing the stability of the drainage systems rezende 2018 liao 2012 highlights that engineering resilience usually prevails in current definitions of community resilience however when discussing resilience to floods this same author ibid stresses that urbanized floodplains are human natural systems where climate socioeconomic trends built systems and riverine processes affect flood hazards and consequent disasters they are characterized by complex behaviors and such dynamic systems will not stay at or simply return to a predetermined state community resilience may involve three main features as defined by birkland and waterman 2009 damage prevention speedy recovery and preservation of community functionality similarly miguez and veról 2017 defined resilience in a context of city resilience to floods as the capacity of a system to continue resisting even if submitted to stressful conditions beyond those established by the design criteria the capacity of the system to structurally recover from damages and the capacity of the system to reestablish functions quickly continuing to offer its services considering however flood related disasters liao 2012 proposes the concept of ecological resilience can be more appropriate to flood risk management since it relies on a more realistic multi equilibrium paradigm focusing pragmatically on system persistence however flood risks are associated to what can be called hybrid system in which a city can be seen as a socio technical ecological system berkes and folke 1998 hollnagel et al 2008 and both concepts of engineering resilience and ecological resilience have been receiving increasing attention rezende 2018 suggests that the search for resilience in the urban system requires the adoption of a continuous and retro fed process adding values of adaptation and harmonization in this discussion we think that urban drainage system plays a crucial role balancing the needs of the natural environment and the urban demands this system provides passage to natural floods while maintaining safe areas for general city life in this context if an engineering approach to resilience is applied to the system as an urban service provider it would be necessary to jointly consider the ecological resilience approach to open alternatives for a dynamic equilibrium when interpreting the flood risk management cycle recovering from a disaster should always provide insights for a different and new reference status learning from the past and adapting to future challenges in the unesco interpretation sayers et al 2013 of flood risk resilience appears in the flood risk definition as a component of vulnerability taking this definition as reference vulnerability is composed of the intrinsic susceptibility to damage of system elements the value of these elements and the resilience in this definition vulnerability is high if susceptibility to damage and value are also high in turn resilience acts in the opposite sense decreasing vulnerability when its value is high it is important to note however that resilience is not an opposite quality of vulnerability in fact it can reduce vulnerability but it has its own characteristics understanding vulnerability may be important to compose a broad framework where resilience also appears different aspects of vulnerability appear in the technical literature mainly regarding infrastructural economic environmental and social characteristics birkmann 2005 for instance postulated five different possible vulnerability approaches the first considers vulnerability as an intrinsic characteristic of the affected element within the concept of risk the second analyzes vulnerability as the level of susceptibility to harm or cause damage the third is based on a dualistic view that contrasts susceptibility to harm and resilience including resilience in the vulnerability discussion the fourth individualizes a multiple structure that considers exposure susceptibility responsiveness and adaptation and the fifth has a multidimensional character addressing the physical social economic environmental and institutional features of vulnerability in a comprehensive interpretation when focusing on social aspects the vulnerability approach tends to be directly related with resilience discussion usually considering responsiveness recovery capability and adaptation aspects this situation is interesting in terms of gathering examples of quantitative measures since there are very few examples of resilience measures itself koks et al 2015 proposed a social vulnerability index which largely relates to low resilience the higher the social vulnerability index the lower the resilience d ercole et al 1994 and wisner et al 2003 made a contribution by establishing a cause and effect relationship generated by the interaction between nature and society recognizing that risk factors are associated with a certain degree of exposure to a critical natural or social hazard that reaches vulnerability in certain groups this contextualization incorporated a temporal future perspective in the concept of vulnerability establishing that the most vulnerable groups are also those that face the greatest difficulties to rebuild their lives after a disaster thus these same groups may become more vulnerable to the effects of subsequent disasters this interpretation again brings the concept of resilience for discussion which manifests itself over time the smaller resilience is the more difficult the recovery process will be consequently increasing vulnerability the occurrence of a disturbance brings in addition to the impact itself an opportunity to recombine structures to renew and create new trajectories batica 2015 that is to adapt to a new situation which may respond more appropriately to future disorders meerow et al 2016 stated that resilience has a dynamic character recognizing the importance of its temporal scale where systemic adaptability must apply this perception considers the urban system as being complex and adaptable composed of socio ecological and sociotechnical patterns that go through multiple spatial scales in this way the concept of resilience approaches the sustainability discussion xu et al 2015 folke et al 2010 turner 2010 lélé 1998 since both concepts involve integrated results in a period of time in which the systems must continue to function and provide adequate services now and in the future therefore resilience is a broad and complex concept difficult to express in quantitative terms in pragmatic terms few mathematical models quantify resilience in a tangible way our work in general lines has an engineering bias and tries to offer a quantitative resilience measure in a spatial scale to be considered in the urban storm water management one of the few examples of a quantitative resilience measure is the work of kotzee and reyers 2016 they stress that there is a need to move towards approaches that manage the resilience of the system to floods by understanding and managing drivers of vulnerability and adaptive capacity they present a quantitative method where 24 resilience indicators related to floods are mixed in a composite index able to map the spatial distribution of flood resilience the indicators cover aspects of relevant social ecological infrastructural and economic aspects of three municipalities in south africa the lowest flood resilience was found in the periphery of cities often in peri urban informal settlements these places also had the lowest social economic and ecological resilience mugume et al 2015 presented a resilience index with the objective of quantifying the residual functionality of the system shifting the target of analysis from the hazard to the system performance when subjected to a large number of failure scenarios with certain magnitude and duration leading to the proposal of adaptation strategies verol 2013 also made an attempt to measure resilience as already cited in her work she proposed an integrated resilience index intending to support decision making on flood control alternatives this index was formulated to measure the response of the city in terms of flood risk control when facing an uncommon adverse future situation not predicted in the design process and surpassing its horizon this index however was able to measure only the overall responses in that study a scenario of future uncontrolled urban growth was introduced to map flood responses of different flood control candidate alternatives the best alternative in terms of maintaining flood risks under control was a combination of urban river restoration and sustainable urban drainage measures like green roofs detention ponds rainwater harvesting the use of a conventional upstream in line dam was found to be efficient for controlling overflows in the present but not so resilient to face future challenges the sustainable approach was shown to be also resilient and this demonstration is one possible contribution of measuring resilience however at the municipal level and in practical terms the implementation of projects to deal with floods and their consequences usually does not specifically target resilience issues instead municipal plans tend to focus on flood mitigation rather than in flood risk reduction the present study attempts to show that resilience can at least to some extent be described and spatialized by mathematical models and therefore can be included in the decision making process in order to guarantee better and more consistent performance of the chosen design alternative over time it is possible to measure some of the elements of resilience and combine them into a model using a multi criteria approach frequently indicators representing certain key aspects can be joined in a composite index reflecting the main characteristics of the studied system as a whole modeling results can say more than the elements taken separately and can increase evaluation capacity in the planning phase offering a simple and representative preliminary result without the need to rigorously model the system itself however it is always important to be aware of the model s restrictions the use of multi criteria indexes is always related with simplifications where some key indicators are assessed and weighted usually representing a certain facet of the problem not the whole problem indicating directions but not really representing the phenomena as a whole simplicity and ease of finding information are characteristics that make this approach very useful in the planning phase in this way this study departs from the original concepts proposed in verol 2013 regarding an integrated flood resilience evaluation of an urban watershed but evolves to a spatialized proposition that intends to map resilience and identify fragile areas that deserve special attention allowing a fine tuned diagnosis in the watershed domain it is important to highlight that even though a model can give insight about flood resilience it would be extremely difficult to create a single model that can express the whole array that resilience can entail therefore the current study contributes to the discussion by offering a relatively simple way to measure resilience in spatialized form 3 study site description the index proposed in this paper was tested in the dona eugênia river basin fig 1 located within the metropolitan area of rio de janeiro brazil which has experienced a great increase in urbanization in recent decades magalhaes and xavier 2003 many of the new settlements are illegal and built in areas that are not suitable for habitation the dona eugênia river basin has been a case study to researchers of the federal university of rio de janeiro ufrj since 1996 which has resulted in valuable observations and modeling data the river basin has an area of 18 km2 and occupies the municipalities of mesquita and nova iguaçu these municipalities are located in a lowland region called baixada fluminense and it is part of the metropolitan region of rio de janeiro city the urban areas of the watershed are mainly located within mesquita an environmental protection area in the upper catchment lies within nova iguaçu the urban areas are located in flat lowlands containing only small variations in altitude the population in mesquita was estimated to be 170 751 inhabitants in 2015 ibge 2014 the city has a number of illegal settlements many of them located along the river banks fig 2 a and b the poor infrastructure throughout the city combined with the illegal settlements and the general poverty has negative effects on flooding the river suffers from many problems originating from the unregulated environment structures are constructed along river banks invading river space and restraining the flow which causes an improper confinement effect in long stretches of the river eliminating river interaction with floodplains fig 2b vegetation removal in urban areas is almost complete silting processes occur in various river stretches and there are many illegal connections discharging sewage directly into the river and a general accumulation of solid waste the lack of sufficient sewage and solid waste management makes the situation of inundation worse due to the increased risk of contamination and spread of water borne diseases the impacts of inundation affect the areas with illegal and uncontrolled settlements more than that of regulated structures the uncontrolled settlements often suffer higher risk of damage due to inadequate construction and unfavorable placement additionally debris from damaged buildings can be moved long stretches away by flowing water which potentially exposes a larger number of people to danger 4 methods 4 1 s fresi formulation the s fresi conception considers the resilience components as proposed by miguez and veról 2017 therefore this new index intends to represent resilience by modeling three aspects the capacity of maintaining resistance over a period of time the capacity of the affected communities to recover from material losses and the capacity of the drainage system to recover its functions and keep operating after the storm guaranteeing basic conditions for urban services to return to normality each of these aspects will be modeled as part of the final index equation however this model does not intend to capture all possible interpretations of resilience this would be impossible by considering these three it is possible to consider changes in the drainage system setup and distributed interventions over the watershed to reduce flooding diminishing the hazard but it is also possible to consider adaptation measures that put buildings in a safer condition by avoiding the water entrance using gates or simply by building on pilotis in this case exposure is reduced when considering insurance or specific financing lines the material recovery can be facilitated in another possible measurable action therefore these considerations are important to understand the meaning possibilities and limitations of the proposed model the s fresi is formulated to integrate infrastructural and socioeconomic aspects with flood hazard considering the above stated premises as shown in fig 3 therefore the s fresi is composed of three parts each part acts as a sub index and the three sub indices are calculated by subtracting the indicators from unity in order to have high numbers representing high resilience while numbers near zero represent low resilience this choice implies that high resilience occurs when negative consequences are minimized the interpretations for the three parts of the s fresi are discussed before showing the final formulation as follows 1 part o n e 1 i h n 1 i e n 2 i s n 3 in the context of resilience part one of the model eq 1 aims to represent the degree to which the population and dwellings are protected from harmful physical effects it combines hazard exposure and susceptibility ih ie is dimensions to evaluate the impact of the flood in the study area similarly to the risk definition in fact if considered isolated it is a measure of resistance but if resistance is sustained over time it implies achieving a greater resilience in other words this part of the equation introduces a measure for resistance and the s fresi has to be used comparatively the capacity of sustaining resistance over time is assessed when comparing a current situation with a future modified scenario where a certain project may be tested against urban growth or climate change for example the analysis for a horizon of time gives the resilience bias to the index 2 part t w o 1 i rm part two of the model eq 2 aims to show the economic ability to recover from flood related losses irm connected to damages to residential buildings and their contents the higher the income is the better will be the recovery component of resilience with little adaptation external aids in monetary terms may also be considered 3 part t h r e e 1 i de part three of the model eq 3 aims to show the capacity of the drainage system to recover from overflows maintaining its functionality after the storm event occurs draining the flooded areas it is usual although undesirable that part of the city remains flooded for long periods after the storm ends this can occur for instance due to insufficient minor drainage lack of previous maintenance or due to clogging during the flood event because of the solid waste carried by the surface flows while a certain area remains flooded it is not possible to return to normality of the urban systems and services as a whole hence eq 3 is related with the duration of the flood ide and the way it affects pedestrians mobility blocks traffic and damages buildings when combining the three parts the s fresi is represented by eq 4 4 s f r e s i 1 i h n 1 i e n 2 i s n 3 m 1 1 i mr m 2 1 i de m 3 each part can be weighted according to its importance or relevance to the case under analysis however the focus in this study is on evaluating the adequacy of the indicators and the formulation as a whole so testing the impact of the weights was not prioritized at this stage therefore the three parts of the proposed equation were assigned equal weights m1 m2 m3 0 333 the three sub indices ih ie is have exponential weights n1 0 5 n2 0 25 n3 0 25 note that n1 represents the weight of the hazard while n2 and n3 together summing also to 0 50 represent the consequences it is important to stress that these weights can be modified to adapt to a particular interpretation and shall need to be properly defined by city managers or decision makers besides a sensitivity analysis is recommended as a further step 4 2 detailing the indicators all indicators that compose the s fresi are normalized into values ranging between zero and one each of the indicators is described below 4 2 1 hazard ih the flood hazard is mainly related to the flood levels which were taken as reference for the indicator ih water depths were determined by using a hydrodynamic model called modcel mascarenhas and miguez 2002 miguez et al 2017 and developed by researchers of the federal university of rio de janeiro modcel is based on the concept of flow cells zanobetti and lorgeré 1968 and it was used to produce flood maps modcel integrates a simple distributed hydrological model with a pseudo 2d hydrodynamic model incorporating several hydraulic links among these links for example are the saint venant dynamic equation surface flows broad crested weirs orifices pumps flap gates inlets and storm drains its main feature refers to the simulation of the surface flows together with the storm drains and the main channels the flood depths were normalized by dividing them by a reference flood depth therefore the maximum ih value was assigned to flow cells with water levels above the reference flood depth for all other cases eq 5 was applied the reference flood depth should be considered a threshold flood level where significant if not total losses occur if this threshold is exceeded here the reference value was chosen to be one meter above ground level 5 i h h h ref where h water deph in the considered area h ref reference flood depth 4 2 2 exposure ie all the people that live in a floodable area of the watershed can potentially be affected directly or indirectly by a flood and are therefore exposed to flood hazard the sub index exposure aims to express the relative exposure of the population using household density as its indicator higher household densities will put more people in contact with flood water the future scenario considered an increase in the population leading to a consequent increase in the household density the household density was normalized by dividing it by a reference value this reference was calculated as the 75th percentile this choice avoids distorting the scale since isolated high density values could compress a great number of values in the lower part of the scale all household densities over the reference value were given the maximum ie value for all other cases eq 6 was be applied 6 i e hhd hh d ref where hhd household density hhd ref household density reference value 75 th percentile 4 2 3 susceptibility is susceptibility can be seen as the likelihood of being affected by a flood consequence the assumption is that the impact occurs as property damage when homes have direct contact with flood water this assumption refers to single houses or ground floors of multi story buildings residences at ground level are assumed to experience greater material loss while those on higher floors are not directly affected although their inhabitants may be affected regarding commuting the designed floor spaces of the buildings in the watershed are small reflecting the low income characteristic of the population in this case this characteristic led to the assumption that all multi story buildings have only one household on each floor this assumption is also corroborated by field inspection hence every building in a flooded area generates one inundated household this is a particularization related with this case study in order to replicate this index in another watershed the proper characteristics of the urban occupation have to be considered to calculate it in the context of flood resilience areas with single family dwellings are considered more susceptible than areas with apartment buildings since all families in a single house area will be directly affected while only part of the families the ones living on the ground floor will be directly affected in an multi story building the sub index susceptibility eq 7 is calculated by the ratio of flooded residences to the total number of residences within the particular flow cell where hhinundated inundated residences hhtotal total residences 4 2 4 material recovery imr the sub index material recovery eq 8 aims to give an indication of the ability to repair or replace flood damaged property including damages to buildings themselves and their contents it is calculated by correlating economic losses and income where l monetary losses i annual income the method for calculating monetary losses is based on the master theses of salgado 1995 and nagem 2008 where the economic loss was estimated from calculations based on depth damage curves using flood levels and income classes the total expected monetary losses are divided by 30 of a household s annual income the fraction of 30 is a typical financing limit associated with the real estate market in brazil and it is assumed to be the annual amount of savings that a family can spend on recovering from a flood in this approach we assumed that annual savings are not carried over to the following year it is important to note that the household financial ability to repair and replace damaged items and structures is in fact a proxy for all possible damages e g the public financial ability to repair and replace public assets like schools roads hospitals etc this consideration implies that the severity of property damages represents the severity of all damages 4 2 5 duration effect ide the longer an area stays inundated the greater the consequences will be the indicator chosen to express this is flood duration resilience also accounts for the functional recovery capacity of a system this way even if a drainage system fails when exposed to an intense storm of a greater return period than that of the design rainfall for example it is expected that this system will be able to recover quickly from its failure discharging the overflows in a short period of time guaranteeing that other urban services can also be reestablished an updated version of the permanence factor zonensein et al 2008 is used to create the sub index ide eq 9 water depths above 10 cm are considered to hinder pedestrians water depths over 25 cm are considered to be harmful to city mobility interrupting traffic water depths above 50 cm are likely to damage buildings and their contents the time above these thresholds tends to be more critical the more an area remains flooded therefore the permanence factor has been separated and coupled to two different indicators multiplying ie and is already presented before accounting for exposure and susceptibility basically ie indicates how many people are likely to be affected pedestrians and people using cars or public transportation while is indicates how many apartments or houses are likely to suffer material damage due to flooding inside 9 i de 0 2 t 10 0 3 t 25 i e 0 5 t 50 i s where t 10 t 25 t 50 normalized permanence times of water depths above thresholds of 10 25 and 50 cm t10 reaches the maximum value t10 1 remembering that all variables were normalized between 0 and 1 when flood duration reaches 3 h this reference duration was defined because in this interval it is probable that a large number of people will be affected going to or returning from work or schools the upper value for t25 refers to 1 h which is sufficient to create a traffic jam lastly the reference value for t50 was assumed to equal to 30 min it is sufficient to heavily damage the residential contents 4 3 case study analysis the analysis began by looking at the model results in the present time without the implementation of any action to mitigate floods the first step was to get an overview of the situation in the study area by observing geographical variations of income flood levels and household density the idea was to see which areas theoretically should present low or high resilience values as a primary reference for the subsequent analysis second the sub indices were analyzed separately and thoroughly by comparing similar areas and assessing the consistency of the indicators finally each sub index was compared with the s fresi values to see how they contributed to the final result four different s fresi scenarios were compared the present situation with and without the implementation of the sustainable urban drainage project and a future scenario of saturated urbanization complete occupation of the watershed with an impervious rate matching that of the worst current sector with and without the implementation of the sustainable urban drainage project to evaluate the accuracy of the s fresi a qualitative analysis of the watershed was performed by looking at the flood levels in combination with income and household density by combining the three data types it is possible to get an indication of which range the s fresi values should be in and thus make an evaluation of the plausibility of the mathematical model an area with high water levels poverty and high household density for example is expected to be associated with low s fresi values 4 4 test scenarios the model was tested in two time frames the present and future each time frame was tested with the implementation of measures intending to mitigate floods and without them the four scenarios are scenario i present without any modifications scenario ii present with the implementation of a sustainable urban drainage project scenario iii future without any modifications scenario iv future with the implementation of a sustainable urban drainage project the project scenario applied to scenarios ii and iv was taken from verol 2013 and consists of the implementation of a fluvial corridor within a river restoration context plus sustainable urban drainage solutions such as floodable parks on site detention tanks green roofs and pervious pavements it is not the main purpose of this paper to discuss the project itself and the modeling procedures but we consider it important to give a brief example of how the model works and how the floodable parks and the infiltration measures were considered in the model fig 4 shows an example of the approach for a small floodable square infiltration measures were considered as a reduction in the effective rainfall future here does not refer to a specific number of years forward but instead implies a time when the city has reached saturated urbanization and 90 of its surfaces are assumed to be impermeable this means that the runoff increases along with the flood hazard no consideration was given to increased precipitation due to climate change in this work we do not seek to foresee a real future but rather we intend to test the proposed index however testing the method against possible climate changes is another possibility to be explored in future works it is assumed that resilience is going to decrease in the future in the scenario of uncontrolled growth and that the implementation of a sustainable project will increase the resilience avoiding critical negative effects although losing part of its efficiency therefore in scenario iv the urban sprawl covered all free spaces in the basin but the sustainable urban drainage measures e g green roofs pervious pavements vegetated flood parks vegetation cover on the riverbanks were maintained and their coverage in the new urbanized areas was taken proportionally to that of scenario ii 4 5 data sources the watershed is a well studied area with a long research history flood levels and permanence time simulations have been made by verol 2013 in her doctoral work river restoration integrated with urban waters management for resilient cities all water related simulations are made with the urban flood modeling tool modcel using rain events with a return period of 25 years which is the standard return period used in brazil for major drainage calculations ministério das cidades 2011 demographic data were taken from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge the evaluation of monetary losses in this study is based on two previous master theses by nagem 2008 and salgado 1995 the two studies were combined to get a value of the expected monetary losses from a flood event regarding both residential structure and contents the permanence factor as previously explained is a concept developed by zonensein et al 2008 that was adapted and used in the duration effect sub index visualization and classification of the s fresi was done using geographic information system gis tools 5 results the maps in figs 5 6 7 and 8 show the results of the s fresi for each studied scenario considering the weights as previously discussed m1 m2 m3 they show a broad range of values and correspond to what was expected a large increase in resilience can be seen when comparing current scenario to a scenario with the implementation of a sustainable urban drainage project the green color represents high resilience and orange colored values represent low resilience the different scenarios were compared and analyzed mean maximum and minimum changes among the scenarios were calculated to observe general trends the percentage of flow cells showing a change larger than 10 and 50 were calculated to get an idea of the variation of the s fresi values the numerical results of the analysis can be seen in table 1 column one shows a decrease in s fresi from present to future the mean value declined by 19 column two compares scenario i and ii showing an increase of resilience with the implementation of the project column three compares scenarios iii and iv showing an even higher increase of resilience with the implementation of the project considering that our index is based on a weighted sum one additional comment about these results refers to the possibility of a very negative indicator being counterbalanced by a very positive one leading to apparently acceptable resilience therefore a complete analysis needs to map separately each of the sub indexes observing the behavior of the partial results to avoid omitting a particular critical situation for a set of complete results including the partial indicators maps and the whole analysis developed please refer to bertilsson and wiklund 2015 these results besides showing the adequacy of the developed tool also stress the importance of considering sustainable urban drainage concepts when discussing and proposing alternatives for mitigating floods 6 discussion it is not reasonable to believe that floods or any other natural disasters can be completely avoided or fully predicted people need to learn how to live with floods and how to alleviate their consequences the reason to develop the s fresi is to be able to pinpoint some of the flood resilience related aspects that are possible to express in mathematical terms a multi criteria approach allows working with variables having different characteristics which can be normalized and operated such as demographic characteristics and flood levels there will always be weaknesses in simplified models that try to assign numbers to complex concepts however the measurement offers the opportunity of acting effectively and therefore a simplified model can still be very important and push urban city planning in the right direction 6 1 testing of the model and limitations the s fresi responded as expected considering the theoretical framework found in the literature review however some of the indicators intend to measure very complex matters and it is difficult to precisely evaluate whether they actually express what they are constructed to measure considering this there is always room for discussion material recovery for example involves many complicated issues for example as formulated now it expresses how well one can repair and replace what was damaged in a flood but perhaps this is not sufficient the original condition could be substandard so simply returning to this situation would not represent a real gain in resilience another possible issue refers to the duration effect this effect is also connected with exposure and susceptibility since low flood levels are expected to affect to a greater extent people and transportation exposure while high flood levels are expected to damage property susceptibility this is reasonable when just looking at the indicator but it perhaps gives the exposure and susceptibility indices too much influence when looking at the complete s fresi there would be a point in keeping all the indicators independent in order to gain better control of what affects what it could be interesting to write a simpler expression relating flood duration with temporarily shutting down urban services and then comparing this alternative with the first results obtained here all these matters are issues for further development so they will be considered when evolving the method 6 2 decision making tool concerning urban drainage the obtained results suggest that the s fresi can be a useful tool for urban water planning and flood mitigation it can also be a convincing tool to show the adequacy of sustainable urban drainage projects to increase city resilience however in order to incorporate models like s fresi into the decision process it is extremely important for politicians to show interest and commitment to creating a resilient society the graphical output of the s fresi makes it accessible to laypersons but an understanding of flood resilience is necessary to make the best use of it each case study will imply scale and normalization adjustments for the indicators to make wise decisions about flood protective measures however additional information will also play a vital role one example refers to the intervention costs which will always be an important factor it would be beneficial to make a separate study of how the s fresi could be combined with a cost benefit analysis the s fresi would likely be of most benefit if incorporated into a broader program to increase the city s general resilience the local government in mesquita has shown interest in previous flood resilience work at ufrj and both mesquita and the neighboring city of são joão de meriti participated in the making cities resilient campaign by unisdr unisdr 2012 this suggests a local awareness of the problems and a desire to improve the city through resilience 6 3 fresi variations and responses it is important to mention how different interventions can change the indicators and affect fresi responses table 2 exemplifies this situation therefore to help understanding this table we consider the river restoration approach where flood plains were recovered as well as vegetation cover on the riverbanks while houses in risky riverbank areas were removed for safety purposes allowing recovery of lateral river connectivity in this situation the hydrodynamic model gives less flooded areas with smaller water depths and fewer people exposed to floods interpreting table 1 ih and ie decline due to storage effects and people relocation increasing the first and third parts of the s fresi considering a second example if the affected area is covered by flood insurance the indemnities received by households can be added to the annual savings reducing imr and increasing the final s fresi value 7 conclusion in order to define concrete goals for reaching a flood resilience status and to evaluate its progress it is desirable to measure flood resilience the s fresi showed promising test results by combining concepts regarding resilience into single values that can be spatialized the s fresi makes it easier to understand use and work with the available and disperse information for example it enables the comparison of different flood control measures against each other the spatialization of the index enhances the possibilities to better detail projects in order to enhance their outcomes it also enables the identification of sensitive areas that are in the greatest need of improvements information about the spatial distribution of resilience is particularly valuable since well targeted resilience projects can also enhance the surrounding areas considerably by spatializing the resilience results they can be displayed in maps making it possible to easily communicate these results and quickly get an overview of the studied area to guide project actions by presenting the information in maps it would also be possible to include additional spatial information such as the location of essential services hospitals and schools for example or other objects worthy of protection the s fresi in its current state needs further testing following up the research of the s fresi can make it a valuable tool in urban planning it can be used to measure and visualize the changes in flood resilience obtained by different flood control alternatives therefore helping in the urban planning and flood mitigation decision making process 
6562,understanding the diversity of urban water regimes in europe require dealing with governance instruments actors strategies and institutional environment to embrace it we propose a typology of synchronous urban water regimes delineating four ideal forms we highlight how actors strategies are embedded in institutional regimes and how sustainability perspectives depend on this urban configuration it gives insights on sustainable transitions their feasibility constraints and opportunities keywords water governance urban sustainability complexity institutional regimes public policy 1 introduction contrary to national or regional territories that exhibit a degree of inertia due to their limited margins for manoeuvre and political power relationships that hinder reform cities benefit from greater flexibility and thus have the potential for fairly innovative institutional dynamism that can lead to highly instructive management experiments barraqué 2006 lorrain 2014 these can then constitute spaces for building technical and economic opportunities to provide solutions to the multiple challenges presented in contemporary governance of drinking water and sanitation services oecd 2015 2016 1 see also table 3 1 water supply energy and financial risks loss of biodiversity and the associated productive protective and regulatory functions lack of technological innovation institutional and regional fragmenting to structure the framework of action in a manner allowing to embrace these diverse aspects the notion of a socio technical system seems to be an essential starting point indeed most social science studies focusing on water start by affirming that it is essential to life however although it is seen as a naturally available resource it is important to remember that it was first distributed in contemporary societies a long time ago and that this process has dovetailed with the development of urban infrastructure since the 19th century indeed inhabitants of towns cities and megacities now view their water supply and sanitation service as a vital socio technical system in the same way as gas electricity transport and telecommunications this highly embedded system ties in with the physical aspects of social life and its environment its morphology and properties water resources rainfall topography ecosystem determine economic factors fixed assets and legal factors contracts it also corresponds to a set of institutional measures for managing it within a given area that has its history and is occupied by social groups with their interests and conflicts of interest considering the water sector as just one technical system among others is an opportunity to step out of a sector based mindset that is shared by the research world and professional sectors alike above all it offers a means of shifting the focus away from issues that are deemed essential by the doxa lorrain and poupeau 2014 and that form the structure of today s water supply service efficiency of public private partnerships ppps implementation of the full cost recovery principle universal development of water access reduction of urban splintering etc while all these questions are legitimate and call for pragmatic answers they tend to isolate and focus on technical aspects of the issues whereas on the contrary it seems urgent to link them and to find collective social and political solutions ostrom 2005 2011 the urban regimes concept has emerged in the academic world in the past three decades in order to better understand the socio technical systems defined as the matrix of a city s capacity for collective action pinson 2010 p 12 this concept is crucial insofar as it asserts that the real challenge of urban water service governance lies at the intersection between issues relating to structured contractual arrangements the configuration of the actors involved and the instruments mobilised 2 today s urban stakeholder systems in cities are characterised by a high level of complexity fragmentation and interdependence between stakeholders and dispersal of resources the pivotal issue for urban governance is hence to introduce enough cooperation between the scattered components of the community to make sure things get done stone 1993 p 227 2 this research tradition emerged in the united states in the 1970s to try to understand in detail how local power was developing and report on the different types of city government it focuses on the emergence and stability of distinct configurations of stakeholders growth coalitions that help to explain the transformation of american cities logan and molotch 1987 stone 1993 the adoption of these research models as a means to understand european cities has been extensively studied prompting lively debate cf for example le galès 1995 they have been tested more recently to analyse water governance in the megacities of the global south lorrain 2014 although this approach is increasingly successful pinson 2010 its pertinence and accuracy should be questioned lorrain 2013 presents four critiques that question its heuristic capacity head on i failure to address the long term ii lack of reflection on the nature of urban producers iii reduction of the trio of institutions formal second tier and informal to formal institutions alone and iv understanding of governance does not take into account hierarchical coalitions it also seems that this approach which is socio political in nature and criticises neoliberal management trends gaining ground in large urban areas seeks to embrace new issues such as the valuation of development projects undertaken by distinct coalitions this issue of the autonomous definition of norms in cities whereby they deem themselves capable of establishing the right ones for themselves is echoed particularly in concerns expressed by proponents of public value o flynn 2007 who question the dominance of new public management over urban governance 3 beyond the negative effects of introducing new instruments such as performance measurement new public management reforms have tended to result in objectives being displaced public organisations have concentrated on adopting instruments instead of focusing on the purpose of their action thereby losing some of the meaning of public action 3 such discussions focus on methods and instruments allowing public and private values now deemed compatible to be expressed regarding urban regimes mossberger and stoker 2001 john et al 2009 stone 2015 a second approach which is quite different from the first one in terms of epistemological and methodological assumptions markard et al 2012 makes the issue of developing sustainable urban socio technical systems its key concern bates et al 2008 pahl wostl et al 2010 frantzeskaki and loorbach 2010 truffer et al 2010 westley et al 2011 brown et al 2013a the sustainable transition approach also focuses its analysis on the socio technical regime concept a regime is defined by a set of rules embodied in institutions practices and infrastructure it represents the structure that coordinates the activities of social stakeholders and groups they provide the system with stability and momentum they are responsible for lock in mechanisms meaning that the stakeholders carry out their tasks in accordance with these rules and do not look beyond them geels 2005 geels and schott 2007 such regimes also have a rigid structure that hampers innovation and thus prevents them from developing successfully and fulfilling their potential however they remain potentially dynamic since innovation still occurs at this level they can give rise to sustainable transitions geels 2005 created and maintained by a range of relatively autonomous but interdependent social groups companies consumers regulating authorities the regimes govern the systems i e they guide individuals behaviour and the decision making process and thus provide a degree of stability to become more robust this perspective must be capable of meeting three key analytical challenges fuenfschilling and truffer 2014 i accounting for a diverse range of socio technical regimes ii consolidating the theoretical foundations of sustainable transition studies and iii considering the pairing of institutional and material aspects by incorporating recent developments in institutional sociology lawrence et al 2009 some authors are trying to answer these critiques by considering urban socio technical systems as regimes developed by stakeholders with distinct institutional rationales fuenfschilling and truffer 2014 and reconfiguring their founding hydro social contracts from a sustainable perspective brown et al 2009 2013a 4 for brown et al 2009 the hydro social contract is a term used to describe the pervading values and often implicit agreements between communities governments and business on how water should be managed this contract is shaped by the dominant cultural perspective and historically embedded urban water values expressed through institutional arrangements and regulatory frameworks and physically represented through water systems infrastructure 4 however the theoretical consolidation efforts must be pursued in order to gain a better understanding of the institutional structure of the strategic framework in which supposedly sustainable compromises are negotiated in this paper we question the potential for proposing a renewed urban regime based approach geared to the specific context of water management in european cities such an approach must thus be capable of integrating considerations regarding the sustainable management of water related services power relationships within stakeholder configurations and the technical dimensions of infrastructure into a single analytical framework we are therefore at the crossroads between approaches focusing on the development of growth coalitions and the sustainable transition of urban socio technical regimes the question that connects them can therefore be worded as follows to what extent and in what way is it possible to combine the horizontal dimensions i e relating to instruments that both permit and manage the strategic behaviour of stakeholders and the vertical dimensions i e relating to the multi level structuring of urban reality of socio technical regime governance in order to obtain a better understanding of sustainable development in european megacities or in other words what types of social and material support can be deployed to make the institutional rationales developed by the various stakeholders involved in european urban water regimes compatible in order to co produce shared value that contributes to their sustainable development to answer this question this article will start by drawing on the theory of institutional resource regimes irr gerber et al 2009 in our opinion this theory provides a response to some of the limitations of the urban regime approach identified by lorrain considering the long term and institutions in a multi level perspective with several stakeholders while referring explicitly to the issue of regime sustainability sustainable transition approach however we will then amend it to obtain a better analytical understanding of the interaction between material and institutional dimensions as well as the wide range of strategic issues addressed by stakeholders involved in urban water regimes lastly we will conclude by discussing the conditions for bringing about synchronous sustainable urban regimes characterised by complex institutional structures i e by a wide range of challenges and objectives as well as several action rationales and coordination systems to conclude in order to make such regimes sustainable and to meet the challenge of technical and institutional complexity we will formulate an avenue for further consideration contributing to the emergence of democratically negotiated innovations 2 institutional regimes for resources and infrastructure a research programme to analyse sustainability although cities today appear to be among the few spaces favouring institutional innovation they are still a product of historical and institutional factors resulting from multi dimensional dynamics whose sustainability is questionable heynen et al 2006 whitehead 2013 pacquot 2015 the institutional resource regime irr approach applied to the governance of water services in europe offers a consistent and stimulating initial analysis it allows us to place public policy and property rights back in the centre of the analysis at a time when cities appear to be torn between objectives of sustainability and urban ecological security hodson and marvin 2007 more precisely it represents the key analytical building block with which we can redevelop a robust analysis of urban regimes and thus understand their potential sustainability see fig 1 2 1 the institutional resource regimes approach the institutional resource regimes framework is dedicated to analyses the link governance structure and the sustainability of natural resource uses gerber et al 2009 an irr coordinates resource users and owners through public policies and property in a delimited territory fig 2 5 public policies and property rights are the institutions of the regime i e the rules of the game north 1990 the analysis focusses only on formal institutions 5 the framework has a significant added value compared to others frameworks for our purpose saleth and dinar 2005 pahl wostl et al 2010 it takes into account property rights and public policy as well as the ways in which these two elements of governance interact with one another kissling näf and kuks 2004 gerber et al 2009 bolognesi and nahrath 2017 irr framework contributes to determining a potential for sustainable use according to regime extent number of regulated uses and coherence clarity of property rights and public policy definition depending on its extent and coherence an irr could take four forms non existent simple complex or integrated fig 3 initially the framework s central hypothesis claimed that if the scope and coherence of the irr increase then uses strive to be more sustainable gerber et al 2009 therefore an integrated regime appears as an ideal type today this hypothesis is nuanced actors behaviors could differ from what is expected regarding property rights structure and public policies this is due to the way they use institutions cheating misunderstanding of rules etc north 2005 6 this statement replaces in the analysis two characteristics of actors opportunism and bounded rationality because of these two features the future is uncertain actors may adopt unexpected behaviour and institutions might be less incentivizing than though by decision makers this point emphasises the need to think linkages between institutional structure rules of the game irr and the power games the game urban regime 6 as an illustration in many french cities water tariff structures do not comply with regulations deliberately in order to balance the budget or to make political gains therefore it is better to talk about the potential sustainability offered through the irr governance framework bolognesi 2014b 2 2 institutional resources regime and urban regime irr perspective allows incorporating historical and multilevel dimensions of governance structure within urban regime approach contributing to developing the latter approach analysis of the evolution of an irr leads to identify stages and nature of change as well as the new institutional constraints and opportunities that frame power games and actors strategies similarly it contributes to taking into account the multilevel structure of governance assessing the characteristics of an irr entails determining from which level public policies and property rights emerge it is of first importance regarding an urban regime because it highlights the institutional tools that actors could use or need to make inefficient to attain their goals therefore one could deduce that power games exceed the urban territory and draw these new frontiers finally these two perspectives enter hierarchical alliances into the scope of an urban regime lorrain 2013 the analysis of the evolution of urban water regime in europe illustrates the potential of integrating historical perspective into the urban regime approach kaika 2003 kallis and de groot 2003 this evolution went through three stages of regulation allouche et al 2008 bolognesi 2014b during the first stage 1973 1988 the focus was on resource quality control and on not impeding diversified use notably through the introduction of common drinking water quality standards and pollution thresholds the second stage 1988 1995 followed up on already established ambitions by adding many specific and sectoral measures to the irr such as the 1991 directive on urban wastewater treatment 91 271 eec since then regulation has mainly taken the form of a command and control system during this stage environmental uses expanded the scope of the regime the third phase represents a paradigm change in european urban water management with the objective of modernising the sector bolognesi 2014a this modernisation seeks harmony between environmental and economic objectives supporting integrated water resource management the irr seeks to rationalise governance via a process of commoditisation and liberalisation with the latter theoretically encouraging sustainable usage table 1 the irr perspective on urban water resources in europe allows us to characterise the governance structure in which users and owners should currently operate four key points appear the sustainability objective replaces the usage protection objective economic incentives and market instruments are privileged in stakeholder coordination regulations aim to facilitate the proper functioning of market based mechanisms and incentives rather than to control usage directly the pool of regulated users and stakeholders contributing to regulation is increasing and diversifying the new institutional structure impacts on power games within european urban regimes first actors have to manage with the liberal requirements as an illustration economic performance of services takes more and more importance while public value becomes a second order interest tabi and verdon 2014 renou 2015 private participation gains in legitimacy and develops bolognesi 2014a thomann et al 2016 additionally the impacts of institutions from different levels on an urban regime are perceptible for example article 9 1 of the water framework directive 2000 60 ec states that incentive tariffs should ensure full cost recovering and resource preservation it induces significant economic and financial constraints for service managers in european cities actors strategies and alliances change to compete mostly through the cost effective requirement or propose alternative views a second illustration is the impact of european directives on procurement and concession contracts that deeply change the way actors may interact from discretionary and relational negotiation to competitive tenders chong et al 2016 2 3 institutional resource regime and sustainable transition studies irr framework could strengthen sustainable transition studies in two aspects first it consolidates theoretical explanation of the link between institutions and sustainability focussing on extent and coherence of the regime helps to understand why regime path may be more or less sustainable gerber et al 2009 moreover extent and coherence notions contribute to understanding the diversity of regimes and transitions brown et al 2009 propose the concept of water sensitive city to understand sustainable transitions they advocate that coordination in a water sensitive city be adaptive underpinned by a flexible institutional regime with multiple infrastructures it puts the emphasis on the local level taking for granted that water governance is complex and fragmented nonetheless these socio technical regimes cannot take any forms possibilities are limited by a set of feasible institutional arrangements in that respect the concept of coherence in irr framework contributes to determining this set of feasible sustainable transitions consequently even if the local level is gaining importance in the governance of water services in european cities autonomy remains relative due to the irr being extended by control european directive and public policies create a strong institutional environment marking out the boundaries of local actors options stakeholder actions that produce standards for self organisation within the irr should therefore be appropriately coordinated with upper tier rules teisman and edelenbos 2011 the second input of irr to sustainable transition studies is the understanding of the impact of governance structure on sustainability both theoretically and empirically currently water governance in european cities is driving by a multiplication of formal rules and an increase in technical and economic complexity of service provision it leads to contradictions the increasing extent of the regime results in reduced coherence bolognesi 2014b as an illustration the water sector represents the largest number of violations of eu environmental law i e 20 of disputes keller 2011 the irr in which european megacities are developing thus facilitates local regulation but tends to lead to incoherence in governance due to the difficult relationships between different levels of government eu national regional and local contracting takes the form of local self organisation with little or no state involvement standing out from traditional types of public regulation ostrom 2010 bakker 2010 bolognesi 2018 thus the european urban water irr is evolving into some form of integration yet remains trapped in a complex form due to difficulties in improving system coherence table 2 bolognesi and nahrath 2017 provides with theoretical explanations of this trend they argue that european water governance tends to be lock in an institutional complexity trap which limits governance quality it is of prime importance for sustainable transition studies as it highlights and explains limitation for the efficiency of such transition urban water management remains a complex and fragmented area relying on traditional technical linear management approaches understanding institutional capacity is then vital the local level is gaining importance in the governance of water services in megacities but autonomy remains relative due to the irr being extended by control stakeholder actions that produce standards for self organisation within the irr should therefore be appropriately coordinated with upper tier rules one of the main structural challenges for water management in european megacities teisman and edelenbos 2011 in analytical terms this requires the framework surrounding irrs to be dovetailed with another capable of identifying stakeholder actions at the megacity level can be identified in order to appreciate how complex practices are in relation to the institutional framework it will lead us to break away from the irr approach in three ways i abandoning of the concept of integration as a normative horizon guiding the governance of water services in europe molle 2008 this will be replaced by the concept of synchronicity in order to construct an alternative typology for urban regimes ii renewed interest in the question of values which must be taken into account when reflecting on sustainability policies and the instruments used to implement them allaire 2013 iii widening the analysis of institutional diversity not focusing on formal institutions but integrating these with second tier institutions lorrain 2013 3 towards synchronous urban water regimes the contribution of complexity we propose that the complexity theory applied to the case of urban centres and coupled with questions on their instrumentation and values can give a greater understanding of how contemporary urban regime stakeholders interact in order to produce the city and thus the mode of water services governance to do this it is helpful to put aside the established public and private categories and to take into account the instruments used the principles that these put forward and the values held by stakeholders it then leads to a renewed typology of urban regimes that are qualified as synchronous 3 1 embracing complexity to obtain a better analysis of water service governance according to teisman and edelenbos 2011 attempts to implement policies pertaining to integrated water resource management are bound to fail repeatedly fragmentation is not a problem that can be solved our starting point is that solutions based on the idea of regaining control and taking back responsibility will ultimately only lead to further fragmentation coordination and integration amount to drawing new boundaries and creating new disputes over who is in charge or what has to be integrated or coordinated again pp104 105 these authors contend that the definition of boundaries has from this perspective become a continual process contesting the idea of a stable balance between policy structures and processes in an efficient governance therefore it is the very concept of integration that must be reconsidered integration is still needed in order to create mutually satisfactory results but it will be impossible to obtain an integrated plan a lead organisation or a dominant procedure a more precise conceptualisation of integration is needed p106 3 2 integration multi tier adaptation and synchronisation these same authors thus propose to view integration as a dual process of mutual adaptation that is taken into account through the complexity theory cilliers 1998 for horizontal integration and mutual adaptation processes this approach indeed encourages self organisation a concept that deals with the ways in which processes emerge develop and evolve according to teisman et al 2009 these processes are formed out of events actions and interactions and together create an institutional structure one important point must be stressed self organisation stems from the de facto freedom of choice and action granted to people and organisations whatever their position in the system even when subject to an extreme power they are still able to choose and act freely this freedom can be used to act either self referentially or more adaptively 7 self organisation is defined in complexity theory as the emergence of new structures implemented through local interaction but not imposed by an external or internal stakeholder it is inspired by the responsive capacity of stakeholders and sub systems that are capable of receiving encoding transforming and registering information and of using it to enlighten their actions teisman et al 2009 7 1 without the capacity for self organisation integration beyond contradictory boundaries will not be easy to achieve integration takes place when the outcome of mutual adjustment and interactive governance is supported by people and organisations higher up in the formal bureaucratic government system yet these people and organisations can easily reject or thwart these self organisation capabilities in such cases fragmentation will become a source of complaints integration takes place when self organising units comply with rules procedures and policies developed by people and organisations higher up in the system they can however also obstruct them teisman et al 2009 this understanding of coordination and integration differs slightly from conventional ideas on mutual adaptation synchronisation supposes that a structure is insufficient to stimulate integration but that there is institutional diversity ostrom 2005 within which the boundaries are constantly changing requiring new interconnections to be made between them williams 2002 furthermore synchronisation supposes that continual adaptation must take place between scales and levels young 2002 due to the nested nature of water governance systems constant interaction is required between the autonomous system and the system as a whole adger et al 2005 synchronisation in systems takes place between sectors schedules areas procedures projects and programmes without any of these systems losing its respective logic or added value flood 1999 teisman et al 2009 in the end integration results from a process of synchronisation in which stakeholders with mutually accepted identities form coalitions capable of cooperating on a series of actions at a certain place and time without being part of a hierarchical structure hunt and shackley 1999 p 147 synchronisation becomes clear once the stakeholders concerned can balance their personal interest with the development of a mutual interest acceptable to all insisting on the coalition concept as an element of an integration process based on synchronisation also creates a link with the urban regime concept defined in the introduction while clarifying its theoretical consistency the next step is to understand the diversity of situations observed through these concepts two different types of self organisation can be found in the complexity theory autopoietic self organisation and dissipative self organisation teisman et al 2009 the former reinforces sub system stability stakeholders do not mutually reorganise at least not radically they continue to exist as they are but are entirely conscious of their interdependence with other stakeholders and organisations the second type of self organisation is dissipative or adaptive whereby sub systems are confronted with results that are unsatisfactory for them and the system generally so they start to envisage new boundaries for the content and system dissipative self organisation incorporates the process into a more dynamic system in which it can attain a new temporary balance and become compatible with its environment once again synchronicity is based on the idea that governance systems are not clearly organised stable or demarcated and can evolve according to an array of trajectories depending on the nature of the synchronicity taking place there is no ideal level or perfectly defined boundary in terms of the people and elements called on to resolve pernicious and complex issues adger et al 2005 in this context the analysis of these systems should focus more on the tools or instruments that are created through mutual action and geared towards joint action rather than on the structures once these elements are available a diverse range of synchronous regimes can be envisaged 3 3 instrumentation and complexity a typology for synchronous urban regime our hypothesis is that water governance challenges differ in their nature territorial and institutional fragmentation inherent to the water sector multi tier governance low capacity of local level stakeholders lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities contested use allocation and that an approach based on complexity and in particular synchronicity is required in response an oecd report 2011 covering 17 countries concurs it points out that in most countries whatever the level of decentralisation public water governance is fragmented and would benefit from better water policy coordination due to the importance of local stakeholders and territorial particularities in the water sector decision makers should not try to avoid difficulties by favouring traditional top down policies but should instead find the means to maintain coherence while preserving diversity the real challenges are to implement policies that are clearly identified adjust them to local contexts overcome obstacles to reforms and bring together the principal stakeholders in different sectors so that they cooperate to share risks and responsibilities the oecd report 2011 thus explores deficits in terms of water policy coordination based on a methodological framework created to diagnose the challenges of multi level governance in decentralised public policies and to identify suitable mechanisms to address them this report therefore suggests making a connection between deficits in water systems and the type of instrumentation to be deployed table 3 based on the research and considerations introduced in parts 1 2 an initial summary may be attempted the theory on institutional resource regimes will be amended by i abandoning the concept of integration ii replacing it with that of synchronisation and iii using concepts of extensions by control or self organisation and cohesion autopoietic or dissipative combining these variables gives us a typology for synchronous urban regimes table 4 each polarised case can be presented rapidly and relates to an archetypal case in order to understand their entire content reference can be made to the works of bulkeley and kern 2006 and bulkeley et al 2016 1 and the flux journal issue 2014 on the history of urban water networks 8 see the journal issue on the history of urban water networks 2014 vol 3 4 issues 97 98 8 integrative synchronous regime in a framework of action where predictive control and problem solving dominate urban regime stakeholders follow an integration rationale and will seek the multi scale and multi level alignment of the wider structure and the different urban functions teisman et al 2009 entrepreneurial synchronous regime in a framework of action where non predictive control and problem solving dominate urban regime stakeholders follow an effectuation rationale sarasvathy 2008 the effectiveness of this rationale is not based on optimising or maximising gains as the future is unpredictable but on minimising authorised losses since the future and particularly the related risks has to be managed resilient synchronous regime in a framework of action where predictive control and problem framing dominate urban regime stakeholders follow a resilience rationale adger et al 2005 that aims to re establish a meta stable balance between the various urban water functions piquette and wintz 2009 transformative synchronous regime in a framework of action where non predictive control and problem framing dominate urban regime stakeholders follow a transformation rationale this involves revising the nature of the hydro social contract that structures the city s development and moving towards the construction of water sensitive cities brown et al 2009 a situation of pluralism overlapping responsibilities and scattered resources that created incentives for cooperation ultimately allowed capacity for action to be rebuilt in cities pinson 2010 mechanisms for aggregating interests as well as forms of inter institutional dialogue were invented to enable organisationally complex situations to prosper a set of incentive association enrolment and mobilisation mechanisms intended to enable consistent collective action in a context of organisational fragmentation and dispersed resources has thus a priori brought about renewed diversity in governable urban regimes in order to facilitate the empirical validation of the proposed approach and to demonstrate its originality we can summarize our contribution as follows it seems possible to understand the diversity of urban water regimes after requiring the three ps policies persons places introduced by the oecd in its recent studies 2016 p 20 the issue is to focus on three new key variables characterizing the new context of urban action more complex problem framing degree of autonomy of local actors in the enunciation of the nature and boundaries of the urban problems to be solved procedures the mechanisms aiming at reducing institutional and organisational fragmentation in urban areas social processes the social dynamics involving the various stakeholders in the urban fabric a first ordering of the empirical diversity mobilizing these categories was carried out appendix a it needs to be completed and enriched far from the constant reconfiguration of functional territories that institutional territories attempt in vain to emulate an alternative to the chaos scenario seems to have prevailed in the large cities of developed countries of europe in particular with regard to this first appraisal many authors call for the widespread implementation of the normative ideal borrowed from hydro sensitive cities 9 see the many contributions in journals dedicated to transition studies in the past ten years environmental innovations and societal transitions technological forecasting and social change research policy etc 9 a deeper examination of urban development enables this proposition to be qualified the sustainability of synchronous regimes that borrow as a priority from the transformative ideal form must be considered in the light of its position within a globalised economy which distorts the way in which the instruments supposed to give it substance function 4 cities globalisation and values the viability of synchronous regimes in question according to numerous analysts the new urban coalitions that have come to power would be capable of making complex territorial systems viable by means of new instruments in the field of water service governance the central issue involves nothing less than inventing new urban forms to be structured around flexible socio technical mechanisms the main argument here is that while modernising under the effect of restrictive incentive based policies cities have been swept along by economic globalisation since the end of the 20thcentury the new phenomenon that must be highlighted concerns the increasing role being played in urban development by new protagonists in particular large private firms that are listed on the stock market and have market value 10 these firms may all be different but since they are listed on the stock market they are all subject to the demands of financial performance and will assess projects from a value perspective this economic and financial rational penetrates quite deeply both directly and indirectly into the range of instruments shaped by synchronous regimes in order to structure the development trajectory of the urban territories considered 10 the viability of these set ups can be questioned from three points of view 1 the democratic deficit in the functioning of these regimes 2 urban development stakeholders coming under the partial control of the global financial system and 3 controlled isomorphism in urban development standards 4 1 the democratic deficit legitimacy and responsibility in question the legitimacy responsibility and power held by or delegated to the new urban development stakeholders can indeed be questioned regarding the governance of water services in france canneva and guérin schneider 2011 denounced the influence of certain industrial lobbyists who attempted to water down a law proposed by d voynet aiming to reform water sector governance by establishing performance indicators to be supervised by the public authority since 2002 they have succeeded in reducing this instrument intended to bring about modern efficient and fair regulation to a mere reporting mechanism the problem for cities and megacities will hence not appear in terms of institutional fragmentation dispersed resources or lack of governability but rather in terms of the effects of coalition mechanisms on the distribution of power and forms of political mobilisation the consolidation of urban regimes qualified here as synchronous in particular risks pushing city governance towards oligarchy and post democracy pinson 2010 swyngedouw 2005 11 swyngedouw denounces the grey accountability of hierarchically articulated and non formalised and procedurally legitimised associations of governance 2005 p 199 11 the concept of institutional evasion introduced by pinson thus echoes the observation that most decisions are taken outside local assemblies be they municipal or inter municipal moreover collaboration on large projects and strategic planning mechanisms within ad hoc committees generally associates a limited number of elected officials with important technical and economic stakeholders who end up constituting an urban authority elite operating outside the official sphere of representative democracy in his analysis of the link between cities and the market lorrain 2013 also expresses concern about the excessive power acquired by certain growth coalitions these new alliances combine access to exceptional public resources and an integrated architecture making them absolute developers their power is not limited by the usual checks and balances of certified accounting shareholder reporting political opposition or an independent press these growth hierarchies thus have a disturbing amount of power which should be better controlled barreteau and daniell 2014 4 2 the operational deficit complications in management and partial control over stakeholders in urban development if we wish to pinpoint precisely the new urban regimes that have emerged it is useful to take into account all the stakeholders operating in urban development and not just the most visible ones influence begins very high up in the decision making chain the traditional circle of promoters developers and utility providers should be widened to include conglomerates engineering consultancies and industrial firms developing new sustainable equipment the water energy nexus concept is thus giving rise to a whole new sector where providers offering smart equipment to make cities sustainable world economic forum 2011 regard themselves as specifiers of technology in competition with one another likewise recent developments have affected the funding of urban development notably with increasing involvement from pension funds giving value to market able solutions torrance 2008 brenner 2013 as shown by truffer et al 2010 urban regimes ultimately find themselves at the centre of conflicting institutional rationales which far from allowing the emergence of water sensitive cities instead of hinder and complicate urban governance although the water sensitive paradigm emerges to an extent it has to contend with resistance from the traditional water paradigm and with the increasingly assertive market paradigm ultimately making the urban territory difficult to govern the urban socio technical system is then considered as a semi coherent organisational field i e characterised by institutionalisation levels some robust and aligned and others less so and honed within the system itself by a wide range of institutional sometimes conflicting rationales in the end the sustainable nature of contemporary socio technical urban transitions has to be reassessed 12 for truffer and fuenfshilling assessing the semi coherence of a socio technical system and its regime is important to appreciate potential transition trajectories in a more fine grained way this approach enables the specification of regime strength the delineation of socio technical regimes the identification of technological niches and the specification of impacts from broader landscape pressures on socio technical regimes in that sense it provides an important element for the conceptualization of transitions in infrastructure sectors 2014 p 787 12 we should also avoid too much focus on formal institutions and the short term and study all the modes of action 13 according to lorrain 2013 the influence of capitalism on the city is played out as much through the use of invisible technical instruments assessment methods reporting tools book to sale or technical ratio as through an operator s legal nature 13 this methodological positioning led lorrain 2013 to become interested in the financial sector s discreet hand in urban development at first glance this sector does not seem to be one of the main urban stakeholders as it operates on the periphery as a specific supplier offering only capital however it has a clear influence through several strategic channels such as assessing the quality of stakeholders these stakeholders then take part in appraising and setting up large projects in different ways the term triple play is used to refer to the actions of an investment bank that supplies advice provides credit and invests in the capital of the company carrying out the operation to sum up the principles of global capitalism come into play in two ways i the calculation techniques used project a certain reading of what is a just value for operations the market value and ii the comparison between asset classes and between countries results in localised urban markets being swallowed up by the vast movement of global trade in a globalised world urban governance procedures hence cannot be self referential they are over determined by benchmarks imposed by standardisation authorities that steer towards a particular type of governance 4 3 the efficiency deficit control and urban normative isomorphism it is common to see urban elites associated with what we have called regimes forge a shared heritage of ideas that often go on to become a fully fledged urban development ideology delegitimising any alternative vision growth demographic economic of financial and real estate values is often considered to be an unattainable horizon it is striking to see how more than in any other sector cities and urban policies are crippled by a shared sense and ideology of what makes a virtuous city this vision is shared by a significant number of urban regimes particularly due to the many public policies transferred from the eu to member states in the field water services the hard surfacing of urban ground and burying of the water cycle to cover over miasmas and dry out the city is giving way to asphalt removal and water network restoration programmes when a canal is reopened or storm water retention basins or even urban marshes are created the water cycle progressively returns to the surface the craze for green grids wildlife corridors and natural infrastructure is gaining ground maughan 2014 but these policies which can be found duplicated in a number of countries seem to be an indicator of institutional isomorphism in urban development rather than the result of a normative form of co production involving a diverse range of stakeholders ultimately even if the city is a possibility and opens up possibilities emelianoff 2008 the sustainable urban development concept that has been appropriated by urban regime stakeholders seems to have smothered innovation by importing universal standards that do not fit well with the co production of solutions geared to the local environment even though this rhetoric is no longer systematic its spirit is now integrated into the definition of environmental protection in european cities and its vision in this respect has become a standard as has its approach to problem solving this approach seems to herald damaging consequences the advent of a standardised elitist consensus to be incorporated into urban sustainability policies the domination of politics over policies béal 2009 and an inability or lack of will on the part of political stakeholders to take citizens demands into account low normative co production this pushes the prospect of sustainable urban development into the distant future the interests of public authorities and private entities are thus converging in urban assemblies dedicated to creating a global sustainability value that will place them high up in the international urban competitiveness rankings but will also weaken their foundations reciprocity thus calling into question their ability to satisfy the needs of citizens 5 conclusion the different actors involved in managing water services in europe are contributing to the construction of urban regimes that aim to achieve sustainability urban water service governance may give rise to stakeholder strategies that aim to make cities sustainable or even water sensitive brown et al 2009 2013b but the fact remains that it is guided by a physical reality partially determined by technological considerations that can create inertia or blockages lorrain 2013 14 the governance is thus partially weighed down by the choices made when design and sizing networks and institutional changes to it can only be understood from the angle of the inherited situation ibid 14 furthermore following our analysis which focused greatly on institutional aspects we conclude that these urban regimes do indeed seem to be semi coherent fuenfshilling and truffer 2014 far from being integrated they are shaped by strains between diverse institutional rationales and can be characterised as complex arrangements between market driven hydraulic and water sensitive rationales ibid in this article we argue that the diversity of urban water regimes in europe can hence be understood by fully embracing a complexity approach focusing on governance instruments teisman and edelenbos 2011 this leads us to propose a typology of synchronous urban water regimes based on four ideal forms and to question their sustainability the apparent flexibility of these forms which can even reconfigure themselves according to the challenges and hazards that might befall them is finally put into perspective a critical analysis of integration practices the sustainability of governance by instruments and the production of shared values demonstrates the importance of socio political relationships that are based on power particularly concerning the role of the global standardisation industry that has emerged over the last three decades and the paramount importance of history whereas the advocates of modern regimes claim only to identify apolitical coordination procedures that are outside any form of historical determinism critical analysis reveals a more complex urban reality in which the political effects of liberal globalisation call into question the sustainability of large urban centres the city and the water services structuring it can thus be viewed as a series of layers of historical complexity including neo liberal globalisation and the instruments symbolising it that complement the historical dynamics but do not erase them completely this observation calls for renewed scrutiny of the role played by public authorities in urban coordination and the co construction of sustainable regimes this particularly involves examining the methods that allow such authorities to become established as the teachers of a sustainable form of development based on a shared local value recent developments in terms of reflexive governance brousseau et al 2012 serving the interest of an insurance based city veltz 2005 15 the territory thus becomes a trusted operator providing solid relationships and facilitating learning allowing risks to be managed and uncertainties and transaction costs to be reduced 15 deserve more systematic exploration in this respect such a perspective does not make it possible for us to postulate that sustainable urban development is a norm theoretically shared by the protagonists it is rather the result of a negotiation process instigated by the public authority as it involves multiple players and levels this can be considered as a process during which the multi scale issues deemed essential to urban sustainability are identified and discussed with a view to obtaining a balanced situation and proposals to achieve this goal are formulated ideally these proposals should comply with at least two fundamental principles i the close intermingling between local and global issues in urban governance sassen 2008 and ii the close relationship between physical and institutional aspects of natural resource governance manuel navarrete 2015 the synchronous urban regimes developed in this context could give rise to sustainable socio technical innovations i e ones based on technologies with managed spatially appropriate and temporally predicted impacts and compliant with social requirements that have been expressed these negotiated innovations daniell 2014 could thus represent a solution to the transactional complexity rogers et al 2015 16 this notion refers to the interaction of diverse institutions infrastructures and actors to meet societal objectives 2015 p 61 16 characterising today s urban water regimes to be efficient this solution could refer to values making explicit reference to the commons allaire 2013 dardot and laval 2014 17 for these authors commons is a regime of practices based on an institutional infrastructure negotiated democratically and drawing its strength from the commitment of those who collectively developed it 17 acknowledgments this paper has been partly funded the swiss national science foundation project infragouv project 169521 appendix a diversity of

6562,understanding the diversity of urban water regimes in europe require dealing with governance instruments actors strategies and institutional environment to embrace it we propose a typology of synchronous urban water regimes delineating four ideal forms we highlight how actors strategies are embedded in institutional regimes and how sustainability perspectives depend on this urban configuration it gives insights on sustainable transitions their feasibility constraints and opportunities keywords water governance urban sustainability complexity institutional regimes public policy 1 introduction contrary to national or regional territories that exhibit a degree of inertia due to their limited margins for manoeuvre and political power relationships that hinder reform cities benefit from greater flexibility and thus have the potential for fairly innovative institutional dynamism that can lead to highly instructive management experiments barraqué 2006 lorrain 2014 these can then constitute spaces for building technical and economic opportunities to provide solutions to the multiple challenges presented in contemporary governance of drinking water and sanitation services oecd 2015 2016 1 see also table 3 1 water supply energy and financial risks loss of biodiversity and the associated productive protective and regulatory functions lack of technological innovation institutional and regional fragmenting to structure the framework of action in a manner allowing to embrace these diverse aspects the notion of a socio technical system seems to be an essential starting point indeed most social science studies focusing on water start by affirming that it is essential to life however although it is seen as a naturally available resource it is important to remember that it was first distributed in contemporary societies a long time ago and that this process has dovetailed with the development of urban infrastructure since the 19th century indeed inhabitants of towns cities and megacities now view their water supply and sanitation service as a vital socio technical system in the same way as gas electricity transport and telecommunications this highly embedded system ties in with the physical aspects of social life and its environment its morphology and properties water resources rainfall topography ecosystem determine economic factors fixed assets and legal factors contracts it also corresponds to a set of institutional measures for managing it within a given area that has its history and is occupied by social groups with their interests and conflicts of interest considering the water sector as just one technical system among others is an opportunity to step out of a sector based mindset that is shared by the research world and professional sectors alike above all it offers a means of shifting the focus away from issues that are deemed essential by the doxa lorrain and poupeau 2014 and that form the structure of today s water supply service efficiency of public private partnerships ppps implementation of the full cost recovery principle universal development of water access reduction of urban splintering etc while all these questions are legitimate and call for pragmatic answers they tend to isolate and focus on technical aspects of the issues whereas on the contrary it seems urgent to link them and to find collective social and political solutions ostrom 2005 2011 the urban regimes concept has emerged in the academic world in the past three decades in order to better understand the socio technical systems defined as the matrix of a city s capacity for collective action pinson 2010 p 12 this concept is crucial insofar as it asserts that the real challenge of urban water service governance lies at the intersection between issues relating to structured contractual arrangements the configuration of the actors involved and the instruments mobilised 2 today s urban stakeholder systems in cities are characterised by a high level of complexity fragmentation and interdependence between stakeholders and dispersal of resources the pivotal issue for urban governance is hence to introduce enough cooperation between the scattered components of the community to make sure things get done stone 1993 p 227 2 this research tradition emerged in the united states in the 1970s to try to understand in detail how local power was developing and report on the different types of city government it focuses on the emergence and stability of distinct configurations of stakeholders growth coalitions that help to explain the transformation of american cities logan and molotch 1987 stone 1993 the adoption of these research models as a means to understand european cities has been extensively studied prompting lively debate cf for example le galès 1995 they have been tested more recently to analyse water governance in the megacities of the global south lorrain 2014 although this approach is increasingly successful pinson 2010 its pertinence and accuracy should be questioned lorrain 2013 presents four critiques that question its heuristic capacity head on i failure to address the long term ii lack of reflection on the nature of urban producers iii reduction of the trio of institutions formal second tier and informal to formal institutions alone and iv understanding of governance does not take into account hierarchical coalitions it also seems that this approach which is socio political in nature and criticises neoliberal management trends gaining ground in large urban areas seeks to embrace new issues such as the valuation of development projects undertaken by distinct coalitions this issue of the autonomous definition of norms in cities whereby they deem themselves capable of establishing the right ones for themselves is echoed particularly in concerns expressed by proponents of public value o flynn 2007 who question the dominance of new public management over urban governance 3 beyond the negative effects of introducing new instruments such as performance measurement new public management reforms have tended to result in objectives being displaced public organisations have concentrated on adopting instruments instead of focusing on the purpose of their action thereby losing some of the meaning of public action 3 such discussions focus on methods and instruments allowing public and private values now deemed compatible to be expressed regarding urban regimes mossberger and stoker 2001 john et al 2009 stone 2015 a second approach which is quite different from the first one in terms of epistemological and methodological assumptions markard et al 2012 makes the issue of developing sustainable urban socio technical systems its key concern bates et al 2008 pahl wostl et al 2010 frantzeskaki and loorbach 2010 truffer et al 2010 westley et al 2011 brown et al 2013a the sustainable transition approach also focuses its analysis on the socio technical regime concept a regime is defined by a set of rules embodied in institutions practices and infrastructure it represents the structure that coordinates the activities of social stakeholders and groups they provide the system with stability and momentum they are responsible for lock in mechanisms meaning that the stakeholders carry out their tasks in accordance with these rules and do not look beyond them geels 2005 geels and schott 2007 such regimes also have a rigid structure that hampers innovation and thus prevents them from developing successfully and fulfilling their potential however they remain potentially dynamic since innovation still occurs at this level they can give rise to sustainable transitions geels 2005 created and maintained by a range of relatively autonomous but interdependent social groups companies consumers regulating authorities the regimes govern the systems i e they guide individuals behaviour and the decision making process and thus provide a degree of stability to become more robust this perspective must be capable of meeting three key analytical challenges fuenfschilling and truffer 2014 i accounting for a diverse range of socio technical regimes ii consolidating the theoretical foundations of sustainable transition studies and iii considering the pairing of institutional and material aspects by incorporating recent developments in institutional sociology lawrence et al 2009 some authors are trying to answer these critiques by considering urban socio technical systems as regimes developed by stakeholders with distinct institutional rationales fuenfschilling and truffer 2014 and reconfiguring their founding hydro social contracts from a sustainable perspective brown et al 2009 2013a 4 for brown et al 2009 the hydro social contract is a term used to describe the pervading values and often implicit agreements between communities governments and business on how water should be managed this contract is shaped by the dominant cultural perspective and historically embedded urban water values expressed through institutional arrangements and regulatory frameworks and physically represented through water systems infrastructure 4 however the theoretical consolidation efforts must be pursued in order to gain a better understanding of the institutional structure of the strategic framework in which supposedly sustainable compromises are negotiated in this paper we question the potential for proposing a renewed urban regime based approach geared to the specific context of water management in european cities such an approach must thus be capable of integrating considerations regarding the sustainable management of water related services power relationships within stakeholder configurations and the technical dimensions of infrastructure into a single analytical framework we are therefore at the crossroads between approaches focusing on the development of growth coalitions and the sustainable transition of urban socio technical regimes the question that connects them can therefore be worded as follows to what extent and in what way is it possible to combine the horizontal dimensions i e relating to instruments that both permit and manage the strategic behaviour of stakeholders and the vertical dimensions i e relating to the multi level structuring of urban reality of socio technical regime governance in order to obtain a better understanding of sustainable development in european megacities or in other words what types of social and material support can be deployed to make the institutional rationales developed by the various stakeholders involved in european urban water regimes compatible in order to co produce shared value that contributes to their sustainable development to answer this question this article will start by drawing on the theory of institutional resource regimes irr gerber et al 2009 in our opinion this theory provides a response to some of the limitations of the urban regime approach identified by lorrain considering the long term and institutions in a multi level perspective with several stakeholders while referring explicitly to the issue of regime sustainability sustainable transition approach however we will then amend it to obtain a better analytical understanding of the interaction between material and institutional dimensions as well as the wide range of strategic issues addressed by stakeholders involved in urban water regimes lastly we will conclude by discussing the conditions for bringing about synchronous sustainable urban regimes characterised by complex institutional structures i e by a wide range of challenges and objectives as well as several action rationales and coordination systems to conclude in order to make such regimes sustainable and to meet the challenge of technical and institutional complexity we will formulate an avenue for further consideration contributing to the emergence of democratically negotiated innovations 2 institutional regimes for resources and infrastructure a research programme to analyse sustainability although cities today appear to be among the few spaces favouring institutional innovation they are still a product of historical and institutional factors resulting from multi dimensional dynamics whose sustainability is questionable heynen et al 2006 whitehead 2013 pacquot 2015 the institutional resource regime irr approach applied to the governance of water services in europe offers a consistent and stimulating initial analysis it allows us to place public policy and property rights back in the centre of the analysis at a time when cities appear to be torn between objectives of sustainability and urban ecological security hodson and marvin 2007 more precisely it represents the key analytical building block with which we can redevelop a robust analysis of urban regimes and thus understand their potential sustainability see fig 1 2 1 the institutional resource regimes approach the institutional resource regimes framework is dedicated to analyses the link governance structure and the sustainability of natural resource uses gerber et al 2009 an irr coordinates resource users and owners through public policies and property in a delimited territory fig 2 5 public policies and property rights are the institutions of the regime i e the rules of the game north 1990 the analysis focusses only on formal institutions 5 the framework has a significant added value compared to others frameworks for our purpose saleth and dinar 2005 pahl wostl et al 2010 it takes into account property rights and public policy as well as the ways in which these two elements of governance interact with one another kissling näf and kuks 2004 gerber et al 2009 bolognesi and nahrath 2017 irr framework contributes to determining a potential for sustainable use according to regime extent number of regulated uses and coherence clarity of property rights and public policy definition depending on its extent and coherence an irr could take four forms non existent simple complex or integrated fig 3 initially the framework s central hypothesis claimed that if the scope and coherence of the irr increase then uses strive to be more sustainable gerber et al 2009 therefore an integrated regime appears as an ideal type today this hypothesis is nuanced actors behaviors could differ from what is expected regarding property rights structure and public policies this is due to the way they use institutions cheating misunderstanding of rules etc north 2005 6 this statement replaces in the analysis two characteristics of actors opportunism and bounded rationality because of these two features the future is uncertain actors may adopt unexpected behaviour and institutions might be less incentivizing than though by decision makers this point emphasises the need to think linkages between institutional structure rules of the game irr and the power games the game urban regime 6 as an illustration in many french cities water tariff structures do not comply with regulations deliberately in order to balance the budget or to make political gains therefore it is better to talk about the potential sustainability offered through the irr governance framework bolognesi 2014b 2 2 institutional resources regime and urban regime irr perspective allows incorporating historical and multilevel dimensions of governance structure within urban regime approach contributing to developing the latter approach analysis of the evolution of an irr leads to identify stages and nature of change as well as the new institutional constraints and opportunities that frame power games and actors strategies similarly it contributes to taking into account the multilevel structure of governance assessing the characteristics of an irr entails determining from which level public policies and property rights emerge it is of first importance regarding an urban regime because it highlights the institutional tools that actors could use or need to make inefficient to attain their goals therefore one could deduce that power games exceed the urban territory and draw these new frontiers finally these two perspectives enter hierarchical alliances into the scope of an urban regime lorrain 2013 the analysis of the evolution of urban water regime in europe illustrates the potential of integrating historical perspective into the urban regime approach kaika 2003 kallis and de groot 2003 this evolution went through three stages of regulation allouche et al 2008 bolognesi 2014b during the first stage 1973 1988 the focus was on resource quality control and on not impeding diversified use notably through the introduction of common drinking water quality standards and pollution thresholds the second stage 1988 1995 followed up on already established ambitions by adding many specific and sectoral measures to the irr such as the 1991 directive on urban wastewater treatment 91 271 eec since then regulation has mainly taken the form of a command and control system during this stage environmental uses expanded the scope of the regime the third phase represents a paradigm change in european urban water management with the objective of modernising the sector bolognesi 2014a this modernisation seeks harmony between environmental and economic objectives supporting integrated water resource management the irr seeks to rationalise governance via a process of commoditisation and liberalisation with the latter theoretically encouraging sustainable usage table 1 the irr perspective on urban water resources in europe allows us to characterise the governance structure in which users and owners should currently operate four key points appear the sustainability objective replaces the usage protection objective economic incentives and market instruments are privileged in stakeholder coordination regulations aim to facilitate the proper functioning of market based mechanisms and incentives rather than to control usage directly the pool of regulated users and stakeholders contributing to regulation is increasing and diversifying the new institutional structure impacts on power games within european urban regimes first actors have to manage with the liberal requirements as an illustration economic performance of services takes more and more importance while public value becomes a second order interest tabi and verdon 2014 renou 2015 private participation gains in legitimacy and develops bolognesi 2014a thomann et al 2016 additionally the impacts of institutions from different levels on an urban regime are perceptible for example article 9 1 of the water framework directive 2000 60 ec states that incentive tariffs should ensure full cost recovering and resource preservation it induces significant economic and financial constraints for service managers in european cities actors strategies and alliances change to compete mostly through the cost effective requirement or propose alternative views a second illustration is the impact of european directives on procurement and concession contracts that deeply change the way actors may interact from discretionary and relational negotiation to competitive tenders chong et al 2016 2 3 institutional resource regime and sustainable transition studies irr framework could strengthen sustainable transition studies in two aspects first it consolidates theoretical explanation of the link between institutions and sustainability focussing on extent and coherence of the regime helps to understand why regime path may be more or less sustainable gerber et al 2009 moreover extent and coherence notions contribute to understanding the diversity of regimes and transitions brown et al 2009 propose the concept of water sensitive city to understand sustainable transitions they advocate that coordination in a water sensitive city be adaptive underpinned by a flexible institutional regime with multiple infrastructures it puts the emphasis on the local level taking for granted that water governance is complex and fragmented nonetheless these socio technical regimes cannot take any forms possibilities are limited by a set of feasible institutional arrangements in that respect the concept of coherence in irr framework contributes to determining this set of feasible sustainable transitions consequently even if the local level is gaining importance in the governance of water services in european cities autonomy remains relative due to the irr being extended by control european directive and public policies create a strong institutional environment marking out the boundaries of local actors options stakeholder actions that produce standards for self organisation within the irr should therefore be appropriately coordinated with upper tier rules teisman and edelenbos 2011 the second input of irr to sustainable transition studies is the understanding of the impact of governance structure on sustainability both theoretically and empirically currently water governance in european cities is driving by a multiplication of formal rules and an increase in technical and economic complexity of service provision it leads to contradictions the increasing extent of the regime results in reduced coherence bolognesi 2014b as an illustration the water sector represents the largest number of violations of eu environmental law i e 20 of disputes keller 2011 the irr in which european megacities are developing thus facilitates local regulation but tends to lead to incoherence in governance due to the difficult relationships between different levels of government eu national regional and local contracting takes the form of local self organisation with little or no state involvement standing out from traditional types of public regulation ostrom 2010 bakker 2010 bolognesi 2018 thus the european urban water irr is evolving into some form of integration yet remains trapped in a complex form due to difficulties in improving system coherence table 2 bolognesi and nahrath 2017 provides with theoretical explanations of this trend they argue that european water governance tends to be lock in an institutional complexity trap which limits governance quality it is of prime importance for sustainable transition studies as it highlights and explains limitation for the efficiency of such transition urban water management remains a complex and fragmented area relying on traditional technical linear management approaches understanding institutional capacity is then vital the local level is gaining importance in the governance of water services in megacities but autonomy remains relative due to the irr being extended by control stakeholder actions that produce standards for self organisation within the irr should therefore be appropriately coordinated with upper tier rules one of the main structural challenges for water management in european megacities teisman and edelenbos 2011 in analytical terms this requires the framework surrounding irrs to be dovetailed with another capable of identifying stakeholder actions at the megacity level can be identified in order to appreciate how complex practices are in relation to the institutional framework it will lead us to break away from the irr approach in three ways i abandoning of the concept of integration as a normative horizon guiding the governance of water services in europe molle 2008 this will be replaced by the concept of synchronicity in order to construct an alternative typology for urban regimes ii renewed interest in the question of values which must be taken into account when reflecting on sustainability policies and the instruments used to implement them allaire 2013 iii widening the analysis of institutional diversity not focusing on formal institutions but integrating these with second tier institutions lorrain 2013 3 towards synchronous urban water regimes the contribution of complexity we propose that the complexity theory applied to the case of urban centres and coupled with questions on their instrumentation and values can give a greater understanding of how contemporary urban regime stakeholders interact in order to produce the city and thus the mode of water services governance to do this it is helpful to put aside the established public and private categories and to take into account the instruments used the principles that these put forward and the values held by stakeholders it then leads to a renewed typology of urban regimes that are qualified as synchronous 3 1 embracing complexity to obtain a better analysis of water service governance according to teisman and edelenbos 2011 attempts to implement policies pertaining to integrated water resource management are bound to fail repeatedly fragmentation is not a problem that can be solved our starting point is that solutions based on the idea of regaining control and taking back responsibility will ultimately only lead to further fragmentation coordination and integration amount to drawing new boundaries and creating new disputes over who is in charge or what has to be integrated or coordinated again pp104 105 these authors contend that the definition of boundaries has from this perspective become a continual process contesting the idea of a stable balance between policy structures and processes in an efficient governance therefore it is the very concept of integration that must be reconsidered integration is still needed in order to create mutually satisfactory results but it will be impossible to obtain an integrated plan a lead organisation or a dominant procedure a more precise conceptualisation of integration is needed p106 3 2 integration multi tier adaptation and synchronisation these same authors thus propose to view integration as a dual process of mutual adaptation that is taken into account through the complexity theory cilliers 1998 for horizontal integration and mutual adaptation processes this approach indeed encourages self organisation a concept that deals with the ways in which processes emerge develop and evolve according to teisman et al 2009 these processes are formed out of events actions and interactions and together create an institutional structure one important point must be stressed self organisation stems from the de facto freedom of choice and action granted to people and organisations whatever their position in the system even when subject to an extreme power they are still able to choose and act freely this freedom can be used to act either self referentially or more adaptively 7 self organisation is defined in complexity theory as the emergence of new structures implemented through local interaction but not imposed by an external or internal stakeholder it is inspired by the responsive capacity of stakeholders and sub systems that are capable of receiving encoding transforming and registering information and of using it to enlighten their actions teisman et al 2009 7 1 without the capacity for self organisation integration beyond contradictory boundaries will not be easy to achieve integration takes place when the outcome of mutual adjustment and interactive governance is supported by people and organisations higher up in the formal bureaucratic government system yet these people and organisations can easily reject or thwart these self organisation capabilities in such cases fragmentation will become a source of complaints integration takes place when self organising units comply with rules procedures and policies developed by people and organisations higher up in the system they can however also obstruct them teisman et al 2009 this understanding of coordination and integration differs slightly from conventional ideas on mutual adaptation synchronisation supposes that a structure is insufficient to stimulate integration but that there is institutional diversity ostrom 2005 within which the boundaries are constantly changing requiring new interconnections to be made between them williams 2002 furthermore synchronisation supposes that continual adaptation must take place between scales and levels young 2002 due to the nested nature of water governance systems constant interaction is required between the autonomous system and the system as a whole adger et al 2005 synchronisation in systems takes place between sectors schedules areas procedures projects and programmes without any of these systems losing its respective logic or added value flood 1999 teisman et al 2009 in the end integration results from a process of synchronisation in which stakeholders with mutually accepted identities form coalitions capable of cooperating on a series of actions at a certain place and time without being part of a hierarchical structure hunt and shackley 1999 p 147 synchronisation becomes clear once the stakeholders concerned can balance their personal interest with the development of a mutual interest acceptable to all insisting on the coalition concept as an element of an integration process based on synchronisation also creates a link with the urban regime concept defined in the introduction while clarifying its theoretical consistency the next step is to understand the diversity of situations observed through these concepts two different types of self organisation can be found in the complexity theory autopoietic self organisation and dissipative self organisation teisman et al 2009 the former reinforces sub system stability stakeholders do not mutually reorganise at least not radically they continue to exist as they are but are entirely conscious of their interdependence with other stakeholders and organisations the second type of self organisation is dissipative or adaptive whereby sub systems are confronted with results that are unsatisfactory for them and the system generally so they start to envisage new boundaries for the content and system dissipative self organisation incorporates the process into a more dynamic system in which it can attain a new temporary balance and become compatible with its environment once again synchronicity is based on the idea that governance systems are not clearly organised stable or demarcated and can evolve according to an array of trajectories depending on the nature of the synchronicity taking place there is no ideal level or perfectly defined boundary in terms of the people and elements called on to resolve pernicious and complex issues adger et al 2005 in this context the analysis of these systems should focus more on the tools or instruments that are created through mutual action and geared towards joint action rather than on the structures once these elements are available a diverse range of synchronous regimes can be envisaged 3 3 instrumentation and complexity a typology for synchronous urban regime our hypothesis is that water governance challenges differ in their nature territorial and institutional fragmentation inherent to the water sector multi tier governance low capacity of local level stakeholders lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities contested use allocation and that an approach based on complexity and in particular synchronicity is required in response an oecd report 2011 covering 17 countries concurs it points out that in most countries whatever the level of decentralisation public water governance is fragmented and would benefit from better water policy coordination due to the importance of local stakeholders and territorial particularities in the water sector decision makers should not try to avoid difficulties by favouring traditional top down policies but should instead find the means to maintain coherence while preserving diversity the real challenges are to implement policies that are clearly identified adjust them to local contexts overcome obstacles to reforms and bring together the principal stakeholders in different sectors so that they cooperate to share risks and responsibilities the oecd report 2011 thus explores deficits in terms of water policy coordination based on a methodological framework created to diagnose the challenges of multi level governance in decentralised public policies and to identify suitable mechanisms to address them this report therefore suggests making a connection between deficits in water systems and the type of instrumentation to be deployed table 3 based on the research and considerations introduced in parts 1 2 an initial summary may be attempted the theory on institutional resource regimes will be amended by i abandoning the concept of integration ii replacing it with that of synchronisation and iii using concepts of extensions by control or self organisation and cohesion autopoietic or dissipative combining these variables gives us a typology for synchronous urban regimes table 4 each polarised case can be presented rapidly and relates to an archetypal case in order to understand their entire content reference can be made to the works of bulkeley and kern 2006 and bulkeley et al 2016 1 and the flux journal issue 2014 on the history of urban water networks 8 see the journal issue on the history of urban water networks 2014 vol 3 4 issues 97 98 8 integrative synchronous regime in a framework of action where predictive control and problem solving dominate urban regime stakeholders follow an integration rationale and will seek the multi scale and multi level alignment of the wider structure and the different urban functions teisman et al 2009 entrepreneurial synchronous regime in a framework of action where non predictive control and problem solving dominate urban regime stakeholders follow an effectuation rationale sarasvathy 2008 the effectiveness of this rationale is not based on optimising or maximising gains as the future is unpredictable but on minimising authorised losses since the future and particularly the related risks has to be managed resilient synchronous regime in a framework of action where predictive control and problem framing dominate urban regime stakeholders follow a resilience rationale adger et al 2005 that aims to re establish a meta stable balance between the various urban water functions piquette and wintz 2009 transformative synchronous regime in a framework of action where non predictive control and problem framing dominate urban regime stakeholders follow a transformation rationale this involves revising the nature of the hydro social contract that structures the city s development and moving towards the construction of water sensitive cities brown et al 2009 a situation of pluralism overlapping responsibilities and scattered resources that created incentives for cooperation ultimately allowed capacity for action to be rebuilt in cities pinson 2010 mechanisms for aggregating interests as well as forms of inter institutional dialogue were invented to enable organisationally complex situations to prosper a set of incentive association enrolment and mobilisation mechanisms intended to enable consistent collective action in a context of organisational fragmentation and dispersed resources has thus a priori brought about renewed diversity in governable urban regimes in order to facilitate the empirical validation of the proposed approach and to demonstrate its originality we can summarize our contribution as follows it seems possible to understand the diversity of urban water regimes after requiring the three ps policies persons places introduced by the oecd in its recent studies 2016 p 20 the issue is to focus on three new key variables characterizing the new context of urban action more complex problem framing degree of autonomy of local actors in the enunciation of the nature and boundaries of the urban problems to be solved procedures the mechanisms aiming at reducing institutional and organisational fragmentation in urban areas social processes the social dynamics involving the various stakeholders in the urban fabric a first ordering of the empirical diversity mobilizing these categories was carried out appendix a it needs to be completed and enriched far from the constant reconfiguration of functional territories that institutional territories attempt in vain to emulate an alternative to the chaos scenario seems to have prevailed in the large cities of developed countries of europe in particular with regard to this first appraisal many authors call for the widespread implementation of the normative ideal borrowed from hydro sensitive cities 9 see the many contributions in journals dedicated to transition studies in the past ten years environmental innovations and societal transitions technological forecasting and social change research policy etc 9 a deeper examination of urban development enables this proposition to be qualified the sustainability of synchronous regimes that borrow as a priority from the transformative ideal form must be considered in the light of its position within a globalised economy which distorts the way in which the instruments supposed to give it substance function 4 cities globalisation and values the viability of synchronous regimes in question according to numerous analysts the new urban coalitions that have come to power would be capable of making complex territorial systems viable by means of new instruments in the field of water service governance the central issue involves nothing less than inventing new urban forms to be structured around flexible socio technical mechanisms the main argument here is that while modernising under the effect of restrictive incentive based policies cities have been swept along by economic globalisation since the end of the 20thcentury the new phenomenon that must be highlighted concerns the increasing role being played in urban development by new protagonists in particular large private firms that are listed on the stock market and have market value 10 these firms may all be different but since they are listed on the stock market they are all subject to the demands of financial performance and will assess projects from a value perspective this economic and financial rational penetrates quite deeply both directly and indirectly into the range of instruments shaped by synchronous regimes in order to structure the development trajectory of the urban territories considered 10 the viability of these set ups can be questioned from three points of view 1 the democratic deficit in the functioning of these regimes 2 urban development stakeholders coming under the partial control of the global financial system and 3 controlled isomorphism in urban development standards 4 1 the democratic deficit legitimacy and responsibility in question the legitimacy responsibility and power held by or delegated to the new urban development stakeholders can indeed be questioned regarding the governance of water services in france canneva and guérin schneider 2011 denounced the influence of certain industrial lobbyists who attempted to water down a law proposed by d voynet aiming to reform water sector governance by establishing performance indicators to be supervised by the public authority since 2002 they have succeeded in reducing this instrument intended to bring about modern efficient and fair regulation to a mere reporting mechanism the problem for cities and megacities will hence not appear in terms of institutional fragmentation dispersed resources or lack of governability but rather in terms of the effects of coalition mechanisms on the distribution of power and forms of political mobilisation the consolidation of urban regimes qualified here as synchronous in particular risks pushing city governance towards oligarchy and post democracy pinson 2010 swyngedouw 2005 11 swyngedouw denounces the grey accountability of hierarchically articulated and non formalised and procedurally legitimised associations of governance 2005 p 199 11 the concept of institutional evasion introduced by pinson thus echoes the observation that most decisions are taken outside local assemblies be they municipal or inter municipal moreover collaboration on large projects and strategic planning mechanisms within ad hoc committees generally associates a limited number of elected officials with important technical and economic stakeholders who end up constituting an urban authority elite operating outside the official sphere of representative democracy in his analysis of the link between cities and the market lorrain 2013 also expresses concern about the excessive power acquired by certain growth coalitions these new alliances combine access to exceptional public resources and an integrated architecture making them absolute developers their power is not limited by the usual checks and balances of certified accounting shareholder reporting political opposition or an independent press these growth hierarchies thus have a disturbing amount of power which should be better controlled barreteau and daniell 2014 4 2 the operational deficit complications in management and partial control over stakeholders in urban development if we wish to pinpoint precisely the new urban regimes that have emerged it is useful to take into account all the stakeholders operating in urban development and not just the most visible ones influence begins very high up in the decision making chain the traditional circle of promoters developers and utility providers should be widened to include conglomerates engineering consultancies and industrial firms developing new sustainable equipment the water energy nexus concept is thus giving rise to a whole new sector where providers offering smart equipment to make cities sustainable world economic forum 2011 regard themselves as specifiers of technology in competition with one another likewise recent developments have affected the funding of urban development notably with increasing involvement from pension funds giving value to market able solutions torrance 2008 brenner 2013 as shown by truffer et al 2010 urban regimes ultimately find themselves at the centre of conflicting institutional rationales which far from allowing the emergence of water sensitive cities instead of hinder and complicate urban governance although the water sensitive paradigm emerges to an extent it has to contend with resistance from the traditional water paradigm and with the increasingly assertive market paradigm ultimately making the urban territory difficult to govern the urban socio technical system is then considered as a semi coherent organisational field i e characterised by institutionalisation levels some robust and aligned and others less so and honed within the system itself by a wide range of institutional sometimes conflicting rationales in the end the sustainable nature of contemporary socio technical urban transitions has to be reassessed 12 for truffer and fuenfshilling assessing the semi coherence of a socio technical system and its regime is important to appreciate potential transition trajectories in a more fine grained way this approach enables the specification of regime strength the delineation of socio technical regimes the identification of technological niches and the specification of impacts from broader landscape pressures on socio technical regimes in that sense it provides an important element for the conceptualization of transitions in infrastructure sectors 2014 p 787 12 we should also avoid too much focus on formal institutions and the short term and study all the modes of action 13 according to lorrain 2013 the influence of capitalism on the city is played out as much through the use of invisible technical instruments assessment methods reporting tools book to sale or technical ratio as through an operator s legal nature 13 this methodological positioning led lorrain 2013 to become interested in the financial sector s discreet hand in urban development at first glance this sector does not seem to be one of the main urban stakeholders as it operates on the periphery as a specific supplier offering only capital however it has a clear influence through several strategic channels such as assessing the quality of stakeholders these stakeholders then take part in appraising and setting up large projects in different ways the term triple play is used to refer to the actions of an investment bank that supplies advice provides credit and invests in the capital of the company carrying out the operation to sum up the principles of global capitalism come into play in two ways i the calculation techniques used project a certain reading of what is a just value for operations the market value and ii the comparison between asset classes and between countries results in localised urban markets being swallowed up by the vast movement of global trade in a globalised world urban governance procedures hence cannot be self referential they are over determined by benchmarks imposed by standardisation authorities that steer towards a particular type of governance 4 3 the efficiency deficit control and urban normative isomorphism it is common to see urban elites associated with what we have called regimes forge a shared heritage of ideas that often go on to become a fully fledged urban development ideology delegitimising any alternative vision growth demographic economic of financial and real estate values is often considered to be an unattainable horizon it is striking to see how more than in any other sector cities and urban policies are crippled by a shared sense and ideology of what makes a virtuous city this vision is shared by a significant number of urban regimes particularly due to the many public policies transferred from the eu to member states in the field water services the hard surfacing of urban ground and burying of the water cycle to cover over miasmas and dry out the city is giving way to asphalt removal and water network restoration programmes when a canal is reopened or storm water retention basins or even urban marshes are created the water cycle progressively returns to the surface the craze for green grids wildlife corridors and natural infrastructure is gaining ground maughan 2014 but these policies which can be found duplicated in a number of countries seem to be an indicator of institutional isomorphism in urban development rather than the result of a normative form of co production involving a diverse range of stakeholders ultimately even if the city is a possibility and opens up possibilities emelianoff 2008 the sustainable urban development concept that has been appropriated by urban regime stakeholders seems to have smothered innovation by importing universal standards that do not fit well with the co production of solutions geared to the local environment even though this rhetoric is no longer systematic its spirit is now integrated into the definition of environmental protection in european cities and its vision in this respect has become a standard as has its approach to problem solving this approach seems to herald damaging consequences the advent of a standardised elitist consensus to be incorporated into urban sustainability policies the domination of politics over policies béal 2009 and an inability or lack of will on the part of political stakeholders to take citizens demands into account low normative co production this pushes the prospect of sustainable urban development into the distant future the interests of public authorities and private entities are thus converging in urban assemblies dedicated to creating a global sustainability value that will place them high up in the international urban competitiveness rankings but will also weaken their foundations reciprocity thus calling into question their ability to satisfy the needs of citizens 5 conclusion the different actors involved in managing water services in europe are contributing to the construction of urban regimes that aim to achieve sustainability urban water service governance may give rise to stakeholder strategies that aim to make cities sustainable or even water sensitive brown et al 2009 2013b but the fact remains that it is guided by a physical reality partially determined by technological considerations that can create inertia or blockages lorrain 2013 14 the governance is thus partially weighed down by the choices made when design and sizing networks and institutional changes to it can only be understood from the angle of the inherited situation ibid 14 furthermore following our analysis which focused greatly on institutional aspects we conclude that these urban regimes do indeed seem to be semi coherent fuenfshilling and truffer 2014 far from being integrated they are shaped by strains between diverse institutional rationales and can be characterised as complex arrangements between market driven hydraulic and water sensitive rationales ibid in this article we argue that the diversity of urban water regimes in europe can hence be understood by fully embracing a complexity approach focusing on governance instruments teisman and edelenbos 2011 this leads us to propose a typology of synchronous urban water regimes based on four ideal forms and to question their sustainability the apparent flexibility of these forms which can even reconfigure themselves according to the challenges and hazards that might befall them is finally put into perspective a critical analysis of integration practices the sustainability of governance by instruments and the production of shared values demonstrates the importance of socio political relationships that are based on power particularly concerning the role of the global standardisation industry that has emerged over the last three decades and the paramount importance of history whereas the advocates of modern regimes claim only to identify apolitical coordination procedures that are outside any form of historical determinism critical analysis reveals a more complex urban reality in which the political effects of liberal globalisation call into question the sustainability of large urban centres the city and the water services structuring it can thus be viewed as a series of layers of historical complexity including neo liberal globalisation and the instruments symbolising it that complement the historical dynamics but do not erase them completely this observation calls for renewed scrutiny of the role played by public authorities in urban coordination and the co construction of sustainable regimes this particularly involves examining the methods that allow such authorities to become established as the teachers of a sustainable form of development based on a shared local value recent developments in terms of reflexive governance brousseau et al 2012 serving the interest of an insurance based city veltz 2005 15 the territory thus becomes a trusted operator providing solid relationships and facilitating learning allowing risks to be managed and uncertainties and transaction costs to be reduced 15 deserve more systematic exploration in this respect such a perspective does not make it possible for us to postulate that sustainable urban development is a norm theoretically shared by the protagonists it is rather the result of a negotiation process instigated by the public authority as it involves multiple players and levels this can be considered as a process during which the multi scale issues deemed essential to urban sustainability are identified and discussed with a view to obtaining a balanced situation and proposals to achieve this goal are formulated ideally these proposals should comply with at least two fundamental principles i the close intermingling between local and global issues in urban governance sassen 2008 and ii the close relationship between physical and institutional aspects of natural resource governance manuel navarrete 2015 the synchronous urban regimes developed in this context could give rise to sustainable socio technical innovations i e ones based on technologies with managed spatially appropriate and temporally predicted impacts and compliant with social requirements that have been expressed these negotiated innovations daniell 2014 could thus represent a solution to the transactional complexity rogers et al 2015 16 this notion refers to the interaction of diverse institutions

entrepreneurial synchronous regime germany is characterised by an organising state and a central place devoted to cities this autonomy of cities is limited by the principle of subsidiarity they have a subordinate position in relation to the land and to the bund which promulgate laws and redistribute funding in 1991 the municipal water provider stadtwerke münchen swm implemented a voluntary payment scheme to encourage local farmers to adopt more sustainable organic farming practices after estimating the target area using hydro geological models swm launched a public information campaign targeting 120 farmers mainly dairy producers the payments were constructed to cover the expected lost income and investments needed to switch to organic farming more precisely farmers received a payment of eur 280 per hectare per year ha year for the first 6 years after the change and eur 250 ha year for the following 12 years resilient synchronous regime in france the conseil communautaire

transformative synchronous regimes the metropolitan authority of barcelona has responsibilities throughout the water cycle from the drinking water supply to wastewater treatment and reclaimed water production it encompasses 9 utilities across the metropolitan area s 36 municipalities 7 wastewater treatment plants and 3 reclaimed water plants managing urban waters at the metropolitan level has fostered a wider perspective at the water cycle level as well as shared infrastructure and expenses the bma encourages customer involvement to learn about different territorial needs and expectations for the future barcelona is looking at alternative water resources and strengthened water cycle management aguas de barcelona was created in 2013 jointly with a large metropolitan utility to manage drinking reclaimed and wastewater for all the metropolitan territory the governing bodies of the optimal territorial areas ambito territoriale ottimale in italy are autonomous entities defined by the region and made up of municipalities they are responsible for planning defining investment programmes and selecting service providers they usually cover an area corresponding to the province the city of milan is located in the po valley known for the fertility of its land and its water wealth the purification plant for the city of milan nosedo can be seen not only as a site designed to meet the cleansing needs of the city of milan but as a real centre of urban experiment which combines social welfare rural development land management renewable energy social and environmental education the plant produces reusable water for agriculture serving more than 90 farms in order to complete its work of rehabilitation and enhancement of the agricultural tradition of the territory the city of milan and the ato started the construction of a large public park called park vettabbia where the plant is located in particular the design of the new park vettabbia defines the new structure of

6563,access to safe drinking water is now recognized as a human right and a government priority at an international level in modern megacities where urban agglomerations progressively encroach on the fringes between cities and rural areas a growing trend in developing countries water access is an urgent concern like most of the world s megacities the rio de janeiro metropolitan region is marked by a dependence on water sources outside its borders this paper describes and discusses the unequal distribution of water supply and sanitation wss services in this metropolitan area from a historical path dependence perspective drawing upon the theoretical concept of the socio technical system it explores diachronically past present and future scenarios of wss in the area the conclusions stress the existence of socio technical path dependency and raise questions for future researches keywords water supply socio technical systems rio de janeiro metropolitan region 1 introduction the issue of urban water scarcity is real compelling and growing in 2000 150 million people lived in cities facing perennial water shortages where the per capita supply was less than 100 l day almost 900 million people lived in cities that faced seasonal shortages where supply dipped below 100 l day at least one month each year by 2050 these numbers are expected to grow to 1 billion and 3 1 billion people respectively nearly a third of humanity and over half of the 6 billion urban dwellers predicted by 2050 will face critical water shortages in their cities xylem 2013 in developing countries many metropolitan areas are facing increasing water scarcity this problem is likely to be further aggravated by rapid population growth and changes in the hydro environment on various scales historical problems such as the gap between growing demand and supply capacity poorly maintained infrastructure and intermittent supply may be aggravated by global environmental changes these changes will exacerbate the scarcity of bulk water associated with both climatic stressors extreme hydrological events environmental variability and change and non climatic stressors environmental characteristics and anthropogenic pressures pahl wostl 2009 ipcc 2014 one of the main points of this paper is that these problems both those associated with natural events and those produced by technical or social contingencies are not isolated rather they are wickedly weber and khademian 2008 entangled within the prevailing socio technical system the way the socio technical system is managed affects the way these problems are addressed water related problems are also associated with urban growth especially but not exclusively in developing countries if the largest urban agglomerations of the early twentieth century were mostly in industrialized countries the vast majority of today s megacities are located in developing ones demographia 2016a according to demographia s world urban areas index the rio de janeiro metropolitan region rmrj currently with 11 835 708 inhabitants is the 27th largest megacity in the worldwide total of 34 demographia 2015 it is the second largest in brazil in terms of both population size and economic output preceded only by the são paulo metropolitan area and the third largest in south america also after buenos aires despite the general availability of water brazil faces serious challenges in universalizing wss services over 1 5 million of the country s approximately 57 million households do not have toilets twenty five million households do not have access to a sewerage system and nearly ten million have no access to a public drinking water system ibge 2010 the poor access to water services in the south east of the country has started gaining visibility in the local and national media because of the frequent water shortages which especially affect the urban peripheries moreover the prolonged drought in 2014 2015 brought the question of water supply in the region to the center of a broad and complex national debate indeed the drought triggered a crisis that has harmed the water system based on the large interstate paraíba do sul river watershed causing a conflict among the three main states in the southeast rio de janeiro são paulo and minas gerais and especially between the first two despite all these serious occurrences the problems of the rmrj water supply such as its unequal socio spatial distribution cannot be attributed to natural events only building upon the theoretical concept of the socio technical system and the related academic debate on wss services this paper shows that wss systems as socio technical systems are affected by path dependence in other words the historical conditions in which the water supply systems were designed shape their future development the paper reaches this conclusion while offering an original analysis based on an in depth descriptive case study of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region the article is structured as follows section 2 outlines the theoretical framework focusing on the construction of the water supply system as a socio technical system section 3 presents the methodological approach describing the rationale and main steps of our case study section 4 reports on the historical and socio economic processes that have shaped the rio de janeiro metropolitan region and its water supply system section 5 provides a geographical characterization of the current water sources and related supply systems section 6 introduces the socio technical interventions proposed by local governments for the future and section 7 discusses the case study in the light of socio technical system theory and proposes some conclusions 2 theoretical background water supply service as a socio technical system several scholars agree that water supply systems can be defined as socio technical systems coutard et al 2004 moss et al 2011 definitions of socio technical systems or socio technical networks are rooted in the impossibility of separating technology from society as stated by winner 1980 p 126 societies choose structures for technologies that influence how people are going to work communicate travel consume and so forth over a very long time choices about technology have important consequences for the form and quality of human associations santos emphasizes technology as the most important mode of interrelation between man and nature and between man and geographical space technologies are a set of instrumental and social means with which man carries out his life produces and at the same time creates space santos 1996 in the introduction to their book a collection of texts by different scholars coutard hanley and zimmerman mention that all these scholars believe that technologies are shaped by society at the same time as they shape society or in other words that social technical systems and technical societies co evolve coutard et al 2004 p 1 involving not just physical artifacts but also organizational structures institutional arrangements and social and cultural meanings once socio technical systems are established they possess a high degree of path dependency tending to be resistant to change existing formal socio technical systems are prisoners of technical and economic choices made in the past that often restrict their adaptation to new challenges guy et al 2011 madeleine akrich 1992 observes that technical objects and social actors whether individual or collective are in a relationship of reciprocal adjustment they should never be analyzed separately to avoid falling into technological determinism or sociological constructivism p 208 nonetheless to conceive of them as an integrated asset that is neither technical nor social but socio technical we need to confront a twofold problem the linguistic problem of elaborating proper and integrated semantics and the methodological problem of analyzing sociotechnical artifacts before they become naturalized p 219 and rooted within a human community for akrich we need to study socio technical phenomena through the phases of negotiation bargaining claims and accusations that come from the side of the technical designers operators or from the side of user community in other words we need to study socio technical phenomena as conflicting processes of an intrinsically political nature lorrain and poupeau define water supply services as socio technical systems that have become essential to urban and metropolitan inhabitants they stress one important aspect of these urban socio technical systems water supply systems have their own physical morphology and properties which are embedded in a territory whose social and natural features match the institutional mechanisms constructed for their management the territories the water supply systems and the institutional mechanisms to manage them are marked by a specific history and by the relationship between different social groups with their own conflicts and interests lorrain and poupeau 2014 formal socio technical systems for water provision in the global south and in latin american metropolises generally have the same characteristics as the systems of the networks in the global north they are highly centralized in their physical structure and management their adaptability to environmental change is limited they provide the same standard quality of treated water for all uses and their forms of financing are almost always based on payment by users according to the volume consumed britto et al 2015 monstadt and schramm 2013 the local populations that use the systems are not involved in decisions about the management allocation and use of water as moss 2001 p 6 notes the only contact between provider and users is normally their monthly or annual bill this centralized model has also been identified as a conventional network le bris and coutard 2008 i e with an interconnected set of equipment centrally planned and managed by a single operator offering a seamless service in a certain territory making it increasingly interlocked these large artifacts shaped by central government policies at once generate new demands and affect the future trajectories and design of urban policies swyngedouw 2004 gandy 2002 these are socio technical systems with a high degree of path dependency furlong 2014 draws upon hughes s 1994 concept of momentum hughes coined this concept to explain how technology and society i e political economic and cultural institutions co evolving to create a stable socio technical system end up producing black boxes that are resistant to change geels 2005 also cited in furlong attributes this resistance to change to human attitudes to adaptation especially to material things and artifacts furlong agreeing with other scholars concerned with the social aspect of science and technology writes that a technical artifact that gathers momentum like a water supply network molds the surrounding geographical space the socio technical system embedded in this space becomes normalized and invisible and therefore resistant to change conventional networks for water supply can be conceived as technologies that have gained momentum for more than a century when this centralized model is implemented in developing countries it is often ineffective in meeting urban demands especially because of the accelerated urbanization that has taken place in recent decades ahlers et al 2014 nilsson 2006 this leads to questions about the role of the state and the conventional model of large infrastructure solutions for the provision of public services and the potential of informal or alternative solutions scholars that have studied water supply provision in urban contexts in the global south maintain that large centralized public systems recursively re produce spatial inequalities harvey 2010 excluding peripheral areas or lower income neighborhoods nilsson 2006 kudva 2009 it is not certain that these socio technical characteristics are adapted to the new multidimensional challenges technical e g extending water supply networks to periurban areas economic e g financial investments and social tariffs environmental e g climate change and potable water availability and social e g universal access to services once idealized as the epitome of modernity and progress distributing services and creating social solidarity large water supply infrastructure networks are currently the object of criticism in northern countries because of their incompatibility with the principles of sustainable development and in the south because of their incapacity to provide universal services coutard and rutherford 2013 moss 2008 domènech march and saurí 2013 jaglin 2012 the potential of decentralized systems e g local energy networks alternative techniques for wastewater rainwater management and harvesting for non potable uses has been discussed and emphasized coutard and rutherford 2013 barraqué 2013 these decentralized systems would be less vulnerable than macro systems which are subject to domino effects when there are breakdowns or accidents at certain points in the network furthermore they are more flexible more adaptable to local conditions and thus more capable of generalizing access to services in local contexts discussing this issue barraqué 2013 p 19 argues that ultimately for the time being it can be considered that water savings should remain the preferred option in the central densely populated and already equipped areas recycling and alternative technologies should be limited to cases where water demand continues to grow and may require utilities to invest in new and more costly resources innovations should then be given priority in peripheries new and alternative forms of services should be publicly discussed prior to their implementation in brazil municipalities have different options to manage their wss services i via a direct or autonomous management structure by means of a public department or municipal corporation ii in association with other municipalities through the development of inter municipal cooperation consortia iii by delegating management either to state companies or to private corporations in the rio de janeiro metropolitan region most of the municipalities delegate these services to the state water supply and sanitation company known by its acronym cedae by doing so they also delegate decisions concerning the socio technical water supply system to the state company there are no municipal or local systems for water provision but two large socio technical systems managed by cedae which it designed to provide an integrated water service to the municipalities in the east and the west of rmrj the former is called the imunana laranjal hydraulic system and the latter the guandu river system 3 research rationale this research follows an in depth case study methodology i e it examines a general issue through the investigation of a relevant case yin 2005 the main unit of analysis is the water supply system of a megacity and the unequal access to water the selected case is the rio de janeiro metropolitan region rmrj a paradigmatic case for latin america metropolises for our research design we drew upon gerring 2004 who maintains that intensive single case studies are welcome when the purpose is exploratory and aimed at understanding a phenomenon that is also relevant for other units i e it answers a new research question rather than providing theory testing verification falsification according to flyvbjerg 2006 case studies should not be methodology driven but problem driven from this perspective it is a mistake to evaluate case study based research with the technical rigor typical of quantitative methods the added value of a descriptive case study is precisely its technical unboundedness which allows it to freely focus on the problem and acquire relevant context related knowledge flyvbjerg 2006 richness of detail and content constitutes the main advantage of a descriptive investigation bourdieu 1977 flyvbjerg 2006 we also draw on lorrain and poupeau 2014 who provide guidelines for qualitative research in water governance they emphasize the importance of both information pluralism p 8 and historical perspective while adopting a socio technical perspective for water governance they stress the relevance of longue dureé history p 10 meaning a historical interpretation of social phenomena not based on contingency but on the main structures identified on a longer temporal scale such an in depth view is often neglected in hydrological research where technical concerns prevail drawing upon lorrain and poupeau ibid we employed data from multiple sources historical academic sources research reports scientific papers monographs official statistical data national datasets ibge snis international datasets demographia interviews with key informants from the government institutions involved which were held throughout the field research commercial director of the water company supervisor of the state water company director of the river basin organization local technical staff from the state water company and the national press we designed our descriptive case study involving three years of field research in line with this methodological premise and our exploratory purpose the first step was to identify our research problem and question why are inequalities in the rmrj wss resistant to change are these inequalities linked to the characteristics of the technical system to answer these questions we provide a description of our diachronic case study outlining its historical trajectory past describing in detail the existing hydrological and technical system present and projecting the alternative socio technical scenarios identified by the main government actors involved future 4 a historic perspective on water supply services in the rio de janeiro metropolitan region the rio de janeiro metropolitan region rmrj with a combined population of 11 835 708 covers 21 municipalities that reflect centuries old imbalances in regional development in brazil two integrated systems provide water to the region i the guandu lages acari system which supplies the west comprising rio de janeiro city and a region called baixada fluminense between the coast of guanabara bay and the mountainous região serrana region map 1 with 9 846 035 inhabitants and ii the imunana laranjal system which supplies the east including niterói são gonçalo and itaboraí with 1 772 727 inhabitants agência nacional de águas ana 2010 see map 1 in this paper we refer to the former area as west rmrj and the latter as east rmrj this study does not consider three smaller municipalities with local water supply systems guapimirim magé tanguá and maricá 564 155 inhabitants map 1 shows the geographical location of west rmrj and east rmrj together these two systems guandu lages acari and imunana laranjal supply 96 6 of the inhabitants of rmrj 4 1 water supply services in rio de janeiro and its western side the baixada fluminense area the characteristics of rmrj are strongly related to the history of the city of rio de janeiro which was the capital of brazil from 1763 to 1960 when brasilia was made the new capital the importance of the municipality grew rapidly in the eighteenth century thanks to gold mining which was centered in the neighboring state of minas gerais furtado 2000 osório 2005 prado junior 2006 when the portuguese royal family moved to rio de janeiro 1808 and coffee started to be grown and exported the city s population growth started to accelerate coffee production and exportation prompted an early process of industrialization prado junior 2006 once brazil was proclaimed a republic in 1889 rio de janeiro the capital city was transformed into the federal district and the nearby municipality of niterói became capital of the state of rio de janeiro osório 2005 rio de janeiro s economic dynamism and cultural importance grew as did its urban infrastructure and services in october 1960 brasilia became the new capital city or federal district and rio de janeiro became the capital of a new state guanabara created on april 14 1960 within the overall process of modernization of the brazilian economy the resulting financial autonomy triggered by this institutional transformation of rio de janeiro facilitated the execution of public investments that ultimately reorganized the spatial structure of the city penalva 1990 in the early 1960s two capitals effectively coexisted in brazil although the federal legislature and judiciary were soon moved to brasilia the executive branch remained in rio however after the 1964 military coup and the introduction of military rule things changed in order to avoid popular protests the government included an article 183 to the 1967 constitution by which the executive branch of government was finally moved to brasília the state of guanabara maintained a privileged position for a few years regarding the allocation of water supply resources especially when compared with the municipalities in the state of rio de janeiro in 1961 the guanabara state government began working on a water supply plan to meet its water needs until 2000 and identified the guandu river as the main supply source silva 1965 cedag 1970 this small river became the main water supply for guanabara state thanks to the creation in 1952 of a large and complex system to divert water from the paraíba do sul river downstream for hydropower generation this system was designed and implemented by light the rio de janeiro electricity utility mcdowall 2008 for which reason it is also known as the light system in 1960 guanabara state had a population of about 3 3 million now guandu is the main water supply source for the rio de janeiro metropolitan region the guandu water treatment station is the largest in the world according to guinness with a water treatment capacity of 43 m3 s in the 1960s the guanabara state government created two public companies to manage wss services empresa de águas do estado daguanabara cedag and empresa de saneamento daguanabara esag in the state of rio de janeiro until the end of 1968 water supply services were managed by the water and sanitary engineering commission which was under the control of the public works department in this same year a new body for water governance was created superintendência central de engenharia sanitária sucesa which served as a kind of holding company that managed a group of regional water supply departments less than ten years later in 1972 sucesa was replaced by a public company owned by the state of rio de janeiro companhia de saneamento do estado do rio de janeiro sanerj brasileiro 1976 in 1975 guanabara state capital city rio de janeiro and rio de janeiro state capital city niterói were merged by a complementary law passed on july 1 1974 accordingly the management bodies of the two states were also merged and the structure of water supply services went through major transformations a new public water company was created companhia estadual de águas e esgotos cedae a state owned utility responsible for providing wss services for the new state it originated from the merger of three companies with very different characteristics cedag esag and sanerj as marques 1999 has shown cedag was financially and economically sound had well paid and well trained staff that operated the company following conservative technical standards and had considerable operational liberty meanwhile sanerj was not financially sound did not have well trained technical personnel and suffered from intense political interference on the part of the governor s office which used the operation of systems in smaller municipalities as leverage for political negotiations with other mayors esag was in an intermediate situation but closer to that of cedag the consolidation of these three companies was carried out under the strong command of cedag marques 1999 p 53 almost simultaneously with the merger of guanabara and rio de janeiro states the rio de janeiro metropolitan region rmrj was established by law lei complementar n 20 july 1 1974 the creation of the new metropolitan area prompted the new state government to design a new plan for wss for this area called the impact plan the purpose was to integrate the different water supply systems in rmrj to improve the service for the entire region the main objective was to organize a large and integrated system that would provide water for the municipalities in the baixada fluminense region and for rio de janeiro city the population of the baixada fluminense region had grown consistently since the 1940s putting increased pressure on the water supply infrastructure despite coinciding with the beginning of the industrialization process in some areas population growth in baixada fluminense was mainly due to the influx of new residents as most of them worked in the city of rio de janeiro geiger 1956 the land was divided into plots which were sold and built upon by their new inhabitants improvements to transportation systems and accessibility in the region in 1935 i e railroad electrification and establishment of a single rail fare facilitated mobility between rio and baixada fluminense which contributed to the increasingly intense process of urban occupation in 1951 the rodovia presidente dutra highway was opened allowing access to the area by motor transport the real estate boom of the 1950s was thus marked by the rapid proliferation of precarious neighborhoods which became a new housing option for low income workers in rio abreu 1987 souza 2014 this process took place without any specific public policy or plan to address urban infrastructure development and led to a demographic boom in baixada fluminense see table 1 from 1940 to 1950 the population of the baixada fluminense grew by 157 4 5 times more than the municipality of rio de janeiro from 1950 to 1960 it grew by 145 and from 1960 to 1970 it grew a further 80 see chart 1 the impact plan for the integration of metropolitan water supply systems was designed to increase the supply of water to the municipalities in the baixada fluminense region and rio de janeiro and to increase the number of households connected to the water network however in their analysis of the development of the plan between 1975 and 1978 britto 1995 and marques 1993 found that despite the priority announced by the state government and cedae of investing in the baixada this did not happen the municipality of rio de janeiro especially the more affluent areas received the largest volume of investments until the 1980s the acari system which was very dependent on rainfall patterns was the only source of water to supply baixada fluminese it had been built between 1877 and 1909 to supply the municipality of rio de janeiro after the reorganization of the systems in 1975 the acari water pipelines supplied water only to the baixada fluminense area in 1981 a new water pipeline was inaugurated to supply baixada fluminense municipalities channeling water from the guandu system nonetheless expansions in water production and adduction failed to generate sufficient volumes for the entire baixada fluminense area these network expansions were executed without the construction of reservoirs leading to the creation of a system afflicted by high degrees of uncertainty precarious functioning and dependency on permanent water related manoeuvers the absence of a well organized distribution system provoked water shortages or irregular distribution in several locations it also caused excessive pressure on specific points of the system leading to an increase in leaks causing damage to water mains and serious water losses 4 2 historical roots of the water supply system in east rmrj the growth toward the eastern side of rmrj began in 1930 when the urban and industrial progress of rio de janeiro reached surrounding areas such as the north of niterói and são gonçalo urban development in this region which has been described in the urban planning literature brasileiro 1976 followed the same process as in the west producing the pattern of urban peripheral development typical of most brazilian metropolises kowarick 1979 maricato and org 1982 in east rmrj the municipality of niterói is the central nucleus while the periphery here called the eastern periphery includes são gonçalo and itaboraí the process of occupation by informal precarious self built unsupervised settlements was intense throughout the 1950s see table 2 niterói was a consolidated central core as it was the capital of the state of rio de janeiro until 1975 in the nineteenth century as state capital this city had privileged access to a range of urban services such as the steam ferry running between rio and niterói street lighting a water supply and electric streetcars ibge 2016 the merger of the states of rio de janeiro and guanabara and the loss of the status of capital could have led to the economic and political decline of the city but the inauguration of the costa e silva bridge connecting it to rio gave an impetus to the city s real estate sector ibid the growth of east rmrj towards the eastern periphery was led by the municipality of são gonçalo today the second most populous municipality in the state of rio de janeiro with about one million inhabitants the provision of wss services to most of its residents is precarious as is the case in the western part of baixada fluminense chart 2 illustrates how the eastern rmrj periphery came to exceed the size of the central city of niteroi the construction of niterói s water supply system began with the channeling of river waters outside the city limits originating in the serra de friburgo and the reservatório da correção reservoir in niterói at the beginning of the twentieth century another source outside the municipality the paraíso dam started being used to supply niterói the dam was supplied by rivers from serra de teresópolis a nearby mountain range this system was completed in 1933 in 1940s a new intake was built the imunana canal as part of a macro drainage project aimed at reducing flooding in the region the waters of the guapiaçu and macacu rivers were channeled to the laranjal water treatment station in são gonçalo this station was opened in 1954 cedae 2014 with a treatment capacity of 0 5 m3 s and has been expanded several times the canal was built by the national department of works and sanitation to drain the areas of the lowland frequently flooded by the confluence of the macacu and guapiaçu rivers after the construction of the canal the natural course of the macacu river was diverted joining the guapimirim river which in turn became affluent of the right bank of the guapiaçu petrobras uff fec 2008 in 1954 the raw water in the imunana canal was captured to supply the cities of niterói and são gonçalo in that year the laranjal water treatment station in são gonçalo had the capacity to treat a flow of more than 0 5 m3 s the outflow was increased with the construction of a booster and by 1972 the capacity of laranjal was 1 3 m3 s cedae 1985 however access to the water supply in são gonçalo was extremely precarious in 1974 only 15 of são gonçalo households had access to piped water while in niteroi this average was 70 brasileiro 1976 water access in rmrj in the 1980s is shown in table 3 the preceding description serves to demonstrate that the inequalities in access to water supply between the central rio de janeiro and niteroi and peripheral municipalities of rmrj have historical roots as mentioned by marques 1993 and britto 1995 wss investments in the peripheral municipalities began in the 1980s after decades of demographic growth 1940 1960 between the middle of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s the technical choice for a centrally planned model to be managed by a single operator was made this choice could be seen as the momentum behind the trajectory of path dependence hughes ibid furlong ibid in the rmrj water supply system an alternative to the single centralized socio technical system in the form of a polycentric integrated network with local decentralized reservoirs has never been considered the socio technical network composed of the guandu system on the west side and imunan laranjal on the east has become normalized deep rooted and therefore resistant to change 5 the rmrj water supply system today like most megacities the rio de janeiro metropolitan region is marked by its dependence on sources that lie outside its borders indeed the availability of water inside the region is not sufficient to meet the growing demand of its municipalities in terms of either quantity or quality since the 1960s water sources inside the region have been highly polluted the region s boundaries have been changed many times since it was established in 1974 here in line with this study s purposes we consider only the municipalities in the metropolitan area which are supplied by the two main water supply systems guandu lajes acari and imunana laranjal see map 2 as they represent the most densely occupied area in rmrj map 3 the eastern area of the metropolitan region including niteroi são gonçalo itaboraí is served by the imunana laranjal system and other isolated systems provide water to maricá and guapimirim the imunana laranjal supply deficit is currently 2 2 m3 s inea fundação coppetec 2014 the western part encompassing baixada fluminense and the city of rio de janeiro is mainly served by the guandu lajes acari system this system imports water from the surrounding watersheds paraíba do sul and guandu which provide a more sustainable and efficient water supply agência nacional de águas ana 2010 5 1 water supply in west rmrj companhia estadual de águas e esgotos cedae operates the two systems that supply water to rmrj the guandu lajes acari system see map 2 is composed of three parts the oldest is the acari system also known as the black lines in reference to its pipes which are made of cast iron and differentiate it from more modern water supply systems at present the system s flow ranges from 1 9 m3 s to 2 6 m3 s cedae 2013 and its area of influence is limited to the territory corresponding to the municipalities of nova iguaçu duque de caxias and some areas of belford roxo and queimados cedae 2013 inea fundação coppetec 2014 table 4 shows the building date diameter length and maximum flow of each of these networks the water from these sub systems mixes with water from the guandu system at several points constituting a highly complex water supply system in baixada fluminense britto et al 2014 quintslr and britto 2014 the lages system see map 2 has two water mains that bring water from the lages reservoir de santa ritta 2009 the associated dam originally built to produce electricity regulates a flow rate of 16 5 m3 s since the 1940s 5 5 m3 s of this flow has been used to supply rio de janeiro city de santa ritta 2009 the two mains have diameters which range from 1500 mm to 1750 mm cedag 1970 they reach the pedregulho reservoir in benfica located in the municipality of rio de janeiro while crossing more than 70 km from the fontes power plant through seropédica and nova iguaçu two municipalities in the baixada fluminense along the way they supply some reservoirs in this region with a small volume of water cedae 2013 the guandu system is the result of a huge feat of hydraulic engineering which provides for the transfer of water from the large interstate paraiba do sul river into minor coastal rivers such as the guandu initially built for hydroelectric power production its volume has been increased and it is now used to supply water to rmrj servicing more than 80 of its population the paraiba do sul river basin experienced a severe drought that began in 2014 and continued throughout 2015 nevertheless data from the rio de janeiro environmental agency inea show that the supply of west rmrj was not affected by the drought in virtue of successive adaptations made to the guandu catchment system the testimony of inhabitants and local practitioners given in interviews shows that existing water supply problems in the baixada fluminense cannot be attributed to a water shortage or climate change water extraction for the guandu system occurs via a raw water lift known as the guandu low hold located at the border between the municipalities of seropédica and nova iguaçu water is lifted to the guandu water treatment station cedae 1985 this station has undergone countless renovations and now has a production capacity of nearly 43 m3 s last year the state government announced that a new guandu cf section 5 would be constructed for the additional production of 12 m3 s water with the aim of responding to growing demand in the metropolitan area conen 2015 water treated at the guandu water treatment station follows two different initial paths about 21 m3 s passes through a tunnel heading for the macacos reservoir to supply the south zone of rio de janeiro and the same quantity goes to the treated water lifts that hold water for the marapicu reservoir the marapicu reservoir has a capacity of 20 000 m3 cedae 1985 supplying five pipelines two of these pipelines service the baixada fluminense the main baixada fluminense pipeline and the new baixada fluminense pipeline carrying water to the region at up to 9 m3 s motta 2013 britto et al 2014 quintslr and britto 2014 this huge metropolitan water supply system is represented in map 2 the state water resources plan inea fundação coppetec 2014 estimates that total water production is around 49 5 m3 s 1 minor differences in the total flow of water in the guandu lages acari system may be due to different sources of data ceade 2013 motta 2013 inea 2014 and variations in the water flow of each of its parts especially the acari system 1 of which only 13 m3 s provides baixada fluminense municipalities cedae 2013 quintslr and britto 2014 as can be seen in table 4 below see table 5 the operationalization of the guandu lajes acari system produces inequalities in the access to public water services among the municipalities of west rmrj see table 6 public supply network table 6 reports on empirical evidence providing data about household access to water according to the ibge census ibge 2010 furthermore nowadays many parts of baixada fluminense do not have a regular water supply three of our interviewees technicians from the local cedae operational departments or daes from baixada fluminense and the cedae metropolitan distribution and sales director for baixada fluminense confirmed the serious problems of intermittency and pressure dae 2014 nowaski 2015 this intermittence or irregularity of supply means that residents of certain areas in duque de caxias nova iguaçu belford roxo queimados paracambi and japeri only have water two days a week on average britto et al 2014 this fact was ascertained during the three years of fieldwork ibid though cedae provides no official quantitative information about intermittent supply to the municipalities snsa mcidades 2016 the dae technicians interviewed said that many neighborhoods cannot be supplied every day since the pressure in the pipes is not high enough so they receive water only two or three times a week they stated that the water doesn t get through easily doing some manoeuvers at least some arrives dae 2014 meanwhile the director reiterated that it was not possible to supply many areas in the region properly especially duque de caxias the most populous city with almost a million inhabitants nowaski 2015 he explained that in some areas in addition to the pressure issues there are water quality problems like cyanobacteria contamination which have led to the interruption of the service for one two three months and we had one event of seven months without water in some neighborhoods ibid 2015 the problem of water availability involves both the supply and the demand side actually the water flow is insufficient for the demand in baixada fluminense as are the storage structures reservoirs more reservoirs could provide greater security for the local supply and distribution network but none have been constructed in the baixada fluminense area political factors seem to explain spatial differences of access to water first of all historically the planning of the metropolitan water supply system gives priority to rio de janeiro neglecting baixada fluminense porto 2003 second the expansions made in water production and supply infrastructure have failed to generate sufficient volumes for the entire baixada fluminense whose population has grown more rapidly than that of rio de janeiro since the 1940s the interviews with the dae technicians and the in field research showed that the work done to bring water to baixada fluminense was executed without the construction of reservoirs leading to the creation of an unpredictable and precarious system dae 2014 concerning water availability the cedae master plan for water supply prepared in 2004 indicated that the entire western part of the metropolitan area i e baixada fluminense would be supplied only by the guandu and lajes systems cedae cnec 2004 the plan also affirms that the solution to supply this area is to expand water production focusing on increasing water withdrawal from the guandu river and on resizing the water transfer pipelines the state water resources plan presented in 2014 validates this perspective noting that to meet demand by 2030 which will reach approximately 67 m3 s it will be necessary to expand water production by 18 m3 s inea fundação coppetec 2014 the flow increase should be accomplished through the guandu river considering that the lajes and acari rivers cannot accommodate any further expansion ibid 5 2 the water supply system in east rmrj the municipalities in the eastern side of the metropolitan region are supplied by the imunana laranjal system with a current production capacity of about 5 5 m3 s inea fundação coppetec 2014 this system has worse water supply problems than the guandu system with a deficit of 2 2 m3 s ibid there is an even greater discrepancy in the access to wss services between these municipalities than there is between those in west rmrj compare tables 6 and 7 the uptake of water occurs in the imunana canal see section 4 2 whose current potential capacity is 7 m3 s however the total capacity of the station is not exploited due to the limited availability of water provided by these water mains currently the guapiaçu and macacu rivers located in the macacu river basin protected area supply this region cedae 2014 according to a former cedae officer the caceribu river was also used to contribute to the supply but can no longer be used due to the degradation of its water quality guedes 2015 this has reduced the water treatment station s volumetric capacity to 5 5 m3 s although it was originally meant to be 7 m3 s cedae 2014 guedes 2015 the wss services in the municipalities of this region niterói são gonçalo itaboraí are not entirely provided by the state company cedae although it is responsible for the production of drinking water at the laranjal water treatment station since 1999 a private company águas de niterói has been responsible for water distribution in niterói the company buys water from cedae from laranjal and distributes it to users in 2014 cedae and águas de niterói signed a new contract that increased the volume transferred to the latter from 1 8 m3 s to 2 1 m3 s o globo 2015 this rise in distributed water for the municipality of niterói has exacerbated the inequality between the city s core and its periphery niterói with 487 562 inhabitants receives 2 1 m3 s leaving only 3 4 m3 s for the other municipalities in the region são gonçalo and itaboraí which have about 1 2 million inhabitants ibge data indicate that 80 of são gonçalo s population receive wss services see table 7 if we consider the total population of são gonçalo in 2010 this means that nearly 150 000 people in the municipality do not have access to such services however considering this area s lack of reservoirs and the resulting irregularities caused by the inability to regulate the distribution of treated water some residents that officially receive the service are negatively affected as well encibra 2014 the ibge s 2010 census indicated that only 27 of the population in itaboraí another peripheral municipality receive wss services see table 7 itaboraí s municipal sanitation plan states that part of the water is supplied by a municipal wss system this system draws water from artesian wells and other surface water sources these waters do not receive any kind of treatment constituting a sanitary risk for the population since the decision by petrobras to build a large petrochemical complex comperj in itaboraí this municipality has recently experienced a population boom that has included the construction of a greater number of informal settlements and made the water supply even more precarious indeed são gonçalo and itaboraí two municipalities located in east rmrj that depend on the imunana laranjal system have experienced decades of water supply problems due to incomplete systems these problems will be aggravated by a deficit in water production as foreseen in the rio de janeiro water resources plan 6 socio technical interventions and future scenarios for the rmrj water and sanitation problems 6 1 the guandu ii project new infrastructure using the same water source the plan to meet currently unmet and future demands presented by cedae in 2016 focuses on the expansion of the guandu system motta 2013 nowaski 2015 conen 2015 briard 2015 this project referred to by the media local residents and the institutions involved as the guandu ii project will according to the general sales and marketing director of cedae interviewed in december 2103 directly or indirectly benefit eleven municipalities of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region including the capital rio de janeiro motta 2013 this intent is confirmed by another source conen 2015 the new water treatment plant would have an initial production capacity of 12 m3 s drawing water from the marapicu ii reservoir through a new 3 5 km pipeline motta 2013 conen 2015 briard 2015 the building of this new infrastructure would also ensure 100 000 domestic connections serving more than three million inhabitants de brito 2014 in the long term cedae s plans intend to double the initial productivity of the guandu system bringing it to a final flow rate of 24 m3 s conen 2015 the plan is to invest brl 3 4 billion in this project briard 2015 which will be provided to cedae directly by caixa econômica federal ibid this federal savings bank is the second largest government owned bank in latin america and is responsible for financing water and sanitation systems and social housing programs from the point of view of cedae s projects and actions the reduction of water losses about 40 of total produced water and the implementation of water demand management do not seem to be serious issues problems such as the absence of water metering lack of user registration meter reading errors physical losses from the supply network and illegal connections to the system are not given due importance meanwhile a study performed for the state water resources plan inea fundação coppetec 2014 which was presented in 2014 showed that a reduction in real physical water losses of 30 in the guandu system alone by 2030 would allow savings of approximately 6 m3 s water which is enough to supply 1 7 million inhabitants another question is that the expansion of the guandu system will require an amount of time and money that is not readily available the president of cedae jorge briard has reported that the construction of guandu ii will be funded via a brl 3 4 billion loan from caixa econômica federal briard 2015 in the three years of in field research it transpired that guandu ii has raised expectations about the improvement of the water supply in baixada fluminense among the local population and institutions however it still reproduces the current unequal supply geography providing services for the entire region that is already serviced by the guandu system as a matter of fact the planned infrastructure will not provide water exclusively to baixada fluminense but to the municipality of rio de janeiro too in addition it is expected that the guandu ii project will provide further security for water treatment serving as an alternative in situations of risk and during essential maintenance concerning the baixada fluminense s water supply problems expanding just one drinking water production plant will not solve the problem of providing regular access to water for its 3 7 million inhabitants in the short term 6 2 solutions proposed for east rmrj the water deficit existing today in the eastern area of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region will tend to worsen with the expectations of economic growth and subsequent population growth to address this shortage the state water resource plan points out four different possible solutions i construction of the guapiaçu river dam ii the use of the waters from the jurturnaíba dam which now serves part of the região dos lagos region on the east coast of rio de janeiro iii the use of the waters from the ribeirão lages dam and iv the diversion of water from rio grande river to the alto guapiaçu dam inea fundação coppetec 2014 among these alternatives the state government of rio de janeiro has opted for the controversial construction of the guapiaçu dam in a bid to increase water availability by 5 5 m3 s doerj 2015 the project is currently paralyzed due to its environmental and social impacts which include the resettlement of families of farmers and agrarian reform settlers ibid conflicts around this proposal led to the creation of a water crisis parliamentary inquiry set up by the rio de janeiro state legislature the commissioners have made recommendations to the state government through the state environmental agency for the development and detailing of the four alternative proposals they have asked the state environmental agency to prepare the necessary studies to assess and compare the technical environmental social economic and financial feasibility of each one to provide full transparency and ensure that the alternative chosen is indeed the best solution ibid p 18 when analyzing the future water scenario of rmrj as a whole it is necessary to consider the climate especially because it is a coastal region the metropolitan area and the guandu river basin may be affected by prolonged periods of drought which would reduce the availability of water dependence on one supply source might worsen this scenario on the other hand considering the opposite hypothesis to droughts the possibility of more intense rainfall volschan 2008 points out that this would result in increased turbidity fecal contamination and affect other physicochemical parameters relevant to water potability standards this would mean greater care would be needed in the production process at the water treatment stations and would thus raise operating costs 7 discussion and conclusion the paper draws upon the theoretical framework of socio technical systems and while using it as an analytical lens understands water supply systems as complex socio technical systems that once established generally possess a high degree of path dependency that is by virtue of their physical embeddedness in urban sub structures and their reliance on powerful regulatory economic interests they tend to be resistant to change moss et al 2011 p 1 some scholars have used the concept of momentum to explain the conservative attitude of socio technical systems furlong 2014 hughes 1994 others interpret this change aversion as an aspect of human relations with objects and artifacts geels 2005 from this perspective a water supply system is an artifact and as a complex socio technical artifact its evolutionary path is mediated by underpinning political and institutional structures and the related socio spatial power relations centralized networks are a specific artifact for water supply which have gained momentum for a long time and are still strongly embedded in the socio spatial context in both the global north and the global south moss et al 2011 even if they are starting to be questioned barraqué 2013 britto et al 2014 one characteristic of centralized infrastructure is that it provides one single quality of water ocde 2009 metropolitan systems are prisoners of technically and economically oriented choices guy et al 2011 having been made at earlier stages these choices often limit the potential for adaptation to new challenges in general their common features are high degree of centralization and weak adaptability the same standard of water quality for all water uses and consumption based financial models i e depending on tariffs based on the volume of water consumed finally their old and often obsolete design reinforces their typical structural rigidity rio de janeiro metropolitan region s water supply system is a highly centralized technical network we selected it as a case study and analyzed its historical evolution as a paradigmatic example of a megalopolis based socio technical system in the south the diachronic perspective allowed us to emphasize the path dependence of the current system as well as its future problems and limitations the rmrj has gone through rapid deep rooted territorial changes in the past ten years especially due to economic growth and the development of the state s oil industry furthermore the municipality of rio de janeiro the core of the metropolis has been chosen as the host city for several international events such as the world cup and the olympics which in turn has led to territorial changes that have affected the entire metropolis such transformations have put the metropolitan area including the suburbs and peripheries in the national spotlight while boosting the interest of researchers and planners in brazil and abroad on the other hand access to essential urban utilities such as mass transportation water supply and sanitation services has seen little improvement in the metropolitan fringes especially those described in this study such as the baixada fluminense there are still serious problems related to the intermittent water supply and overall service quality the solutions proposed by the state government to meet growing demand are still based on this kind of centralized model the guandu system is a highly centralized technical network based on only one source to supply 80 of the metropolitan region serving about 9 4 million people the technical decision to expand the guandu system will reinforce the dependence of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region on this one source contradicting the basic tenets of sustainable water use the fair and equitable functioning of a socio technical water supply system does not just have to do with the availability of water and technical issues it is about ensuring that each citizen has equal and reliable access to sufficient quantities of safe water at an affordable price to lead a healthy dignified and productive life the in depth descriptive case study of the rmrj building upon multiple data sources resulted in the identification of a technical recursive factor that has marked the evolutionary path of the socio technical system and still strengthens the insecurity of water services in the rio de janeiro megacity showing its path dependence it therefore has the power to answer the research questions why are inequalities in the rio de janeiro wss system resistant to change are those inequalities linked to the characteristics of the technical system the hegemony of a supply side technical paradigm driven at an operational level by a large centralized infrastructure model overseen by cedae was decided on and planned in a top down manner during the 1970s when it gathered momentum now it is already embedded in the socio spatial context and is resistant to change this embeddedness leads to the inattentiveness to alternative water supply solutions such as decentralized systems the solutions conceived by the state government and the state water company are very conservative as they neglect new possibilities for water demand management measures to control water losses and the use of alternative solutions to complement the water supply increasing the guandu system producing the same standard quality of treated water for different water uses without a demand management perspective could aggravate the vulnerability of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region s supply as it is currently structured socially and politically even if water scarcity cannot be related to climate change prolonged periods of drought are predicted as a possible scenario for coming years if this scenario is played out the inhabitants of the peripheral areas of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region which currently do not have adequate access to a water supply will be disproportionately affected it is important to stress that demographic growth in metropolitan rio is more intense in these areas the rigidity of the centralized guandu system has made all the inhabitants dependent on its infrastructure which is difficult to overcome the current rmrj water supply system and the future scenarios proposed by the main government institutions reflect these path dependence factors as a unique socio technical system it seems inadequate to deal with the current threefold challenge concerning water to meet demand for water supply linked to a specific pattern of demographic growth to adapt to uncertainties arising from climate change and to maintain the ecological systems that provide water meanwhile because of the shortfalls in the water provision system many of the residents of baixada fluminense use wells or collective springs as a supplementary source of water britto et al 2014 these alternative technologies which often have strong roots in the local culture deserve attention they could be arranged in such a way as to complement the macro systems thereby providing access to water in the short term while the above description focuses on the socio technical dimension on an empirical level at the conceptual level it stresses the complexity and multidimensionality of the water supply system actually the resistance to change of rmrj s water supply systems cannot be explained only by observing technical aspects political cultural and institutional factors represent major barriers to incremental changes towards decentralization in the state of rio de janeiro and particularly in rmrj there lacks a municipal culture britto 2016 and the institutional capacity to lead the decentralization of water supply management even if low tech approaches and other socio technical solutions based on decentralized water supply system were technically possible there is no political commitment to promote their implementation nowadays there is a process of liberalization or dismantling of the public provision of basic services water included a bill 2345 2017 proposing the privatization of cedae was approved by the rio de janeiro state legislature at the beginning of 2017 the municipalities served by cedae have not questioned the law this political measure shows that political efforts are not geared towards investigating alternative and more inclusive paths of governance maintaining the classical bipolar options of market or state and the correspondingly centralized power structure the strengthening of municipal governments and the promotion of their cooperation may exert a counterforce against this trend nonetheless inter municipal cooperation is very poor in rmrj britto et al 2017 a recent study about inter municipal consortia in brazil britto et al 2017 emphasizes the importance of local actors commitment and mobilization for inter municipal cooperation stressing the role of a bottom up dynamics for building joint ventures in rmrj two main components hinder this process britto 2016 britto et al 2017 the lack of demographic and economic homogeneity among municipalities and above all the cultural heritage of patrimonialism in political and governmental practices future research still from a path dependence and socio technical perspective could pay attention to these aspects and alternative solutions political and cultural drivers deserve future research attention from a path dependence perspective one relevant question is what factors could break the embeddedness of the hegemonic socio technical structure and promote socio technical change making room for decentralized systems or at least some integration between the systems the present research has the typical limitations of case studies and exploratory research providing an in depth description of a specific historical and geographical context however thanks to the wealth of detail and the length of the in field research it aims to contribute to the academic debate on the universalization of water supply especially in megacities in the global south acknowledgements the three authors wish to thank faperj and cnpq for the provision of funding part of the research was carried out within the desafio project funded by the eu s seventh framework programme for research 
6563,access to safe drinking water is now recognized as a human right and a government priority at an international level in modern megacities where urban agglomerations progressively encroach on the fringes between cities and rural areas a growing trend in developing countries water access is an urgent concern like most of the world s megacities the rio de janeiro metropolitan region is marked by a dependence on water sources outside its borders this paper describes and discusses the unequal distribution of water supply and sanitation wss services in this metropolitan area from a historical path dependence perspective drawing upon the theoretical concept of the socio technical system it explores diachronically past present and future scenarios of wss in the area the conclusions stress the existence of socio technical path dependency and raise questions for future researches keywords water supply socio technical systems rio de janeiro metropolitan region 1 introduction the issue of urban water scarcity is real compelling and growing in 2000 150 million people lived in cities facing perennial water shortages where the per capita supply was less than 100 l day almost 900 million people lived in cities that faced seasonal shortages where supply dipped below 100 l day at least one month each year by 2050 these numbers are expected to grow to 1 billion and 3 1 billion people respectively nearly a third of humanity and over half of the 6 billion urban dwellers predicted by 2050 will face critical water shortages in their cities xylem 2013 in developing countries many metropolitan areas are facing increasing water scarcity this problem is likely to be further aggravated by rapid population growth and changes in the hydro environment on various scales historical problems such as the gap between growing demand and supply capacity poorly maintained infrastructure and intermittent supply may be aggravated by global environmental changes these changes will exacerbate the scarcity of bulk water associated with both climatic stressors extreme hydrological events environmental variability and change and non climatic stressors environmental characteristics and anthropogenic pressures pahl wostl 2009 ipcc 2014 one of the main points of this paper is that these problems both those associated with natural events and those produced by technical or social contingencies are not isolated rather they are wickedly weber and khademian 2008 entangled within the prevailing socio technical system the way the socio technical system is managed affects the way these problems are addressed water related problems are also associated with urban growth especially but not exclusively in developing countries if the largest urban agglomerations of the early twentieth century were mostly in industrialized countries the vast majority of today s megacities are located in developing ones demographia 2016a according to demographia s world urban areas index the rio de janeiro metropolitan region rmrj currently with 11 835 708 inhabitants is the 27th largest megacity in the worldwide total of 34 demographia 2015 it is the second largest in brazil in terms of both population size and economic output preceded only by the são paulo metropolitan area and the third largest in south america also after buenos aires despite the general availability of water brazil faces serious challenges in universalizing wss services over 1 5 million of the country s approximately 57 million households do not have toilets twenty five million households do not have access to a sewerage system and nearly ten million have no access to a public drinking water system ibge 2010 the poor access to water services in the south east of the country has started gaining visibility in the local and national media because of the frequent water shortages which especially affect the urban peripheries moreover the prolonged drought in 2014 2015 brought the question of water supply in the region to the center of a broad and complex national debate indeed the drought triggered a crisis that has harmed the water system based on the large interstate paraíba do sul river watershed causing a conflict among the three main states in the southeast rio de janeiro são paulo and minas gerais and especially between the first two despite all these serious occurrences the problems of the rmrj water supply such as its unequal socio spatial distribution cannot be attributed to natural events only building upon the theoretical concept of the socio technical system and the related academic debate on wss services this paper shows that wss systems as socio technical systems are affected by path dependence in other words the historical conditions in which the water supply systems were designed shape their future development the paper reaches this conclusion while offering an original analysis based on an in depth descriptive case study of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region the article is structured as follows section 2 outlines the theoretical framework focusing on the construction of the water supply system as a socio technical system section 3 presents the methodological approach describing the rationale and main steps of our case study section 4 reports on the historical and socio economic processes that have shaped the rio de janeiro metropolitan region and its water supply system section 5 provides a geographical characterization of the current water sources and related supply systems section 6 introduces the socio technical interventions proposed by local governments for the future and section 7 discusses the case study in the light of socio technical system theory and proposes some conclusions 2 theoretical background water supply service as a socio technical system several scholars agree that water supply systems can be defined as socio technical systems coutard et al 2004 moss et al 2011 definitions of socio technical systems or socio technical networks are rooted in the impossibility of separating technology from society as stated by winner 1980 p 126 societies choose structures for technologies that influence how people are going to work communicate travel consume and so forth over a very long time choices about technology have important consequences for the form and quality of human associations santos emphasizes technology as the most important mode of interrelation between man and nature and between man and geographical space technologies are a set of instrumental and social means with which man carries out his life produces and at the same time creates space santos 1996 in the introduction to their book a collection of texts by different scholars coutard hanley and zimmerman mention that all these scholars believe that technologies are shaped by society at the same time as they shape society or in other words that social technical systems and technical societies co evolve coutard et al 2004 p 1 involving not just physical artifacts but also organizational structures institutional arrangements and social and cultural meanings once socio technical systems are established they possess a high degree of path dependency tending to be resistant to change existing formal socio technical systems are prisoners of technical and economic choices made in the past that often restrict their adaptation to new challenges guy et al 2011 madeleine akrich 1992 observes that technical objects and social actors whether individual or collective are in a relationship of reciprocal adjustment they should never be analyzed separately to avoid falling into technological determinism or sociological constructivism p 208 nonetheless to conceive of them as an integrated asset that is neither technical nor social but socio technical we need to confront a twofold problem the linguistic problem of elaborating proper and integrated semantics and the methodological problem of analyzing sociotechnical artifacts before they become naturalized p 219 and rooted within a human community for akrich we need to study socio technical phenomena through the phases of negotiation bargaining claims and accusations that come from the side of the technical designers operators or from the side of user community in other words we need to study socio technical phenomena as conflicting processes of an intrinsically political nature lorrain and poupeau define water supply services as socio technical systems that have become essential to urban and metropolitan inhabitants they stress one important aspect of these urban socio technical systems water supply systems have their own physical morphology and properties which are embedded in a territory whose social and natural features match the institutional mechanisms constructed for their management the territories the water supply systems and the institutional mechanisms to manage them are marked by a specific history and by the relationship between different social groups with their own conflicts and interests lorrain and poupeau 2014 formal socio technical systems for water provision in the global south and in latin american metropolises generally have the same characteristics as the systems of the networks in the global north they are highly centralized in their physical structure and management their adaptability to environmental change is limited they provide the same standard quality of treated water for all uses and their forms of financing are almost always based on payment by users according to the volume consumed britto et al 2015 monstadt and schramm 2013 the local populations that use the systems are not involved in decisions about the management allocation and use of water as moss 2001 p 6 notes the only contact between provider and users is normally their monthly or annual bill this centralized model has also been identified as a conventional network le bris and coutard 2008 i e with an interconnected set of equipment centrally planned and managed by a single operator offering a seamless service in a certain territory making it increasingly interlocked these large artifacts shaped by central government policies at once generate new demands and affect the future trajectories and design of urban policies swyngedouw 2004 gandy 2002 these are socio technical systems with a high degree of path dependency furlong 2014 draws upon hughes s 1994 concept of momentum hughes coined this concept to explain how technology and society i e political economic and cultural institutions co evolving to create a stable socio technical system end up producing black boxes that are resistant to change geels 2005 also cited in furlong attributes this resistance to change to human attitudes to adaptation especially to material things and artifacts furlong agreeing with other scholars concerned with the social aspect of science and technology writes that a technical artifact that gathers momentum like a water supply network molds the surrounding geographical space the socio technical system embedded in this space becomes normalized and invisible and therefore resistant to change conventional networks for water supply can be conceived as technologies that have gained momentum for more than a century when this centralized model is implemented in developing countries it is often ineffective in meeting urban demands especially because of the accelerated urbanization that has taken place in recent decades ahlers et al 2014 nilsson 2006 this leads to questions about the role of the state and the conventional model of large infrastructure solutions for the provision of public services and the potential of informal or alternative solutions scholars that have studied water supply provision in urban contexts in the global south maintain that large centralized public systems recursively re produce spatial inequalities harvey 2010 excluding peripheral areas or lower income neighborhoods nilsson 2006 kudva 2009 it is not certain that these socio technical characteristics are adapted to the new multidimensional challenges technical e g extending water supply networks to periurban areas economic e g financial investments and social tariffs environmental e g climate change and potable water availability and social e g universal access to services once idealized as the epitome of modernity and progress distributing services and creating social solidarity large water supply infrastructure networks are currently the object of criticism in northern countries because of their incompatibility with the principles of sustainable development and in the south because of their incapacity to provide universal services coutard and rutherford 2013 moss 2008 domènech march and saurí 2013 jaglin 2012 the potential of decentralized systems e g local energy networks alternative techniques for wastewater rainwater management and harvesting for non potable uses has been discussed and emphasized coutard and rutherford 2013 barraqué 2013 these decentralized systems would be less vulnerable than macro systems which are subject to domino effects when there are breakdowns or accidents at certain points in the network furthermore they are more flexible more adaptable to local conditions and thus more capable of generalizing access to services in local contexts discussing this issue barraqué 2013 p 19 argues that ultimately for the time being it can be considered that water savings should remain the preferred option in the central densely populated and already equipped areas recycling and alternative technologies should be limited to cases where water demand continues to grow and may require utilities to invest in new and more costly resources innovations should then be given priority in peripheries new and alternative forms of services should be publicly discussed prior to their implementation in brazil municipalities have different options to manage their wss services i via a direct or autonomous management structure by means of a public department or municipal corporation ii in association with other municipalities through the development of inter municipal cooperation consortia iii by delegating management either to state companies or to private corporations in the rio de janeiro metropolitan region most of the municipalities delegate these services to the state water supply and sanitation company known by its acronym cedae by doing so they also delegate decisions concerning the socio technical water supply system to the state company there are no municipal or local systems for water provision but two large socio technical systems managed by cedae which it designed to provide an integrated water service to the municipalities in the east and the west of rmrj the former is called the imunana laranjal hydraulic system and the latter the guandu river system 3 research rationale this research follows an in depth case study methodology i e it examines a general issue through the investigation of a relevant case yin 2005 the main unit of analysis is the water supply system of a megacity and the unequal access to water the selected case is the rio de janeiro metropolitan region rmrj a paradigmatic case for latin america metropolises for our research design we drew upon gerring 2004 who maintains that intensive single case studies are welcome when the purpose is exploratory and aimed at understanding a phenomenon that is also relevant for other units i e it answers a new research question rather than providing theory testing verification falsification according to flyvbjerg 2006 case studies should not be methodology driven but problem driven from this perspective it is a mistake to evaluate case study based research with the technical rigor typical of quantitative methods the added value of a descriptive case study is precisely its technical unboundedness which allows it to freely focus on the problem and acquire relevant context related knowledge flyvbjerg 2006 richness of detail and content constitutes the main advantage of a descriptive investigation bourdieu 1977 flyvbjerg 2006 we also draw on lorrain and poupeau 2014 who provide guidelines for qualitative research in water governance they emphasize the importance of both information pluralism p 8 and historical perspective while adopting a socio technical perspective for water governance they stress the relevance of longue dureé history p 10 meaning a historical interpretation of social phenomena not based on contingency but on the main structures identified on a longer temporal scale such an in depth view is often neglected in hydrological research where technical concerns prevail drawing upon lorrain and poupeau ibid we employed data from multiple sources historical academic sources research reports scientific papers monographs official statistical data national datasets ibge snis international datasets demographia interviews with key informants from the government institutions involved which were held throughout the field research commercial director of the water company supervisor of the state water company director of the river basin organization local technical staff from the state water company and the national press we designed our descriptive case study involving three years of field research in line with this methodological premise and our exploratory purpose the first step was to identify our research problem and question why are inequalities in the rmrj wss resistant to change are these inequalities linked to the characteristics of the technical system to answer these questions we provide a description of our diachronic case study outlining its historical trajectory past describing in detail the existing hydrological and technical system present and projecting the alternative socio technical scenarios identified by the main government actors involved future 4 a historic perspective on water supply services in the rio de janeiro metropolitan region the rio de janeiro metropolitan region rmrj with a combined population of 11 835 708 covers 21 municipalities that reflect centuries old imbalances in regional development in brazil two integrated systems provide water to the region i the guandu lages acari system which supplies the west comprising rio de janeiro city and a region called baixada fluminense between the coast of guanabara bay and the mountainous região serrana region map 1 with 9 846 035 inhabitants and ii the imunana laranjal system which supplies the east including niterói são gonçalo and itaboraí with 1 772 727 inhabitants agência nacional de águas ana 2010 see map 1 in this paper we refer to the former area as west rmrj and the latter as east rmrj this study does not consider three smaller municipalities with local water supply systems guapimirim magé tanguá and maricá 564 155 inhabitants map 1 shows the geographical location of west rmrj and east rmrj together these two systems guandu lages acari and imunana laranjal supply 96 6 of the inhabitants of rmrj 4 1 water supply services in rio de janeiro and its western side the baixada fluminense area the characteristics of rmrj are strongly related to the history of the city of rio de janeiro which was the capital of brazil from 1763 to 1960 when brasilia was made the new capital the importance of the municipality grew rapidly in the eighteenth century thanks to gold mining which was centered in the neighboring state of minas gerais furtado 2000 osório 2005 prado junior 2006 when the portuguese royal family moved to rio de janeiro 1808 and coffee started to be grown and exported the city s population growth started to accelerate coffee production and exportation prompted an early process of industrialization prado junior 2006 once brazil was proclaimed a republic in 1889 rio de janeiro the capital city was transformed into the federal district and the nearby municipality of niterói became capital of the state of rio de janeiro osório 2005 rio de janeiro s economic dynamism and cultural importance grew as did its urban infrastructure and services in october 1960 brasilia became the new capital city or federal district and rio de janeiro became the capital of a new state guanabara created on april 14 1960 within the overall process of modernization of the brazilian economy the resulting financial autonomy triggered by this institutional transformation of rio de janeiro facilitated the execution of public investments that ultimately reorganized the spatial structure of the city penalva 1990 in the early 1960s two capitals effectively coexisted in brazil although the federal legislature and judiciary were soon moved to brasilia the executive branch remained in rio however after the 1964 military coup and the introduction of military rule things changed in order to avoid popular protests the government included an article 183 to the 1967 constitution by which the executive branch of government was finally moved to brasília the state of guanabara maintained a privileged position for a few years regarding the allocation of water supply resources especially when compared with the municipalities in the state of rio de janeiro in 1961 the guanabara state government began working on a water supply plan to meet its water needs until 2000 and identified the guandu river as the main supply source silva 1965 cedag 1970 this small river became the main water supply for guanabara state thanks to the creation in 1952 of a large and complex system to divert water from the paraíba do sul river downstream for hydropower generation this system was designed and implemented by light the rio de janeiro electricity utility mcdowall 2008 for which reason it is also known as the light system in 1960 guanabara state had a population of about 3 3 million now guandu is the main water supply source for the rio de janeiro metropolitan region the guandu water treatment station is the largest in the world according to guinness with a water treatment capacity of 43 m3 s in the 1960s the guanabara state government created two public companies to manage wss services empresa de águas do estado daguanabara cedag and empresa de saneamento daguanabara esag in the state of rio de janeiro until the end of 1968 water supply services were managed by the water and sanitary engineering commission which was under the control of the public works department in this same year a new body for water governance was created superintendência central de engenharia sanitária sucesa which served as a kind of holding company that managed a group of regional water supply departments less than ten years later in 1972 sucesa was replaced by a public company owned by the state of rio de janeiro companhia de saneamento do estado do rio de janeiro sanerj brasileiro 1976 in 1975 guanabara state capital city rio de janeiro and rio de janeiro state capital city niterói were merged by a complementary law passed on july 1 1974 accordingly the management bodies of the two states were also merged and the structure of water supply services went through major transformations a new public water company was created companhia estadual de águas e esgotos cedae a state owned utility responsible for providing wss services for the new state it originated from the merger of three companies with very different characteristics cedag esag and sanerj as marques 1999 has shown cedag was financially and economically sound had well paid and well trained staff that operated the company following conservative technical standards and had considerable operational liberty meanwhile sanerj was not financially sound did not have well trained technical personnel and suffered from intense political interference on the part of the governor s office which used the operation of systems in smaller municipalities as leverage for political negotiations with other mayors esag was in an intermediate situation but closer to that of cedag the consolidation of these three companies was carried out under the strong command of cedag marques 1999 p 53 almost simultaneously with the merger of guanabara and rio de janeiro states the rio de janeiro metropolitan region rmrj was established by law lei complementar n 20 july 1 1974 the creation of the new metropolitan area prompted the new state government to design a new plan for wss for this area called the impact plan the purpose was to integrate the different water supply systems in rmrj to improve the service for the entire region the main objective was to organize a large and integrated system that would provide water for the municipalities in the baixada fluminense region and for rio de janeiro city the population of the baixada fluminense region had grown consistently since the 1940s putting increased pressure on the water supply infrastructure despite coinciding with the beginning of the industrialization process in some areas population growth in baixada fluminense was mainly due to the influx of new residents as most of them worked in the city of rio de janeiro geiger 1956 the land was divided into plots which were sold and built upon by their new inhabitants improvements to transportation systems and accessibility in the region in 1935 i e railroad electrification and establishment of a single rail fare facilitated mobility between rio and baixada fluminense which contributed to the increasingly intense process of urban occupation in 1951 the rodovia presidente dutra highway was opened allowing access to the area by motor transport the real estate boom of the 1950s was thus marked by the rapid proliferation of precarious neighborhoods which became a new housing option for low income workers in rio abreu 1987 souza 2014 this process took place without any specific public policy or plan to address urban infrastructure development and led to a demographic boom in baixada fluminense see table 1 from 1940 to 1950 the population of the baixada fluminense grew by 157 4 5 times more than the municipality of rio de janeiro from 1950 to 1960 it grew by 145 and from 1960 to 1970 it grew a further 80 see chart 1 the impact plan for the integration of metropolitan water supply systems was designed to increase the supply of water to the municipalities in the baixada fluminense region and rio de janeiro and to increase the number of households connected to the water network however in their analysis of the development of the plan between 1975 and 1978 britto 1995 and marques 1993 found that despite the priority announced by the state government and cedae of investing in the baixada this did not happen the municipality of rio de janeiro especially the more affluent areas received the largest volume of investments until the 1980s the acari system which was very dependent on rainfall patterns was the only source of water to supply baixada fluminese it had been built between 1877 and 1909 to supply the municipality of rio de janeiro after the reorganization of the systems in 1975 the acari water pipelines supplied water only to the baixada fluminense area in 1981 a new water pipeline was inaugurated to supply baixada fluminense municipalities channeling water from the guandu system nonetheless expansions in water production and adduction failed to generate sufficient volumes for the entire baixada fluminense area these network expansions were executed without the construction of reservoirs leading to the creation of a system afflicted by high degrees of uncertainty precarious functioning and dependency on permanent water related manoeuvers the absence of a well organized distribution system provoked water shortages or irregular distribution in several locations it also caused excessive pressure on specific points of the system leading to an increase in leaks causing damage to water mains and serious water losses 4 2 historical roots of the water supply system in east rmrj the growth toward the eastern side of rmrj began in 1930 when the urban and industrial progress of rio de janeiro reached surrounding areas such as the north of niterói and são gonçalo urban development in this region which has been described in the urban planning literature brasileiro 1976 followed the same process as in the west producing the pattern of urban peripheral development typical of most brazilian metropolises kowarick 1979 maricato and org 1982 in east rmrj the municipality of niterói is the central nucleus while the periphery here called the eastern periphery includes são gonçalo and itaboraí the process of occupation by informal precarious self built unsupervised settlements was intense throughout the 1950s see table 2 niterói was a consolidated central core as it was the capital of the state of rio de janeiro until 1975 in the nineteenth century as state capital this city had privileged access to a range of urban services such as the steam ferry running between rio and niterói street lighting a water supply and electric streetcars ibge 2016 the merger of the states of rio de janeiro and guanabara and the loss of the status of capital could have led to the economic and political decline of the city but the inauguration of the costa e silva bridge connecting it to rio gave an impetus to the city s real estate sector ibid the growth of east rmrj towards the eastern periphery was led by the municipality of são gonçalo today the second most populous municipality in the state of rio de janeiro with about one million inhabitants the provision of wss services to most of its residents is precarious as is the case in the western part of baixada fluminense chart 2 illustrates how the eastern rmrj periphery came to exceed the size of the central city of niteroi the construction of niterói s water supply system began with the channeling of river waters outside the city limits originating in the serra de friburgo and the reservatório da correção reservoir in niterói at the beginning of the twentieth century another source outside the municipality the paraíso dam started being used to supply niterói the dam was supplied by rivers from serra de teresópolis a nearby mountain range this system was completed in 1933 in 1940s a new intake was built the imunana canal as part of a macro drainage project aimed at reducing flooding in the region the waters of the guapiaçu and macacu rivers were channeled to the laranjal water treatment station in são gonçalo this station was opened in 1954 cedae 2014 with a treatment capacity of 0 5 m3 s and has been expanded several times the canal was built by the national department of works and sanitation to drain the areas of the lowland frequently flooded by the confluence of the macacu and guapiaçu rivers after the construction of the canal the natural course of the macacu river was diverted joining the guapimirim river which in turn became affluent of the right bank of the guapiaçu petrobras uff fec 2008 in 1954 the raw water in the imunana canal was captured to supply the cities of niterói and são gonçalo in that year the laranjal water treatment station in são gonçalo had the capacity to treat a flow of more than 0 5 m3 s the outflow was increased with the construction of a booster and by 1972 the capacity of laranjal was 1 3 m3 s cedae 1985 however access to the water supply in são gonçalo was extremely precarious in 1974 only 15 of são gonçalo households had access to piped water while in niteroi this average was 70 brasileiro 1976 water access in rmrj in the 1980s is shown in table 3 the preceding description serves to demonstrate that the inequalities in access to water supply between the central rio de janeiro and niteroi and peripheral municipalities of rmrj have historical roots as mentioned by marques 1993 and britto 1995 wss investments in the peripheral municipalities began in the 1980s after decades of demographic growth 1940 1960 between the middle of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s the technical choice for a centrally planned model to be managed by a single operator was made this choice could be seen as the momentum behind the trajectory of path dependence hughes ibid furlong ibid in the rmrj water supply system an alternative to the single centralized socio technical system in the form of a polycentric integrated network with local decentralized reservoirs has never been considered the socio technical network composed of the guandu system on the west side and imunan laranjal on the east has become normalized deep rooted and therefore resistant to change 5 the rmrj water supply system today like most megacities the rio de janeiro metropolitan region is marked by its dependence on sources that lie outside its borders indeed the availability of water inside the region is not sufficient to meet the growing demand of its municipalities in terms of either quantity or quality since the 1960s water sources inside the region have been highly polluted the region s boundaries have been changed many times since it was established in 1974 here in line with this study s purposes we consider only the municipalities in the metropolitan area which are supplied by the two main water supply systems guandu lajes acari and imunana laranjal see map 2 as they represent the most densely occupied area in rmrj map 3 the eastern area of the metropolitan region including niteroi são gonçalo itaboraí is served by the imunana laranjal system and other isolated systems provide water to maricá and guapimirim the imunana laranjal supply deficit is currently 2 2 m3 s inea fundação coppetec 2014 the western part encompassing baixada fluminense and the city of rio de janeiro is mainly served by the guandu lajes acari system this system imports water from the surrounding watersheds paraíba do sul and guandu which provide a more sustainable and efficient water supply agência nacional de águas ana 2010 5 1 water supply in west rmrj companhia estadual de águas e esgotos cedae operates the two systems that supply water to rmrj the guandu lajes acari system see map 2 is composed of three parts the oldest is the acari system also known as the black lines in reference to its pipes which are made of cast iron and differentiate it from more modern water supply systems at present the system s flow ranges from 1 9 m3 s to 2 6 m3 s cedae 2013 and its area of influence is limited to the territory corresponding to the municipalities of nova iguaçu duque de caxias and some areas of belford roxo and queimados cedae 2013 inea fundação coppetec 2014 table 4 shows the building date diameter length and maximum flow of each of these networks the water from these sub systems mixes with water from the guandu system at several points constituting a highly complex water supply system in baixada fluminense britto et al 2014 quintslr and britto 2014 the lages system see map 2 has two water mains that bring water from the lages reservoir de santa ritta 2009 the associated dam originally built to produce electricity regulates a flow rate of 16 5 m3 s since the 1940s 5 5 m3 s of this flow has been used to supply rio de janeiro city de santa ritta 2009 the two mains have diameters which range from 1500 mm to 1750 mm cedag 1970 they reach the pedregulho reservoir in benfica located in the municipality of rio de janeiro while crossing more than 70 km from the fontes power plant through seropédica and nova iguaçu two municipalities in the baixada fluminense along the way they supply some reservoirs in this region with a small volume of water cedae 2013 the guandu system is the result of a huge feat of hydraulic engineering which provides for the transfer of water from the large interstate paraiba do sul river into minor coastal rivers such as the guandu initially built for hydroelectric power production its volume has been increased and it is now used to supply water to rmrj servicing more than 80 of its population the paraiba do sul river basin experienced a severe drought that began in 2014 and continued throughout 2015 nevertheless data from the rio de janeiro environmental agency inea show that the supply of west rmrj was not affected by the drought in virtue of successive adaptations made to the guandu catchment system the testimony of inhabitants and local practitioners given in interviews shows that existing water supply problems in the baixada fluminense cannot be attributed to a water shortage or climate change water extraction for the guandu system occurs via a raw water lift known as the guandu low hold located at the border between the municipalities of seropédica and nova iguaçu water is lifted to the guandu water treatment station cedae 1985 this station has undergone countless renovations and now has a production capacity of nearly 43 m3 s last year the state government announced that a new guandu cf section 5 would be constructed for the additional production of 12 m3 s water with the aim of responding to growing demand in the metropolitan area conen 2015 water treated at the guandu water treatment station follows two different initial paths about 21 m3 s passes through a tunnel heading for the macacos reservoir to supply the south zone of rio de janeiro and the same quantity goes to the treated water lifts that hold water for the marapicu reservoir the marapicu reservoir has a capacity of 20 000 m3 cedae 1985 supplying five pipelines two of these pipelines service the baixada fluminense the main baixada fluminense pipeline and the new baixada fluminense pipeline carrying water to the region at up to 9 m3 s motta 2013 britto et al 2014 quintslr and britto 2014 this huge metropolitan water supply system is represented in map 2 the state water resources plan inea fundação coppetec 2014 estimates that total water production is around 49 5 m3 s 1 minor differences in the total flow of water in the guandu lages acari system may be due to different sources of data ceade 2013 motta 2013 inea 2014 and variations in the water flow of each of its parts especially the acari system 1 of which only 13 m3 s provides baixada fluminense municipalities cedae 2013 quintslr and britto 2014 as can be seen in table 4 below see table 5 the operationalization of the guandu lajes acari system produces inequalities in the access to public water services among the municipalities of west rmrj see table 6 public supply network table 6 reports on empirical evidence providing data about household access to water according to the ibge census ibge 2010 furthermore nowadays many parts of baixada fluminense do not have a regular water supply three of our interviewees technicians from the local cedae operational departments or daes from baixada fluminense and the cedae metropolitan distribution and sales director for baixada fluminense confirmed the serious problems of intermittency and pressure dae 2014 nowaski 2015 this intermittence or irregularity of supply means that residents of certain areas in duque de caxias nova iguaçu belford roxo queimados paracambi and japeri only have water two days a week on average britto et al 2014 this fact was ascertained during the three years of fieldwork ibid though cedae provides no official quantitative information about intermittent supply to the municipalities snsa mcidades 2016 the dae technicians interviewed said that many neighborhoods cannot be supplied every day since the pressure in the pipes is not high enough so they receive water only two or three times a week they stated that the water doesn t get through easily doing some manoeuvers at least some arrives dae 2014 meanwhile the director reiterated that it was not possible to supply many areas in the region properly especially duque de caxias the most populous city with almost a million inhabitants nowaski 2015 he explained that in some areas in addition to the pressure issues there are water quality problems like cyanobacteria contamination which have led to the interruption of the service for one two three months and we had one event of seven months without water in some neighborhoods ibid 2015 the problem of water availability involves both the supply and the demand side actually the water flow is insufficient for the demand in baixada fluminense as are the storage structures reservoirs more reservoirs could provide greater security for the local supply and distribution network but none have been constructed in the baixada fluminense area political factors seem to explain spatial differences of access to water first of all historically the planning of the metropolitan water supply system gives priority to rio de janeiro neglecting baixada fluminense porto 2003 second the expansions made in water production and supply infrastructure have failed to generate sufficient volumes for the entire baixada fluminense whose population has grown more rapidly than that of rio de janeiro since the 1940s the interviews with the dae technicians and the in field research showed that the work done to bring water to baixada fluminense was executed without the construction of reservoirs leading to the creation of an unpredictable and precarious system dae 2014 concerning water availability the cedae master plan for water supply prepared in 2004 indicated that the entire western part of the metropolitan area i e baixada fluminense would be supplied only by the guandu and lajes systems cedae cnec 2004 the plan also affirms that the solution to supply this area is to expand water production focusing on increasing water withdrawal from the guandu river and on resizing the water transfer pipelines the state water resources plan presented in 2014 validates this perspective noting that to meet demand by 2030 which will reach approximately 67 m3 s it will be necessary to expand water production by 18 m3 s inea fundação coppetec 2014 the flow increase should be accomplished through the guandu river considering that the lajes and acari rivers cannot accommodate any further expansion ibid 5 2 the water supply system in east rmrj the municipalities in the eastern side of the metropolitan region are supplied by the imunana laranjal system with a current production capacity of about 5 5 m3 s inea fundação coppetec 2014 this system has worse water supply problems than the guandu system with a deficit of 2 2 m3 s ibid there is an even greater discrepancy in the access to wss services between these municipalities than there is between those in west rmrj compare tables 6 and 7 the uptake of water occurs in the imunana canal see section 4 2 whose current potential capacity is 7 m3 s however the total capacity of the station is not exploited due to the limited availability of water provided by these water mains currently the guapiaçu and macacu rivers located in the macacu river basin protected area supply this region cedae 2014 according to a former cedae officer the caceribu river was also used to contribute to the supply but can no longer be used due to the degradation of its water quality guedes 2015 this has reduced the water treatment station s volumetric capacity to 5 5 m3 s although it was originally meant to be 7 m3 s cedae 2014 guedes 2015 the wss services in the municipalities of this region niterói são gonçalo itaboraí are not entirely provided by the state company cedae although it is responsible for the production of drinking water at the laranjal water treatment station since 1999 a private company águas de niterói has been responsible for water distribution in niterói the company buys water from cedae from laranjal and distributes it to users in 2014 cedae and águas de niterói signed a new contract that increased the volume transferred to the latter from 1 8 m3 s to 2 1 m3 s o globo 2015 this rise in distributed water for the municipality of niterói has exacerbated the inequality between the city s core and its periphery niterói with 487 562 inhabitants receives 2 1 m3 s leaving only 3 4 m3 s for the other municipalities in the region são gonçalo and itaboraí which have about 1 2 million inhabitants ibge data indicate that 80 of são gonçalo s population receive wss services see table 7 if we consider the total population of são gonçalo in 2010 this means that nearly 150 000 people in the municipality do not have access to such services however considering this area s lack of reservoirs and the resulting irregularities caused by the inability to regulate the distribution of treated water some residents that officially receive the service are negatively affected as well encibra 2014 the ibge s 2010 census indicated that only 27 of the population in itaboraí another peripheral municipality receive wss services see table 7 itaboraí s municipal sanitation plan states that part of the water is supplied by a municipal wss system this system draws water from artesian wells and other surface water sources these waters do not receive any kind of treatment constituting a sanitary risk for the population since the decision by petrobras to build a large petrochemical complex comperj in itaboraí this municipality has recently experienced a population boom that has included the construction of a greater number of informal settlements and made the water supply even more precarious indeed são gonçalo and itaboraí two municipalities located in east rmrj that depend on the imunana laranjal system have experienced decades of water supply problems due to incomplete systems these problems will be aggravated by a deficit in water production as foreseen in the rio de janeiro water resources plan 6 socio technical interventions and future scenarios for the rmrj water and sanitation problems 6 1 the guandu ii project new infrastructure using the same water source the plan to meet currently unmet and future demands presented by cedae in 2016 focuses on the expansion of the guandu system motta 2013 nowaski 2015 conen 2015 briard 2015 this project referred to by the media local residents and the institutions involved as the guandu ii project will according to the general sales and marketing director of cedae interviewed in december 2103 directly or indirectly benefit eleven municipalities of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region including the capital rio de janeiro motta 2013 this intent is confirmed by another source conen 2015 the new water treatment plant would have an initial production capacity of 12 m3 s drawing water from the marapicu ii reservoir through a new 3 5 km pipeline motta 2013 conen 2015 briard 2015 the building of this new infrastructure would also ensure 100 000 domestic connections serving more than three million inhabitants de brito 2014 in the long term cedae s plans intend to double the initial productivity of the guandu system bringing it to a final flow rate of 24 m3 s conen 2015 the plan is to invest brl 3 4 billion in this project briard 2015 which will be provided to cedae directly by caixa econômica federal ibid this federal savings bank is the second largest government owned bank in latin america and is responsible for financing water and sanitation systems and social housing programs from the point of view of cedae s projects and actions the reduction of water losses about 40 of total produced water and the implementation of water demand management do not seem to be serious issues problems such as the absence of water metering lack of user registration meter reading errors physical losses from the supply network and illegal connections to the system are not given due importance meanwhile a study performed for the state water resources plan inea fundação coppetec 2014 which was presented in 2014 showed that a reduction in real physical water losses of 30 in the guandu system alone by 2030 would allow savings of approximately 6 m3 s water which is enough to supply 1 7 million inhabitants another question is that the expansion of the guandu system will require an amount of time and money that is not readily available the president of cedae jorge briard has reported that the construction of guandu ii will be funded via a brl 3 4 billion loan from caixa econômica federal briard 2015 in the three years of in field research it transpired that guandu ii has raised expectations about the improvement of the water supply in baixada fluminense among the local population and institutions however it still reproduces the current unequal supply geography providing services for the entire region that is already serviced by the guandu system as a matter of fact the planned infrastructure will not provide water exclusively to baixada fluminense but to the municipality of rio de janeiro too in addition it is expected that the guandu ii project will provide further security for water treatment serving as an alternative in situations of risk and during essential maintenance concerning the baixada fluminense s water supply problems expanding just one drinking water production plant will not solve the problem of providing regular access to water for its 3 7 million inhabitants in the short term 6 2 solutions proposed for east rmrj the water deficit existing today in the eastern area of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region will tend to worsen with the expectations of economic growth and subsequent population growth to address this shortage the state water resource plan points out four different possible solutions i construction of the guapiaçu river dam ii the use of the waters from the jurturnaíba dam which now serves part of the região dos lagos region on the east coast of rio de janeiro iii the use of the waters from the ribeirão lages dam and iv the diversion of water from rio grande river to the alto guapiaçu dam inea fundação coppetec 2014 among these alternatives the state government of rio de janeiro has opted for the controversial construction of the guapiaçu dam in a bid to increase water availability by 5 5 m3 s doerj 2015 the project is currently paralyzed due to its environmental and social impacts which include the resettlement of families of farmers and agrarian reform settlers ibid conflicts around this proposal led to the creation of a water crisis parliamentary inquiry set up by the rio de janeiro state legislature the commissioners have made recommendations to the state government through the state environmental agency for the development and detailing of the four alternative proposals they have asked the state environmental agency to prepare the necessary studies to assess and compare the technical environmental social economic and financial feasibility of each one to provide full transparency and ensure that the alternative chosen is indeed the best solution ibid p 18 when analyzing the future water scenario of rmrj as a whole it is necessary to consider the climate especially because it is a coastal region the metropolitan area and the guandu river basin may be affected by prolonged periods of drought which would reduce the availability of water dependence on one supply source might worsen this scenario on the other hand considering the opposite hypothesis to droughts the possibility of more intense rainfall volschan 2008 points out that this would result in increased turbidity fecal contamination and affect other physicochemical parameters relevant to water potability standards this would mean greater care would be needed in the production process at the water treatment stations and would thus raise operating costs 7 discussion and conclusion the paper draws upon the theoretical framework of socio technical systems and while using it as an analytical lens understands water supply systems as complex socio technical systems that once established generally possess a high degree of path dependency that is by virtue of their physical embeddedness in urban sub structures and their reliance on powerful regulatory economic interests they tend to be resistant to change moss et al 2011 p 1 some scholars have used the concept of momentum to explain the conservative attitude of socio technical systems furlong 2014 hughes 1994 others interpret this change aversion as an aspect of human relations with objects and artifacts geels 2005 from this perspective a water supply system is an artifact and as a complex socio technical artifact its evolutionary path is mediated by underpinning political and institutional structures and the related socio spatial power relations centralized networks are a specific artifact for water supply which have gained momentum for a long time and are still strongly embedded in the socio spatial context in both the global north and the global south moss et al 2011 even if they are starting to be questioned barraqué 2013 britto et al 2014 one characteristic of centralized infrastructure is that it provides one single quality of water ocde 2009 metropolitan systems are prisoners of technically and economically oriented choices guy et al 2011 having been made at earlier stages these choices often limit the potential for adaptation to new challenges in general their common features are high degree of centralization and weak adaptability the same standard of water quality for all water uses and consumption based financial models i e depending on tariffs based on the volume of water consumed finally their old and often obsolete design reinforces their typical structural rigidity rio de janeiro metropolitan region s water supply system is a highly centralized technical network we selected it as a case study and analyzed its historical evolution as a paradigmatic example of a megalopolis based socio technical system in the south the diachronic perspective allowed us to emphasize the path dependence of the current system as well as its future problems and limitations the rmrj has gone through rapid deep rooted territorial changes in the past ten years especially due to economic growth and the development of the state s oil industry furthermore the municipality of rio de janeiro the core of the metropolis has been chosen as the host city for several international events such as the world cup and the olympics which in turn has led to territorial changes that have affected the entire metropolis such transformations have put the metropolitan area including the suburbs and peripheries in the national spotlight while boosting the interest of researchers and planners in brazil and abroad on the other hand access to essential urban utilities such as mass transportation water supply and sanitation services has seen little improvement in the metropolitan fringes especially those described in this study such as the baixada fluminense there are still serious problems related to the intermittent water supply and overall service quality the solutions proposed by the state government to meet growing demand are still based on this kind of centralized model the guandu system is a highly centralized technical network based on only one source to supply 80 of the metropolitan region serving about 9 4 million people the technical decision to expand the guandu system will reinforce the dependence of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region on this one source contradicting the basic tenets of sustainable water use the fair and equitable functioning of a socio technical water supply system does not just have to do with the availability of water and technical issues it is about ensuring that each citizen has equal and reliable access to sufficient quantities of safe water at an affordable price to lead a healthy dignified and productive life the in depth descriptive case study of the rmrj building upon multiple data sources resulted in the identification of a technical recursive factor that has marked the evolutionary path of the socio technical system and still strengthens the insecurity of water services in the rio de janeiro megacity showing its path dependence it therefore has the power to answer the research questions why are inequalities in the rio de janeiro wss system resistant to change are those inequalities linked to the characteristics of the technical system the hegemony of a supply side technical paradigm driven at an operational level by a large centralized infrastructure model overseen by cedae was decided on and planned in a top down manner during the 1970s when it gathered momentum now it is already embedded in the socio spatial context and is resistant to change this embeddedness leads to the inattentiveness to alternative water supply solutions such as decentralized systems the solutions conceived by the state government and the state water company are very conservative as they neglect new possibilities for water demand management measures to control water losses and the use of alternative solutions to complement the water supply increasing the guandu system producing the same standard quality of treated water for different water uses without a demand management perspective could aggravate the vulnerability of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region s supply as it is currently structured socially and politically even if water scarcity cannot be related to climate change prolonged periods of drought are predicted as a possible scenario for coming years if this scenario is played out the inhabitants of the peripheral areas of the rio de janeiro metropolitan region which currently do not have adequate access to a water supply will be disproportionately affected it is important to stress that demographic growth in metropolitan rio is more intense in these areas the rigidity of the centralized guandu system has made all the inhabitants dependent on its infrastructure which is difficult to overcome the current rmrj water supply system and the future scenarios proposed by the main government institutions reflect these path dependence factors as a unique socio technical system it seems inadequate to deal with the current threefold challenge concerning water to meet demand for water supply linked to a specific pattern of demographic growth to adapt to uncertainties arising from climate change and to maintain the ecological systems that provide water meanwhile because of the shortfalls in the water provision system many of the residents of baixada fluminense use wells or collective springs as a supplementary source of water britto et al 2014 these alternative technologies which often have strong roots in the local culture deserve attention they could be arranged in such a way as to complement the macro systems thereby providing access to water in the short term while the above description focuses on the socio technical dimension on an empirical level at the conceptual level it stresses the complexity and multidimensionality of the water supply system actually the resistance to change of rmrj s water supply systems cannot be explained only by observing technical aspects political cultural and institutional factors represent major barriers to incremental changes towards decentralization in the state of rio de janeiro and particularly in rmrj there lacks a municipal culture britto 2016 and the institutional capacity to lead the decentralization of water supply management even if low tech approaches and other socio technical solutions based on decentralized water supply system were technically possible there is no political commitment to promote their implementation nowadays there is a process of liberalization or dismantling of the public provision of basic services water included a bill 2345 2017 proposing the privatization of cedae was approved by the rio de janeiro state legislature at the beginning of 2017 the municipalities served by cedae have not questioned the law this political measure shows that political efforts are not geared towards investigating alternative and more inclusive paths of governance maintaining the classical bipolar options of market or state and the correspondingly centralized power structure the strengthening of municipal governments and the promotion of their cooperation may exert a counterforce against this trend nonetheless inter municipal cooperation is very poor in rmrj britto et al 2017 a recent study about inter municipal consortia in brazil britto et al 2017 emphasizes the importance of local actors commitment and mobilization for inter municipal cooperation stressing the role of a bottom up dynamics for building joint ventures in rmrj two main components hinder this process britto 2016 britto et al 2017 the lack of demographic and economic homogeneity among municipalities and above all the cultural heritage of patrimonialism in political and governmental practices future research still from a path dependence and socio technical perspective could pay attention to these aspects and alternative solutions political and cultural drivers deserve future research attention from a path dependence perspective one relevant question is what factors could break the embeddedness of the hegemonic socio technical structure and promote socio technical change making room for decentralized systems or at least some integration between the systems the present research has the typical limitations of case studies and exploratory research providing an in depth description of a specific historical and geographical context however thanks to the wealth of detail and the length of the in field research it aims to contribute to the academic debate on the universalization of water supply especially in megacities in the global south

6564,with an ever growing population of around 10 million inhabitants officially 7 9 in 2013 ho chi minh city hcmc is set to become one of the largest cities in south east asia and already occupies a major economic role in the area to accommodate the increasing population the megacity now stretches out in an urban continuum covering more than 800 square kilometers and is currently growing at a rate of 3 2 per year if the neighboring provinces around hcmc are included the total population reaches nearly 18 million people this paper attempts to describe the interplay between hcmc and flood related risks and offer some guidelines to deal with inundations the potential risks of flooding by rain tsunami and or dam failure upstream of the city are evaluated and contextualized within the perspective of climate and human induced environmental changes the region is highly vulnerable to the combined effects of subsidence and rising sea levels and has already led to serious flooding that may extend spatially before the end of the century we propose possible preventative solutions to urban flooding using a multi pronged approach to issues regarding urban development and suggest a redevelopment strategy for major infrastructure projects keywords adaptation to urban inundation tropical rain wave set up by tides tsunamis dam failure climate change subsidence urban planning strategy 1 introduction ho chi minh city is a low elevation coastal megacity with a very large and rapidly increasing population economic activity is also very high and rising in line with the population increase like most megacities in south east asia or india that were built within a delta s boundaries hcmc is affected by flood related risks aggravated by the conjunction of heavy rains and high tide levels this situation is driven by three factors low elevation of the land above sea level extensive urban growth yielding to soil subsidence and an extension of impervious areas resulting in increased runoff tran ngoc et al 2016 over the last 300 years hcmc has gone through several phases of expansion because the city is bordered by the saigon river and intersected by several creeks water has always been a fundamental part of its identity in the late 18th and early 19th centuries the nguyen dynasty expanded the canal network to improve waterway transportation and facilitate commercial activity under french rule in the first half of the 20th century the urban face of saigon underwent major changes in particular the canals intersecting the city center were filled to create tree lined boulevards ton and truong 2011 swampy areas were also filled to build residential areas and concomitantly the network of remaining canals was progressively used as an open air sewage system domestic as well as industrial waste water givental 2014 water is now the main focus of all worldwide climate related issues and hcmc finds itself on the top ten list of cities categorized as being in the greatest danger of coastal flooding small and nichols 2003 isponre 2009 this paper proposes a multiple perspective approach to characterize the principal risks of flooding caused directly by heavy tropical rain and runoff and or high tide wave set up and ways to mitigate them first field measurements were taken throughout the urban area to quantify flooding by rain and to assess the flood risks in those neighborhoods this quantification is complemented by numerical simulations to characterize the risks of submersion caused by either tsunami waves or the rupture of a dam as well as data related to the expected increase in future sea levels once the main results of these flood related risks are cross referenced and assessed we discuss possible urban planning for ho chi minh city s future development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site hcmc is located in a low elevation coastal zone in the upper border of the mekong delta and 65 of its territory is at an altitude below 1 5 m above sea level fig 1 it is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with two distinguished seasons the rainy season extends from may to november with a heavy period from september to october in total about 160 rain events occur yearly with an average cumulated rainfall of roughly 2000 mm because of the convective pattern of precipitation events the rain is non uniformly distributed at the scale of the megacity with considerable differences from one district to another for a given storm event this variability at short spatial scale is currently not accounted for in weather forecast reports in conjunction with heavy precipitation hcmc is also affected by the combined effects of semi diurnal tides waves with amplitude reaching a maximum of 1 5 m and high water discharge from both upstream rivers namely the saigon and dong nai rivers hcmc has been experiencing severe accelerated urbanization since the start of the last decade with up to 100 of land surface constructed upon in some sectors nguyen 2013 heavy rain intensity and lack of sewage infrastructure makes the megacity highly vulnerable to flood risk as shown in the present study the spatio temporal dynamics of flooding in hcmc differs significantly when driven by rainfall or river overflow 2 2 monitoring rain and flood zones since 2002 a monitoring network has been developed to survey urban flooding at the street scale and includes 11 automatic rain gauges distributed all over the city as well as monitoring cameras installed in 2013 this network is completed by visual observations to characterize the submerged areas i e to measure water depth duration and spatial extension of any inundations since 2009 inundation areas have been systematically classified into two typologies submerged areas are referred to as old for those that are regularly submerged from year to year or new for those appearing in different locations from year to year 2 3 numerical modeling to assess another risk of flooding by tsunami or dam failure numerical simulations were undertaken with telemac2d code lang et al 2010 this software is based on the barré de saint venant equations and assumes 2d shallow water conditions initially developed by electricité de france edf it was chosen for its ability to solve large scale problems with reasonable computation time the first case study aimed to evaluate the effects of a tsunami that could occur due to an ocean quake with different levels in the east sea a potential earthquake area because of its geological structure hypothetical numerical runs were conducted by placing the epicenter about 240 km from vietnam s south coast the purpose was to determine the spatio temporal characteristics of tsunami waves and help authorities set up early warning procedures as presented in fig 2 a the numerical domain extended up to hcmc the discretization scheme consisted of 1 045 000 triangular elements varying in size from 500 to 4000 m for the seaward extension of the domain to a size of 10 m to describe the streets in the urban context different cases of earthquake magnitude corresponding to 7 6 7 8 8 0 and 8 35 on the richter scale were simulated it took one hour of computation to simulate ten hours using an intel server cluster on parallel mode with 16 cores the second case study was undertaken with the same numerical model and grid of discretization but focused on the domain located upstream of hcmc it aimed to assess the city s submersion risk in the event of the dau tieng dam failure which is located eighty kilometers upstream of hcmc this earth dam was constructed between 1981 and 1985 for agricultural irrigation in the provinces surrounding hcmc and has a total capacity of 1 58 billion m3 of water and maximum water level of 28 m the study area fig 2b extended from the dau tieng lake to the estuary and represented a surface of 5000 km2 it was discretized with 270 000 triangular elements the simulation was done for a failure width of 500 m corresponding to a maximum instantaneous flow discharge of 40 000 m3 s in a section located ten kilometers downstream of the dam 3 results and discussion 3 1 coupled effects of rainfall and urbanization fig 3 a represents the number of storm events observed in hcmc from 2007 to 2014 and demonstrates that heavy rain events exceeding 100 mm are not rare and can be observed every year however important inter annual variability can also be observed another important result is that some locations are systematically submerged yet each year new flood sites can be observed fig 3b the total number of submerged locations was the highest in 2008 126 locations as a result of a very sharp increase in building density since the beginning of the 1990s during this period the impervious surface increased 8 fold in the flood prone area and the population increased by 2 fold nguyen 2013 this figure also shows that the number of submerged sites changed considerably over the 2008 2015 period first it decreased steeply from 2008 to 2011 to reach a minimum of 30 inundated sites this can be related to the reduction from 4 to 1 of rainfall events larger than 100 mm fig 3a and also to large scale restructuration of the drainage infrastructure in the downtown area tran ngoc 2015 the resurgence of flooding observed in 2013 2014 is likely due to the development of peri urban zones with poor sewer installation and poor maintenance and to the increase of rainfall events it also seems that the time needed to reduce flooding by drainage infrastructure in the areas transitioning from small houses and gardens in 2008 to full urbanization in 2014 was much longer than anticipated as illustrated in fig 3c another consequence of intensive urbanization is that soil subsidence has reached a rate of 0 02 0 04 m yr in some sectors and is illustrated in fig 4 a similar observations were obtained by ho tong et al 2015 this subsidence is greatest in the city center along the saigon river districts 7 12 binh thanh thu duc and in the southwest peri urban sectors districts 6 8 and binh chanh in these sectors old traditional houses have been demolished to make way for high rise buildings some of them more than 50 floors and commercial centers subsidence here is the result of intensive groundwater pumping to secure building basements and is also linked to the construction of a new underground metro system due for completion in 2019 dinh et al 2015 also demonstrated the impact of geology because the most severe rates of subsidence were observed in the holocene silt loam areas along the saigon river and in the southwest of the city it is obvious that this process leads to an accumulation of runoff and limits the evacuation by gravity of the flooded zones overall it is clear the city has several flood prone areas with submersion levels varying from 0 15 to 0 65 m fig 4b produced by the earth observation service of esa resulting from rainfall variability and or high tide wave set up and that both are impacted by subsidence comparison between fig 4a and b clearly demonstrates this conjunction between subsidence and flooding 3 2 incidental flooding driven by wave propagation two numerical simulations were performed to determine the flood risk for several districts along the saigon river that could result in wave propagation originating from either a tsunami in the east sea or a reservoir dam failure upstream of hcmc respectively for a quake reaching an intensity of 8 0 on the richter scale the average celerity of a tsunami s waves from the earthquake s epicenter to the estuary is about 20 5 m s the change in sea level height after 1 5 h is presented in fig 5 a the tsunami s peak arrives at the estuary after approximately 3 25 h and here the highest water level attains seven meters the wave reaches downtown hcmc after an additional 4 5 h fig 5b and induces a wave between 1 5 and 3 m above the initial street level according to the different simulations considered it is worth noting that during propagation along the mangrove fringe tsunami waves could be greatly dissipated by this type of ecosystem barbier et al 2008 it was not possible to include this mitigating effect in our simulation but it should be taken into consideration in the future the second case study of failure at the dau tieng dam is presented in fig 6 the flood wave has an amplitude that decreases rapidly from a peak of nearly 18 m at 20 km downstream of the dam to less than one meter in the city center as shown in fig 6 the fluctuations due to tidal forcing dashed black line are comparable to those related to the impact of dam failure solid black line from this it seems clear that hcmc is moderately vulnerable in the event of dam failure at dau tieng the existence of a floodplain located upstream of hcmc where discharged water can spread may explain these simulated results while the spread would protect hcmc s infrastructure and inhabitants it would undoubtedly cause major damage in the upstream agricultural zones the conclusion that can be drawn from these simulations is that the risk of flooding from a tsunami would most likely be much larger than from dam failure 3 3 long term vulnerability a realistic flood risk assessment and its long term evolution should also take into account the effects of human induced climate change a series of scientific works coordinated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and summarized in its 5th ipcc report part 2 impact adaptation and vulnerability march 2014 underlines that without a drastic reduction 50 in greenhouse gas emissions the area of south vietnam could be seriously affected by the conjunction of two effects from a hydrometeorological perspective an increase in the occurrence of typhoons and extreme rainfall by 10 20 is anticipated with a strong impact on river flow and riverbank erosion from an ocean perspective an increase of the sea surface temperature to 30 c or more in the south pacific zone combined with the melting of antarctica ice sheet could produce a sea level rise of 1 m by the end of this century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated as recently analyzed by de conto and pollard 2016 on the basis of innovative numerical simulations coupling ice sheet and climate dynamics the situation will certainly be exacerbated by the impact of human activities on soil subsidence at both the urban and regional scale in addition to the megacity situation discussed in section 3 1 and presented in fig 4 agricultural practices in the mekong delta are responsible for a very worrying situation as pointed out by erban et al 2014 through a set of observations obtained by satellite radar imagery over the delta from 2006 to 2010 the authors clearly highlighted a rate of soil subsidence varying between 0 02 and 0 04 m year and an average decrease by 0 30 m per year of groundwater levels a similar interplay between groundwater levels and soil subsidence was also reported by dinh et al 2014 for the hcmc region consequently the subsidence of soil at the regional scale could be higher than the rise in sea level by the end of this century the cumulative effects could result in the lowering of the average soil level with respect to the sea level by 0 03 0 05 m year in other words a 1 5 2 5 m rise in a 50 year period the submersion of the quasi totality of the coastal fringe is to be feared the loss of agricultural land notably rice due to salinization and the consequent migration of millions of inhabitants would have an enormous impact a significant part of this migratory flux would probably be in the direction of hcmc where large areas could also be submerged 3 4 urban planning strategy in light of these results it seems evident that to achieve sustainable development there needs to be revision of ho chi minh city s urban development policies with a much greater emphasis on and integration of flood management strategies adb 2010 vcaps 2013 for the time being the city s rate of urbanization is advancing at an alarming rate with former wetlands being filled and transformed into new development areas such as phu my hung and thu thiem the megacity s continual expansion raises questions about the capacity of the soil to absorb runoff and its impact on floods kim and ho 2014 since 2008 authorities in hcmc have been developing a master plan of coordinated urban expansion to be in place by 2025 this plan proposes the adoption of a multi center city model with four major development areas and several additional urban projects as can often be observed there is a gap between planning and reality adetef 2012 experts and local policy makers are in agreement that alternative measures need to be integrated lempert et al 2013 in particular investment in infrastructure needs to comply with land use policies construction law and urban planning in order to implement the concept of a sustainable city at different scales furthermore the development of urban areas alongside existing waterways and in low lying swampy areas is met with institutional technical and financial challenges at the institutional level the challenge is to implement a coherent urban planning policy by breaking it down into national regional and urban levels it is crucial to promote a transversal approach land use urban planning and water management to adopt a multi scale vision and to avoid single sector and single project approaches eckert and waibel 2009 at the technical level development of relevant urban planning tools is required at the planning stage environmental impact studies should be enforced to ensure sustainable water balance when a wetland site is filled setting up monitoring networks and access to acquired data is a prerequisite to develop robust scenarios coupling measurement statistics and numerical simulations a further challenge concerns the need for innovative construction techniques adapted to the geology of particular sites this would include the construction of underground works such as metro lines and basement parking areas these challenges have been debated during workshops with policymakers in order to consider the water related problems of urbanization in an integrated way for example the rivers and channels in hcmc were long considered as being for transport only but they are now also considered as recreational areas and important for the city s identity as they improve the quality of life for residents recent urban development projects in the hcmc metropolitan area have already brought major improvements by greening riverbanks and improving water quality in the creeks and saigon river one of the main challenges for ho chi minh city s future is to allocate more space to green and blue belts in planned layouts urban multi functional basins fig 7 a could respond to hydrological and environmental issues by preserving areas for storm water retention and storage of tidal flow volumes rising tide they could also integrate urban and landscape planning at different scales paddi world bank 2014 an integrated territorial approach needs to account for the specific context of the estuary and the city it should connect sites with surrounding neighborhoods by prioritizing the entity of the park and enhancing the river embankment s value this would help the city to adopt a more sustainable urbanization policy particularly in the implementation of city water infrastructure projects and to mitigate and reduce flooding hazards in addition upgrading and use of the water network will also create favorable conditions for the development of waterway transportation and river tourism in 2012 the centre de prospective et d etudes urbaines de ho chi minh ville paddi proposed several courses of urban action relating to large civil engineering projects for dike network construction in order to reduce the risk of flooding for example reducing flow velocity by facilitating the spread of the rising tide flow upstream developing storm water storage facilities away from tidal influence in order to reduce the discharge flow in sewage networks after a storm or a dam failure and the risks of overflow on roads at high tide facilitating rain water infiltration by preserving natural environments or installing storm water infiltration ponds a good example is the upcoming creation of a new urban area by the name of thu thiem which is presently a swamp in one of the meanders of the saigon river fig 7b the plan includes a residential area and large urban park that takes into account possible inundation and includes an artificial lake for water retention because of its strategic location just in front of the city center thu thiem should have the capacity to mitigate tidal floods and high water events through man made canals lakes and mangrove areas and at the same time to accommodate over 130 000 residents 4 conclusion the mitigation of water related risks is a priority for many megacities especially those located in low elevation tropical coastal areas considering the vulnerability of hcmc and its economic importance at the regional scale a multidisciplinary approach has been adopted to evaluate the interplay between urban development planning and flood related risks within the framework of natural hazards and of climate and human induced changes in recent years many studies have been conducted to assess the vulnerability of this megacity to rainfall induced flooding based on spatial monitoring of rainfall and of the flooded areas the results showed that the risk is especially intense during building construction phases maintenance of the drainage network appears to be a simple and essential measure to ensure optimal functioning of properly sized sewers we further analyzed the risk of flooding by tsunami or dam failure the numerical simulations undertaken show that hcmc is more vulnerable to inundation by tsunami than by dam failure this asymmetric response of the watershed to wave propagation mainly results from topographic effects in the event of a dam failure wave energy would be rapidly dissipated by spreading out over the flood plain upstream of hcmc the habitations and infrastructure of this rural region would undoubtedly be severely affected in the case of a tsunami wave energy would be amplified during its propagation into the river network it is worth noting that the dissipation of wave energy during its landward propagation into the mangrove fringe has not been taken into account in the present simulation and could mitigate the effects presented in the simulations recent satellite based observations of the megacity and of the mekong delta have demonstrated that without a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions the combination of both the effects of soil subsidence and the expected impact of climate change on rising sea levels could lead to submersion of a large part of the lower mekong basin including low elevation areas of hcmc within a period of 30 50 years the current master plan for hcmc will be revised in the next few years as part of this process the department of urban planning and architecture dupa is currently working on methodology to integrate climate change issues into the new urban plan especially to assign specific land use as a key adaptive instrument an example of this new plan of action is that hcmc is also developing some sectorial measures to build retention basins in several districts and to limit urban extension in the wetlands it is clear that integrating sea defense services provided by mangrove areas should be a prerequisite to any planned seaward urbanization the development plans can only be efficient if there is coordination between national and local authorities as well as technical departments the climate change office established in 2012 will undoubtedly play a major role in the implementation of measures to increase the resilience of the city acknowledgments this paper was prepared within care centre asiatique de recherches sur l eau a joint research laboratory between hcm

altitude below 1 5 m above sea level fig 1 it is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with two distinguished seasons the rainy season extends from may to november with a heavy period from september to october in total about 160 rain events occur yearly with an average cumulated rainfall of roughly 2000 mm because of the convective pattern of precipitation events the rain is non

evaluate the effects of a tsunami that could occur due to an ocean quake with different levels in the east sea a potential earthquake area because of its geological structure hypothetical numerical runs were conducted by placing the epicenter about 240 km from vietnam s south coast the purpose was to determine the spatio temporal characteristics of tsunami waves and help authorities set up early warning procedures as presented in fig 2 a the numerical domain extended up to hcmc the discretization scheme consisted of 1 045 000 triangular elements varying in size from 500 to 4000 m for the seaward extension of the domain to a size of 10 m to describe the streets in the urban context different cases of earthquake magnitude corresponding to 7 6 7 8 8 0 and 8 35 on the richter scale were simulated it took one hour of computation to simulate ten hours using an intel server cluster on parallel mode with 16 cores the second case study was undertaken with the same numerical model and grid of discretization but focused on the domain located upstream of hcmc it aimed to assess the city s submersion risk in the event of the dau tieng dam failure which is located eighty kilometers upstream of hcmc this earth dam was constructed between 1981 and 1985 for agricultural irrigation in the provinces surrounding hcmc and has a total capacity of 1 58 billion m3 of water and maximum water level of 28 m the study area fig 2b extended from the dau tieng lake to the estuary and represented a surface of 5000 km2 it was discretized with 270 000 triangular elements the simulation was done for a failure width of 500 m corresponding to a maximum instantaneous flow discharge of 40 000 m3 s in a section located ten kilometers downstream of the dam 3 results and discussion 3 1 coupled effects of rainfall and urbanization fig 3 a represents the number of storm events observed in hcmc from 2007 to 2014 and demonstrates that heavy rain events exceeding 100 mm are not rare and can be observed every year however important inter annual variability can also be observed another important result is that some locations are systematically submerged yet each year new flood sites can be observed fig 3b the total number of submerged locations was the highest in 2008 126 locations as a result of a very sharp increase in building density since the beginning of the 1990s during this period the impervious surface increased 8 fold in the flood prone area and the population increased by 2 fold nguyen 2013 this figure also shows that the number of submerged sites changed considerably over the 2008 2015 period first it decreased steeply from 2008 to 2011 to reach a minimum of 30 inundated sites this can be related to the reduction from 4 to 1 of rainfall events larger than 100 mm fig 3a and also to large scale restructuration of the drainage infrastructure in the downtown area tran ngoc 2015 the resurgence of flooding observed in 2013 2014 is likely due to the development of peri urban zones with poor sewer installation and poor maintenance and to the increase of rainfall events it also seems that the time needed to reduce flooding by drainage infrastructure in the areas transitioning from small houses and gardens in 2008 to full urbanization in 2014 was much longer than anticipated as illustrated in fig 3c another consequence of intensive urbanization is that soil subsidence has reached a rate of 0 02 0 04 m yr in some sectors and is illustrated in fig 4 a similar observations were obtained by ho tong et al 2015 this subsidence is greatest in the city center along the saigon river districts 7 12 binh thanh thu duc and in the southwest peri urban sectors districts 6 8 and binh chanh in these sectors old traditional houses have been demolished to make way for high rise buildings some of them more than 50 floors and commercial centers subsidence here is the result of intensive groundwater pumping to secure building basements and is also linked to the construction of a new underground metro system due for completion in 2019 dinh et al 2015 also demonstrated the impact of geology because the most severe rates of subsidence were observed in the holocene silt loam areas along the saigon river and in the southwest of the city it is obvious that this process leads to an accumulation of runoff and limits the evacuation by gravity of the flooded zones overall it is clear the city has several flood prone areas with submersion levels varying from 0 15 to 0 65 m fig 4b produced by the earth observation service of esa resulting from rainfall variability and or high tide wave set up and that both are impacted by subsidence comparison between fig 4a and b clearly demonstrates this conjunction between subsidence and flooding 3 2 incidental flooding driven by wave propagation two numerical simulations were performed to determine the flood risk for several districts along the saigon river that could result in wave propagation originating from either a tsunami in the east sea or a reservoir dam failure upstream of hcmc respectively for a quake reaching an intensity of 8 0 on the richter scale the average celerity of a tsunami s waves from the earthquake s epicenter to the estuary is about 20 5 m s the change in sea level height after 1 5 h is presented in fig 5 a the tsunami s peak arrives at the estuary after approximately 3 25 h and here the highest water level attains seven meters the wave reaches downtown hcmc after an additional 4 5 h fig 5b and induces a wave between 1 5 and 3 m above the initial street level according to the different simulations considered it is worth noting that during propagation along the mangrove fringe tsunami waves could be greatly dissipated by this type of ecosystem barbier et al 2008 it was not possible to include this mitigating effect in our simulation but it should be taken into consideration in the future the second case study of failure at the dau tieng dam is presented in fig 6 the flood wave has an amplitude that decreases rapidly from a peak of nearly 18 m at 20 km downstream of the dam to less than one meter in the city center as shown in fig 6 the fluctuations due to tidal forcing dashed black line are comparable to those related to the impact of dam failure solid black line from this it seems clear that hcmc is moderately vulnerable in the event of dam failure at dau tieng the existence of a floodplain located upstream of hcmc where discharged water can spread may explain these simulated results while the spread would protect hcmc s infrastructure and inhabitants it would undoubtedly cause major damage in the upstream agricultural zones the conclusion that can be drawn from these simulations is that the risk of flooding from a tsunami would most likely be much larger than from dam failure 3 3 long term vulnerability a realistic flood risk assessment and its long term evolution should also take into account the effects of human induced climate change a series of scientific works coordinated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and summarized in its 5th ipcc report part 2 impact adaptation and vulnerability march 2014 underlines that without a drastic reduction 50 in greenhouse gas emissions the area of south vietnam could be seriously affected by the conjunction of two effects from a hydrometeorological perspective an increase in the occurrence of typhoons and extreme rainfall by 10 20 is anticipated with a strong impact on river flow and riverbank erosion from an ocean perspective an increase of the sea surface temperature to 30 c or more in the south pacific zone combined with the melting of antarctica ice sheet could produce a sea level rise of 1 m by the end of this century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated as recently analyzed by de conto and pollard 2016 on the basis of innovative numerical simulations coupling ice sheet and climate dynamics the situation will certainly be exacerbated by the impact of human activities on soil subsidence at both the urban and regional scale in addition to the megacity situation discussed in section 3 1 and presented in fig 4 agricultural practices in the mekong delta are responsible for a very worrying situation as pointed out by erban et al 2014 through a set of observations obtained by satellite radar imagery over the delta from 2006 to 2010 the authors clearly highlighted a rate of soil subsidence varying between 0 02 and 0 04 m year and an average decrease by 0 30 m per year of groundwater levels a similar interplay between groundwater levels and soil subsidence was also reported by dinh et al 2014 for the hcmc region consequently the subsidence of soil at the regional scale could be higher than the rise in sea level by the end of this century the cumulative effects could result in the lowering of the average soil level with respect to the sea level by 0 03 0 05 m year in other words a 1 5 2 5 m rise in a 50 year period the submersion of the quasi totality of the coastal fringe is to be feared the loss of agricultural land notably rice due to salinization and the consequent migration of millions of inhabitants would have an enormous impact a significant part of this migratory flux would probably be in the direction of hcmc where large areas could also be submerged 3 4 urban planning strategy in light of these results it seems evident that to achieve sustainable development there needs to be revision of ho chi minh city s urban development policies with a much greater emphasis on and integration of flood management strategies adb 2010 vcaps 2013 for the time being the city s rate of urbanization is advancing at an alarming rate with former wetlands being filled and transformed into new development areas such as phu my hung and thu thiem the megacity s continual expansion raises questions about the capacity of the soil to absorb runoff and its impact on floods kim and ho 2014 since 2008 authorities in hcmc have been developing a master plan of coordinated urban expansion to be in place by 2025 this plan proposes the adoption of a multi center city model with four major development areas and several additional urban projects as can often be observed there is a gap between planning and reality adetef 2012 experts and local policy makers are in agreement that alternative measures need to be integrated lempert et al 2013 in particular investment in infrastructure needs to comply with land use policies construction law and urban planning in order to implement the concept of a sustainable city at different scales furthermore the development of urban areas alongside existing waterways and in low lying swampy areas is met with institutional technical and financial challenges at the institutional level the challenge is to implement a coherent urban planning policy by breaking it down into national regional and urban levels it is crucial to promote a transversal approach land use urban planning and water management to adopt a multi scale vision and to avoid single sector and single project approaches eckert and waibel 2009 at the technical level development of relevant urban planning tools is required at the planning stage environmental impact studies should be enforced to ensure sustainable water balance when a wetland site is filled setting up monitoring networks and access to acquired data is a prerequisite to develop robust scenarios coupling measurement statistics and numerical simulations a further challenge concerns the need for innovative construction techniques adapted to the geology of particular sites this would include the construction of underground works such as metro lines and basement parking areas these challenges have been debated during workshops with policymakers in order to consider the water related problems of urbanization in an integrated way for example the rivers and channels in hcmc were long considered as being for transport only but they are now also considered as recreational areas and important for the city s identity as they improve the quality of life for residents recent urban development projects in the hcmc metropolitan area have already brought major improvements by greening riverbanks and improving water quality in the creeks and saigon river one of the main challenges for ho chi minh city s future is to allocate more space to green and blue belts in planned layouts urban multi functional basins fig 7 a could respond to hydrological and environmental issues by preserving areas for storm water retention and storage of tidal flow volumes rising tide they could also integrate urban and landscape planning at different scales paddi world bank 2014 an integrated territorial approach needs to account for the specific context of the estuary and the city it should connect sites with surrounding neighborhoods by prioritizing the entity of the park and enhancing the river embankment s value this would help the city to adopt a more sustainable urbanization policy particularly in the implementation of city water infrastructure projects and to mitigate and reduce flooding hazards in addition upgrading and use of the water network will also create favorable conditions for the development of waterway transportation and river tourism in 2012 the centre de prospective et d etudes urbaines de ho chi minh ville paddi proposed several courses of urban action relating to large civil engineering projects for dike network construction in order to reduce the risk of flooding for example reducing flow velocity by facilitating the spread of the rising tide flow upstream developing storm water storage facilities away from tidal influence in order to reduce the discharge flow in sewage networks after a storm or a dam failure and the risks of overflow on roads at high tide facilitating rain water infiltration by preserving natural environments or installing storm water infiltration ponds a good example is the upcoming creation of a new urban area by the name of thu thiem which is presently a swamp in one of the meanders of the saigon river fig 7b the plan includes a residential area and large urban park that takes into account possible inundation and includes an artificial lake for water retention because of its strategic location just in front of the city center thu thiem should have the capacity to mitigate tidal floods and high water events through man made canals lakes and mangrove areas and at the same time to accommodate over 130 000 residents 4 conclusion the mitigation of water related risks is a priority for many megacities especially those located in low elevation tropical coastal areas considering the vulnerability of hcmc and its economic importance at the regional scale a multidisciplinary approach has been adopted to evaluate the interplay between urban development planning and flood related risks within the framework of natural hazards and of climate and human induced changes in recent years many studies have been conducted to assess the vulnerability of this megacity to rainfall induced flooding based on spatial monitoring of rainfall and of the flooded areas the results showed that the risk is especially intense during building construction phases maintenance of the drainage network appears to be a simple and essential measure to ensure optimal functioning of properly sized sewers we further analyzed the risk of flooding by tsunami or dam failure the numerical simulations undertaken show that hcmc is more vulnerable to inundation by tsunami than by dam failure this asymmetric response of the watershed to wave propagation mainly results from topographic effects in the event of a dam failure wave energy would be rapidly dissipated by spreading out over the flood plain upstream of hcmc the habitations and infrastructure of this rural region would undoubtedly be severely affected in the case of a tsunami wave energy would be amplified during its propagation into the river network it is worth noting that the dissipation of wave energy during its landward propagation into the mangrove fringe has not been taken into account in the present simulation and could mitigate the effects presented in the simulations recent satellite based observations of the megacity and of the mekong delta have demonstrated that without a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions the combination of both the effects of soil subsidence and the expected impact of climate change on rising sea levels could lead to submersion of a large part of the lower mekong basin including low elevation areas of hcmc within a period of 30 50 years the current master plan for hcmc will be revised in the next few years as part of this process the department of urban planning and architecture dupa is currently working on methodology to integrate climate change issues into the new urban plan especially to assign specific land use as a key adaptive instrument an example of this new plan of action is that hcmc is also developing some sectorial measures to build retention basins in several districts and to limit urban extension in the wetlands it is clear that integrating sea defense services provided by mangrove areas should be a prerequisite to any planned seaward urbanization the development plans can only be efficient if there is coordination between national and local authorities as well as technical departments the climate change office established in 2012 will undoubtedly play a major role in the implementation of measures to increase the resilience of the city acknowledgments this paper was prepared within care centre asiatique de recherches sur l eau a joint research laboratory between hcm
