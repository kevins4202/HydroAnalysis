1630,recent laboratory studies have shown the injection of colloidal mg oh 2 could provide an effective and low cost alternative as a long term ph buffering system in this study mg oh 2 was modified by tween 80 and sds and the modified suspension had the properties of high stability small particle size the average particle diameter d 50 was smaller than 1 μm and negative charge zeta potential 14 26 mv at ph 10 54 all of these properties demonstrated that colloidal mg oh 2 may have satisfactory transport performance in porous media however colloidal mg oh 2 is heterogeneous colloids with a high concentration the transport performance in porous media is significantly different from homogeneous colloids and the model simulation is relatively complex to solve these problems method of calculus combined with colloid filtration theory cft t e equation and modified maxwell theory was used to simulate the transport performance of high concentration of mg oh 2 colloids results indicated that the observed experimental results matched well with the model simulations hydrodynamic force dlvo attractive force and colloid diffusion are the major factors controlling the migration of colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media and could quantitatively describe the influence of injection velocity porous media size and ionic strength on colloidal mg oh 2 transport properties by model calculation keywords colloidal mg oh 2 groundwater heterogeneous transport model 1 introduction heavy metal contamination of groundwater has drawn global attention as it has posed severe environmental and health problems albuquerque and labrincha 2008 dzombak 1997 li et al 2017 heavy metal ions e g cd2 pb2 zn2 cu2 are strongly absorbed to iron hydroxides and aluminosilicates after discharged into the subsurface under neutral to alkaline conditions however most of the heavy metal contaminated sites are acidic which facilitates the mobility of the heavy metal and prevents remediation al hakawati and banks 2000 antisari et al 2014 moghaddam and mulligan 2008 therefore in order to achieve remediation of heavy metals in contaminated groundwater we must be able to raise aquifer ph and maintain it at the background level until the external acid loading of aquifer dissipates conventionally soluble hydroxides naoh and koh were used for subsurface ph buffer however excessive injection of soluble hydroxides into a poorly buffered aquifer leads to an unacceptable high ph resulting in secondary pollution and failure of immobilization due to the dissolution of heavy metal hydroxides unlike soluble hydroxides mg oh 2 could precipitate most of the heavy metals as alkaline guo et al 2013 kameda et al 2009 and possess several advantages in groundwater remediation firstly it is a relatively insoluble and environmentally friendly material indicating that it could release oh slowly to adjust ph of an aquifer with less negative effect on the environment pokrovsky and schott 2004 secondly mg oh 2 produces less waste compared with soluble hydroxides during remediation and could be utilized for a long period without strong ph variability hiortdahl and borden 2014 thirdly mg oh 2 is nonmagnetic with a moderate density 2 36 g cm3 for which flocculation and sedimentation are not as significant as some remedial materials e g nano scale zero valent iron all of these imply that mg oh 2 is an excellent ph buffering reagent that forms colloid or suspension easily for its injection and migration in aquifers in order to develop the application of mg oh 2 in groundwater remediation a thorough understanding of the migration behavior of mg oh 2 in groundwater is necessary in our previous studies steady colloidal mg oh 2 suspension with a small particle size d 50 0 5 μm negatively charged and satisfactory transport performance was developed to remediate groundwater contaminated by heavy metals dong et al 2017 the transport properties of colloidal mg oh 2 belong to colloid migration as its particle size is smaller than 1 μm mccarthy and wobber 1993 therefore models that simulate and predict the migration of colloids in saturated porous media could be used to simulate the migration of mg oh 2 in aquifers in previous studies carboxyl modified polystyrene latex microspheres with uniform particle size and low concentration 10 200 mg l were used to investigate the transport performance of colloids in porous media and the creation of models chongyang shen et al 2007 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 wu et al 2012 yao et al 1971 mechanism of deposition is independent with the concentration of colloids and deposition mass is a linear relationship with colloid concentration in other words c c0 is independent with the variation of initial concentration of colloids in column experiments however colloids with non uniform particle size and high concentration 0 6 120 g l were used for practice in situ remediation borden 2007 dong et al 2017 hiortdahl and borden 2014 strutz et al 2016 in the work of borden deposition of emulsified oil on porous media followed langmuir model as a very high concentration 120 g l of emulsified oil was inject into the aquifer borden 2007 the substantial deposition of reagents might change the properties of porous media e g surface charge and porosity in this condition concentration will have some effect on colloid migration in porous media in order to achieve a satisfied remediation effect a high concentration of mg oh 2 10 g l was used in this work whether the existing transport models could be used to simulate the migration performance of high concentration colloidal mg oh 2 needs to be clarified besides colloidal mg oh 2 has a non uniform particle size and belongs to heterogeneous colloids several recent studies have also shown that colloid sizes can significantly affect colloids deposition in porous media thus the transport performance of mg oh 2 has significant differences with homogeneous colloids in addition porous media in aquifers was non uniform for some contaminant sites chokejaroenrat et al 2014 zhong et al 2008 heterogeneous properties of porous media will also complicate the migration of colloid in aquifers previous researches mainly focused on the migration of colloids with uniform particle size and low concentration therefore the objectives of this work are to investigate the transport properties of high concentration of heterogeneous colloidal mg oh 2 to find or create a method to simulate the migration of high concentration of heterogeneous colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media to quantitatively analyze the influence of the flow velocity porous media size and ion strength on the transport properties of colloidal mg oh 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and analysis methods heterogeneous colloidal mg oh 2 used in this work was prepared through modifying mg oh 2 by tween 80 and sds according to our previous studies the addition of sds could significantly enhance the stability of colloidal mg oh 2 while a large amount of dosage was necessary over its critical micelle concentration cmc tween 80 could obviously decrease the cmc of sds resulting in sds easy aggregation around mg oh 2 particle surface and formulation of relatively stable double layer structure li et al 2018 composite surfactant of sds and tween 80 had a satisfying modification effect on mg oh 2 suspension with a small dosage the mass fraction of tween 80 sds mg oh 2 is 1 1 100 zeta potential and particle size of the prepared colloidal mg oh 2 were measured by a zeta potential and particle size analyzer nanoplus the viscosity of colloidal mg oh 2 were measured using a low shear 0 1 s 1 falling ball viscometer brookfield dv2tlv pre calibrated with water detail properties of heterogeneous colloidal mg oh 2 were shown in table 1 and fig 1 colloidal mg oh 2 has the properties of high stability was maintained stable for 24 h as shown in fig 2 small particle size the average particle diameter d 50 was smaller than 1 μm and negative charge zeta potential 14 26 mv at ph 10 54 all of these properties demonstrated that colloidal mg oh 2 may have satisfactory transport performance in porous media 2 2 column experiments a series of experiments under different flow velocities porous media sizes ionic strengths and initial colloid concentrations were performed to investigate the transport properties of high concentration of heterogeneous colloidal mg oh 2 river sand was packed into a plexiglass column and saturated with water to simulate aquifer fig 3 provides the schematic of experimental apparatuses one pore volume of prepared colloidal mg oh 2 was injected into the column upward after the injection of colloidal mg oh 2 several pore volumes of distilled water was injected into the column and effluent were sampled at scheduled time intervals and concentration of colloidal mg oh 2 and effluent ph were analyzed immediately in our preliminary experiments samples were centrifuged for 5 min at the rate of 13 000 r min and filtered through a 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes resin filter membrane to remove mg oh 2 colloid particles and mg in the percolate was measured and represents the dissolved mg2 the concentration of dissolved mg2 was 2 5 mg l while the mg2 after acidification in effluent suspension was over 1000 mg l this result indicated that the amount of dissolved mg2 was negligible compared with colloidal mg oh 2 considering the fact that over 99 of the mg exists in the form of colloids concentration of colloidal mg oh 2 was analyzed by measuring the total concentration of mg samples were acidified to ph 2 with hno3 concentration of mg2 was measured to characterize the concentration of mg oh 2 at the end of the experiments soil samples were taken at different positions analysis for mg oh 2 was by measuring alkalinity acidifying dried soil samples to ph 2 with hno3 and then back titrating to ph 8 with 0 05 mol l naoh in this study flow velocity porous media size ionic strength and initial colloid concentration were considered and details were shown in table 2 3 results and discussions 3 1 transport characteristics of high concentration of heterogeneous colloidal mg oh 2 figs 4 5 and 6 showed the breakthrough curve of colloidal mg oh 2 residual concentration of colloidal mg oh 2 and effluent ph under different flow velocities a porous media sizes b ionic strengths c and initial colloidal mg oh 2 concentrations d results demonstrated that higher velocity larger porous media diameter and lower ionic strength would improve the migration of colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media with a higher effluent concentration and lesser residual concentration in porous media the increase of flow velocity and porous media size would decrease the collision efficiency when colloids migrated in porous media a decrease in ionic strength can increase the thickness of the diffuse double layer between colloids and porous media surfaces and thus increasing the repulsive forces and increase the detachment fact of colloids from porous media all of these would reduce the deposition of colloidal mg oh 2 on porous media and benefit its migration results of fig 6 implied that the variation of ph was coincident with breakthrough curve of colloidal mg oh 2 effluent ph began to increase as mg oh 2 was detected in effluent water reached maximum value of 10 10 3 a slight ph decrease and then remained steady in the final stage however experiments results indicated that c c0 was independent with the initial colloidal mg oh 2 concentration suggesting that deposition of colloids on porous media is linearly increased as the initial concentration of colloidal mg oh 2 increased as shown in fig 5d this might attribute to a low residual concentration of mg oh 2 on porous media smaller than 0 4 of the total sum of porous media despite a high concentration of colloidal mg oh 2 was injected to aquifer therefore colloidal mg oh 2 concentration had no effect on the mechanism of colloid deposition on porous media thus models developed by yao tufenkji and shen could be used to simulate the transport performance of high concentration of heterogeneous colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media 3 2 model establishment 3 2 1 transfer heterogeneous into homogeneous previous research has mainly focused on the migration of uniform particle size colloids in porous media and model development was also under this condition however colloidal mg oh 2 with heterogeneous particle size transport properties in porous media were different with homogeneous colloids and should not be directly simulated by existing models considering the special properties of colloidal mg oh 2 method of calculus were used to simulate the transport performance of heterogeneous mg oh 2 colloids in this work colloidal mg oh 2 particles were divided into several cells by their size distribution mg oh 2 was considered as homogeneous colloids in each cell therefore colloidal mg oh 2 in each cell could be simulated by the existing model the total deposition on porous media was the sum of deposition of each cell 3 2 2 theory for simulating the transport performance of homogeneous colloid 3 2 2 1 colloid filtration theory cft most of the widely used models were derived from colloid filtration theory cft which was originally developed by yao yao et al 1971 according to cft deposition was the major process governing the rate of transport this process was represented by collision efficiency η which represented the probability of colloid particles from the bulk liquid to very near the surface of the collector tufenkji and elimelech 2004 when conditions were favorable for colloid deposition colloids and collector surfaces were of opposite charge and ionic strength of the solution was very high cft calculations closely matched experimental results however under chemical conditions that were unfavorable for deposition such as when there was significant electrostatic repulsion between colloid particles and porous media hahn and o melia 2004 landkamer et al 2013 the experimental observation for η had often been reported to considerably deviate from the theoretical estimation in other words the true value of collision efficiency η was lower than theory η 0 to address this issue an empirical factor of attachment efficiency α was employed which was defined as the ratio of collisions resulting in attachment to the total number of collisions and could be described as 1 η α η 0 the effluent concentration of colloids could be calculated by 2 c c 0 exp 3 2 1 f α η 0 l d where c 0 is the initial concentration of colloid f is the porosity of aquifer l is the filter medium packed length d is the porous media diameter due to the negative surface charge of colloidal mg oh 2 there existed electrostatic repulsion between colloid particles and porous media and the deposition of particles on porous media was an unfavorable condition thus the calculation of attachment efficiency should not be neglected 3 2 2 2 calculation of collision efficiency the collision efficiency η 0 could be calculated by t e equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 3 η 0 η d η t η g 2 4 a s 1 3 n r 0 081 n pe 0 715 n vdw 0 052 0 55 a s n r 1 675 n a 0 125 0 22 n r 0 24 n g 1 11 n vdw 0 053 where η d is the contribution to deposition provided by brownian diffusion η i is the interception or size exclusion η g is the gravity driven sedimentation a s is the porosity dependent parameter n r is the aspect ratio n pe is the perclet number n vdw is the van der waals number n a is the attraction number and n g is the gravity number the definition and physical interpretation of a s n r n pe n vdw n a and n g were shown in table 3 according to the studies of tufenkji tufenkji and elimelech 2004 η 0 was affected by hydrodynamic factors e g flow velocity and porous media diameter and unaffected by chemical factors e g ionic strength 3 2 2 3 calculation of attachment efficiency under the unfavorable condition the expression of attachment efficiency by maxwell model was developed by comparing brownian diffusion kinetic energies with primary and secondary minimum energies chongyang shen et al 2007 4 α α pri α sec φ max 4 π 1 2 x 2 exp x 2 dx 0 φ sec 4 π 1 2 x 2 exp x 2 dx where α pri and α sec are the fractions of successful collisions resulting in colloid deposition in the primary and secondary minima respectively φ max and φ sec are the energy barrier and secondary minimum of a dlvo interaction energy profile x is the dimensionless kinetic energy of a colloid defined as 5 x 2 mv 2 2 kt where k is the boltzmann constant t is absolute temperature m is colloid mass v is colloid velocity and its distribution is assumed to follow the maxwell distribution in the maxwell model the single collector attachment efficiency was considered to only be influenced by chemical factors such as ionic strength i and surface properties elimelech and o melia 1990 hahn and o melia 2004 however experimental measurements had shown that α of colloid deposition on porous media might also be affected by hydrodynamic factors e g flow velocity and and johnson 2005 johnson and tong 2006 kim and lee 2014 kuznar and elimelech 2007 shen et al 2010 it was reported that the maxwell model coupled with the hydrodynamic torque approach could provide an improved prediction of α of colloid deposition in porous media under unfavorable conditions the attachment efficiency in modified maxwell model could be expressed as follows shen et al 2010 6 α f pri α pri f sec α sec where f pri and f sec are the fractions of single collector surface area over which the adhesive torques t a acting on the colloids retained in the primary and secondary minimum are greater than the fluid hydrodynamic drag t h respectively the detailed procedure for calculating adhesive and hydrodynamic torque could be found in the works of saeed torkzaban torkzaban et al 2007 7 t a f a l c f a f a a p 4 k 1 3 8 t h 1 4 a p f h 1 4 a p 10 205 πμ v r a p 2 where f a is the adhesion force α p is the colloid radius k is the composite young s modulus f h is the drag forces v is the pore water velocity v r is the hydrodynamic shear at a distance of α p from the surface and μ is the fluid absolute viscosity 3 2 3 model for simulating the transport performance of colloidal mg oh 2 according to the assumption in section 3 2 1 eq 2 used to simulate colloidal mg oh 2 transport in porous media need to be converted into a set of equations 9 c c i 10 c i c 0 i exp 3 2 1 f α i η 0 i l d 11 η i f v d a pi 12 α i p v d i a pi where c 0i and c i are the initial and effluent concentration of colloidal of type i α i is the attachment efficiency of colloidal of type i could be calculated by eqs 4 8 η i is the collision efficiency of colloidal of type i could be calculated by eq 3 and i runs over all types of colloidal mg oh 2 in solution which divided by colloid particle size considering the function of convection and dispersion colloidal mg oh 2 transport in 1 d column could be described by eq 13 borden 2007 13 c i t d 2 c i x 2 v c i x 3 2 v 1 f d c i η 0 i α i the initial and boundary conditions of eq 13 in this work are 14 c i x 0 0 x 15 c i 0 t c 0 i 0 t t 0 16 c i 0 t 0 t t 0 where t 0 is the time for colloidal mg oh 2 injected to column 3 3 comparison of model simulations and experimental results simulated and observed colloidal mg oh 2 concentration were shown in fig 7 column effluent and fig 8 deposition at the end of experiments results illustrated that the observed experimental results matched well with the model simulations at any flow velocity porous media size and ionic strength hence the method of calculus combined with cft model t e equation calculate η 0 and modified maxwell theory calculate α could be used to simulate the transport performance of a high concentration of heterogeneous mg oh 2 colloid in porous media the effect of flow velocity porous media size and ionic strength on colloidal mg oh 2 deposition on porous media could quantitatively be described by the model mechanically and model simulations could perform a better understanding on different factors controlling heterogeneity mg oh 2 colloids transport in aquifers 3 4 model sensitivity analysis 3 4 1 effects of flow velocity the breakthrough curve and residual mg oh 2 distribution with different flow velocities were shown in figs 7a and 8a results indicated that flow velocity had a strong effect on the transport performance of colloidal mg oh 2 effluent concentration increased from 0 36 to 7 26 g l when flow velocity increased from 3 8 to 25 92 m d calculated results demonstrated that the increase of flow velocity would lead to the decrease of η 0 and α which suggested hydrodynamic played an important role in colloid deposition on porous media high flow velocity would lead to a larger hydrodynamic force saeed torkzaban et al 2007 shen et al 2010 which would increase the detachment of colloid from porous media and resulted in an increase of effluent concentration and a decrease of residual in porous media colloid particle size might also have an effect on the value of η 0 and α as shown in fig 9a η 0 decreased with the increase of colloid particle diameter this phenomenon could be explained by the deposition mechanism of colloidal mg oh 2 on porous media fig 1 illustrated that over 90 of the colloidal mg oh 2 particles was smaller than 1 μm indicating the effect of collision efficiency was controlled by brownian diffusion η d tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the intensity of brownian diffusion would decrease with the increase of colloid particle size tufenkji and elimelech 2004 thus η 0 decreased with the increase of colloid particle diameter for colloidal mg oh 2 the value of α increased at first and then decreased as the diameter of colloid particle increased as shown in fig 9b in addition hydrodynamic forces only functioned when the diameter of colloidal mg oh 2 exceeded a critical value hydrodynamic force was equal to attraction force for this diameter α was unaffected by water velocity and porous media size when the diameter of colloidal mg oh 2 particle was smaller than the critical value in previous studies tong and johnson tong and joainson 2006 found a decrease of α when flow velocity increased from 2 66 to 10 64 m d for colloids of 0 1 2 0 μm they attributed the changes in α to the hydrodynamic drag force which could shear the colloids off the porous medium surfaces a number of studies had also shown dependence of colloid attachment efficiency on flow velocity bai and chi 1996 bai and tien 1999 therefore the difference between tong and bai could be explained by the different experimental conditions flow velocity would effect α only when hydrodynamic force exceeded the attraction force fig 10 3 4 2 effects of porous media size porous media size also had an effect on the transport performance of colloidal mg oh 2 effluent concentration increased from 1 74 to 2 95 g l when the d 10 of porous media increased from 0 115 to 0 53 mm as shown in fig 7b the calculated results showed that the porous media size negatively correlated with η 0 the larger porous media size could provide a bigger pore among porous media which could decrease the probability of colloid particle collision in porous media and exhibited a smaller value of η 0 this resulted in an increase of effluent concentration and a decrease of residual in porous media however α increased with the increase of porous media size this was attributed to the increase of porous media size would significantly decrease the hydrodynamic force saeed torkzaban et al 2007 and decrease the detachment function of colloid from porous media and unfavorable for colloid migration hence the influence of porous media to colloidal mg oh 2 migration was not as significant as flow velocity 3 4 3 effects of ionic strength the breakthrough curve and residual mg oh 2 distribution with different ionic strengths were shown in figs 7c and 8c results implied that the increase of ionic strength was unfavorable for the migration of colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media effluent concentration decreased from 2 35 to 0 56 g l as ionic strength increased from 0 3 to 2 mm according to the findings of tufenkji tufenkji and elimelech 2004 η 0 was affected by hydrodynamic factors e g flow velocity and unaffected by chemical factors e g ionic strength therefore the value of η 0 would not have any variation as the increase of ionic strength as shown in fig 11a and the effect of ionic strength on the migration of colloidal mg oh 2 was expressed in the detachment of colloid from porous media the value of α a rise in ionic strength can increase the attachment of colloids on collector surfaces as shown in fig 11b α decreased with the increase of ionic strength by reducing the thickness of the diffuse double layer between colloid and collector surfaces and thus reducing the repulsive forces makselon et al 2017 tosco et al 2012 which was consistent with the observations in this study 4 conclusions cft model t e equation and modified maxwell theory could be used for simulating the transport performance of a high concentration colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media the deposition of mg oh 2 on porous media would not significantly change the properties of porous media method of calculus according to the size distribution was applied to simulate the transport performance of a high concentration of heterogeneous mg oh 2 colloids in porous media observed experimental results matched well with the model simulations hydrodynamic force dlvo attractive force and colloid diffusion were the major force functions on the migration of colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media the influence of flow velocity porous media size and ionic strength on colloidal mg oh 2 transport properties could be quantitatively described by model calculation acknowledgments this work was supported by key lab of groundwater resources and

benefit its migration results of fig 6 implied that the variation of ph was coincident with breakthrough curve of colloidal mg oh 2 effluent ph began to increase as mg oh 2 was detected in effluent water reached maximum value of 10 10 3 a slight ph decrease and then remained steady in the final stage however experiments results indicated that c c0 was independent with the initial colloidal mg oh 2 concentration suggesting that deposition of colloids on porous media is linearly increased as the initial concentration of colloidal mg oh 2 increased as shown in fig 5d this might attribute to a low residual concentration of mg oh 2 on porous media smaller than 0 4 of the total sum of porous media despite a high concentration of colloidal mg oh 2 was injected to aquifer therefore colloidal mg oh 2 concentration had no effect on the mechanism of colloid deposition on porous media thus models developed by yao tufenkji and shen could be used to simulate the transport performance of high concentration of heterogeneous colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media 3 2 model establishment 3 2 1 transfer heterogeneous into homogeneous previous research has mainly focused on the migration of uniform particle size colloids in porous media and model development was also under this condition however colloidal mg oh 2 with heterogeneous particle size transport properties in porous media were different with homogeneous colloids and should not be directly simulated by existing models considering the special properties of colloidal mg oh 2 method of calculus were used to simulate the transport performance of heterogeneous mg oh 2 colloids in this work colloidal mg oh 2 particles were divided into several cells by their size distribution mg oh 2 was considered as homogeneous colloids in each cell therefore colloidal mg oh 2 in each cell could be simulated by the existing model the total deposition on porous media was the sum of deposition of each cell 3 2 2 theory for simulating the transport performance of homogeneous colloid 3 2 2 1 colloid filtration theory cft most of the widely used models were derived from colloid filtration theory cft which was originally developed by yao yao et al 1971 according to cft deposition was the major process governing the rate of transport this process was represented by collision efficiency η which represented the probability of colloid particles from the bulk liquid to very near the surface of the collector tufenkji and elimelech 2004 when conditions were favorable for colloid deposition colloids and collector surfaces were of opposite charge and ionic strength of the solution was very high cft calculations closely matched experimental results however under chemical conditions that were unfavorable for deposition such as when there was significant electrostatic repulsion between colloid particles and porous media hahn and o melia 2004 landkamer et al 2013 the experimental observation for η had often been reported to considerably deviate from the theoretical estimation in other words the true value of collision efficiency η was lower than theory η 0 to address this issue an empirical factor of attachment efficiency α was employed which was defined as the ratio of collisions resulting in attachment to the total number of collisions and could be described as 1 η α η 0 the effluent concentration of colloids could be calculated by 2 c c 0 exp 3 2 1 f α η 0 l d where c 0 is the initial concentration of colloid f is the porosity of aquifer l is the filter medium packed length d is the porous media diameter due to the negative surface charge of colloidal mg oh 2 there existed electrostatic repulsion between colloid particles and porous media and the deposition of particles on porous media was an unfavorable condition thus the calculation of attachment efficiency should not be neglected 3 2 2 2 calculation of collision efficiency the collision efficiency η 0 could be calculated by t e equation tufenkji and elimelech 2004 3 η 0 η d η t η g 2 4 a s 1 3 n r 0 081 n pe 0 715 n vdw 0 052 0 55 a s n r 1 675 n a 0 125 0 22 n r 0 24 n g 1 11 n vdw 0 053 where η d is the contribution to deposition provided by brownian diffusion η i is the interception or size exclusion η g is the gravity driven sedimentation a s is the porosity dependent parameter n r is the aspect ratio n pe is the perclet number n vdw is the van der waals number n a is the attraction number and n g is the gravity number the definition and physical interpretation of a s n r n pe n vdw n a and n g were shown in table 3 according to the studies of tufenkji tufenkji and elimelech 2004 η 0 was affected by hydrodynamic factors e g flow velocity and porous media diameter and unaffected by chemical factors e g ionic strength 3 2 2 3 calculation of attachment efficiency under the unfavorable condition the expression of attachment efficiency by maxwell model was developed by comparing brownian diffusion kinetic energies with primary and secondary minimum energies chongyang shen et al 2007 4 α α pri α sec φ max 4 π 1 2 x 2 exp x 2 dx 0 φ sec 4 π 1 2 x 2 exp x 2 dx where α pri and α sec are the fractions of successful collisions resulting in colloid deposition in the primary and secondary minima respectively φ max and φ sec are the energy barrier and secondary minimum of a dlvo interaction energy profile x is the dimensionless kinetic energy of a colloid defined as 5 x 2 mv 2 2 kt where k is the boltzmann constant t is absolute temperature m is colloid mass v is colloid velocity and its distribution is assumed to follow the maxwell distribution in the maxwell model the single collector attachment efficiency was considered to only be influenced by chemical factors such as ionic strength i and surface properties elimelech and o melia 1990 hahn and o melia 2004 however experimental measurements had shown that α of colloid deposition on porous media might also be affected by hydrodynamic factors e g flow velocity and and johnson 2005 johnson and tong 2006 kim and lee 2014 kuznar and elimelech 2007 shen et al 2010 it was reported that the maxwell model coupled with the hydrodynamic torque approach could provide an improved prediction of α of colloid deposition in porous media under unfavorable conditions the attachment efficiency in modified maxwell model could be expressed as follows shen et al 2010 6 α f pri α pri f sec α sec where f pri and f sec are the fractions of single collector surface area over which the adhesive torques t a acting on the colloids retained in the primary and secondary minimum are greater than the fluid hydrodynamic drag t h respectively the detailed procedure for calculating adhesive and hydrodynamic torque could be found in the works of saeed torkzaban torkzaban et al 2007 7 t a f a l c f a f a a p 4 k 1 3 8 t h 1 4 a p f h 1 4 a p 10 205 πμ v r a p 2 where f a is the adhesion force α p is the colloid radius k is the composite young s modulus f h is the drag forces v is the pore water velocity v r is the hydrodynamic shear at a distance of α p from the surface and μ is the fluid absolute viscosity 3 2 3 model for simulating the transport performance of colloidal mg oh 2 according to the assumption in section 3 2 1 eq 2 used to simulate colloidal mg oh 2 transport in porous media need to be converted into a set of equations 9 c c i 10 c i c 0 i exp 3 2 1 f α i η 0 i l d 11 η i f v d a pi 12 α i p v d i a pi where c 0i and c i are the initial and effluent concentration of colloidal of type i α i is the attachment efficiency of colloidal of type i could be calculated by eqs 4 8 η i is the collision efficiency of colloidal of type i could be calculated by eq 3 and i runs over all types of colloidal mg oh 2 in solution which divided by colloid particle size considering the function of convection and dispersion colloidal mg oh 2 transport in 1 d column could be described by eq 13 borden 2007 13 c i t d 2 c i x 2 v c i x 3 2 v 1 f d c i η 0 i α i the initial and boundary conditions of eq 13 in this work are 14 c i x 0 0 x 15 c i 0 t c 0 i 0 t t 0 16 c i 0 t 0 t t 0 where t 0 is the time for colloidal mg oh 2 injected to column 3 3 comparison of model simulations and experimental results simulated and observed colloidal mg oh 2 concentration were shown in fig 7 column effluent and fig 8 deposition at the end of experiments results illustrated that the observed experimental results matched well with the model simulations at any flow velocity porous media size and ionic strength hence the method of calculus combined with cft model t e equation calculate η 0 and modified maxwell theory calculate α could be used to simulate the transport performance of a high concentration of heterogeneous mg oh 2 colloid in porous media the effect of flow velocity porous media size and ionic strength on colloidal mg oh 2 deposition on porous media could quantitatively be described by the model mechanically and model simulations could perform a better understanding on different factors controlling heterogeneity mg oh 2 colloids transport in aquifers 3 4 model sensitivity analysis 3 4 1 effects of flow velocity the breakthrough curve and residual mg oh 2 distribution with different flow velocities were shown in figs 7a and 8a results indicated that flow velocity had a strong effect on the transport performance of colloidal mg oh 2 effluent concentration increased from 0 36 to 7 26 g l when flow velocity increased from 3 8 to 25 92 m d calculated results demonstrated that the increase of flow velocity would lead to the decrease of η 0 and α which suggested hydrodynamic played an important role in colloid deposition on porous media high flow velocity would lead to a larger hydrodynamic force saeed torkzaban et al 2007 shen et al 2010 which would increase the detachment of colloid from porous media and resulted in an increase of effluent concentration and a decrease of residual in porous media colloid particle size might also have an effect on the value of η 0 and α as shown in fig 9a η 0 decreased with the increase of colloid particle diameter this phenomenon could be explained by the deposition mechanism of colloidal mg oh 2 on porous media fig 1 illustrated that over 90 of the colloidal mg oh 2 particles was smaller than 1 μm indicating the effect of collision efficiency was controlled by brownian diffusion η d tufenkji and elimelech 2004 the intensity of brownian diffusion would decrease with the increase of colloid particle size tufenkji and elimelech 2004 thus η 0 decreased with the increase of colloid particle diameter for colloidal mg oh 2 the value of α increased at first and then decreased as the diameter of colloid particle increased as shown in fig 9b in addition hydrodynamic forces only functioned when the diameter of colloidal mg oh 2 exceeded a critical value hydrodynamic force was equal to attraction force for this diameter α was unaffected by water velocity and porous media size when the diameter of colloidal mg oh 2 particle was smaller than the critical value in previous studies tong and johnson tong and joainson 2006 found a decrease of α when flow velocity increased from 2 66 to 10 64 m d for colloids of 0 1 2 0 μm they attributed the changes in α to the hydrodynamic drag force which could shear the colloids off the porous medium surfaces a number of studies had also shown dependence of colloid attachment efficiency on flow velocity bai and chi 1996 bai and tien 1999 therefore the difference between tong and bai could be explained by the different experimental conditions flow velocity would effect α only when hydrodynamic force exceeded the attraction force fig 10 3 4 2 effects of porous media size porous media size also had an effect on the transport performance of colloidal mg oh 2 effluent concentration increased from 1 74 to 2 95 g l when the d 10 of porous media increased from 0 115 to 0 53 mm as shown in fig 7b the calculated results showed that the porous media size negatively correlated with η 0 the larger porous media size could provide a bigger pore among porous media which could decrease the probability of colloid particle collision in porous media and exhibited a smaller value of η 0 this resulted in an increase of effluent concentration and a decrease of residual in porous media however α increased with the increase of porous media size this was attributed to the increase of porous media size would significantly decrease the hydrodynamic force saeed torkzaban et al 2007 and decrease the detachment function of colloid from porous media and unfavorable for colloid migration hence the influence of porous media to colloidal mg oh 2 migration was not as significant as flow velocity 3 4 3 effects of ionic strength the breakthrough curve and residual mg oh 2 distribution with different ionic strengths were shown in figs 7c and 8c results implied that the increase of ionic strength was unfavorable for the migration of colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media effluent concentration decreased from 2 35 to 0 56 g l as ionic strength increased from 0 3 to 2 mm according to the findings of tufenkji tufenkji and elimelech 2004 η 0 was affected by hydrodynamic factors e g flow velocity and unaffected by chemical factors e g ionic strength therefore the value of η 0 would not have any variation as the increase of ionic strength as shown in fig 11a and the effect of ionic strength on the migration of colloidal mg oh 2 was expressed in the detachment of colloid from porous media the value of α a rise in ionic strength can increase the attachment of colloids on collector surfaces as shown in fig 11b α decreased with the increase of ionic strength by reducing the thickness of the diffuse double layer between colloid and collector surfaces and thus reducing the repulsive forces makselon et al 2017 tosco et al 2012 which was consistent with the observations in this study 4 conclusions cft model t e equation and modified maxwell theory could be used for simulating the transport performance of a high concentration colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media the deposition of mg oh 2 on porous media would not significantly change the properties of porous media method of calculus according to the size distribution was applied to simulate the transport performance of a high concentration of heterogeneous mg oh 2 colloids in porous media observed experimental results matched well with the model simulations hydrodynamic force dlvo attractive force and colloid diffusion were the major force functions on the migration of colloidal mg oh 2 in porous media the influence of flow velocity porous media size and ionic strength on colloidal mg oh 2 transport properties could be quantitatively described by model calculation acknowledgments this work was supported by key lab of groundwater resources and

1631,karst water is an important resource for drinking water supply to determine the impacts of urbanization on karst water quality we performed a case study in the rapidly urbanized guiyang anshun region guizhou province southwestern china we interpret data from regional reconnaissance and long term monitoring related to major ion chemistry stable isotopes sr c s for so4 2 and n and o for no3 remote sensing and socio economic development we identify groundwater so4 2 and no3 sources by combined use of δ34s and ca2 na molar ratio and δ15n and no3 na ratio respectively we find that carbonate sulfide silicate and gypsum weathering anthropogenic inputs and hydrodynamic conditions account for karst water composition and its seasonal variations atmospheric n and s deposition nitrification of soil n and sulfide oxidation control the background levels of groundwater no3 and so4 2 the elevated concentrations of no3 and so4 2 at residential sites in rural and urban areas mainly arise from domestic sewage nitrification and fertilizer application are major reasons for the high levels of no3 in regional groundwater systems vegetated forested land area decreases as constructed land area increases which results in declining biogenic co2 production and inputs into the aquifer although the local government has attempted to control so2 emissions substantial increases in fossil fuel utilization and fertilizer consumption as well as population growth may have increased atmospheric hno3 deposition and induced increasingly severe contamination of groundwater with no3 and so4 2 our results improve the understanding of urbanization impacts on water quality and are important for water resource management in karst regions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords karst water

most important resources for drinking water supply worldwide de waele et al 2009 2011 ford and williams 2007 liang et al 2018 parise et al 2008 yuan et al 2016 in southern china for instance the karst water resource is 1847 108 m3 a accounting for 91 of the total karst water resource of china yuan et al 2016 therefore understanding both karst water quality and quantity is vital to a safe drinking water supply and sustainable exploitation and management of water resources alterations of subsurface environments e g caused by urbanization may strongly affect karst aquifer structures for example subsurface infrastructure such as tunnels sewers subways storage facilities and parking garages create secondary porosity installation of such utility lines also produces zones with greater permeability because their backfill materials are usually more permeable than the surrounding soils hibbs and sharp 2012 meanwhile due to fast replenishment by precipitation and surface water karst

fig 2e and are associated with accessibility to the atmosphere pco2 10 3 5 atm and soil co2 inputs the higher pco2 values of surface water are mainly caused by exchange between groundwater and surface water the saturation indices for calcite sicalcite and dolomite sidolomite of groundwater are commonly 0 5 to 0 5 and 2 to 0 5 respectively fig s1b c these values show that the groundwater is mostly near or over saturated with respect to calcite but near or under saturated with respect to dolomite groundwater ph values appear to be higher in april relative to august september and january karst water ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations and ec values are generally higher in january than in august september and april concentrations of no3 appear higher in august september and january compared to april groundwater typically has higher ca2 hco3 and no3 concentrations and ec values than surface water but similar so4 2 concentrations the predominant hydrochemical types of karst waters are ca mg hco3 ca mg hco3 so4 ca hco3 so4 and ca hco3 to better distinguish anthropogenic no3 hydrochemical data for august september were subjected to pca the results show that four principal components can be extracted and account for 80 of the total variance component 1 is characterized by higher loadings 0 5 of na cl k so4 2 and no3 fig 3a these closely related variables suggest they are linked to anthropogenic inputs based on previous knowledge of water quality in this region e g han and liu 2006 liu et al 2006 2008 component 2 has a high loading of hco3 0 90 and higher loading of ca2 0 56 but extremely low loadings of so4 2 and dissolved sio2 indicating the contribution of carbonate dissolution for component 3 the loadings of sr2 ca2 and so4 2 are 0 90 0 63 and 0 52 fig 3b respectively which likely reflect sr2 originating from celestite bearing gypsum sole high loading 0 74 is assigned to sio2 aq in component 4 fig 3c representing silicate weathering the following is also evident from fig 3 1 carbonate dissolution and anthropogenic inputs jointly contribute to no3 mg2 and ec loads in the karst water 2 gypsum could be one source of ca2 and so4 2 3 silicate weathering makes a minor contribution to the water composition and 4 carbonate and silicate weathering may decrease karst water ph values 4 1 2 effects of flow modes the aggressiveness of water is controlled by the amount of ambient h2co3 h2so4 and hno3 de waele et al 2016 as a result of allogenic recharge carbonate dissolution could be promoted because of the increase in protons arising from soil co2 inputs and oxidation of sulfides and ammonium this could be most significant during heavy rainfall and flood events that introduce large amounts of soil co2 oxidizing species and dissolved and suspended substances including various contaminants into the aquifer such recharge events occur over short time periods and therefore their effects on karst water chemistry may sometimes present as a first flush effect cánovas et al 2010 gzyl and banks 2007 similar studies have been conducted by other authors in barton springs texas usa a sampling frequency of 3 4 weeks showed the geochemistry of diffuse water was static during a transition from drought to wet conditions while that of conduit water was greatly affected by recharging surface water during the wet interval wong et al 2012 in contrast for the maolan spring guizhou china that discharges water from epikarst fractures elevated ec values resulting from soil co2 inputs by rainfall were clearly observed by high frequency monitoring using a multi parameter logger sampling time interval 15 min liu et al 2007 this soil co2 effect works in both diffuse and conduit waters but the dilution effect induced by heavy rainfall dominates when available liu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 4 1 3 causes of seasonal variations in hydrochemistry the sampling scheme of this study cannot capture the immediate dynamic features of water chemistry responding to rainfall in terms of seasonal tendencies soil co2 and dilution effects for ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations are evident and will be discussed later for domestic and industrial use boreholes are drilled with screens corresponding to the main conduit owing to its high yield of karst water the discharge sites of a karst conduit system are usually springs white 2012 and therefore the water chemistry of springs boreholes and underground rivers may vary similarly over time though with a time lag from hours to a few days this explains why the seasonal trends of major ion chemistry in samples from springs blue holes boreholes and underground rivers or caves are similar during the period from january to september figs 2 s1 unlike ca2 mg2 and hco3 temporal variations of so4 2 and no3 that are partly anthropogenic in origin depend on the timing of their input into the aquifer for example the dynamics of solutes of agricultural origin will be associated with the farming season this is mainly because surface contaminants that enter the conduit system are flushed through to the springs with little dilution white 2012 in anshun for instance rapeseed october may 58 9 103 ha rice july october 53 3 103 ha and corn april august 47 0 103 ha cultivation dominates respectively accounting for 19 7 17 8 and 15 7 of the total farm land in 2016 gzbs 2018

5 of the total fertilizer consumption for anshun in 2016 gzbs 2018 hence this farming activity is responsible for the commonly elevated no3 concentrations in august september and january vs april fig

ratios reflect ccs character for the clastic aquifers and marine genesis for the carbonate and carbonate clastic aquifers as illustrated in the na normalized hco3 vs ca2 diagram fig 4a the end members ems of carbonate silicate and evaporite are plotted to represent their contribution to water constituents the samples all fall within the carbonate domain and the area between carbonate and silicate domains which indicates carbonates primarily contribute to enrichment of ca2 and hco3 in the karst waters a majority of the samples lie along or above the line representing an mg2 ca2 molar ratio of 0 5 fig 4b which indicates the dominant role of dolomite dissolution in controlling karst water composition a great many samples also have mg2 ca2 ratios 0 5 reflecting a modest contribution of calcite dissolution to water chemistry according to dissolution and hydrolysis reactions of carbonates and common silicates e g amphibole anorthite and pyroxene by h2co3 eqs s4 s7 s10 s12 their weathering generates ca2 mg2 and hco3 in a molar ratio equaling 0 5 thus the samples lying above the 1 2 trend line in the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 plot fig 4c are likely associated with the addition of ca2 from gypsum there is no geological evidence of halite occurrence in this region han and liu 2004 hence karst water cl and na both typically 20 mg l fig s1d e originate from albite weathering eq s13 and anthropogenic inputs e g food salt use this exogenous na is the reason why some samples approach the silicate domain of the above geochemical model that neglects anthropogenic contributions gaillardet et al 1999 except for sample 92 87sr 86sr ratios increase from a marine carbonate character 0 708 to a ccs character 0 711 with rising mg2 ca2 ratios fig 5a reflecting the mixing of water from limestone and dolomite clastic aquifers in fig 5b three flow paths fps are delineated from sr isotope data on the basis of groundwater flow directions shown in fig 1b each fp may be hypothesized to represent a conduit system with the sampled springs blue holes and underground rivers being the discharge points and main channels along fp 3 sicalcite and sidolomite values of sample 102 increase compared to those of samples 104 and 103 fig 5b this is caused by the replenishment of water with high aggressiveness as reflected by the ph 6 64 sicalcite 2 1 sidolomite 4 8 and ec 72 3 μs cm values of sample 104 fig 5c as a result concentrations of ca2 and mg2 increase and the groundwater becomes over and near saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite accordingly it may also cause co2 degassing as evidenced by the increase in pco2 value of sample 102 fig 5c along fp 1 from sample 95 spring to 105 an outlet of an underground river sicalcite decreases from 0 31 to 0 07 and sidolomite rises from 0 62 to 0 16 this indicates the underground river may have received mg rich waters derived from silicate weathering as supported by the 87sr 86sr ratio 0 7103 of sample 105 from sample 97 a karst window of water filled conduits to 92 a blue hole receiving conduit water along fp 2 sicalcite sidolomite and ph values moderately increase pco2 values slightly decrease and 87sr 86sr ratios drastically fall this section of conduit may have not received sufficient soil co2 inputs as it is situated in an urban area therefore h2co3 consumption and carbonate dissolution result in a decrease in pco2 but increases in si and ph values furthermore sr isotopic signatures and mg2 ca2 ratios fig 5a demonstrate that the groundwater has percolated through strata comprised of marine dolomites 4 2 dissolved inorganic carbon dic 4 2 1 sources of dic δ13cdic values respectively average 7 1 and 0 in the atmosphere rain water and marine carbonates telmer and veizer 1999 plants with c3 photosynthesis have δ13c values ranging from 32 to 22 average 27 boutton et al 1998 while those with c4 photosynthesis range from 17 to 9 average 13 the δ13c values of particulate oc in guizhou rivers and springs are mostly around 24 5 li et al 2008 which indicates the prevalence of c3 plant cultivation and a minor contribution from c4 plants the δ13c value of soil respired co2 is close to that of labile oc because root respiration causes no fractionation between 12c and 13c diffusion of co2 in soils induces 13co2 enrichment by 4 4 relative to 12co2 owing to the difference in their diffusion coefficients cerling et al 1991 consequently the net δ13c value of soil co2 is 22 6 in a c3 plant dominant terrain in the present study groundwater δ13cdic and δ13cdoc values range from 15 2 to 8 3 average 10 3 1 8 n 16 and 22 4 to 10 4 average 14 9 3 1 respectively concentrations of doc range from below the analytical detection limit 0 05 mg l to 10 6 mg l average 3 78 3 26 mg l doc concentrations are correlated with δ13cdic values r 0 657 n 11 p 05 showing that doc oxidation affects δ13cdic values in the groundwater microbes preferentially utilize the light 12c accordingly 12c is enriched in the dic δ13cdic becomes more depleted and δ13cdoc increases therefore compared to the oc value 24 5 the distinctly elevated δ13cdoc denotes active doc oxidation the pco2 value of the atmosphere is much lower than for groundwater and thus its contribution to the dic of groundwater can be omitted therefore dic sources are written as 1 δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carbonates silicates δ 13 c soil respiration δ 13 c doc oxidation for carbonate dissolution by h2so4 and hno3 the hco3 and ca2 mg2 produced would occur in a molar ratio of 1 0 see eqs s5 s6 s8 s9 with a δ13cdic value of 0 dissolution of carbonates by h2co3 may be characterized by a δ13c value of 11 aucour et al 1999 silicate weathering causes no addition of c isotopes to the groundwater addition of hco3 from doc oxidation and soil co2 dissolution moderately increase groundwater hco3 ca2 mg2 ratios accordingly those ems are plotted in a δ13cdic value vs hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio diagram fig 6 this figure shows the samples deviate from the carbonate dissolution by h2co3 em some go up modestly to the em of carbonate dissolution by h2so4 and hno3 and some moderately shift downward along the soil co2 dissolution and doc oxidation trend line they are also all far above the trend of silicate weathering by h2co3 these features indicate doc oxidation soil co2 dissolution and silicate weathering are minor sources of dic therefore carbonate dissolution is responsible for the majority of dic loads for which the contributions of h2so4 or h2so4 and hno3 average 40 in southwestern china jiang 2013 li et al 2008 4 2 2 effect of biogenic co2 in a co2 h2o system dic i e h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 concentrations are a function of ph and pco2 eqs s14 s15 and at ph values 8 3 only hco3 is of importance 99 appelo and postma 2005 this is well reflected by the correlations between hco3 concentrations and values of pco2 rapr 0 751 p 01 and ph r 0 597 p 01 table s3 biogenic co2 sources include soil respiration and biotic oc oxidation as shown by the correlation between temperature and pco2 values rjan 0 723 p 01 table s2 biogenic co2 increases under higher temperature conditions li et al 2010a this is because higher temperatures favor plant root respiration biomass productivity and oc decomposition atkin et al 2000 rainfall carries co2 and oc from the surficial zones into groundwater a higher pco2 value promotes carbonate dissolution if the water is unsaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite as supported by the correlation between ec and pco2 values e g rjan 0 537 p 01 table s2 such a temperature facilitated soil co2 effect seems obvious in terms of the qls site which is hypothesized to predominantly receive diffuse flow fig s2 site no 42 in table s1 its temperature and ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations increase from 14 6 c and 13 3 2 1 and 20 8 mg l to 17 9 c and 15 5 2 5 and 30 7 mg l respectively during the period from january to september the rainfall is similar in april and august september but the higher temperatures of groundwater and the atmosphere for the latter figs s1f s3 cause higher biogenic co2 production this may explain the typically higher ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations of karst waters in august september than april fig 2b c d on the other hand the dilution effect becomes increasingly notable because of high rainfall intensity in the wet season as a result the soil co2 effect is weakened resulting in a decrease in pco2 values fig 2e and gradually weaker correlations between ec and pco2 values in april r 0 476 p 01 table s3 and august september r 0 374 p 01 table s4 relative to january the thick soil layer paddy land and strong farming activity in the anshun region may produce more co2 zhao et al 2010 2015 the expansion of urbanized areas in guiyang has been principally through excavating forested mountains and occupying farm land the decline of vegetated area reduces biogenic co2 production leading to decreases in groundwater pco2 values and aggressiveness from this perspective the decreases in hco3 concentrations at the hsp dzb dsd and wjdj sites in guiyang can be interpreted as reflecting a decline of groundwater aggressiveness caused by shifts from farm land to constructed land figs 7 8a in contrast hco3 concentrations of the htd site an outflow of a subterranean stream situated at the outskirts fig s2 site no 210 in table s1 are stable possibly because there is no change in its lulc unlike hco3 concentrations of ca2 are generally stable fig 8b owing to carbonate solubility constraints the impervious surfaces of constructed land on the other hand also reduce local recharge and biogenic co2 inputs into the aquifers 4 3 sulfate and nitrate 4 3 1 identification of so4 2 sources in addition to dissolved so4 2 in the oceans s in evaporite deposits and sulfide mainly as pyrite in marine clastic sediments are the major reservoirs for the global s cycle e g bottrell and newton 2006 the triassic marine so4 2 of south china has δ34s values ranging from 14 5 to 32 5 chen and chu 1988 guizhou coal contains 3 1 to 9 1 average 5 5 s with δ34s values of 12 01 to 2 51 average 7 52 and guiyang rainwater has δ34s values of 14 0 to 0 8 average 5 4 hong et al 1993 minimal 0 1 0 2 or 0 7 0 3 to 2 3 0 5 s isotopic fractionation occurs during microbial pyrite oxidation which depends on functional bacterium types and concentrations of sulfates and sulfides brabec et al 2012 the δ34s values in superphosphate ca h2po4 2 h2o caso4 fertilizer are reported to range from 5 6 to 7 7 average 0 8 n 8 li et al 2006 the waters derived from carbonate dissolution are assumed to have δ34s values similar to gypsum as gypsum principally occurs in dolomites in this region nonetheless because of the overlaps in the above s isotope em composition identifying groundwater so4 2 sources is difficult using only δ34s values alternatively ca2 na molar ratios in combination with s isotopic constraints can provide additional information to distinguish origins of so4 2 to represent ca2 na ratios of coal originating waters values for mine water of the zhijin coalfield at guizhou 0 0 1 5 average 0 4 0 5 n 19 li et al 2018 are considered in this study the ca2 na ratio in superphosphate is 279 according to the cao 21 43 and na2o 0 17 content in a superphosphate sample analyzed by rui et al 2008 on the basis of chemical composition of an earlier reported gypsum water sample huang et al 2016 its ca2 na ratio is assessed as 13 2 waters draining carbonates are widely accepted to have ca2 na ratios of 50 200 gaillardet et al 1999 the ca2 na ratio for the rainwater sample considered in this study is 22 5 showing that its ca2 and na may mainly arise from carbonate and gypsum dusts using these geochemical features the ems of so4 2 are illustrated by combining δ34s values and ca2 na ratios in fig 9a in which the dashed line presents the ideal mixing of two ems in this study groundwater δ34sso4 values range from 7 2 to 5 2 average 2 0 3 1 n 23 fig 9a illustrates that the samples mostly plot within the polygon defined by the above five ems or along some of the dashed lines this shows the groundwater could be mixtures of some or all of these ems however the samples are mostly far away from the gypsum em reflecting a minor contribution made by gypsum dissolution to the occurrence of groundwater so4 2 for the cultivated and forested lands the samples are close to the fertilizer em demonstrating inputs of superphosphate into the groundwater this to some extent is in accordance with the claim made by brenot et al 2007 that anhydrite and soluble so3 2 bearing fertilizers are significant inputs of dissolved so4 2 load in the moselle river france in this study the subsequent groundwater so4 2 concentrations induced by fertilizer inputs seem to remain at relatively low levels typically 10 50 mg l similarly the four samples collected from the rural sites one residential and the other three residential cultivated fall on or along the rainwater coal mixing line indicating the so4 2 principally derives from sulfide oxidation during water rock interaction the rainwater sample of this study contains 2 7 mg l so4 2 hence atmospheric so4 2 likely makes only a minor contribution to groundwater so4 2 loads consequently sulfide oxidation when available provides some background occurrence of so4 2 in regional groundwater if limited gypsum is present in the strata jiang 2012 moncaster et al 2000 as such the typical background level for the study area appears to be 50 80 mg l so4 2 moreover the aquifers are under oxidizing conditions as indicated by eh values commonly between 300 and 450 mv hence the s isotopic fractionation induced by biotic so4 2 reduction preferential use of the lighter 32s and enrichment in 34so4 2 bottrell and newton 2006 spence et al 2001 is negligible fig 9a also shows that all or most samples collected from the rural residential and urban areas approach the characteristics of domestic industrial wastewater in shuicheng guizhou described by li et al 2010b this suggests municipal and rural sewage significantly affect groundwater s isotopic composition detergents are characterized by δ34s values of 15 2 to 17 2 average 15 9 0 6 n 8 li et al 2006 therefore they may be one of the most important contributors to such positive δ34s values average 2 0 of domestic wastewater fig 9a importantly so4 2 concentrations are mostly 80 160 mg l in the residential sites of urban and rural areas which are much higher than the evaluated so4 2 loads associated with fertilizers and oxidation of sulfide hence domestic sewage may play a critical role in the occurrence of local groundwater so4 2 4 3 2 identification of no3 sources in china the δ15n values of nh4 in chemical fertilizer are 5 61 to 3 98 average 0 35 1 90 n 68 and of no3 in nh4no3 fertilizer range from 1 91 to 21 33 average 8 69 5 78 n 17 cao et al 1991 the nh4 n in fertilizers originates from fixation of atmospheric n2 and hence its δ15n is close to 0 kendall 1998 human and animal waste is relatively enriched in 15n showing a wide range in δ15n values from 7 47 to 49 71 xing et al 2001 this is because volatilization of 15n depleted ammonia induces a large enrichment of 15n in the residual nh4 and its subsequent oxidation product no3 xue et al 2009 red soil one of the most common soil types in south china has δ15n values for total n ranging from 1 00 to 1 56 average 1 29 0 20 cao et al 1993 during microbially mediated nh4 oxidation to no2 and then no3 i e nitrification two oxygen atoms in the newly formed no3 arise from h2o and the third from o2 andersson and hooper 1983 hollocher 1984 the δ18o of atmospheric o2 is 23 5 0 3 kroopnick and craig 1972 according to the global network of isotopes in precipitation database the δ18o values of guiyang precipitation range from 16 7 to 0 7 iaea wmo 2018 thus in theory the δ18o as 2 3δ18oh2o 1 3δ18oatmosphere of local groundwater no3 due to nitrification is estimated to be 3 3 to 7 34 provided the groundwater has a meteoric origin the no3 in groundwater of this study has δ15n and δ18o values of 0 62 to 21 40 average 12 58 5 15 n 26 and 0 49 to 9 97 average 4 69 2 85 respectively the rainwater sample contains 1 6 mg l no3 with δ15n and δ18o values of 0 81 and 76 44 respectively which are generally situated within the range of atmospheric no3 δ15n 13 to 13 δ18o 25 to 75 xue et al 2009 the groundwater δ18ono3 values are below the characteristic values of synthetic no3 fertilizers δ18o 17 25 xue et al 2009 therefore it may be concluded that both precipitation no3 and synthetic no3 fertilizers contribute little to the groundwater no3 loads as illustrated in fig 9b the groundwater samples all plot within or very close to the δ18o range caused by nitrification overall nitrification appears to be the most important process responsible for no3 occurrence in the groundwater of the study area generally a linear relationship exists between the δ18o and δ15n of groundwater no3 δ18o 0 3δ15n 0 89 r 2 0 3 this likely indicates denitrification causing increases in both the δ15n and δ18o of the residual no3 through kinetic isotopic fractionation böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 for denitrification some researchers have asserted that the fractionation ratios of δ15n δ18o are 2 1 1 7 1 5 and 1 3 aravena and robertson 1998 böttcher et al 1990 cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 mengis et al 1999 which are lower than the 3 3 estimated in this study moreover a significant correlation is only found between no3 concentrations and δ18o values r 0 536 p 01 but not between no3 and δ15n this together with the low r 2 value of the linear relationship shows that denitrification is subdued in the aerobic aquifers in fig 9b most of the samples plot within the human and animal waste domain the nh4 used for nitrification appears to mainly originate from septic systems and manure and the contribution of nh4 n fertilizer and soil n is insignificant this is in contrast to the earlier evidence that groundwater chemistry is greatly affected by fertilizers the disagreement is caused by underestimation of nh4 n fertilizer contribution to groundwater no3 loads owing to the overlapping δ18o values of nitrification produced no3 with the origins of nh4 n fertilizer soil n sewage and manure to address this issue we favor the combined technique of δ15n values in conjunction with no3 na molar ratios again as it is helpful for differentiating no3 from the above sources the relevant em values of no3 na ratios are determined as follows the sample from the hst site hypothesized to be contaminated by domestic sewage fig s2 site no 32 in table s1 had a no3 na ratio of 0 01 on 28 april 2018 which agrees well with the communal effluent value no3 na 0 1 reported by roy et al 1999 in contrast the groundwater of residential sites for both urban and rural areas is mostly characterized by ratios of 0 27 0 38 average 0 31 0 04 n 8 this is probably linked to the extent of nitrification hence we use no3 na ratios of 0 01 to 0 38 to represent the em of domestic sewage assuming waters leaching agricultural lands induce characteristic no3 na ratios of 10 roy et al 1999 this value could be assigned to waters leaching synthetic n fertilizer applied lands no3 na ratios of 5 3 and 2 4 respectively for january and september 2015 for the undisturbed qls site represent no3 issuing from the soil the no3 na ratio for the rainwater sample of this study is 10 7 accordingly those ems are plotted in the δ15n value vs no3 na ratio diagram fig 9c which illustrates that the rainwater generally overlaps the nh4 n fertilizer em this is because nh3 resulting from volatilization of nh4 n fertilizers is one source of atmospheric nh3 that is often eventually oxidized to no3 because of its meteoric origin it is appropriate to hypothesize that together with atmospheric no3 soil autogenic no3 is responsible for the background level of groundwater no3 i e 1 9 2 3 mg l according to the concentrations at the qls site as shown in fig 9c the sample from forested mountain lies on the em mixing line of nh4 n fertilizer and red soil n and contains no3 of 31 mg l with a δ15n value of 0 62 this demonstrates a significant contribution made by synthetic nh4 to its no3 load other points from the cultivated and forested lands mostly have relatively high no3 na ratios 1 3 3 2 δ15n values commonly 3 10 and no3 concentrations typically 11 23 mg l suggesting the existence of manure spreading in addition to fertilizer application from the viewpoint of regional groundwater no3 concentrations no3 na ratios mostly ranging from 0 4 to 7 0 fig s1g demonstrate that the contribution of fertilizers is profound when considering the significant fertilizer consumption in the study area this is linked to the nonpoint source character of agriculture inputs that makes groundwater more susceptible to fertilizer usage elevated no3 concentrations typically 23 30 mg l are also determined in the rural residential cultivated area with no3 na ratios of 0 5 1 0 and δ15n values of 12 these features suggest the groundwater no3 mainly arises from manure and or septic systems with a minor contribution from fertilizers most rural residential and urban areas are characterized by δ15n values 12 no3 na ratios 0 8 and no3 values typically between 14 and 39 mg l overall this indicates a substantial contribution from septic systems to groundwater no3 contamination 4 3 3 long term variations concentrations of so4 2 at the ltz ljz bba and xnt sites generally increased over time from 2001 to 2017 fig 10a intensification of sulfide and gypsum dissolution in the strata induced by aquifer alterations is unlikely at a regional scale therefore we ascribe the elevated so4 2 concentrations to increases in atmospheric s deposition domestic sewage production and fertilizer consumption the primary sources of atmospheric s are power plants household coal combustion metal sulfide smelting and the h2so4 industry han et al 2011 however the gzbs 2018 reports that total so2 emission volumes gradually decreased from 2008 to 2016 in guizhou province fig 11a due to decreasing industrial so2 emission volumes attributed to a rise in removal rates fig s4 therefore atmospheric s deposition is not the main reason for the long term rise in groundwater so4 2 concentrations in contrast as a result of governmental restrictions on coal use for domestic purposes the household and other waste gas so2 emission volumes drastically decreased from 2009 to 2010 but exhibited a stepwise increasing trend from 2010 to 2015 fig 11b on the basis of these so2 emission volumes and removal rates total so2 production is calculated to generally rise from 2008 to 2016 fig 11c this could increase so4 2 background content in the environment e g by unsuitable disposal of industrial so2 absorption products obviously increases in household so2 emission volumes are related to continuous population growth fig 11d as a consequence a subsequent increase in domestic sewage production would also take place which may have significantly contributed to the elevated so4 2 concentrations in groundwater the consumption of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers two of the four main fertilizer types is hypothesized to have appreciably increased from 2008 to 2016 in conjunction with total fertilizer consumption fig 11e in guiyang for example n fertilizer urea ammonium sulfate n p k compound consumption accounted for 45 2 46 2 and 46 6 of the total fertilizer consumption in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively gzbs 2018 hence the increased consumption of so4 2 bearing fertilizers e g superphosphate and nh4 2so4 is also an important contributor to the rise in groundwater so4 2 concentrations as shown in fig 10b c no3 concentrations also increased at some of the monitored sites over time from 2001 to 2017 with no3 na ratios commonly ranging from 0 0 to 2 5 concentrations of no3 display strong seasonal variations which is linked to the lulc dependent source component inputs and periodic hydraulic cycles for the dhs bba and xwz sites situated in densely populated downtown and new districts the low no3 na ratios typically 0 75 indicate typical no3 loads of 10 to 30 mg l can be attributed to domestic sewage the xnt site is characterized by higher no3 concentrations typically 17 28 mg l and no3 na ratios 0 5 2 4 and a δ15n value of 10 28 on 28 april 2018 this suggests the no3 is associated with both fertilizer and domestic sewage inputs which also explains the higher no3 na ratios of 0 5 1 5 typical of the ljz and ltz sites located in the suburbs thus population growth and fertilizer consumption increase are also responsible for the long term rise of groundwater no3 concentrations concentrations of soil autogenic no3 may have strong spatial temporal variability due to soil texture organic n content and accessibility and availability of functional microbes atmospheric no3 often results from oxidation of no g no2 and nh3 g for guiyang rainfall no3 contributors include nox from vehicle exhaust 31 19 and coal combustion 19 9 a significant amount of nh4 arises from the volatilization of fertilizers 22 10 and animal wastes 22 12 vehicle exhausts 19 11 and coal combustion 19 12 liu et al 2017 the consumption of coal can be alternatively represented by total so2 production thereby the substantial increases in the number of personal vehicles fig 11f coal consumption and population growth may have made an increasingly important contribution to atmospheric hno3 deposition through complex chemical and enzymatic reactions kendall 1998 therefore efforts and new technologies are needed to improve the regional air and water quality including 1 reducing coal s content increasing the efficiency of energy use and improving s and n removal from waste gas industrial and household 2 developing green energy e g wind water and solar power for industry household and vehicle use and 3 adopting strict measures to control the disposal and discharge of water gas and solid waste 5 conclusions this study investigates the karst water geochemistry of the rapidly urbanized guiyang anshun region by identifying major ion sources and interpreting their seasonal and long term variations combined use of δ34s values and ca2 na ratios as well as δ15n values and no3 na ratios prove to be useful in respectively discriminating among the so4 2 and no3 inputs into groundwater carbonate dissolution and sulfide oxidation principally contribute to enrichment of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 in the karst waters with a minor contribution made by weathering of silicates and gypsum based on geochemical characterization of dic so4 2 and no3 and considerations with respect to socio economic development the major impacts of urbanization on karst water quality can be summarized as follows 1 the alterations of vegetated and forested lands to constructed land have reduced biogenic co2 inputs into the groundwater fig 12 2 the increase in fertilizer consumption and population growth are mainly responsible for elevated so4 2 concentrations in the groundwater by infiltration of fertilizer leaching water and septic system seepage they also partly account for elevated no3 concentrations through atmospheric hno3 deposition in addition to inputs of fertilizer and manure leachate and domestic sewage 3 domestic sewage significantly contributes to elevated no3 and so4 2 concentrations at urban and rural residential sites nitrification and fertilizers mainly account for higher no3 loads in regional groundwater 4 the increase in fossil fuel consumption through coal combustion and personal vehicles contributes to atmospheric hno3 deposition making the control of nox and nh3 bearing waste gas emissions an urgent need these findings have important implications for understanding karst water geochemistry and improving water resource management in other karst regions of the world acknowledgements this work was funded by the national natural

1631,karst water is an important resource for drinking water supply to determine the impacts of urbanization on karst water quality we performed a case study in the rapidly urbanized guiyang anshun region guizhou province southwestern china we interpret data from regional reconnaissance and long term monitoring related to major ion chemistry stable isotopes sr c s for so4 2 and n and o for no3 remote sensing and socio economic development we identify groundwater so4 2 and no3 sources by combined use of δ34s and ca2 na molar ratio and δ15n and no3 na ratio respectively we find that carbonate sulfide silicate and gypsum weathering anthropogenic inputs and hydrodynamic conditions account for karst water composition and its seasonal variations atmospheric n and s deposition nitrification of soil n and sulfide oxidation control the background levels of groundwater no3 and so4 2 the elevated concentrations of no3 and so4 2 at residential sites in rural and urban areas mainly arise from domestic sewage nitrification and fertilizer application are major reasons for the high levels of no3 in regional groundwater systems vegetated forested land area decreases as constructed land area increases which results in declining biogenic co2 production and inputs into the aquifer although the local government has attempted to control so2 emissions substantial increases in fossil fuel utilization and fertilizer consumption as well as population growth may have increased atmospheric hno3 deposition and induced increasingly severe contamination of groundwater with no3 and so4 2 our results improve the understanding of urbanization impacts on water quality and are important for water resource management in karst regions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords karst water geochemistry groundwater no3 and so4 2 contamination urbanization 1 introduction karst water is a very important water reserve for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes and also one of the most important resources for drinking water supply worldwide de waele et al 2009 2011 ford and williams 2007 liang et al 2018 parise et al 2008 yuan et al 2016 in southern china for instance the karst water resource is 1847 108 m3 a accounting for 91 of the total karst water resource of china yuan et al 2016 therefore understanding both karst water quality and quantity is vital to a safe drinking water supply and sustainable exploitation and management of water resources alterations of subsurface environments e g caused by urbanization may strongly affect karst aquifer structures for example subsurface infrastructure such as tunnels sewers subways storage facilities and parking garages create secondary porosity installation of such utility lines also produces zones with greater permeability because their backfill materials are usually more permeable than the surrounding soils hibbs and sharp 2012 meanwhile due to fast replenishment by precipitation and surface water karst water is susceptible to surficial contamination induced by anthropogenic activities e g arcega cabrera et al 2014 filippini et al 2018 ford and williams 2007 gutiérrez et al 2014 jiang et al 2009a 2009b thus its dynamics both chemical and hydrodynamic depend on water availability recharge and flow patterns lithology and configuration of the matrix fractures and conduits as well as climate e g

variations in karst ponds and springs have also been carried out liu et al 2007 2015 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 2015 it is now widely accepted that h2co3 and h2so4 jointly promote carbonate dissolution in southwestern china h2co3 primarily originates from soil respired co2 and organic carbon oc degradation h2so4 is derived from the oxidation of sulfides e g pyrite in coal containing strata and atmospheric s deposition through s bearing coal combustion sulfuric acid gypsum dissolution domestic sewage and agricultural fertilizers are also groundwater so4 2 sources e g jiang 2012 lang et al 2011 liu et al 2008 the principal sources of nitrate another major contaminant in addition to sulfate in groundwater beneath guiyang the capital city of guizhou include sewage effluent chemical fertilizer and nitrification liu et al 2006 nitrification of nh4 can produce hno3 e g kendall 1998 perrin et al 2008 importantly animal waste and fertilizer volatilization vehicle exhausts and coal combustion are the major atmospheric nh4 sources in guiyang liu et al 2017 thus hno3 is another increasingly significant source of protons attacking carbonates huang et al 2017 jiang 2013 however the geochemical evolution of karst water and its associations with urbanization impacts have not been fully addressed in karst regions of the world land use and land cover lulc a reflection of urban space is hypothesized to influence biogenic h2co2 production moreover population growth and socio economic development could induce or aggravate groundwater so4 2 and no3 contamination this study characterizes spatial temporal variations in hydrochemistry in the guiyang anshun region a typical karst area of fast urbanization in guizhou using hydrochemical reconnaissance and monitoring sr

underground runoff flow paths are short and mostly near source outflows the carboniferous permian and triassic carbonate rocks with interlayers of clastic rocks composed of fragments and breccias with

pearson correlation coefficient sigma 2 tailed for various parameters were determined using spss pca was performed by diagonalization of the correlation matrix of the original variables to avoid the influence of different numerical ranges and selected principal components based on the eigenvalues 1 and cumulative explained variance for each principal component the loadings of variables were calculated using orthogonal projection and strengthened with varimax rotation 3 3 remote sensing data four landsat image scenes covering the guiyang anshun region were used in this work landsat7 etm

2001 2004 2009 and 2016 respectively 3 5 long term monitoring data the guizhou institute of geo environment monitoring has routinely monitored guiyang groundwater quality twice a year dry season and wet season for several decades some of the monitoring data for major ion concentrations from 2001 to 2017 are used in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry 4 1 1 general characteristics box plots fig 2 and correlation matrices tables s2 s4 were created to analyze the hydrochemical data groundwater and surface water have ph values ranging from 6 56 to 8 4 and 7 32 to 8 71 respectively fig 2a typical major ion concentrations are 15 160 mg l ca2 2 40 mg l mg2 150 350 mg l hco3 10 180 mg l so4 2 and 2 40 mg l no3 fig 2b c d f g as an indicator of total major ion concentrations ec values are 72 3 986 μs cm and exhibit similar seasonal variations fig s1a groundwater and surface water pco2 values are mostly 10 2 5 to 10 1 2 and 10 3 5 to 10 2 0 atm respectively fig 2e and are associated with accessibility to the atmosphere pco2 10 3 5 atm and soil co2 inputs the higher pco2 values of surface water are mainly caused by exchange between groundwater and surface water the saturation indices for calcite sicalcite and dolomite sidolomite of groundwater are commonly 0 5 to 0 5 and 2 to 0 5 respectively fig s1b c these values show that the groundwater is mostly near or over saturated with respect to calcite but near or under saturated with respect to dolomite groundwater ph values appear to be higher in april relative to august september and january karst water ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations and ec values are generally higher in january than in august september and april concentrations of no3 appear higher in august september and january compared to april groundwater typically has higher ca2 hco3 and no3 concentrations and ec values than surface water but similar so4 2 concentrations the predominant hydrochemical types of karst waters are ca mg hco3 ca mg hco3 so4 ca hco3 so4 and ca hco3 to better distinguish anthropogenic no3 hydrochemical data for august september were subjected to pca the results show that four principal components can be extracted and account for 80 of the total variance component 1 is characterized by higher loadings 0 5 of na cl k so4 2 and no3 fig 3a these closely related variables suggest they are linked to anthropogenic inputs based on previous knowledge of water quality in this region e g han and liu 2006 liu et al 2006 2008 component 2 has a high loading of hco3 0 90 and higher loading of ca2 0 56 but extremely low loadings of so4 2 and dissolved sio2 indicating the contribution of carbonate dissolution for component 3 the loadings of sr2 ca2 and so4 2 are 0 90 0 63 and 0 52 fig 3b respectively which likely reflect sr2 originating from celestite bearing gypsum sole high loading 0 74 is assigned to sio2 aq in component 4 fig 3c representing silicate weathering the following is also evident from fig 3 1 carbonate dissolution and anthropogenic inputs jointly contribute to no3 mg2 and ec loads in the karst water 2 gypsum could be one source of ca2 and so4 2 3 silicate weathering makes a minor contribution to the water composition and 4 carbonate and silicate weathering may decrease karst water ph values 4 1 2 effects of flow modes the aggressiveness of water is controlled by the amount of ambient h2co3 h2so4 and hno3 de waele et al 2016 as a result of allogenic recharge carbonate dissolution could be promoted because of the increase in protons arising from soil co2 inputs and oxidation of sulfides and ammonium this could be most significant during heavy rainfall and flood events that introduce large amounts of soil co2 oxidizing species and dissolved and suspended substances including various contaminants into the aquifer such recharge events occur over short time periods and therefore their effects on karst water chemistry may sometimes present as a first flush effect cánovas et al 2010 gzyl and banks 2007 similar studies have been conducted by other authors in barton springs texas usa a sampling frequency of 3 4 weeks showed the geochemistry of diffuse water was static during a transition from drought to wet conditions while that of conduit water was greatly affected by recharging surface water during the wet interval wong et al 2012 in contrast for the maolan spring guizhou china that discharges water from epikarst fractures elevated ec values resulting from soil co2 inputs by rainfall were clearly observed by high frequency monitoring using a multi parameter logger sampling time interval 15 min liu et al 2007 this soil co2 effect works in both diffuse and conduit waters but the dilution effect induced by heavy rainfall dominates when available liu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 4 1 3 causes of seasonal variations in hydrochemistry the sampling scheme of this study cannot capture the immediate dynamic features of water chemistry responding to rainfall in terms of seasonal tendencies soil co2 and dilution effects for ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations are evident and will be discussed later for domestic and industrial use boreholes are drilled with screens corresponding to the main conduit owing to its high yield of karst water the discharge sites of a karst conduit system are usually springs white 2012 and therefore the water chemistry of springs boreholes and underground rivers may vary similarly over time though with a time lag from hours to a few days this explains why the seasonal trends of major ion chemistry in samples from springs blue holes boreholes and underground rivers or caves are similar during the period from january to september figs 2 s1 unlike ca2 mg2 and hco3 temporal variations of so4 2 and no3 that are partly anthropogenic in origin depend on the timing of their input into the aquifer for example the dynamics of solutes of agricultural origin will be associated with the farming season this is mainly because surface contaminants that enter the conduit system are flushed through to the springs with little dilution white 2012 in anshun for instance rapeseed october may 58 9 103 ha rice july october 53 3 103 ha and corn april august 47 0 103 ha cultivation dominates respectively accounting for 19 7 17 8 and 15 7 of the total farm land in 2016 gzbs 2018 for rapeseed cultivation suggested fertilizer input is 350 kg ha urea in november december as such n fertilizer is a major source of groundwater no3 with a consumption of 29 614 tons accounting for 43 5 of the total fertilizer consumption for anshun in 2016 gzbs 2018 hence this farming activity is responsible for the commonly elevated no3 concentrations in august september and january vs april fig 2g due to rice and rapeseed cultivation respectively 4 1 4 water rock interaction 87sr 86sr ratios within the crust of central italy are 0 715 0 725 hawkesworth and vollmer 1979 and those of mantle origin mid ocean ridge basalts range from 0 7024 to 0 7030 average 0 7027 0 0002 n 21 schiano et al 1997 the 87sr 86sr ratios in permian triassic seawater typically range from 0 7065 to 0 7085 korte et al 2003 veizer et al 1999 which reflect the values in coeval marine carbonate rocks the mean value of the ratios for global runoff is 0 7119 due to a combination of continental crust silicates ccs carbonates and evaporites e g chetelat et al 2008 karim and veizer 2000 palmer and edmond 1989 wang et al 2007 2009 in guizhou 87sr 86sr ratios of permian basalts are 0 7061 0 7064 average 0 7062 0 0001 n 3 lu et al 1992 and those of qingshuijiang river draining silicate strata range from 0 7088 to 0 7155 average 0 7112 0 0019 n 16 han et al 2010 in this study 87sr 86sr ratios are respectively 0 7077 0 7103 average 0 7087 0 0010 n 10 0 7080 0 7106 average 0 7085 0 0010 n 6 and 0 7090 0 7107 average 0 7098 0 0012 n 2 in the carbonate carbonate clastic and clastic aquifers accordingly the ratios reflect ccs character for the clastic aquifers and marine genesis for the carbonate and carbonate clastic aquifers as illustrated in the na normalized hco3 vs ca2 diagram fig 4a the end members ems of carbonate silicate and evaporite are plotted to represent their contribution to water constituents the samples all fall within the carbonate domain and the area between carbonate and silicate domains which indicates carbonates primarily contribute to enrichment of ca2 and hco3 in the karst waters a majority of the samples lie along or above the line representing an mg2 ca2 molar ratio of 0 5 fig 4b which indicates the dominant role of dolomite dissolution in controlling karst water composition a great many samples also have mg2 ca2 ratios 0 5 reflecting a modest contribution of calcite dissolution to water chemistry according to dissolution and hydrolysis reactions of carbonates and common silicates e g amphibole anorthite and pyroxene by h2co3 eqs s4 s7 s10 s12 their weathering generates ca2 mg2 and hco3 in a molar ratio equaling 0 5 thus the samples lying above the 1 2 trend line in the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 plot fig 4c are likely associated with the addition of ca2 from gypsum there is no geological evidence of halite occurrence in this region han and liu 2004 hence karst water cl and na both typically 20 mg l fig s1d e originate from albite weathering eq s13 and anthropogenic inputs e g food salt use this exogenous na is the reason why some samples approach the silicate domain of the above geochemical model that neglects anthropogenic contributions gaillardet et al 1999 except for sample 92 87sr 86sr ratios increase from a marine carbonate character 0 708 to a ccs character 0 711 with rising mg2 ca2 ratios fig 5a reflecting the mixing of water from limestone and dolomite clastic aquifers in fig 5b three flow paths fps are delineated from sr isotope data on the basis of groundwater flow directions shown in fig 1b each fp may be hypothesized to represent a conduit system with the sampled springs blue holes and underground rivers being the discharge points and main channels along fp 3 sicalcite and sidolomite values of sample 102 increase compared to those of samples 104 and 103 fig 5b this is caused by the replenishment of water with high aggressiveness as reflected by the ph 6 64 sicalcite 2 1 sidolomite 4 8 and ec 72 3 μs cm values of sample 104 fig 5c as a result concentrations of ca2 and mg2 increase and the groundwater becomes over and near saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite accordingly it may also cause co2 degassing as evidenced by the increase in pco2 value of sample 102 fig 5c along fp 1 from sample 95 spring to 105 an outlet of an underground river sicalcite decreases from 0 31 to 0 07 and sidolomite rises from 0 62 to 0 16 this indicates the underground river may have received mg rich waters derived from silicate weathering as supported by the 87sr 86sr ratio 0 7103 of sample 105 from sample 97 a karst window of water filled conduits to 92 a blue hole receiving conduit water along fp 2 sicalcite sidolomite and ph values moderately increase pco2 values slightly decrease and 87sr 86sr ratios drastically fall this section of conduit may have not received sufficient soil co2 inputs as it is situated in an urban area therefore h2co3 consumption and carbonate dissolution result in a decrease in pco2 but increases in si and ph values furthermore sr isotopic signatures and mg2 ca2 ratios fig 5a demonstrate that the groundwater has percolated through strata comprised of marine dolomites 4 2 dissolved inorganic carbon dic 4 2 1 sources of dic δ13cdic values respectively average 7 1 and 0 in the atmosphere rain water and marine carbonates telmer and veizer 1999 plants with c3 photosynthesis have δ13c values ranging from 32 to 22 average 27 boutton et al 1998 while those with c4 photosynthesis range from 17 to 9 average 13 the δ13c values of particulate oc in guizhou rivers and springs are mostly around 24 5 li et al 2008 which indicates the prevalence of c3 plant cultivation and a minor contribution from c4 plants the δ13c value of soil respired co2 is close to that of labile oc because root respiration causes no fractionation between 12c and 13c diffusion of co2 in soils induces 13co2 enrichment by 4 4 relative to 12co2 owing to the difference in their diffusion coefficients cerling et al 1991 consequently the net δ13c value of soil co2 is 22 6 in a c3 plant dominant terrain in the present study groundwater δ13cdic and δ13cdoc values range from 15 2 to 8 3 average 10 3 1 8 n 16 and 22 4 to 10 4 average 14 9 3 1 respectively concentrations of doc range from below the analytical detection limit 0 05 mg l to 10 6 mg l average 3 78 3 26 mg l doc concentrations are correlated with δ13cdic values r 0 657 n 11 p 05 showing that doc oxidation affects δ13cdic values in the groundwater microbes preferentially utilize the light 12c accordingly 12c is enriched in the dic δ13cdic becomes more depleted and δ13cdoc increases therefore compared to the oc value 24 5 the distinctly elevated δ13cdoc denotes active doc oxidation the pco2 value of the atmosphere is much lower than for groundwater and thus its contribution to the dic of groundwater can be omitted therefore dic sources are written as 1 δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carbonates silicates δ 13 c soil respiration δ 13 c doc oxidation for carbonate dissolution by h2so4 and hno3 the hco3 and ca2 mg2 produced would occur in a molar ratio of 1 0 see eqs s5 s6 s8 s9 with a δ13cdic value of 0 dissolution of carbonates by h2co3 may be characterized by a δ13c value of 11 aucour et al 1999 silicate weathering causes no addition of c isotopes to the groundwater addition of hco3 from doc oxidation and soil co2 dissolution moderately increase groundwater hco3 ca2 mg2 ratios accordingly those ems are plotted in a δ13cdic value vs hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio diagram fig 6 this figure shows the samples deviate from the carbonate dissolution by h2co3 em some go up modestly to the em of carbonate dissolution by h2so4 and hno3 and some moderately shift downward along the soil co2 dissolution and doc oxidation trend line they are also all far above the trend of silicate weathering by h2co3 these features indicate doc oxidation soil co2 dissolution and silicate weathering are minor sources of dic therefore carbonate dissolution is responsible for the majority of dic loads for which the contributions of h2so4 or h2so4 and hno3 average 40 in southwestern china jiang 2013 li et al 2008 4 2 2 effect of biogenic co2 in a co2 h2o system dic i e h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 concentrations are a function of ph and pco2 eqs s14 s15 and at ph values 8 3 only hco3 is of importance 99 appelo and postma 2005 this is well reflected by the correlations between hco3 concentrations and values of pco2 rapr 0 751 p 01 and ph r 0 597 p 01 table s3 biogenic co2 sources include soil respiration and biotic oc oxidation as shown by the correlation between temperature and pco2 values rjan 0 723 p 01 table s2 biogenic co2 increases under higher temperature conditions li et al 2010a this is because higher temperatures favor plant root respiration biomass productivity and oc decomposition atkin et al 2000 rainfall carries co2 and oc from the surficial zones into groundwater a higher pco2 value promotes carbonate dissolution if the water is unsaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite as supported by the correlation between ec and pco2 values e g rjan 0 537 p 01 table s2 such a temperature facilitated soil co2 effect seems obvious in terms of the qls site which is hypothesized to predominantly receive diffuse flow fig s2 site no 42 in table s1 its temperature and ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations increase from 14 6 c and 13 3 2 1 and 20 8 mg l to 17 9 c and 15 5 2 5 and 30 7 mg l respectively during the period from january to september the rainfall is similar in april and august september but the higher temperatures of groundwater and the atmosphere for the latter figs s1f s3 cause higher biogenic co2 production this may explain the typically higher ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations of karst waters in august september than april fig 2b c d on the other hand the dilution effect becomes increasingly notable because of high rainfall intensity in the wet season as a result the soil co2 effect is weakened resulting in a decrease in pco2 values fig 2e and gradually weaker correlations between ec and pco2 values in april r 0 476 p 01 table s3 and august september r 0 374 p 01 table s4 relative to january the thick soil layer paddy land and strong farming activity in the anshun region may produce more co2 zhao et al 2010 2015 the expansion of urbanized areas in guiyang has been principally through excavating forested mountains and occupying farm land the decline of vegetated area reduces biogenic co2 production leading to decreases in groundwater pco2 values and aggressiveness from this perspective the decreases in hco3 concentrations at the hsp dzb dsd and wjdj sites in guiyang can be interpreted as reflecting a decline of groundwater aggressiveness caused by shifts from farm land to constructed land figs 7 8a in contrast hco3 concentrations of the htd site an outflow of a subterranean stream situated at the outskirts fig s2 site no 210 in table s1 are stable possibly because there is no change in its lulc unlike hco3 concentrations of ca2 are generally stable fig 8b owing to carbonate solubility constraints the impervious surfaces of constructed land on the other hand also reduce local recharge and biogenic co2 inputs into the aquifers 4 3 sulfate and nitrate 4 3 1 identification of so4 2 sources in addition to dissolved so4 2 in the oceans s in evaporite deposits and sulfide mainly as pyrite in marine clastic sediments are the major reservoirs for the global s cycle e g bottrell and newton 2006 the triassic marine so4 2 of south china has δ34s values ranging from 14 5 to 32 5 chen and chu 1988 guizhou coal contains 3 1 to 9 1 average 5 5 s with δ34s values of 12 01 to 2 51 average 7 52 and guiyang rainwater has δ34s values of 14 0 to 0 8 average 5 4 hong et al 1993 minimal 0 1 0 2 or 0 7 0 3 to 2 3 0 5 s isotopic fractionation occurs during microbial pyrite oxidation which depends on functional bacterium types and concentrations of sulfates and sulfides brabec et al 2012 the δ34s values in superphosphate ca h2po4 2 h2o caso4 fertilizer are reported to range from 5 6 to 7 7 average 0 8 n 8 li et al 2006 the waters derived from carbonate dissolution are assumed to have δ34s values similar to gypsum as gypsum principally occurs in dolomites in this region nonetheless because of the overlaps in the above s isotope em composition identifying groundwater so4 2 sources is difficult using only δ34s values alternatively ca2 na molar ratios in combination with s isotopic constraints can provide additional information to distinguish origins of so4 2 to represent ca2 na ratios of coal originating waters values for mine water of the zhijin coalfield at guizhou 0 0 1 5 average 0 4 0 5 n 19 li et al 2018 are considered in this study the ca2 na ratio in superphosphate is 279 according to the cao 21 43 and na2o 0 17 content in a superphosphate sample analyzed by rui et al 2008 on the basis of chemical composition of an earlier reported gypsum water sample huang et al 2016 its ca2 na ratio is assessed as 13 2 waters draining carbonates are widely accepted to have ca2 na ratios of 50 200 gaillardet et al 1999 the ca2 na ratio for the rainwater sample considered in this study is 22 5 showing that its ca2 and na may mainly arise from carbonate and gypsum dusts using these geochemical features the ems of so4 2 are illustrated by combining δ34s values and ca2 na ratios in fig 9a in which the dashed line presents the ideal mixing of two ems in this study groundwater δ34sso4 values range from 7 2 to 5 2 average 2 0 3 1 n 23 fig 9a illustrates that the samples mostly plot within the polygon defined by the above five ems or along some of the dashed lines this shows the groundwater could be mixtures of some or all of these ems however the samples are mostly far away from the gypsum em reflecting a minor contribution made by gypsum dissolution to the occurrence of groundwater so4 2 for the cultivated and forested lands the samples are close to the fertilizer em demonstrating inputs of superphosphate into the groundwater this to some extent is in accordance with the claim made by brenot et al 2007 that anhydrite and soluble so3 2 bearing fertilizers are significant inputs of dissolved so4 2 load in the moselle river france in this study the subsequent groundwater so4 2 concentrations induced by fertilizer inputs seem to remain at relatively low levels typically 10 50 mg l similarly the four samples collected from the rural sites one residential and the other three residential cultivated fall on or along the rainwater coal mixing line indicating the so4 2 principally derives from sulfide oxidation during water rock interaction the rainwater sample of this study contains 2 7 mg l so4 2 hence atmospheric so4 2 likely makes only a minor contribution to groundwater so4 2 loads consequently sulfide oxidation when available provides some background occurrence of so4 2 in regional groundwater if limited gypsum is present in the strata jiang 2012 moncaster et al 2000 as such the typical background level for the study area appears to be 50 80 mg l so4 2 moreover the aquifers are under oxidizing conditions as indicated by eh values commonly between 300 and 450 mv hence the s isotopic fractionation induced by biotic so4 2 reduction preferential use of the lighter 32s and enrichment in 34so4 2 bottrell and newton 2006 spence et al 2001 is negligible fig 9a also shows that all or most samples collected from the rural residential and urban areas approach the characteristics of domestic industrial wastewater in shuicheng guizhou described by li et al 2010b this suggests municipal and rural sewage significantly affect groundwater s isotopic composition detergents are characterized by δ34s values of 15 2 to 17 2 average 15 9 0 6 n 8 li et al 2006 therefore they may be one of the most important contributors to such positive δ34s values average 2 0 of domestic wastewater fig 9a importantly so4 2 concentrations are mostly 80 160 mg l in the residential sites of urban and rural areas which are much higher than the evaluated so4 2 loads associated with fertilizers and oxidation of sulfide hence domestic sewage may play a critical role in the occurrence of local groundwater so4 2 4 3 2 identification of no3 sources in china the δ15n values of nh4 in chemical fertilizer are 5 61 to 3 98 average 0 35 1 90 n 68 and of no3 in nh4no3 fertilizer range from 1 91 to 21 33 average 8 69 5 78 n 17 cao et al 1991 the nh4 n in fertilizers originates from fixation of atmospheric n2 and hence its δ15n is close to 0 kendall 1998 human and animal waste is relatively enriched in 15n showing a wide range in δ15n values from 7 47 to 49 71 xing et al 2001 this is because volatilization of 15n depleted ammonia induces a large enrichment of 15n in the residual nh4 and its subsequent oxidation product no3 xue et al 2009 red soil one of the most common soil types in south china has δ15n values for total n ranging from 1 00 to 1 56 average 1 29 0 20 cao et al 1993 during microbially mediated nh4 oxidation to no2 and then no3 i e nitrification two oxygen atoms in the newly formed no3 arise from h2o and the third from o2 andersson and hooper 1983 hollocher 1984 the δ18o of atmospheric o2 is 23 5 0 3 kroopnick and craig 1972 according to the global network of isotopes in precipitation database the δ18o values of guiyang precipitation range from 16 7 to 0 7 iaea wmo 2018 thus in theory the δ18o as 2 3δ18oh2o 1 3δ18oatmosphere of local groundwater no3 due to nitrification is estimated to be 3 3 to 7 34 provided the groundwater has a meteoric origin the no3 in groundwater of this study has δ15n and δ18o values of 0 62 to 21 40 average 12 58 5 15 n 26 and 0 49 to 9 97 average 4 69 2 85 respectively the rainwater sample contains 1 6 mg l no3 with δ15n and δ18o values of 0 81 and 76 44 respectively which are generally situated within the range of atmospheric no3 δ15n 13 to 13 δ18o 25 to 75 xue et al 2009 the groundwater δ18ono3 values are below the characteristic values of synthetic no3 fertilizers δ18o 17 25 xue et al 2009 therefore it may be concluded that both precipitation no3 and synthetic no3 fertilizers contribute little to the groundwater no3 loads as illustrated in fig 9b the groundwater samples all plot within or very close to the δ18o range caused by nitrification overall nitrification appears to be the most important process responsible for no3 occurrence in the groundwater of the study area generally a linear relationship exists between the δ18o and δ15n of groundwater no3 δ18o 0 3δ15n 0 89 r 2 0 3 this likely indicates denitrification causing increases in both the δ15n and δ18o of the residual no3 through kinetic isotopic fractionation böttcher et al 1990 fukada et al 2003 for denitrification some researchers have asserted that the fractionation ratios of δ15n δ18o are 2 1 1 7 1 5 and 1 3 aravena and robertson 1998 böttcher et al 1990 cey et al 1999 fukada et al 2003 mengis et al 1999 which are lower than the 3 3 estimated in this study moreover a significant correlation is only found between no3 concentrations and δ18o values r 0 536 p 01 but not between no3 and δ15n this together with the low r 2 value of the linear relationship shows that denitrification is subdued in the aerobic aquifers in fig 9b most of the samples plot within the human and animal waste domain the nh4 used for nitrification appears to mainly originate from septic systems and manure and the contribution of nh4 n fertilizer and soil n is insignificant this is in contrast to the earlier evidence that groundwater chemistry is greatly affected by fertilizers the disagreement is caused by underestimation of nh4 n fertilizer contribution to groundwater no3 loads owing to the overlapping δ18o values of nitrification produced no3 with the origins of nh4 n fertilizer soil n sewage and manure to address this issue we favor the combined technique of δ15n values in conjunction with no3 na molar ratios again as it is helpful for differentiating no3 from the above sources the relevant em values of no3 na ratios are determined as follows the sample from the hst site hypothesized to be contaminated by domestic sewage fig s2 site no 32 in table s1 had a no3 na ratio of 0 01 on 28 april 2018 which agrees well with the communal effluent value no3 na 0 1 reported by roy et al 1999 in contrast the groundwater of residential sites for both urban and rural areas is mostly characterized by ratios of 0 27 0 38 average 0 31 0 04 n 8 this is probably linked to the extent of nitrification hence we use no3 na ratios of 0 01 to 0 38 to represent the em of domestic sewage assuming waters leaching agricultural lands induce characteristic no3 na ratios of 10 roy et al 1999 this value could be assigned to waters leaching synthetic n fertilizer applied lands no3 na ratios of 5 3 and 2 4 respectively for january and september 2015 for the undisturbed qls site represent no3 issuing from the soil the no3 na ratio for the rainwater sample of this study is 10 7 accordingly those ems are plotted in the δ15n value vs no3 na ratio diagram fig 9c which illustrates that the rainwater generally overlaps the nh4 n fertilizer em this is because nh3 resulting from volatilization of nh4 n fertilizers is one source of atmospheric nh3 that is often eventually oxidized to no3 because of its meteoric origin it is appropriate to hypothesize that together with atmospheric no3 soil autogenic no3 is responsible for the background level of groundwater no3 i e 1 9 2 3 mg l according to the concentrations at the qls site as shown in fig 9c the sample from forested mountain lies on the em mixing line of nh4 n fertilizer and red soil n and contains no3 of 31 mg l with a δ15n value of 0 62 this demonstrates a significant contribution made by synthetic nh4 to its no3 load other points from the cultivated and forested lands mostly have relatively high no3 na ratios 1 3 3 2 δ15n values commonly 3 10 and no3 concentrations typically 11 23 mg l suggesting the existence of manure spreading in addition to fertilizer application from the viewpoint of regional groundwater no3 concentrations no3 na ratios mostly ranging from 0 4 to 7 0 fig s1g demonstrate that the contribution of fertilizers is profound when considering the significant fertilizer consumption in the study area this is linked to the nonpoint source character of agriculture inputs that makes groundwater more susceptible to fertilizer usage elevated no3 concentrations typically 23 30 mg l are also determined in the rural residential cultivated area with no3 na ratios of 0 5 1 0 and δ15n values of 12 these features suggest the groundwater no3 mainly arises from manure and or septic systems with a minor contribution from fertilizers most rural residential and urban areas are characterized by δ15n values 12 no3 na ratios 0 8 and no3 values typically between 14 and 39 mg l overall this indicates a substantial contribution from septic systems to groundwater no3 contamination 4 3 3 long term variations concentrations of so4 2 at the ltz ljz bba and xnt sites generally increased over time from 2001 to 2017 fig 10a intensification of sulfide and gypsum dissolution in the strata induced by aquifer alterations is unlikely at a regional scale therefore we ascribe the elevated so4 2 concentrations to increases in atmospheric s deposition domestic sewage production and fertilizer consumption the primary sources of atmospheric s are power plants household coal combustion metal sulfide smelting and the h2so4 industry han et al 2011 however the gzbs 2018 reports that total so2 emission volumes gradually decreased from 2008 to 2016 in guizhou province fig 11a due to decreasing industrial so2 emission volumes attributed to a rise in removal rates fig s4 therefore atmospheric s deposition is not the main reason for the long term rise in groundwater so4 2 concentrations in contrast as a result of governmental restrictions on coal use for domestic purposes the household and other waste gas so2 emission volumes drastically decreased from 2009 to 2010 but exhibited a stepwise increasing trend from 2010 to 2015 fig 11b on the basis of these so2 emission volumes and removal rates total so2 production is calculated to generally rise from 2008 to 2016 fig 11c this could increase so4 2 background content in the environment e g by unsuitable disposal of industrial so2 absorption products obviously increases in household so2 emission volumes are related to continuous population growth fig 11d as a consequence a subsequent increase in domestic sewage production would also take place which may have significantly contributed to the elevated so4 2 concentrations in groundwater the consumption of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers two of the four main fertilizer types is hypothesized to have appreciably increased from 2008 to 2016 in conjunction with total fertilizer consumption fig 11e in guiyang for example n fertilizer urea ammonium sulfate n p k compound consumption accounted for 45 2 46 2 and 46 6 of the total fertilizer consumption in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively gzbs 2018 hence the increased consumption of so4 2 bearing fertilizers e g superphosphate and nh4 2so4 is also an important contributor to the rise in groundwater so4 2 concentrations as shown in fig 10b c no3 concentrations also increased at some of the monitored sites over time from 2001 to 2017 with no3 na ratios commonly ranging from 0 0 to 2 5 concentrations of no3 display strong seasonal variations which is linked to the lulc dependent source component inputs and periodic hydraulic cycles for the dhs bba and xwz sites situated in densely populated downtown and new districts the low no3 na ratios typically 0 75 indicate typical no3 loads of 10 to 30 mg l can be attributed to domestic sewage the xnt site is characterized by higher no3 concentrations typically 17 28 mg l and no3 na ratios 0 5 2 4 and a δ15n value of 10 28 on 28 april 2018 this suggests the no3 is associated with both fertilizer and domestic sewage inputs which also explains the higher no3 na ratios of 0 5 1 5 typical of the ljz and ltz sites located in the suburbs thus population growth and fertilizer consumption increase are also responsible for the long term rise of groundwater no3 concentrations concentrations of soil autogenic no3 may have strong spatial temporal variability due to soil texture organic n content and accessibility and availability of functional microbes atmospheric no3 often results from oxidation of no g no2 and nh3 g for guiyang rainfall no3 contributors include nox from vehicle exhaust 31 19 and coal combustion 19 9 a significant amount of nh4 arises from the volatilization of fertilizers 22 10 and animal wastes 22 12 vehicle exhausts 19 11 and coal combustion 19 12 liu et al 2017 the consumption of coal can be alternatively represented by total so2 production thereby the substantial increases in the number of personal vehicles fig 11f coal consumption and population growth may have made an increasingly important contribution to atmospheric hno3 deposition through complex chemical and enzymatic reactions kendall 1998 therefore efforts and new technologies are needed to improve the regional air and water quality including 1 reducing coal s content increasing the efficiency of energy use and improving s and n removal from waste gas industrial and household 2 developing green energy e g wind water and solar power for industry household and vehicle use and 3 adopting strict measures to control the disposal and discharge of water gas and solid waste 5 conclusions this study investigates the karst water geochemistry of the rapidly urbanized guiyang anshun region by identifying major ion sources and interpreting their seasonal and long term variations combined use of δ34s values and ca2 na ratios as well as δ15n values and no3 na ratios prove to be useful in respectively discriminating among the so4 2 and no3 inputs into groundwater carbonate dissolution and sulfide oxidation principally contribute to enrichment of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 in the karst waters with a minor contribution made by weathering of silicates and gypsum based on geochemical characterization of dic so4 2 and no3 and considerations with respect to socio economic development the major impacts of urbanization on karst water quality can be summarized as follows 1 the alterations of vegetated and forested lands to constructed land have reduced biogenic co2 inputs into the groundwater fig 12 2 the increase in fertilizer consumption and population growth are mainly responsible for elevated so4 2 concentrations in the groundwater by infiltration of fertilizer leaching water and septic system seepage they also partly account for elevated no3 concentrations through atmospheric hno3 deposition in addition to inputs of fertilizer and manure leachate and domestic sewage 3 domestic sewage significantly contributes to elevated no3 and so4 2 concentrations at urban and rural residential sites nitrification and fertilizers mainly account for higher no3 loads in regional groundwater 4 the increase in fossil fuel consumption through coal combustion and personal vehicles contributes to atmospheric hno3 deposition making the control of nox and nh3 bearing waste gas emissions an urgent need these findings have important implications for understanding karst water geochemistry and improving water resource management in other karst regions of the world acknowledgements this work was funded by the national natural

environment is a long standing issue because of the contaminant and pathogen spread in water resources that threatens public health eerkes medrano et al 2015 the interest in this topic is being renewed by the increasing reports about the presence of manufactured mp in freshwater environments worldwide and their potentially harmful effects on the associated fauna teuten et al 2009 mp smaller than 90μm can move over long distances in surface and subsurface waters ending in lakes free et al 2014 and seas andrady 2011 reker et al 2015 and accumulate in sediments wang et al 2017 moreover wastewater treatment works are a significant source of mp to surface waters murphy et al 2016 rillig et al 2017 highlighted the role of earthworms in the transport of mp from soil to groundwater transport of mp in the vadose zone and subsurface waters depends on the colloid filtration in porous media that results from complex interactions between the pore wall surfaces and the colloid properties bradford et al 2013 denovio et al 2004 elimelech et al 1995 grolimund et al 2001 vogel 2002 size is one of the controlling factors in the retention of particles in porous media as derived from the yao s colloid filtration theory yao et al 1971 modeling studies show that particle size had a dramatic effect on the fate and retention of colloidal particles in filter beds besseling et al 2017 also dissolved organic matter dom influences the transport of colloidal particles in porous media because their steric interactions override the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek combined forces controlling the colloid stability for example dom can adsorb to colloids leading either to flocculation by polymer bridging or to polymer stabilization on the other hand dom can block the colloid adsorption sites in soils aquifers river beds and packed filters elimelech et al 1995 fang et al 2009 sen khilar 2006 further evidences indicate that dom decreases the attachment efficiency of polystyrene particles to surfaces of quartz sand pelley tufenkji 2008 the adsorption of chemicals to mp may also have important consequences on the contamination of groundwater studies on the facilitated transport of contaminants by mp in laboratory models or natural subsurface systems are sparse though they are in general agreement with the literature on natural colloids alimi et al 2018 quantification of the concentration of particles is also important to estimate the magnitude of the contaminant load and is needed to achieve accurate measurements for colloid transport studies goeppert hoetzl 2010 niehren kinzelbach 1998 however particle size characterization and quantification in natural water samples and aqueous extracts may be cumbersome because of the presence of a huge variety of polymers colloidal particles and microorganisms ngo et al 2008 the detection and identification of mp in groundwater are still in an early state geissen et al 2015 electronic microscopy is often used to measure the size of colloidal particles but it is time consuming also sample drying followed by the conductive shading required by scanning electron microscopy sem modify the conformation of polymeric surface coatings which have a dramatic influence on the colloidal behavior elimelech et al 1995 dynamic light scattering dls is not able to resolve to measure different particle size populations in complex polydisperse suspensions some efforts have been made to characterize the particle size distribution of colloidal particles with small polydispersity using a combination of dls and static light scattering and two color laser sources to avoid contributions from multiple scattering bryant et al 2003 these authors reported that light scattering methods could not discriminate different particle size populations in heavy tailed distributions particle fractioning methods such as asymmetric flow field flow fractioning or size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi angle light scattering provide significant advances in particle size determination in complex mixtures de la calle et al 2017 but it was not extensively used in the mp characterization in waters gigault et al 2017 fourier transform infrared imaging was used to determine the presence of mp 20μm in groundwater and drinking water mintenig et al 2019 these authors only found low concentrations up to 7 particles m 3 other authors reported much higher concentrations 3 6 106 particles m 3 at the inlet of drinking water treatment plants the sub micron sizes only accounted for 5 pivokonsky et al 2018 up to date quantification and precise size determination of mp is being made using visible microscopy and sem anderson et al 2017 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2018 but there is still no universally accepted quantification and qualification tools of mp in fresh waters li et al 2018 in the present article we propose the trps technique to quantify and characterize the size of mp smaller than 3 μm in groundwater and surface freshwaters trps can perform accurate measurements of nano to microparticle properties suspended in electrolytes the concentration of particles in the fluid is measured as a number of particles per unit volume of fluid across a specified detectable particle size range that brings an accurate size distribution of these particles trps method uses the same principle as the coulter method the measurement procedure consists of applying a voltage across a single microscopic measuring channel connecting two cells fig 1a the channel size can be from 40 nm to 5 μm in diameter depending on the size of the membrane used the impedance of the electrolyte fluid in the measuring channel is sampled 50 000 times per second sample particles are driven through the channel by applying a combination of pressure and voltage when a particle passes through the measuring channel decreases the current between the cells that decrease also named resistive pulse or blockade signal is detected and measured by an application software the relationship between the magnitude of the blockade and the volume of the particle is linear so that calibration of the blockade magnitude with standards spheres of known size is used to determine the size of individual particles moreover the measuring channel is carved by the manufacturer in a thermoplastic polyurethane membrane which can be stretched tunning to fit the channel size to the best detection of blockades on the passage of the particles weatherall et al 2016 the concentration of particles in the sample can be determined accurately by counting particle by particle within a range of sizes between 40 nm and 10 μm therefore trps has enough resolution to discriminate populations mixed in multimodal samples of mp varenne et al 2016 besides this technique does not disturb the geometry of the particle trps has been successfully used to characterize and enumerate nano and microparticles suspended in biological fluids such as viruses and exosomes lane et al 2015 maas et al 2017 and engineered nanoparticles blundell et al 2016 mayne et al 2016 rottman et al 2013 the electrolyte used in trps measurements must meet the requirements of current intensity and voltage for accurate measurements of the blockades most of the applications of the trps have been developed for buffers typically used in physiology or biochemistry such as pbs or tris lane et al 2015 therefore the electrolyte may constitute a limitation to measure the size of suspended particles in surface and subsurface waters by trps because of their variation in ph and their electrolyte composition recently some research is being developed using unbuffered electrolytes at concentrations commonly found in drinking waters e g 2 mm kcl with ph from 3 to 7 mayne et al 2016 under certain experimental conditions distribution broadening and double peaks in the blockade waveforms can generate significant uncertainty in the size measurement broadening of the blockade shape can be reduced by using measuring cells with channels that are similar in diameter to the particles weatherall et al 2016 the potential applications of trps to characterize and enumerate mp in natural waters effluents or soil extracts can be limited by the presence of dissolved organic polymers which may interfere with the measurement of blockades by changing the electric current passing through the measuring cell pevarnik et al 2013 little is known about the influence of dissolved polymers on the trps determinations pevarnik et al 2013 reported that hydrogels pass through the channels by electroosmosis producing blockades with a characteristic shape these authors explain that the counter ions that compensate the charge in the polymer seem to be flushed from the hydrogel as passing through the channel flocculated dom can behave as low density hydrogels that could disturb the blockades on the passing of the mp through the channel given the above the trps can be a useful technique to enhance the characterization of mp in water samples from terrestrial environments but the presence of dom may interfere with the measurements the objective of the present work is to test the capabilities of trps to measure particle sizes in the presence of dom in particular we examine the effects of the ha on the shape of blockades and in the measurement of particle size of calibrated latex polystyrene microspheres used as a mp surrogate in aqueous suspensions 2 materials and methods 2 1 particle size measurement the trps apparatus is an izon qnano izon science europe ltd oxford uk the measuring cell used for these experiments is a np1000 membrane izon science europe ltd that can measure particle sizes between 500 and 2000 nm fig 1b c this interval is adequate for measuring the microspheres used in this study all buffers and electrolytes used in the particle size measurements were prepared with ultrapure milli q water millipore merk filtered through a filter membrane of 220 nm pore size different buffers and concentrations were tested to select the best measuring conditions namely phosphate saline buffer pbs cl2h3k2na3o8p2 cacl2 and nacl after several preliminary tests we found the optimal electrolyte for the particle size measurements 7 mmol l 1 cacl2 and ph 5 8 0 2 table 1 the cacl2 electrolyte also contributes to the slow flocculation rate of the ha adequate to our experiments we used monodisperse polystyrene microspheres as a surrogate of the mp estapor microspheres ref fy 100 merck millipore darmstadt germany with a mean diameter of 930 10nm without surface functional groups the stock suspension supplied by the manufacturer had a polystyrene concentration of 10 g l 1 humic acids were purchased from merck sigma aldrich humic acid sodium salt technical grade cas number 68131 04 4 the molecular weight range of the ha is between 2 and 500kda ha stock suspensions were prepared by dissolving 100 0 5 mg ha in 100ml ultrapure water and vortexed for five seconds using an rs va10 phoenix instrument germany vortex stirrer apparatus at maximum speed 2 2 mp ha and mp ha mixtures different suspensions containing either mp ha or mp ha mixtures in 7 mm cacl2 ph 5 8 were prepared as follows i mp without ha ii ha without mp at two concentrations namely 2 and 6 mg l 1 ha and iii mp with five ha concentrations namely 2 4 6 8 and 10 mg l 1 ha the concentration of mp was 1 0 mg l 1 in all experiments using the mp the trps measurements in the above suspensions were made after different incubation times 0 25 16 and 40 h at 25 c after the trps measurement the dissolved ha were removed from the above mp ha mixtures by washing i e centrifugation and resuspension of the mp with 0 5 ml 7 mm cacl2 without ha the washing procedure was repeated by five times then trps measurements were repeated as above with the washed mp the procedure for trps measurement was done as follows 75 μl of the electrolyte was put in the lower cell and 40 μl of the suspension mp ha or mp ha in the upper cell the voltage channel stretch and pressure were adjusted until getting an intensity current between 70 and 150 na using particle free electrolyte once the current was stable the samples were injected in the upper cell the experimental conditions chosen for the three buffers were identical with a channel stretch of 47 mm the pressure difference between the two halves of the fluid cell was 66 pa the above settings were also used by other authors weatherall et al 2016 the voltages applied were 0 08 v for pbs and 0 7 v for both nacl and cacl2 the settings for resistive pulse detection were scan rate 50 khz minimum scan time 30 s maximum scan time 10 min minimum number pulse detections 500 and the minimum average detection rate in 10 min was 0 83 blockades per second additionally dls measurements of mp ha and mp ha mixtures were done with a zetasizer nano zs apparatus malvern instruments ltd uk 2 3 particle clustering clustering methods can be used to determine whether the waveforms of blockades represent similar particles or dissimilar several clustering methods can be found in the literature hierarchical partitioning density based model based grid based and soft computing methods rokach maimon 2005 we used a model based clustering analysis of particle size populations the classification and density estimation method is based on finite gaussian mixture modeling fgmm the clustering model used the expectation maximization em algorithm a description of this algorithm can be found in do and batzoglou 2008 briefly in the fgmm em procedure each population of a finite mixture density is associated with a cluster in this work we assume that all component densities arise from the same univariate gaussian distribution for each component or cluster in one dimension there are just two models all components have equal variance or different variance among clusters the determination of the most suitable number of clusters was done on the basis of the bayesian information criterion bic fraley et al 2012 clustering procedure and calculations were done with the mclust library implemented in the r statistical package core team 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of the electrolyte on mp detection the cacl2 7 mmol l 1 ph5 8 electrolyte without ha and mp gave about five blockades after 600 s table 2 this blockade rate is negligible and may be caused by electrolyte contamination with aerosol particles vogel et al 2011 the blockade rate for the highest concentration of ha 10 mg l 1 in cacl2 and 40 h of incubation time was 0 042 0 059na s 1 on the other hand the rate of blockades for mp in cacl2 was 240 times higher than only with ha therefore blockades of ha in cacl2 can be neglected and the most of the blockades in mp ha mixtures can be assigned to the mp a comparison of blockade magnitude and blockade duration for the pbs used as reference buffer and nacl and cacl2 electrolytes is shown in fig 2 the scattering patterns observed using nacl and cacl2 were similar while the ones obtained with pbs showed a larger dispersion in blockade duration the magnitude of blockades and their durations were normalized using the standard sizing technique that consists of calculating the cube roots of trps pulse magnitude divided by their mean value pulse duration was also normalized dividing by the mean value vogel et al 2011 weatherall et al 2016 table 3 shows that the number of blockades was similar for the three buffers but the number of blockade counts in each cluster was different differences in the number of counts in each cluster depend on the sequence of the blockade in each input file feed into the clustering computer program for example if few tiny waveforms appear first these and the subsequent tiny ones will be grouped in a small cluster e g 13 blockades as can be seen in the cluster no 1 with cacl2 table 3 otherwise if the sequence starts with average sized waveforms these and the subsequent ones with similar size will be grouped in a large cluster such as occurs in the cluster no 1 with nacl table 3 the largest mixing probabilities about 30 correspond to clusters with the highest particle counts these high mixing probabilities mean that differences in size between these large clusters are not statistically significant the suitability of trps to study colloid particle sizes can be limited by the current intensity that crosses the measuring cell which depends on the electrolyte composition the channel size and the voltage fortunately the optimal ph and electrolyte concentrations for the trps measurements fall into the typical values of the soil solution wolt 1994 and freshwater environments stumm morgan 1996 in the absence of ha the two electrolytes tested kcl and cacl2 gave the same particle size distributions using the adequate voltages and current intensities therefore trps can be used in many aquatic samples and soil water extracts using unbuffered monovalent or divalent electrolytes at concentrations close to the field conditions using these electrolytes constitutes a significant advantage over sem because trps can measure the size of mp very fast without altering their surface 3 2 mp ha interaction a mixture of charged ha and uncharged mp produces a charged neutral interaction that can be calculated within the debye huckel model theoretical calculations of colloid sphere interactions in 7 mm cacl2 using the dejaguin landau vervey oberbeek dlvo approach see table 4 showed the absence of a repulsive barrier fig 3 a however the attraction potential at 1 nm separation in absolute value is small 12 k b t where k b is the boltzmann constant and t is the temperature in addition to theoretical calculations phase contrast optical microscopy and sem did not show any aggregation of the mp nor influence of the ha in their morphology fig 3b d these photographs support that the adsorption of ha on mp in 7 mm cacl2 was negligible and agree with the small energy interaction predicted by the debye huckel model the median particle size of mp measured with trps in the washed samples previously incubated with ha was not statistically different to the mp not incubated with ha therefore it can be assumed that the ha mp binding is negligible all the above results support that the change in size due to adsorption of the ha to mp is questionable however the washing procedure decreased the blockade rate to 100 counts per minute or less resulting in a decrease in the count rate about five times regarding the unwashed sample this decrease may be related to the entanglement of about 80 of mp in ha floccules remaining in the supernatant after vortexing so that these were lost during replacement of supernatant with the ha free electrolyte as a result a number of mp linked to ha may have been removed which could lead to some exclusion of mp ha aggregates in the washing procedure dls measurements performed on all ha and the mp ha mixtures resulted in significant errors in the autocorrelation function fit 0 5 and the polydispersity index 1 therefore the particle size estimations in mp ha mixtures reported by the dls apparatus were not reliable this confirms that the presence of dissolved dom is insidious in the determination of size and counting of mp by different methods including the trps and supports the convenience of dom removal before measurements sujathan et al 2017 3 3 influence of the presence of ha on the particle size estimation with trps the influence of ha on the resistive pulses was analyzed by representing the distribution of cloud points of the blockade magnitude versus its duration scatterplots for all the incubation times and ha concentrations can be examined in fig 4 in this figure we used the full width at half maximum duration of the waveform fwhm i e the duration of the blockade at the half maximum height in order to get a reduction of the influence of the noise in the baseline incubation time and ha increased the dispersion of the cloud of points towards higher blockade magnitudes note the decrease in the particle counts per time i e the blockade rate with the incubation time analysis of waveforms of ha mp mixtures by fgmm em clustering brings three different types fig 5 the first type fig 5a is the regular waveforms around the 85 of the blockades these are similar to the waveforms measured in the absence of ha the second is the anomalous waveforms that are 4 fig 5b and cannot be used in the blockade size measurements and finally some large waveforms about 11 fig 5c appear after incubation times larger than 0 25h we hypothesized that these large waveforms could be related to the presence of flocculated humic acids in the measuring channel at the same time as the microspheres the shape of the large waveforms is indistinguishable from the regular ones except for their size therefore identification of the alterations induced by the ha based only in the analysis of the waveform shape can be a difficult task fig 6a shows that the mean particle size increased linearly with incubation time and the concentration of humic acids the influence of ha can be observed in more detail in the histogram representing the empirical density of the normalized distribution of the particle size fig 7 the distributions are weighted by the total blockade counts in each measurement in such way that the area under the curve is the unity the reddish bars in the histogram indicate the increase in the apparent size with the ha concentration and occurs more clearly with the longest incubation times 16 and 40 h the black line indicates the difference between the density histogram of particle size distribution in the presence of ha minus the density distribution in the absence of ha this line shows that ha increases the frequencies in the extreme values the left tail of the distribution decreased with the incubation time independently of the ha concentration on the contrary the right tail increased with the ha concentration and incubation time if considering only the right tail of the histograms i e the sizes larger than 1000nm then the integral sum under the black line in the fig 7 has a linear relation with the ha with pearson s r 0 97 0 94 and 0 94 for incubation times of 0 25 16 and 40 h respectively fig 6a the slope of the line becomes steeper with the incubation time the increase in size with the addition of ha is not supported by the hypothesis of the surface coating of mp by the ha as was seen by sem images and the dlvo calculations then we hypothesize that the apparent increase in size may be caused by the presence of flocculated ha in the measuring channel not attached to the mp flocculated ha can also explain the linear increase in the noise of the baseline current through the measuring cell with the increasing ha concentrations fig 6b the noise increases from 5 61 0 06 na at 0 25 h to 6 19 0 25 na at 40 h fluctuations in the electric resistivity with increasing concentrations of ha support the hypothesis that incipient flocculation of ha disturbs the blockades the flocculated ha cause larger heterogeneities in the electric field than the dissolved ha when passing thorough of measuring channel in consequence we hypothesize that the higher ha concentration the higher the flocculation rate and the higher oscillations in the electric resistivity ha suspensions in 7 mm cacl2 formed floccules that reached near one millimeter in size after two days of incubation in a laboratory beaker we identified these clouds as ha floccules with phase contrast optical microscopy flocculation of the ha implies that size distribution of floccules shifts towards bigger sizes much larger than the range of the measuring channel used in the trps in addition the presence of large floccules in the measuring cell of the trps may preclude the mp enter into the measuring channel that can result in the decrease of particle counts as observed in the presence of ha however if mp coating by ha is negligible then what do these large sizes mean and why different sizes coexist we hypothesize that the aggregation dynamics of ha produces a suspension of ha floccules covering a large scale of sizes from few tens nanometers to millimeters this is typical of colloid aggregation dynamics then the smallest floccules crossing through the measuring channel cause small current blockades with peak values below the detection threshold therefore the smallest floccules only produce noise in the baseline current in the same way as reported by anderson et al 2015 on the contrary very few floccules can produce blockades of sufficient size that can account for false particles finally the largest floccules cannot enter the channel considering the above a fraction of the population of ha floccules with different sizes can contribute to increasing the noise in the baseline current also blockades corresponding to mp passing through the measuring channel are disrupted by accompanying small ha floccules we hypothesize that the blockade magnitude and duration in mp ha mixtures depends on the size and concentration of the floccules passing simultaneously with the mp through the channel it is not clear how the ha can disturb the electric field but hydrocolloids can deform upon passing the measuring channel pevarnik et al 2013 that deformation can bring waveforms with a different shape regarding the typical waveforms produced by denser mp polymers however waveforms in the presence of ha did not show significant differences in shape nor in the amplitude duration aspect ratio fig 5 the only significant difference is the size difference in amplitude and duration of the waveforms it is clear that ha do not produce alterations of the waveform shape as was reported by pevarnik et al pevarnik et al 2013 for deformable hydrocolloids the results of trps measurements of mp in the presence of ha depends on a complex assemblage of processes these include colloid aggregation dynamics and the distribution of the arrival times of ha floccules to the measuring channel in this study the quantitative effect on the apparent size induced by ha is analyzed by statistical clustering methods 3 4 distribution of particle populations the fgmm em clustering resulted in optimal kernel density functions that were in general fitted with a mixture of three gaussian components with different variances fig s1 in the supporting information in one case 0 25 h incubation and 6 mg l 1 ha the optimal fitting had four components kernel density functions give an overview of the changes in the particle size distribution induced by the incubation time and the concentration of the humic acids fig s2 in the supporting information fig 8 shows the clustering results of the particle size distribution formed by three significant clusters note that size in the cluster no 1 is in the range from 810 to 925 nm that is slightly smaller than the nominal particle size provided by the supplier the size of the particles in this cluster remained unchanged with the incubation time and the ha concentration that means that there is a significant population of mp whose size was not influenced by the ha the cluster no 2 groups the particles with a size in the range from 925 to 1095 nm and fits into the particle size reported by the manufacturer the distribution of clusters no 1 and no 2 hardly overlap finally cluster no 3 groups the particles with sizes larger than the nominal particle size 1095nm the above analysis suggests that the fgmm em clustering separates different populations of the mp in the presence of ha and cacl2 clustering classification was used to analyze the changes in their population distribution in function of the incubation time and the ha fig 9 shows that populations in the cluster no 1 constitute less than the half of the trps counts this cluster does not show a clear relation with the ha or with the incubation time it shows a significant decrease in population with the ha in the range 2 6 mg l 1 at 40 h incubation that can be related to the shift to larger blockades with time a further increase in size causes particles to fall into the cluster no 3 cluster no 2 encompassed the higher number of counts at short times i e less than half of population fraction at 0 25 h incubation with a significant decrease at bigger ha 8 mg l 1 at larger times the population decreased significantly in the range of ha 2 8 mg l 1 changes in the particle populations in the cluster no 2 do not have significant correspondence with the variations in the cluster no 1 populations in the cluster no 3 varied in an opposite way as in the cluster no 2 the fig 9 also shows an apparent increase in the population fraction with the ha and the incubation time this increase is compensated by a decrease in the particle counts in the cluster no 2 at 2 mg l 1 ha the population reached the minimum 0 12 and 0 15 these apparent sizes correspond to the largest sizes namely 1300 nm at 16 h and 1462 nm at 40 h doubling in diameter the nominal size of the mp used in this study to summarize fgmm em clustering method used to analyze the size distribution of mp obtained with trps can resolve different components without loss of information as indicated by the bayesian information criterium cluster no 1 in fig 9 covers the fraction of particles about 30 50 population that were not influenced by the presence of ha the cluster no 2 indicates an increase in the particle size associated with the concentration of ha and incubation time the coexistence of different sizes and the slow growth rate support that the ha binding to mp is negligible accordingly the small electrostatic interactions avena and koopal 1999 also the double layer interaction table 4 shows a low repulsion barrier so that the attraction force is small and the range of electrostatic attraction is short 20nm 4 conclusion we presented a study on the feasibility of the application of trps as a candidate method for direct counting and particle by particle size measurement of mp in surface waters and groundwater we evaluated the influence of the humic acids on the trps measurement with ionic strength and ph typical of aquatic environments the presence of humic acids at concentrations higher than 4 mg l 1 alters the measurements as follows i increases the noise of the current baseline regarding the ha free electrolyte which hinders the blockade detection and measurement ii decreases the count rate causing an underestimation of the particle concentrations iii increases the blockade magnitude which leads to an overestimation in the size measurements interference of dom needs to be solved for accurate measurement of concentration and size of mp with trps we suggest a procedure of classification of blockades using the unsupervised fgmm em clustering method this method can help to identify the dom effects on the size measurement and can be used to make corrections of these effects without chemical treatment of samples the trps method can be used to improve current knowledge of the behavior of mp and other particulate micro contaminants in surface waters and groundwater

conclusions of this study indicate that trps can be a valuable tool to improve the knowledge of the mp fate in surface waters in the vadose zone and groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords colloid flocculation finite gaussian clustering humic acids particle size microplastics tunable resistive pulse sensing trps 1 introduction the fate of mp bacteria and viruses in the environment is a long standing issue because of the contaminant and pathogen spread in water resources that threatens public health eerkes medrano et al 2015 the interest in this topic is being renewed by the increasing reports about the presence of manufactured mp in freshwater environments worldwide and their potentially harmful effects on the associated fauna teuten et al 2009 mp smaller than 90μm can move over long distances in surface and subsurface waters ending in lakes free et al 2014 and seas andrady 2011 reker et al 2015 and accumulate in sediments wang et al 2017 moreover wastewater treatment works are a significant source of mp to surface waters murphy et al 2016 rillig et al 2017 highlighted the role of earthworms in the transport of mp from soil to groundwater transport of mp in the vadose zone and subsurface waters depends on the colloid filtration in porous media that results from complex interactions between the pore wall surfaces and the colloid properties bradford et al 2013 denovio et al 2004 elimelech et al 1995 grolimund et al 2001 vogel 2002 size is one of the controlling factors in the retention of particles in porous media as derived from the yao s colloid filtration theory yao et al 1971 modeling studies show that particle size had a dramatic effect on the fate and retention of colloidal particles in filter beds besseling et al 2017 also dissolved organic matter dom influences the transport of colloidal particles in porous media because their steric interactions override the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek combined forces controlling the colloid stability for example dom can adsorb to colloids leading either to flocculation by polymer bridging or to polymer stabilization on the other hand dom can block the colloid adsorption sites in soils aquifers river beds and packed filters elimelech et al 1995 fang et al 2009 sen khilar 2006 further evidences indicate that dom decreases the attachment efficiency of polystyrene particles to surfaces of quartz sand pelley tufenkji 2008 the adsorption of chemicals to mp may also have important consequences on the contamination of groundwater studies on the facilitated transport of contaminants by mp in laboratory models or natural subsurface systems are sparse though they are in general agreement with the literature on natural colloids alimi et al 2018 quantification of the concentration of particles is also important to estimate the magnitude of the contaminant load and is needed to achieve accurate measurements for colloid transport studies goeppert hoetzl 2010 niehren kinzelbach 1998 however particle size characterization and quantification in natural water samples and aqueous extracts may be cumbersome because of the presence of a huge variety of polymers colloidal particles and microorganisms ngo et al 2008 the detection and identification of mp in groundwater are still in an early state geissen et al 2015 electronic microscopy is often used to measure the size of colloidal particles but it is time consuming also sample drying followed by the conductive shading required by scanning electron microscopy sem modify the conformation of polymeric surface coatings which have a dramatic influence on the colloidal behavior elimelech et al 1995 dynamic light scattering dls is not able to resolve to measure different particle size populations in complex polydisperse suspensions some efforts have been made to characterize the particle size distribution of colloidal particles with small polydispersity using a combination of dls and static light scattering and two color laser sources to avoid contributions from multiple scattering bryant et al 2003 these authors reported that light scattering methods could not discriminate different particle size populations in heavy tailed distributions particle fractioning methods such as asymmetric flow field flow fractioning or size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi angle light scattering provide significant advances in particle size determination in complex mixtures de la calle et al 2017 but it was not extensively used in the mp characterization in waters gigault et al 2017 fourier transform infrared imaging was used to determine the presence of mp 20μm in groundwater and drinking water mintenig et al 2019 these authors only found low concentrations up to 7 particles m 3 other authors reported much higher concentrations 3 6 106 particles m 3 at the inlet of drinking water treatment plants the sub micron sizes only accounted for 5 pivokonsky et al 2018 up to date quantification and precise size determination of mp is being made using visible microscopy and sem anderson et al 2017 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2018 but there is still no universally accepted quantification and qualification tools of mp in fresh waters li et al 2018 in the present article we propose the trps technique to quantify and characterize the size of mp smaller than 3 μm in groundwater and surface freshwaters trps can perform accurate measurements of nano to microparticle properties suspended in electrolytes the concentration of particles in the fluid is measured as a number of particles per unit volume of fluid across a specified detectable particle size range that brings an accurate size distribution of these particles trps method uses the same principle as the coulter method the measurement procedure consists of applying a voltage across a single microscopic measuring channel connecting two cells fig 1a the channel size can be from 40 nm to 5 μm in diameter depending on the size of the membrane used the impedance of the electrolyte fluid in the measuring channel is sampled 50 000 times per second sample particles are driven through the channel by applying a combination of pressure and voltage when a particle passes through the measuring channel decreases the current between the cells that decrease also named resistive pulse or blockade signal is detected and measured by an application software the relationship between the magnitude of the blockade and the volume of the particle is linear so that calibration of the blockade magnitude with standards spheres of known size is used to determine the size of individual particles moreover the measuring channel is carved by the manufacturer in a thermoplastic polyurethane membrane which can be stretched tunning to fit the channel size to the best detection of blockades on the passage of the particles weatherall et al 2016 the concentration of particles in the sample can be determined accurately by counting particle by particle within a range of sizes between 40 nm and 10 μm therefore trps has enough resolution to discriminate populations mixed in multimodal samples of mp varenne et al 2016 besides this technique does not disturb the geometry of the particle trps has been successfully used to characterize and enumerate nano and microparticles suspended in biological fluids such as viruses and exosomes lane et al 2015 maas et al 2017 and engineered nanoparticles blundell et al 2016 mayne et al 2016 rottman et al 2013 the electrolyte used in trps measurements must meet the requirements of current intensity and voltage for accurate measurements of the blockades most of the applications of the trps have been developed for buffers typically used in physiology or biochemistry such as pbs or tris lane et al 2015 therefore the electrolyte may constitute a limitation to measure the size of suspended particles in surface and subsurface waters by trps because of their variation in ph and their electrolyte composition recently some research is being developed using unbuffered electrolytes at concentrations commonly found in drinking waters e g 2 mm kcl with ph from 3 to 7 mayne et al 2016 under certain experimental conditions distribution broadening and double peaks in the blockade waveforms can generate significant uncertainty in the size measurement broadening of the blockade shape can be reduced by using measuring cells with channels that are similar in diameter to the particles weatherall et al 2016 the potential applications of trps to characterize and enumerate mp in natural waters effluents or soil extracts can be limited by the presence of dissolved organic polymers which may interfere with the measurement of blockades by changing the electric current passing through the measuring cell pevarnik et al 2013 little is known about the influence of dissolved polymers on the trps determinations pevarnik et al 2013 reported that hydrogels pass through the channels by electroosmosis producing blockades with a characteristic shape these authors explain that the counter ions that compensate the charge in the polymer seem to be flushed from the hydrogel as passing through the channel flocculated dom can behave as low density hydrogels that could disturb the blockades on the passing of the mp through the channel given the above the trps can be a useful technique to enhance the characterization of mp in water samples from terrestrial environments but the presence of dom may interfere with the measurements the objective of the present work is to test the capabilities of trps to measure particle sizes in the presence of dom in particular we examine the effects of the ha on the shape of blockades and in the measurement of particle size of calibrated latex polystyrene microspheres used as a mp surrogate in aqueous suspensions 2 materials and methods 2 1 particle size measurement the

with five ha concentrations namely 2 4 6 8 and 10 mg l 1 ha the concentration of mp was 1 0 mg l 1 in all experiments using the mp the trps measurements in the above suspensions were made after different incubation times 0 25 16 and 40 h at 25 c after the trps measurement the dissolved ha were removed from the above mp ha mixtures by washing i e centrifugation and resuspension of the mp with 0 5 ml 7 mm cacl2 without ha the washing procedure was repeated by five times then trps measurements were repeated as above with the washed mp the procedure for trps measurement was done as follows 75 μl of the electrolyte was put in the lower cell and 40 μl of the suspension mp ha or mp ha in the upper cell the voltage channel stretch and pressure were adjusted until getting an intensity current between 70 and 150 na using particle free electrolyte once the current was stable the samples were injected in the upper cell the experimental conditions chosen for the three buffers were identical with a channel stretch of 47 mm the pressure difference between the two halves of the fluid cell was 66 pa the above settings were also used by other authors weatherall et al 2016 the voltages applied were 0 08 v for pbs and 0 7 v for both nacl and cacl2 the settings for resistive pulse detection were scan rate 50 khz minimum scan time 30 s maximum scan time 10 min minimum number pulse detections 500 and the minimum average detection rate in 10 min was 0 83 blockades per second additionally dls measurements of mp ha and mp ha mixtures were done with a zetasizer nano zs apparatus malvern instruments ltd uk 2 3 particle clustering clustering methods can be used to determine whether the waveforms of blockades represent similar particles or dissimilar several clustering methods can be found in the literature hierarchical partitioning density based model based grid based and soft computing methods rokach maimon 2005 we used a model based clustering analysis of particle size populations the classification and density estimation method is based on finite gaussian mixture modeling fgmm the clustering model used the expectation maximization em algorithm a description of this algorithm can be found in do and batzoglou 2008 briefly in the fgmm em procedure each population of a finite mixture density is associated with a cluster in this work we assume that all component densities arise from the same univariate gaussian distribution for each component or cluster in one dimension there are just two models all components have equal variance or different variance among clusters the determination of the most suitable number of clusters was done on the basis of the bayesian information criterion bic fraley et al 2012 clustering procedure and calculations were done with the mclust library implemented in the r statistical package core team 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of the electrolyte on mp detection the cacl2 7 mmol l 1 ph5 8 electrolyte without ha and mp gave about five blockades after 600 s table 2 this blockade rate is negligible and may be caused by electrolyte contamination with aerosol particles vogel et al 2011 the blockade rate for the highest concentration of ha 10 mg l 1 in cacl2 and 40 h of incubation time was 0 042 0 059na s 1 on the other hand the rate of blockades for mp in cacl2 was 240 times higher than only with ha therefore blockades of ha in cacl2 can be neglected and the most of the blockades in mp ha mixtures can be assigned to the mp a comparison of blockade magnitude and blockade duration for the pbs used as reference buffer and nacl and cacl2 electrolytes is shown in fig 2 the scattering patterns observed using nacl and cacl2 were similar while the ones obtained with pbs showed a larger dispersion in blockade duration the magnitude of blockades and their durations were normalized using the standard sizing technique that consists of calculating the cube roots of trps pulse magnitude divided by their mean value pulse duration was also normalized dividing by the mean value vogel et al 2011 weatherall et al 2016 table 3 shows that the number of blockades was similar for the three buffers but the number of blockade counts in each cluster was different differences in the number of counts in each cluster depend on the sequence of the blockade in each input file feed into the clustering computer program for example if few tiny waveforms appear first these and the subsequent tiny ones will be grouped in a small cluster e g 13 blockades as can be seen in the cluster no 1 with cacl2 table 3 otherwise if the sequence starts with average sized waveforms these and the subsequent ones with similar size will be grouped in a large cluster such as occurs in the cluster no 1 with nacl table 3 the largest mixing probabilities about 30 correspond to clusters with the highest particle counts these high mixing probabilities mean that differences in size between these large clusters are not statistically significant the suitability of trps to study colloid particle sizes can be limited by the current intensity that crosses the measuring cell which depends on the electrolyte composition the channel size and the voltage fortunately the optimal ph and electrolyte concentrations for the trps measurements fall into the typical values of the soil solution wolt 1994 and freshwater environments stumm morgan 1996 in the absence of ha the two electrolytes tested kcl and cacl2 gave the same particle size distributions using the adequate voltages and current intensities therefore trps can be used in many aquatic samples and soil water extracts using unbuffered monovalent or divalent electrolytes at concentrations close to the field conditions using these electrolytes constitutes a significant advantage over sem because trps can measure the size of mp very fast without altering their surface 3 2 mp ha interaction a mixture of charged ha and uncharged mp produces a charged neutral interaction that can be calculated within the debye huckel model theoretical calculations of colloid sphere interactions in 7 mm cacl2 using the dejaguin landau vervey oberbeek dlvo approach see table 4 showed the absence of a repulsive barrier fig 3 a however the attraction potential at 1 nm separation in absolute value is small 12 k b t where k b is the boltzmann constant and t is the temperature in addition to theoretical calculations phase contrast optical microscopy and sem did not show any aggregation of the mp nor influence of the ha in their morphology fig 3b d these photographs support that the adsorption of ha on mp in 7 mm cacl2 was negligible and agree with the small energy interaction predicted by the debye huckel model the median particle size of mp measured with trps in the washed samples previously incubated with ha was not statistically different to the mp not incubated with ha therefore it can be assumed that the ha mp binding is negligible all the above results support that the change in size due to adsorption of the ha to mp is questionable however the washing procedure decreased the blockade rate to 100 counts per minute or less resulting in a decrease in the count rate about five times regarding the unwashed sample this decrease may be related to the entanglement of about 80 of mp in ha floccules remaining in the supernatant after vortexing so that these were lost during replacement of supernatant with the ha free electrolyte as a result a number of mp linked to ha may have been removed which could lead to some exclusion of mp ha aggregates in the washing procedure dls measurements performed on all ha and the mp ha mixtures resulted in significant errors in the autocorrelation function fit 0 5 and the polydispersity index 1 therefore the particle size estimations in mp ha mixtures reported by the dls apparatus were not reliable this confirms that the presence of dissolved dom is insidious in the determination of size and counting of mp by different methods including the trps and supports the convenience of dom removal before measurements sujathan et al 2017 3 3 influence of the presence of ha on the particle size estimation with trps the influence of ha on the resistive pulses was analyzed by representing the distribution of cloud points of the blockade magnitude versus its duration scatterplots for all the incubation times and ha concentrations can be examined in fig 4 in this figure we used the full width at half maximum duration of the waveform fwhm i e the duration of the blockade at the half maximum height in order to get a reduction of the influence of the noise in the baseline incubation time and ha increased the dispersion of the cloud of points towards higher blockade magnitudes note the decrease in the particle counts per time i e the blockade rate with the incubation time analysis of waveforms of ha mp mixtures by fgmm em clustering brings three different types fig 5 the first type fig 5a is the regular waveforms around the 85 of the blockades these are similar to the waveforms measured in the absence of ha the second is the anomalous waveforms that are 4 fig 5b and cannot be used in the blockade size measurements and finally some large waveforms about 11 fig 5c appear after incubation times larger than 0 25h we hypothesized that these large waveforms could be related to the presence of flocculated humic acids in the measuring channel at the same time as the microspheres the shape of the large waveforms is indistinguishable from the regular ones except for their size therefore identification of the alterations induced by the ha based only in the analysis of the waveform shape can be a difficult task fig 6a shows that the mean particle size increased linearly with incubation time and the concentration of humic acids the influence of ha can be observed in more detail in the histogram representing the empirical density of the normalized distribution of the particle size fig 7 the distributions are weighted by the total blockade counts in each measurement in such way that the area under the curve is the unity the reddish bars in the histogram indicate the increase in the apparent size with the ha concentration and occurs more clearly with the longest incubation times 16 and 40 h the black line indicates the difference between the density histogram of particle size distribution in the presence of ha minus the density distribution in the absence of ha this line shows that ha increases the frequencies in the extreme values the left tail of the distribution decreased with the incubation time independently of the ha concentration on the contrary the right tail increased with the ha concentration and incubation time if considering only the right tail of the histograms i e the sizes larger than 1000nm then the integral sum under the black line in the fig 7 has a linear relation with the ha with pearson s r 0 97 0 94 and 0 94 for incubation times of 0 25 16 and 40 h respectively fig 6a the slope of the line becomes steeper with the incubation time the increase in size with the addition of ha is not supported by the hypothesis of the surface coating of mp by the ha as was seen by sem images and the dlvo calculations then we hypothesize that the apparent increase in size may be caused by the presence of flocculated ha in the measuring channel not attached to the mp flocculated ha can also explain the linear increase in the noise of the baseline current through the measuring cell with the increasing ha concentrations fig 6b the noise increases from 5 61 0 06 na at 0 25 h to 6 19 0 25 na at 40 h fluctuations in the electric resistivity with increasing concentrations of ha support the hypothesis that incipient flocculation of ha disturbs the blockades the flocculated ha cause larger heterogeneities in the electric field than the dissolved ha when passing thorough of measuring channel in consequence we hypothesize that the higher ha concentration the higher the flocculation rate and the higher oscillations in the electric resistivity ha suspensions in 7 mm cacl2 formed floccules that reached near one millimeter in size after two days of incubation in a laboratory beaker we identified these clouds as ha floccules with phase contrast optical microscopy flocculation of the ha implies that size distribution of floccules shifts towards bigger sizes much larger than the range of the measuring channel used in the trps in addition the presence of large floccules in the measuring cell of the trps may preclude the mp enter into the measuring channel that can result in the decrease of particle counts as observed in the presence of ha however if mp coating by ha is negligible then what do these large sizes mean and why different sizes coexist we hypothesize that the aggregation dynamics of ha produces a suspension of ha floccules covering a large scale of sizes from few tens nanometers to millimeters this is typical of colloid aggregation dynamics then the smallest floccules crossing through the measuring channel cause small current blockades with peak values below the detection threshold therefore the smallest floccules only produce noise in the baseline current in the same way as reported by anderson et al 2015 on the contrary very few floccules can produce blockades of sufficient size that can account for false particles finally the largest floccules cannot enter the channel considering the above a fraction of the population of ha floccules with different sizes can contribute to increasing the noise in the baseline current also blockades corresponding to mp passing through the measuring channel are disrupted by accompanying small ha floccules we hypothesize that the blockade magnitude and duration in mp ha mixtures depends on the size and concentration of the floccules passing simultaneously with the mp through the channel it is not clear how the ha can disturb the electric field but hydrocolloids can deform upon passing the measuring channel pevarnik et al 2013 that deformation can bring waveforms with a different shape regarding the typical waveforms produced by denser mp polymers however waveforms in the presence of ha did not show significant differences in shape nor in the amplitude duration aspect ratio fig 5 the only significant difference is the size difference in amplitude and duration of the waveforms it is clear that ha do not produce alterations of the waveform shape as was reported by pevarnik et al pevarnik et al 2013 for deformable hydrocolloids the results of trps measurements of mp in the presence of ha depends on a complex assemblage of processes these include colloid aggregation dynamics and the distribution of the arrival times of ha floccules to the measuring channel in this study the quantitative effect on the apparent size induced by ha is analyzed by statistical clustering methods 3 4 distribution of particle populations the fgmm em clustering resulted in optimal kernel density functions that were in general fitted with a mixture of three gaussian components with different variances fig s1 in the supporting information in one case 0 25 h incubation and 6 mg l 1 ha the optimal fitting had four components kernel density functions give an overview of the changes in the particle size distribution induced by the incubation time and the concentration of the humic acids fig s2 in the supporting information fig 8 shows the clustering results of the particle size distribution formed by three significant clusters note that size in the cluster no 1 is in the range from 810 to 925 nm that is slightly smaller than the nominal particle size provided by the supplier the size of the particles in this cluster remained unchanged with the incubation time and the ha concentration that means that there is a significant population of mp whose size was not influenced by the ha the cluster no 2 groups the particles with a size in the range from 925 to 1095 nm and fits into the particle size reported by the manufacturer the distribution of clusters no 1 and no 2 hardly overlap finally cluster no 3 groups the particles with sizes larger than the nominal particle size 1095nm the above analysis suggests that the fgmm em clustering separates different populations of the mp in the presence of ha and cacl2 clustering classification was used to analyze the changes in their population distribution in function of the incubation time and the ha fig 9 shows that populations in the cluster no 1 constitute less than the half of the trps counts this cluster does not show a clear relation with the ha or with the incubation time it shows a significant decrease in population with the ha in the range 2 6 mg l 1 at 40 h incubation that can be related to the shift to larger blockades with time a further increase in size causes particles to fall into the cluster no 3 cluster no 2 encompassed the higher number of counts at short times i e less than half of population fraction at 0 25 h incubation with a significant decrease at bigger ha 8 mg l 1 at larger times the population decreased significantly in the range of ha 2 8 mg l 1 changes in the particle populations in the cluster no 2 do not have significant correspondence with the variations in the cluster no 1 populations in the cluster no 3 varied in an opposite way as in the cluster no 2 the fig 9 also shows an apparent increase in the population fraction with the ha and the incubation time this increase is compensated by a decrease in the particle counts in the cluster no 2 at 2 mg l 1 ha the population reached the minimum 0 12 and 0 15 these apparent sizes correspond to the largest sizes namely 1300 nm at 16 h and 1462 nm at 40 h doubling in diameter the nominal size of the mp used in this study to summarize fgmm em clustering method used to analyze the size distribution of mp obtained with trps can resolve different components without loss of information as indicated by the bayesian information criterium cluster no 1 in fig 9 covers the fraction of particles about 30 50 population that were not influenced by the presence of ha the cluster no 2 indicates an increase in the particle size associated with the concentration of ha and incubation time the coexistence of different sizes and the slow growth rate support that the ha binding to mp is negligible accordingly the small electrostatic interactions avena and koopal 1999 also the double layer interaction table 4 shows a low repulsion barrier so that the attraction force is small and the range of electrostatic attraction is short 20nm 4 conclusion we presented a study on the feasibility of the application of trps as a candidate method for direct counting and particle by particle size measurement of mp in surface waters and groundwater we evaluated the influence of the humic acids on the trps measurement with ionic strength and ph typical of aquatic environments the presence of humic acids at concentrations higher than 4 mg l 1 alters the measurements as follows i increases the noise of the current baseline regarding the ha free electrolyte which hinders the blockade detection and measurement ii decreases the count rate causing an underestimation of the particle concentrations iii increases the blockade magnitude which leads to an overestimation in the size measurements interference of dom needs to be solved for accurate measurement of concentration and size of mp with trps we suggest a procedure of classification of blockades using the unsupervised fgmm em clustering method this method can help to identify the dom effects on the size measurement and can be used to make corrections of these effects without chemical treatment of samples the trps method can be used to improve current knowledge of the behavior of mp and other particulate micro contaminants in surface waters and groundwater

1633,comparative analysis was performed of changing groundwater quality over ten years 2006 2016 by source apportionment and spatial distribution characteristics this shallow groundwater in a typical riverside groundwater resource area was studied using principal component analysis pca and factor analysis fa coupled with the absolute principal component score multiple linear regression apcs mlr receptor model the relationship among land use types hydro chemical composition and evolution of the quality of groundwater from natural and anthropogenic sources was demonstrated the results showed that water rock interaction agricultural fertilizer and domestic and industrial wastewater were responsible for the evolution of contamination in the groundwater the major potential pollution sources that had significant effect on groundwater quality variables were categorized into three groups heavy metals iron manganese nutrients ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrates and organic pollution chemical oxygen demand the apcs mlr model considered the average contribution of each different potential pollution source to these categories separately the potential pollution sources in the groundwater presented an obvious spatial distribution with an area of high concentration distributed mainly in the western and northwestern areas downstream from the songhua river the variation of land use type and evolution of the spatial distribution of the pollution sources in the groundwater showed good consistency eventually pca fa coupled with apcs mlr became a versatile tool for comprehensive source apportionment of groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater source apportionment evolution process apcs mlr principal component analysis factor analysis 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most valuable natural resources for supporting life economic development and ecological diversity aiuppa et al 2003 li et al 2016 however increasing population and severe human disturbance has increased the demand for groundwater which has resulted in great urgency for protecting groundwater environments moya et al 2015 jiang et al 2009 overexploitation coupled with groundwater pollution has threatened the security of the drinking water supply regional groundwater quality is primarily controlled by natural processes such as groundwater flow recharge and water rock interaction however it is also increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities including agricultural production industrial growth and urbanization güler et al 2012 qin et al 2013 el et al 2017 therefore groundwater quality is usually characterized by significant spatio temporal variability baily et al 2011 to demonstrate the spatio temporal relationship between pollution and groundwater quality source apportionment is used to understand the principal pollution components and interaction process the results have significant meaning for developing effective groundwater pollution control at present the analysis of groundwater pollution sources is mainly focused on particular single sources such as fluoride lü et al 2016 nitrate savard et al 2010 ioannis 2016 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs shao et al 2014 and trace toxic elements kumar et al 2016 mendoza et al 2016 however comprehensive source apportionment is more commonly applied for surface water singh et al 2004 shrestha et al 2007 helena et al 2000 huang et al 2010 juahir et al 2011 su et al 2011 muangthong and shrestha 2015 duan et al 2016 and has rarely been applied in the field for source apportionment of groundwater liu et al 2003 kim et al 2005 how to identify and quantify the processes by which potential pollution sources affect groundwater quality and how to determine the quantitative contribution of particular pollution sources had gradually become a focus of recent research multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca factor analysis fa positive matrix factorization pmf and chemical mass balance cmb have often been used they are effective tools for classifying samples and identifying pollution sources by drawing meaningful information from large datasets gu et al 2012 masoud et al 2016 guo et al 2017 kringel et al 2016 pca fa was a dimension reduction technique not requiring a priori knowledge of the number of sources or their composition it has been used effectively to evaluate the changing condition of water quality furthermore based on use of the absolute principal component score apcs and multiple linear regression mlr the apcs mlr receptor model has been used to determine the quantitative pollution contribution of identified sources haji et al 2017 this could provide a clearer understanding of natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the hydro chemical processes in groundwater mohammad et al 2016 compared with its applications in air and surface water the application of the apcs mlr model for quality characterization and classification of groundwater is an exploratory effort assessment of the contribution of all potential pollution sources to groundwater quality has become an essential requirement for the management of groundwater resources the main purpose of this study was to reveal the complete evolutionary process of groundwater quality in the limin groundwater resource area in harbin city heilongjiang province northeastern china during the interval 2006 2016 pca fa and apcs mlr were used to identify potential pollution sources and their spatial distribution from 2006 to 2016 and to evaluate the contribution of individual potential pollution sources another purpose was to try to reveal the relationship between land use type and the evolution of quality of groundwater from natural and anthropogenic sources the aim was to provide a scientific basis for decisions to prevent and control groundwater pollution and to improve the development and utilization of groundwater resources in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the limin development zone is located in harbin city in northeastern china its boundary was close to the north bank of the songhua river and downstream of the hulan river 45 49 to 46 25 n and 126 11 to 127 19 e shown in fig 1 in the selected study area the annual mean temperature was 3 5 c and the annual average rainfall was 505 4 mm with annual evaporation of 1411 19 mm most of the study area is in the songhua river flood plain which is mostly covered by quaternary sediments about 45 53 m thick the two main aquifers which are of the sand gravel type in the holocene series of the lower pleistocene provide good storage and transportation space for groundwater groundwater is mainly recharged by vertical infiltration from precipitation and agricultural irrigation and by lateral flow from the songhua and hulan rivers during wet seasons and floods concentrated extraction of groundwater for living agricultural irrigation and industrial production is the main groundwater discharge 2 2 sample selection all of the water samples were collected from shallow groundwater pore phreatic water and were sampled at a pre determined depth of 2 6 m below the water table most of the sample points were from pore phreatic water coarse sand gravel aquifer in riverbank that runs along the songhua and hulan rivers the thickness of the aquifer is about 20 40 m and the hydraulic conductivity is about 36 55 m d there were 48 and 28 groundwater sample points in 2006 and 2016 respectively and these provided a suitable sampling of the spatial distribution in the region for the two sampling periods 2006 and 2016 17 groundwater quality parameters were selected to characterize the overall groundwater pollution in the study area 2 3 dataset preparation after consideration of the local hydro chemical properties and hydrogeological conditions 17 groundwater quality parameters were selected these included potassium k sodium na calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulfates so4 2 nitrates no3 nitrites no2 iron fe2 manganese mn2 fluorine f phosphate hpo4 2 chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved solid tds and total hardness th based on the continuity of the sampling detected results pca fa analysis was used to distinguish the contribution of different natural and human pollutants to the groundwater quality in the limin groundwater source area the basic statistics of the groundwater quality parameters in the study area are summarized in table 1 the pre treatment method employed for the data and its suitability for the data is critical for the application of pca to environmental datasets in this study the pre treatment methods such as elimination of non informative variables treatment of missing data values and detection and treatment of outliers were performed before the pca fa analysis 2 4 methods 2 4 1 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca is mathematical tools which can reduce the variable dimension description for understanding and analyze the dataset easily pca is a multivariate statistical analysis method that depend on the orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables called principal components pcs the principal component can be expressed as 1 x 1 11 f 1 12 f 2 1 m f m x 2 21 f 1 22 f 2 2 m f m x n n 1 f 1 n 1 f 2 nm f m 2 x af e a ij n m where x n is the component score a is the component loading fis the measured value of variable nis the component number m is the total number of variables in pca the principal component of eigenvalue is greater than unity which are generally considered with most of the variability of the original dataset 2 4 2 factor analysis fa is similar to the principal component analysis on the calculation principle it is an internal analysis using lower number of unobserved variables called factors to explain more complex relationships in the observed variables since the original loadings are usually rotated it means that each variable has very high factor loading as high as 1 on one of the pcs and very low factor loading as low as 0 on the other pcs in this study pca fa was performed on the normalized variables in 2006 and 2016 the fa can be expressed as 3 z ij f 1 f 1 i f 2 f 12 f 3 f 13 fm f 1 m e fi where x n is the component score a is the component loading f is the factor score e is the residual term accounting for errors or other source of variation i is the sample number and m is the total number of variables the important precondition of pca and fa was that the original variables should have strong correlation kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s test were used to test the correlation between correlation coefficient and partial correlation coefficients of the original variables generally the kmo statistic varies between 0 and 1 kaiser 1974 recommended accepting values that was 0 5 was acceptable furthermore values between 0 5 and 0 7 were mediocre values between 0 7 and 0 8 were good values between 0 8 and 0 9 were great and values above 0 9 were superb bartlett test of sphericity was used to test whether the variables were independent if the statistical measurement of the bartlett test was large and the associated probability value was less than the specified level the dataset was suitable for the factor analysis if the correlation coefficient matrix was not be a unit matrix it meant that it was not suitable for the factor analysis conversely 2 4 3 source apportionment on apcs mlr the receptor model used for source apportionment of groundwater employed a combination of two statistical techniques multiple linear regression mlr and absolute principal component scores apcs the model took the absolute factor scores as independent variables and the concentrations of pollutants were treated as dependent variables this was done to convert the apcs analysis factor score for the contribution of each pollution source according to the regression index provided by the apcs mlr this provided a quantitative characterization of the contribution of each pollution source to the overall pollution at present this method is used in water quality evaluation to calculate the contribution of pollution factors to each evaluation parameters a detailed description of the receptor model was given by thurston and spengler 1985 to determine the sharing rate of particle sources in boston the source contributions to a pollutant concentration cj can be calculated using the following multiple linear regression 4 c j r 0 j k 1 n r jk apcs k where r 0 j is a constant term of multiple regressions for pollutant j r jk is coefficient of multiple regression of the source k for pollutant j and apcs k is the scaled value of the rotated factor k for the considered sample the combined term r jk apcs k represent the contribution of source k to c j the quantitative contribution from each identified source to individual groundwater quality parameters was calculated using the original measured values to verify the accuracy of the calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 data structure determination using pca and fa the kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were applied to examine the suitability of the data for pca fa the calculation results for 2006 and 2016 were shown in table 2 according to the k s tests all variables were log normally distributed with a confidence of 95 or higher the kmo value for the dataset was 0 72 and 0 66 in 2006 and 2016 respectively similarly bartlett s test of sphericity values were 2049 19 and 1537 35 with an inspection of p values close to zero p 0 05 all these results indicated that there might be a statistically significant interrelationship between variables which rendered the pca fa analysis valid for fa the initially extracted communalities were calculated in order to select appropriate indices the higher the communality the more useful the information was in the evaluation of the indices normalized data matrices were used for the pca fa analyses according to the kaiser standard the principle of eigenvalues being 1 was used to determine the number of principal components here the eigenvalue is a sum of the squared factor loadings for all factors of a given variable which is the communality of each factor to account for the observed value variance based on the kaiser rule the first five and four principal components were obtained with eigenvalue 1 in the 2006 and 2016 datasets this summed to 76 57 and 81 35 of the total variance in the 2006 and 2016 groundwater quality datasets respectively see tables 3 and 4 the variance factor rotation loading matrix of the selected groundwater quality parameters in 2006 and 2016 were presented in table 5 and factor loadings 0 75 0 50 0 75 and 0 30 0 50 were considered strong moderate and weak respectively 3 1 1 identification of potential pollution sources and spatial distribution characteristics in 2006 in 2006 the first varifactor vf1 was the first factor influencing the groundwater quality of the study area and accounted for 36 41 of the total variance its eigenvalue was 7 65 and it had strong and positive loadings on na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 th and tds it showed moderately positive loading on k and weak positive loading on cod and no2 component loading for each index in the five selected components after varimax rotation are shown graphically in fig 2 each factor score of the selected monitoring points was obtained using spss 20 0 the relationship between the potential pollution sources and geographic location called the spatial distribution was described using the kriging interpolation calculation with arcgis 9 3 software shown in fig 3 the higher the score is the more serious the pollution groundwater pollution sources varied from natural sources such as weathering of common rocks mineral and soils salt deposits and brines to anthropogenic sources such as landfill wastewater water treatment and agriculture raju et al 2011 nearly half of the physico chemical parameters were contained in vf1 table 4 and the high concentration areas factor score 0 75 were mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the songhua river fig 3 the study area was located in a quaternary loose layer a gravel layer with a layer of muddy loam and clay in the middle the runoff condition was good and leaching effect was strong water exploitation along the riverside in the songhua river changed the hydraulic gradient and enhanced water rock interaction industrial effluent and domestic sewage infiltration made dissolved rock components such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 and cl migrate and enrich easily furthermore the lateral flow from the songhua river was an important recharge source and controlled the groundwater chemistry to a certain degree in the high score area of vf1 therefore vf1 was identified as point source pollution resulting from water rock interaction industrial and domestic sewage discharging the second varifactor vf2 accounting for 15 61 of the total variance had strong and positive loadings on fe2 and mn2 and weak positive loading on cod it was seen from the spatial distribution of five potential pollution components fig 3 that the parts along the hulan river in the northeastern area especially in songbei district and the middle and lower reaches of the songhua river had higher scores in these areas the concentration of iron and manganese was high in general the original geological environment in the region was the quaternary loose aquifer group the holocene series and pleistocene series contained the main aquifers they had a mixed layer with muddy loam and clay in the middle along with abundant iron manganese nodules iron and manganese are both variable valence elements in black soil the abundant organic matter and reducing environment in groundwater provided good conditions for iron and manganese reduction reactions with the specific reactions being as follows berbenni et al 2000 fe oh 3 3h e fe 2 3h 2 o ch 2 o fe 2 o 3 2h 2fe 2 co 2 2h 2 o ch 2 o 2mno 2 3h 2mn 2 hco 3 2h 2 o ch 2 o fe oh 3 7h 4fe 2 hco 3 10 h 2 o moreover infiltration of water from anthropogenic sources such as industrial wastewater and domestic sewage could accelerate the dissolution of the iron and manganese minerals therefore the high concentration of iron and manganese was mainly affected by the special environmental geochemistry and chemical composition of the aquifer which could be interpreted as original geological environment pollution based on the water rock interaction and infiltration of industrial and domestic wastewater the third varifactor vf3 accounting for 9 90 of the total variance had strong and positive loading on no3 and no2 moderately positive loading on nh4 n weak positive loading on ca2 and moderate negative loading on hco3 according to statistics the amount of nitrogenous fertilizers and compound fertilizers used for agriculture was 21 985 t and 18 319 t respectively on average 231 kg fertilizer per hectare was used in 2005 and this indicated that excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizer might be one important source of no3 no2 and nh4 n in the regional groundwater moreover the high component score areas 0 5 were mostly located in areas with high density building sites fig 3 indicating that underground pipeline leakage might accidently have caused enrichment of various nitrogen contaminants in addition the residential garbage contained large amounts of nitrogenous organic matter and a large number of microorganisms which entered groundwater aquifers by rain filtration therefore the third varifactor represented non point source pollution of nitrogen resulting from fertilizers application domestic sewage leakage and rain water dripping and filtration the fourth varifactor vf4 accounted for 9 01 of the total variance and had an eigenvalue of 1 89 it had strong positive loading on f weak positive loading on no2 and weak negative loading on cod the high concentration of f were mostly in the western northwestern and southwestern areas fluorine is distributed widely in nature mainly in the forms of minerals such as fluorite caf2 cryolite na3 alf6 and apatite ca5 po4 3f agorhom et al 2015 fluorine rich rocks and deposits were key sources of enrichment in fluorinated soil and groundwater the study area was located in the alluvial and flood fan of the songhua river where the fluorine rich medium of quaternary loose deposits sand and clay could release f by dissolution and hydration during the process of lateral recharge from river to groundwater moreover the emission of hydrogen fluorine compounds and industrial atmospheric dust containing fluorine has led to a certain degree of increase of fluorine in rainfall and wastewater discharge in recent years therefore this factor might be termed typical fluoride pollution based on the dissolution of fluorine mineral and rainfall infiltration with fluorine finally the fifth varifactor vf5 accounting for 5 63 of the total variance in the datasets had an eigenvalue of 1 18 and was highly correlated only with hpo4 2 it appeared from the statistical analysis that pipeline leakage or accidental wastewater discharge had directly entered the groundwater aquifer and had contained dissolved total phosphate orthophosphate and dissolved orthophosphate the high factor score area 0 90 was in the central business district with the main pollution sources in the area being such as hotels and public baths fig 3 in addition the harbin bio pharmaceutical factory and two garbage stations were also in the area the presence of much garbage and industrial waste could cause phosphate pollutants to infiltrate the aquifer and cause phosphorus pollution in the groundwater the areas with high factor scores were in the western and southeastern areas where regional phosphorus fertilizer from agricultural land caused phosphorous infiltration of the unconfined aquifer therefore the fifth factor could be regarded as non point source pollution of phosphorus based on fertilizer infiltration domestic and industrial wastewater emission 3 1 2 identification of potential pollution sources and spatial distribution characteristics in 2016 similar methods for principal component identification were used for the groundwater quality analysis in 2016 the principal component loading for each parameter in the four selected components after varimax rotation are shown graphically in fig 4 and the spatial distribution of four principal pollution sources was shown in fig 5 the first varifactor vf1 accounting for 40 71 of the total variance had strong and positive loading on na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 th and tds fig 4 this was analogous to the first factor in 2006 and similar sources of pollution could be accounted for with the first factor in 2016 the synthesis factor for the quality of the groundwater environment was the positive loading on th and tds 0 93 which showed that the basic ion concentration was increasing year by year the spatial distribution showed that the areas with factor score 0 80 had increased significantly compared to 2006 mostly in the limin groundwater source and songbei district on the north bank of the songhua river figs 3 and 5 the area of factor scores of 0 35 0 80 were mainly distributed in the central area fig 5 population growth and rising living standards were increasing the demand for groundwater which led to overexploitation of the water supply for living and agricultural irrigation the water rock interaction accelerated mineral dissolution which enriched the concentration of soluble ions such as ca2 and mg2 and sharply increased the access of these ions to the aquifer in addition more industrial and domestic wastewater discharge might be another important source for increasing the area of vf1 high concentration from 2006 to 2016 therefore vf1 in 2016 was also interpreted as point source pollution based on water rock interaction industrial and domestic sewage discharging the second varifactor vf2 accounting for 21 31 of the total variance had strong and positive loadings on mn2 moderate positive loading on fe2 and f weak positive loading on cod and weak negative loading on nh4 n the importance and possible sources of these components were discussed previously due to the strong interactions between iron manganese and fluorine it revealed that both physicochemical and biological factors could be the main factors responsible for the high loading of these parameters on vf2 the spatial distribution of vf2 showed that high concentration area was in the center of limin district fig 5 the unique geochemical characteristics controlled by tectonic and river factors formed a reducing environment with sealing performance and enrichment of organic matter these provided good conditions for mineral dissolution and reaction including iron manganese and fluorine which increased their presence in the groundwater another important source was anthropogenic sources many factories such as steel manufacture and biological pharmaceuticals were located in the region industrial wastewater and solid wastes had influence on the concentration of iron manganese and fluorine therefore vf2 in 2016 still represented original geological environment pollution based on the water rock interaction and infiltration of industrial and domestic wastewater the third varifactor vf3 accounting for 12 32 of the total variance had strong and positive loading on nh4 n no3 and no2 with moderate or positive loading on hpo4 2 hco3 cod and so4 2 it was found from the correlation matrix in 2016 that mn2 was negatively correlated with nutrients which indicated competition between nutrients and manganese for dissolved oxygen fig 4 according to the spatial distribution characteristics of this factor the high concentration area of nitrogen was mainly concentrated in western limin district fig 5 the ammonia nitrogen pollutant was often found in landfill leachate and in waste products such as sewage liquid manure and other organic waste products among the numerous sources of ammonia nitrogen that released by decomposition of organic matter and fertilizer from agricultural applications was the major contributing source different types of agriculture in the western area generated non point source pollution that had a high percentage of nitrogen from pesticides and fertilizers therefore the third varifactor was called the non point source pollution of nitrogen based on agricultural irrigation and domestic sewage effluent finally the fourth varifactor vf4 which accounted for 7 02 of the total variance had positive loading only on cod this indicated approximately the total amount of organic matter in the groundwater the spatial distribution of vf4 showed that the areas with a high factor score 0 7 were mainly located in western limin district southwestern songbei district and in the parts of the northwest close to the hulan river fig 5 also located there was the harbin biological medicine factory with activities mainly related to drug production medical devices and functional foods and with a large amount of organic wastewater discharge furthermore there were also domestic garbage collection stations which contained organic matter and a large number of microorganisms the leachate from these went through the aeration zone and caused groundwater pollution to a certain degree therefore vf4 was representing organic pollution in groundwater 3 2 source apportionment using apcs mlr model after identifying possible pollution sources the contribution of each source to groundwater quality variables was apportioned using apcs mlr according to the results by thurston and spengler 1985 when n m 50 n represents the number of samples and m represents the number of pollutants for analysis a reliable pca fa result could be obtained the number of data samples in the present study met this requirement during the factor extraction process the principle of eigenvalue 1 was adopted to identify five and four primary factors in 2006 and 2016 respectively tables 6 and 7 as shown in these tables the r2 values of the studied parameters concentrations were 0 7 for both calculations using the receptor model and the actual observations this indicated that there was good consistency between the modeled and observed values and that the source apportionment results were reliable furthermore the ratio of the mean observed and estimated values of almost all the groundwater quality variables suggested goodness of the receptor model approach to the source apportionment of the study area groundwater in 2006 most variables were primarily influenced by point source pollution from water rock interaction and industrial and domestic sewage effluent vf1 representing the salt ions were k na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 tds and th of which the contributions were 61 24 70 31 74 35 73 84 70 45 67 85 71 21 72 87 and 80 36 respectively the contribution of the remaining groundwater quality parameters was between 1 01 no3 and 18 86 f the contribution from original geological metal pollution vf2 for different groundwater quality parameters ranged from 0 67 tds to 70 06 fe2 this was mainly embodied in metallic elements such as fe2 and mn2 of which the contribution was 63 17 and 66 54 respectively furthermore the contribution to f was 76 79 the sources of these latter three ions had good consistency the contribution of non point source pollution of nitrogen vf3 for different parameters accounted for between 3 37 ca2 and 78 06 no3 the contribution of nh4 n no3 and no2 was 69 04 78 06 and 71 21 respectively and the contribution of the remaining parameters was 15 it was found that the contribution of typical fluoride pollution vf4 to groundwater quality parameters in 2006 ranged from 0 49 na to 56 79 f it was also observed that the high percentage of ca2 35 24 was related to f the reversible reaction of caf2 gave it a dual control effect on f and ca2 the hpo4 2 factor vf5 was responsible for 56 45 hpo4 2 and 29 53 cod respectively this factor also accounted for 3 58 8 83 of nitrogen concentration generally the average contributions indicated that point source pollution vf1 original geological metal pollution vf2 non point source pollution of nitrogen vf3 typical fluoride pollution vf4 and non point source pollution of phosphorus vf5 for the different parameters concentrations of groundwater quality in 2006 were 36 41 15 61 9 90 9 01 and 5 63 respectively fig 7 in the study area in 2016 most variables were primarily influenced by point source pollution from water rock interaction and industrial and domestic sewage effluent vf1 representing the salt ions including na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl th and tds their contributions were 75 51 77 42 63 84 68 35 57 85 75 63 and 71 42 respectively the other groundwater quality parameters were from 1 35 cod to 41 38 mn furthermore th had a high percentage 75 63 and the enrichment of ca2 and mg2 was related to increase of the th concentration the contribution of original geological environment pollution vf2 to the different groundwater quality parameters ranged from 0 81 so4 2 to 80 11 mn2 the contribution for the three major parameters was fe2 78 65 mn2 80 11 and f 73 59 while the contribution of the remaining indicators was 20 the contribution of non point source pollution of nitrogen vf3 to different quality parameters was between 1 17 ca2 and 78 34 no3 the contributions to nh4 n no3 and no2 were all 70 and to potassium was 60 81 this indicated the same source as for the nitrogen series parameters generally the nitrogen element transformation was closely related to the cod and the contribution of vf3 to cod was 45 62 it was found that the contribution of organic pollution vf4 to groundwater quality parameters accounted for between 0 03 fe2 and 74 60 cod this indicated that the highest percentage of cod resulted from this source all in all the average contributions indicated that point source pollution vf1 primary geological environment pollution vf2 non point source pollution of nitrogen vf3 and organic pollution vf4 contributions to the different groundwater quality parameters were 40 71 21 31 12 32 and 7 02 respectively in 2016 fig 6 in addition the major pollution variables that exceeded the standard could be categorized into three groups heavy metals fe2 mn2 nitrogen nh4 n no3 and no2 and organic pollution cod the calculated average contribution of the different potential pollution sources to heavy metals nutrients and organic pollution in 2006 and 2016 based on tables 5 and 6 are presented in a pie chart fig 7 the results showed that based on the special environmental geochemistry vf2 the contribution of original geological environment pollution was 68 30 and 74 81 in 2006 and 2016 respectively the point source pollution vf1 discharged made a contribution of 14 94 which included the major sources of heavy metals such as iron and manganese accordingly non point source of nitrogen vf3 was the major source of nitrogen in groundwater 70 10 contribution in 2006 and 76 77 contribution in 2016 organic pollution vf4 with 60 81 contribution and non point source nitrogen vf3 with 19 61 contribution in 2016 were the major sources of chemical oxygen demand in groundwater quality in addition non point source phosphate pollution vf5 made a 29 53 contribution and typical fluorine enrichment pollution vf4 made a 20 74 contribution in 2006 3 3 analysis of groundwater quality evolution from 2006 to 2016 3 3 1 evolution analysis for groundwater quality and groundwater chemistry type to analyze the causes of groundwater evolution the third class groundwater quality of the groundwater quality standard gb t14848 93 was used to evaluate the overall condition of the groundwater quality a column graph indicating conditions that exceeded the standard rate was drawn by means of statistical analysis for the groundwater quality in the study area fig 8 the results showed that the main pollution parameters in the study area were iron manganese and ammonia nitrogen manganese and ammonia nitrogen both exceeded the standard 80 and iron was close to 80 in 2006 in 2016 the over standard level for iron and manganese was slightly lower and the rate of ammonia nitrogen increased compared with 2006 this indicated increasing contamination by ammonia nitrogen in 2016 the over standard rate of nitrites and nitrates was below 20 and the trend of increase was marked compared with 2006 in addition the chemical oxygen demand deriving from sewage and industrial wastewater increased to above 10 this indicated that groundwater organic pollution was becoming more serious phreatic water is the main type of groundwater resource in the study area and factors such as climate hydrological geography and anthropogenic activities have great influence on it the chemical species in the groundwater changed constantly in terms of their spatial distribution and principal pollution components in relation to the continuous development of industry and agriculture taking the major groundwater ions as variables a piper diagram analysis was done for the selected water samples the results are shown in a piper hydrochemistry diagram for 2006 and 2016 fig 9 the comparison between groundwater quality dataset in the study area at the initial stage of urbanization 2006 and after rapid development through urbanization 2016 highlighted some differences between them fig 9 the groundwater samples fell into the lower left side of the cationic triangle with the highest amount of sodium and calcium occupying second place the water sample points were centered in the middle and left with the highest amount of bicarbonate chloride took second place in the anionic triangle in 2006 the principal hydrochemistry types in 2006 were ca na hco3 na ca hco3 and ca so4 cl in 2016 the principal hydrochemistry types were ca mg so4 na ca so4 cl ca so4 cl and na ca mg so4 this indicated that the chemistry of the shallow groundwater in the study area had changed and become more polluted since 2006 groundwater anions were mostly hco3 in 2006 but were predominantly so4 2 and cl in 2016 groundwater samples with high so4 2 and cl concentrations corresponded with cultivated land or low density building site areas where there were plenty of fertilizer e g ammonium sulfate residuals and some small factories discharging so4 2 respectively in addition lateral flow from the rivers might be another important source for high so4 2 content in the groundwater 3 3 2 analysis of the evolution of land use types in 2006 and 2016 land use type was not only the foundation of the ecosystem but also the most important indicator of anthropogenic activity for human geography systems with interaction between anthropogenic activity and the natural environment the degree of connection depended on the land use type and the density of human beings koh et al 2010 different types of land uses were not only related to social development but also to the evolution of groundwater quality social development during urbanization changed the structure of the urban surfaces the original groundwater system was adjusted so that industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation runoff and domestic sewage infiltrated the aquifer changing the circulation system of the groundwater it was decided to use the changes of land use type indicated in remote sensing data via the interpretation of harbin 2006 and 2016 to analyze the evolution of the groundwater quality the results showed that the land use type was developing including dry farmland area reduced by 10 69 building site area increased by 5 77 forestland area increased by 2 73 grassland area increased by 0 69 and the percentage of unexploited area decreased by 0 43 from 2006 to 2016 table 8 cultivated land was first for transfer amount and the amount of building site area transferred was 25 22 km2 this indicated internal causes for organic pollution in the groundwater to a certain extent land use types characterize human activity and the interaction between land use type and groundwater chemical composition could be measured spatially to reveal significant influences on groundwater from 2006 to 2016 fig 10 it was concluded that the main land use types were dry farmland forested land and building sites in the study area in 2006 and their percentages were 63 14 12 38 and 10 79 respectively in 2016 dry fields building site areas and forested land were the main land use types 52 45 16 56 and 15 11 respectively this revealed that the area of dry fields had been reduced by 10 69 and the building site area increased by 25 22 km2 during the interval from 2006 to 2016 table 8 comparative analysis of the spatial distribution of vf1 and the land use type in 2006 and 2016 revealed that the area of high factor scores 0 80 based on water rock interaction industrial effluent and domestic sewage discharge increased significantly compared by 2016 this change was mostly in the limin groundwater source and songbei district on the north bank of the songhua river this was consistent with the growth of building in the site area the increase of population inevitably leads to increasing demand for groundwater and building site area the resulting groundwater overexploitation changed the oxidation reduction conditions and strengthened interactions between the mineral dissolution and groundwater moreover sewage emissions had increased significantly which also led to increased amounts of basic ions entering the groundwater the high concentration of vf2 was generally distributed in the center of the study area and the high concentration of iron and manganese reflected the expansion of the building site areas the minerals that included iron manganese and fluorine leached in response to the acid and alkali solubility effects caused by discharge of industrial wastewater and hydrodynamic filtration by concentrated mining of the groundwater sources this resulted in enrichment of iron manganese and fluorine in the protogenic geological environment the high concentration of nitrogen vf3 was located on agricultural land in western areas and the reduction of agricultural land e g dry farmland also agreed with decrease in the area of non point nutrients this reflected the characteristic nitrogen pollution in the study area during 2006 2016 the excessive fertilizer and pesticides caused serious nitrogen pollution in the groundwater in addition fluorine and phosphate contamination was concentrated in the agricultural and building areas in the western and southwestern areas in 2006 the space distribution of organic pollution cod was significantly related to the distribution of agricultural cultivation and building site area which were characterized by organic pollutants in the groundwater therefore the pollution resulted from anthropogenic factors due to agriculture irrigation and discharge of domestic and industrial wastewater the major new sources of groundwater contamination it could be concluded that the groundwater potential pollution sources presented an obvious spatial distribution the high concentration areas were mainly distributed in the western and northwestern areas especially downstream of the songhua river the land use types had great influence on the spatial distribution of potential pollution sources and there was good consistency between the change of land use types and the spatial distribution of potential pollution sources of groundwater from 2006 to 2016 4 conclusions pca and fa along with the apcs mlr receptor model were used to assess the potential pollution sources of groundwater and to apportion the contributions of different pollution sources to each groundwater quality parameters from 2006 to 2016 in the limin groundwater source area in harbin northeastern china the change of groundwater chemistry type and the evolution of land use types from 2006 to 2016 were analyzed to reveal the causes for the changing groundwater quality five and four potential pollution sources were identified in 2006 and 2016 respectively the major potential pollution sources which had significant effect on groundwater quality variables could be categorized into three groups heavy metals iron manganese nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrates and organic pollution chemical oxygen demand results showed that water rock interaction agricultural fertilizer pollution and emission of domestic and industrial wastewater were most responsible for the evolution of groundwater contamination it was concluded that the groundwater potential pollution sources presented an obvious spatial distribution and that the high concentration areas were mainly distributed in the western and northwestern areas especially downstream of the songhua river the land use types had great influence on the spatial distribution of potential pollution sources and there was good consistency between the change of land use types and the spatial distribution of potential pollution sources of groundwater from 2006 to 2016 this study showed the feasibility and reliability of the combined use of these multivariate statistical techniques to explore the evolution of groundwater quality pca coupled with apcs mlr has become a versatile tool for pollution source identification and source apportionment

1633,comparative analysis was performed of changing groundwater quality over ten years 2006 2016 by source apportionment and spatial distribution characteristics this shallow groundwater in a typical riverside groundwater resource area was studied using principal component analysis pca and factor analysis fa coupled with the absolute principal component score multiple linear regression apcs mlr receptor model the relationship among land use types hydro chemical composition and evolution of the quality of groundwater from natural and anthropogenic sources was demonstrated the results showed that water rock interaction agricultural fertilizer and domestic and industrial wastewater were responsible for the evolution of contamination in the groundwater the major potential pollution sources that had significant effect on groundwater quality variables were categorized into three groups heavy metals iron manganese nutrients ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrates and organic pollution chemical oxygen demand the apcs mlr model considered the average contribution of each different potential pollution source to these categories separately the potential pollution sources in the groundwater presented an obvious spatial distribution with an area of high concentration distributed mainly in the western and northwestern areas downstream from the songhua river the variation of land use type and evolution of the spatial distribution of the pollution sources in the groundwater showed good consistency eventually pca fa coupled with apcs mlr became a versatile tool for comprehensive source apportionment of groundwater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater source apportionment evolution process apcs mlr principal component analysis factor analysis 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most valuable natural resources for supporting life economic development and ecological diversity aiuppa et al 2003 li et al 2016 however increasing population and severe human disturbance has increased the demand for groundwater which has resulted in great urgency for protecting groundwater environments moya et al 2015 jiang et al 2009 overexploitation coupled with groundwater pollution has threatened the security of the drinking water supply regional groundwater quality is primarily controlled by natural processes such as groundwater flow recharge and water rock interaction however it is also increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities including agricultural production industrial growth and urbanization güler et al 2012 qin et al 2013 el et al 2017 therefore groundwater quality is usually characterized by significant spatio temporal variability baily et al 2011 to demonstrate the spatio temporal relationship between pollution and groundwater quality source apportionment is used to understand the principal pollution components and interaction process the results have significant meaning for developing effective groundwater pollution control at present the analysis of groundwater pollution sources is mainly focused on particular single sources such as fluoride lü et al 2016 nitrate savard et al 2010 ioannis 2016 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs shao et al 2014 and trace toxic elements kumar et al 2016 mendoza et al 2016 however comprehensive source apportionment is more commonly applied for surface water singh et al 2004 shrestha et al 2007 helena et al 2000 huang et al 2010 juahir et al 2011 su et al 2011 muangthong and shrestha 2015 duan et al 2016 and has rarely been applied in the field for source apportionment of groundwater liu et al 2003 kim et al 2005 how to identify and quantify the processes by which potential pollution sources affect groundwater quality and how to determine the quantitative contribution of particular pollution sources had gradually become a focus of recent research multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis pca factor analysis fa positive matrix factorization pmf and chemical mass balance cmb have often been used they are effective tools for classifying samples and identifying pollution sources by drawing meaningful information from large datasets gu et al 2012 masoud et al 2016 guo et al 2017 kringel et al 2016 pca fa was a dimension reduction technique not requiring a priori knowledge of the number of sources or their composition it has been used effectively to evaluate the changing condition of water quality furthermore based on use of the absolute principal component score apcs and multiple linear regression mlr the apcs mlr receptor model has been used to determine the quantitative pollution contribution of identified sources haji et al 2017 this could provide a clearer understanding of natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the hydro chemical processes in groundwater mohammad et al 2016 compared with its applications in air and surface water the application of the apcs mlr model for quality characterization and classification of groundwater is an exploratory effort assessment of the contribution of all potential pollution sources to groundwater quality has become an essential requirement for the management of groundwater resources the main purpose of this study was to reveal the complete evolutionary process of groundwater quality in the limin groundwater resource area in harbin city heilongjiang province northeastern china during the interval 2006 2016 pca fa and apcs mlr were used to identify potential pollution sources and their spatial distribution from 2006 to 2016 and to evaluate the contribution of individual potential pollution sources another purpose was to try to reveal the relationship between land use type and the evolution of quality of groundwater from natural and anthropogenic sources the aim was to provide a scientific basis for decisions to prevent and control groundwater pollution and to improve the development and utilization of groundwater resources in the region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the limin development zone is located in harbin city in northeastern china its boundary was close to the north bank of the songhua river and downstream of the hulan river 45 49 to 46 25 n and 126 11 to 127 19 e shown in fig 1 in the selected study area the annual mean temperature was 3 5 c and the annual average rainfall was 505 4 mm with annual evaporation of 1411 19 mm most of the study area is in the songhua river flood plain which is mostly covered by quaternary sediments about 45 53 m thick the two main aquifers which are of the sand gravel type in the holocene series of the lower pleistocene provide good storage and transportation space for groundwater groundwater is mainly recharged by vertical infiltration from precipitation and agricultural irrigation and by lateral flow from the songhua and hulan rivers during wet seasons and floods concentrated extraction of groundwater for living agricultural irrigation and industrial production is the main groundwater discharge 2 2 sample selection all of the water samples were collected from shallow groundwater pore phreatic water and were sampled at a pre determined depth of 2 6 m below the water table most of the sample points were from pore phreatic water coarse sand gravel aquifer in riverbank that runs along the songhua and hulan rivers the thickness of the aquifer is about 20 40 m and the hydraulic conductivity is about 36 55 m d there were 48 and 28 groundwater sample points in 2006 and 2016 respectively and these provided a suitable sampling of the spatial distribution in the region for the two sampling periods 2006 and 2016 17 groundwater quality parameters were selected to characterize the overall groundwater pollution in the study area 2 3 dataset preparation after consideration of the local hydro chemical properties and hydrogeological conditions 17 groundwater quality parameters were selected these included potassium k sodium na calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulfates so4 2 nitrates no3 nitrites no2 iron fe2 manganese mn2 fluorine f phosphate hpo4 2 chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved solid tds and total hardness th based on the continuity of the sampling detected results pca fa analysis was used to distinguish the contribution of different natural and human pollutants to the groundwater quality in the limin groundwater source area the basic statistics of the groundwater quality parameters in the study area are summarized in table 1 the pre treatment method employed for the data and its suitability for the data is critical for the application of pca to environmental datasets in this study the pre treatment methods such as elimination of non informative variables treatment of missing data values and detection and treatment of outliers were performed before the pca fa analysis 2 4 methods 2 4 1 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca is mathematical tools which can reduce the variable dimension description for understanding and analyze the dataset easily pca is a multivariate statistical analysis method that depend on the orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables called principal components pcs the principal component can be expressed as 1 x 1 11 f 1 12 f 2 1 m f m x 2 21 f 1 22 f 2 2 m f m x n n 1 f 1 n 1 f 2 nm f m 2 x af e a ij n m where x n is the component score a is the component loading fis the measured value of variable nis the component number m is the total number of variables in pca the principal component of eigenvalue is greater than unity which are generally considered with most of the variability of the original dataset 2 4 2 factor analysis fa is similar to the principal component analysis on the calculation principle it is an internal analysis using lower number of unobserved variables called factors to explain more complex relationships in the observed variables since the original loadings are usually rotated it means that each variable has very high factor loading as high as 1 on one of the pcs and very low factor loading as low as 0 on the other pcs in this study pca fa was performed on the normalized variables in 2006 and 2016 the fa can be expressed as 3 z ij f 1 f 1 i f 2 f 12 f 3 f 13 fm f 1 m e fi where x n is the component score a is the component loading f is the factor score e is the residual term accounting for errors or other source of variation i is the sample number and m is the total number of variables the important precondition of pca and fa was that the original variables should have strong correlation kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s test were used to test the correlation between correlation coefficient and partial correlation coefficients of the original variables generally the kmo statistic varies between 0 and 1 kaiser 1974 recommended accepting values that was 0 5 was acceptable furthermore values between 0 5 and 0 7 were mediocre values between 0 7 and 0 8 were good values between 0 8 and 0 9 were great and values above 0 9 were superb bartlett test of sphericity was used to test whether the variables were independent if the statistical measurement of the bartlett test was large and the associated probability value was less than the specified level the dataset was suitable for the factor analysis if the correlation coefficient matrix was not be a unit matrix it meant that it was not suitable for the factor analysis conversely 2 4 3 source apportionment on apcs mlr the receptor model used for source apportionment of groundwater employed a combination of two statistical techniques multiple linear regression mlr and absolute principal component scores apcs the model took the absolute factor scores as independent variables and the concentrations of pollutants were treated as dependent variables this was done to convert the apcs analysis factor score for the contribution of each pollution source according to the regression index provided by the apcs mlr this provided a quantitative characterization of the contribution of each pollution source to the overall pollution at present this method is used in water quality evaluation to calculate the contribution of pollution factors to each evaluation parameters a detailed description of the receptor model was given by thurston and spengler 1985 to determine the sharing rate of particle sources in boston the source contributions to a pollutant concentration cj can be calculated using the following multiple linear regression 4 c j r 0 j k 1 n r jk apcs k where r 0 j is a constant term of multiple regressions for pollutant j r jk is coefficient of multiple regression of the source k for pollutant j and apcs k is the scaled value of the rotated factor k for the considered sample the combined term r jk apcs k represent the contribution of source k to c j the quantitative contribution from each identified source to individual groundwater quality parameters was calculated using the original measured values to verify the accuracy of the calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 data structure determination using pca and fa the kmo and bartlett s sphericity tests were applied to examine the suitability of the data for pca fa the calculation results for 2006 and 2016 were shown in table 2 according to the k s tests all variables were log normally distributed with a confidence of 95 or higher the kmo value for the dataset was 0 72 and 0 66 in 2006 and 2016 respectively similarly bartlett s test of sphericity values were 2049 19 and 1537 35 with an inspection of p values close to zero p 0 05 all these results indicated that there might be a statistically significant interrelationship between variables which rendered the pca fa analysis valid for fa the initially extracted communalities were calculated in order to select appropriate indices the higher the communality the more useful the information was in the evaluation of the indices normalized data matrices were used for the pca fa analyses according to the kaiser standard the principle of eigenvalues being 1 was used to determine the number of principal components here the eigenvalue is a sum of the squared factor loadings for all factors of a given variable which is the communality of each factor to account for the observed value variance based on the kaiser rule the first five and four principal components were obtained with eigenvalue 1 in the 2006 and 2016 datasets this summed to 76 57 and 81 35 of the total variance in the 2006 and 2016 groundwater quality datasets respectively see tables 3 and 4 the variance factor rotation loading matrix of the selected groundwater quality parameters in 2006 and 2016 were presented in table 5 and factor loadings 0 75 0 50 0 75 and 0 30 0 50 were considered strong moderate and weak respectively 3 1 1 identification of potential pollution sources and spatial distribution characteristics in 2006 in 2006 the first varifactor vf1 was the first factor influencing the groundwater quality of the study area and accounted for 36 41 of the total variance its eigenvalue was 7 65 and it had strong and positive loadings on na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 th and tds it showed moderately positive loading on k and weak positive loading on cod and no2 component loading for each index in the five selected components after varimax rotation are shown graphically in fig 2 each factor score of the selected monitoring points was obtained using spss 20 0 the relationship between the potential pollution sources and geographic location called the spatial distribution was described using the kriging interpolation calculation with arcgis 9 3 software shown in fig 3 the higher the score is the more serious the pollution groundwater pollution sources varied from natural sources such as weathering of common rocks mineral and soils salt deposits and brines to anthropogenic sources such as landfill wastewater water treatment and agriculture raju et al 2011 nearly half of the physico chemical parameters were contained in vf1 table 4 and the high concentration areas factor score 0 75 were mainly concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the songhua river fig 3 the study area was located in a quaternary loose layer a gravel layer with a layer of muddy loam and clay in the middle the runoff condition was good and leaching effect was strong water exploitation along the riverside in the songhua river changed the hydraulic gradient and enhanced water rock interaction industrial effluent and domestic sewage infiltration made dissolved rock components such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 and cl migrate and enrich easily furthermore the lateral flow from the songhua river was an important recharge source and controlled the groundwater chemistry to a certain degree in the high score area of vf1 therefore vf1 was identified as point source pollution resulting from water rock interaction industrial and domestic sewage discharging the second varifactor vf2 accounting for 15 61 of the total variance had strong and positive loadings on fe2 and mn2 and weak positive loading on cod it was seen from the spatial distribution of five potential pollution components fig 3 that the parts along the hulan river in the northeastern area especially in songbei district and the middle and lower reaches of the songhua river had higher scores in these areas the concentration of iron and manganese was high in general the original geological environment in the region was the quaternary loose aquifer group the holocene series and pleistocene series contained the main aquifers they had a mixed layer with muddy loam and clay in the middle along with abundant iron manganese nodules iron and manganese are both variable valence elements in black soil the abundant organic matter and reducing environment in groundwater provided good conditions for iron and manganese reduction reactions with the specific reactions being as follows berbenni et al 2000 fe oh 3 3h e fe 2 3h 2 o ch 2 o fe 2 o 3 2h 2fe 2 co 2 2h 2 o ch 2 o 2mno 2 3h 2mn 2 hco 3 2h 2 o ch 2 o fe oh 3 7h 4fe 2 hco 3 10 h 2 o moreover infiltration of water from anthropogenic sources such as industrial wastewater and domestic sewage could accelerate the dissolution of the iron and manganese minerals therefore the high concentration of iron and manganese was mainly affected by the special environmental geochemistry and chemical composition of the aquifer which could be interpreted as original geological environment pollution based on the water rock interaction and infiltration of industrial and domestic wastewater the third varifactor vf3 accounting for 9 90 of the total variance had strong and positive loading on no3 and no2 moderately positive loading on nh4 n weak positive loading on ca2 and moderate negative loading on hco3 according to statistics the amount of nitrogenous fertilizers and compound fertilizers used for agriculture was 21 985 t and 18 319 t respectively on average 231 kg fertilizer per hectare was used in 2005 and this indicated that excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizer might be one important source of no3 no2 and nh4 n in the regional groundwater moreover the high component score areas 0 5 were mostly located in areas with high density building sites fig 3 indicating that underground pipeline leakage might accidently have caused enrichment of various nitrogen contaminants in addition the residential garbage contained large amounts of nitrogenous organic matter and a large number of microorganisms which entered groundwater aquifers by rain filtration therefore the third varifactor represented non point source pollution of nitrogen resulting from fertilizers application domestic sewage leakage and rain water dripping and filtration the fourth varifactor vf4 accounted for 9 01 of the total variance and had an eigenvalue of 1 89 it had strong positive loading on f weak positive loading on no2 and weak negative loading on cod the high concentration of f were mostly in the western northwestern and southwestern areas fluorine is distributed widely in nature mainly in the forms of minerals such as fluorite caf2 cryolite na3 alf6 and apatite ca5 po4 3f agorhom et al 2015 fluorine rich rocks and deposits were key sources of enrichment in fluorinated soil and groundwater the study area was located in the alluvial and flood fan of the songhua river where the fluorine rich medium of quaternary loose deposits sand and clay could release f by dissolution and hydration during the process of lateral recharge from river to groundwater moreover the emission of hydrogen fluorine compounds and industrial atmospheric dust containing fluorine has led to a certain degree of increase of fluorine in rainfall and wastewater discharge in recent years therefore this factor might be termed typical fluoride pollution based on the dissolution of fluorine mineral and rainfall infiltration with fluorine finally the fifth varifactor vf5 accounting for 5 63 of the total variance in the datasets had an eigenvalue of 1 18 and was highly correlated only with hpo4 2 it appeared from the statistical analysis that pipeline leakage or accidental wastewater discharge had directly entered the groundwater aquifer and had contained dissolved total phosphate orthophosphate and dissolved orthophosphate the high factor score area 0 90 was in the central business district with the main pollution sources in the area being such as hotels and public baths fig 3 in addition the harbin bio pharmaceutical factory and two garbage stations were also in the area the presence of much garbage and industrial waste could cause phosphate pollutants to infiltrate the aquifer and cause phosphorus pollution in the groundwater the areas with high factor scores were in the western and southeastern areas where regional phosphorus fertilizer from agricultural land caused phosphorous infiltration of the unconfined aquifer therefore the fifth factor could be regarded as non point source pollution of phosphorus based on fertilizer infiltration domestic and industrial wastewater emission 3 1 2 identification of potential pollution sources and spatial distribution characteristics in 2016 similar methods for principal component identification were used for the groundwater quality analysis in 2016 the principal component loading for each parameter in the four selected components after varimax rotation are shown graphically in fig 4 and the spatial distribution of four principal pollution sources was shown in fig 5 the first varifactor vf1 accounting for 40 71 of the total variance had strong and positive loading on na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 th and tds fig 4 this was analogous to the first factor in 2006 and similar sources of pollution could be accounted for with the first factor in 2016 the synthesis factor for the quality of the groundwater environment was the positive loading on th and tds 0 93 which showed that the basic ion concentration was increasing year by year the spatial distribution showed that the areas with factor score 0 80 had increased significantly compared to 2006 mostly in the limin groundwater source and songbei district on the north bank of the songhua river figs 3 and 5 the area of factor scores of 0 35 0 80 were mainly distributed in the central area fig 5 population growth and rising living standards were increasing the demand for groundwater which led to overexploitation of the water supply for living and agricultural irrigation the water rock interaction accelerated mineral dissolution which enriched the concentration of soluble ions such as ca2 and mg2 and sharply increased the access of these ions to the aquifer in addition more industrial and domestic wastewater discharge might be another important source for increasing the area of vf1 high concentration from 2006 to 2016 therefore vf1 in 2016 was also interpreted as point source pollution based on water rock interaction industrial and domestic sewage discharging the second varifactor vf2 accounting for 21 31 of the total variance had strong and positive loadings on mn2 moderate positive loading on fe2 and f weak positive loading on cod and weak negative loading on nh4 n the importance and possible sources of these components were discussed previously due to the strong interactions between iron manganese and fluorine it revealed that both physicochemical and biological factors could be the main factors responsible for the high loading of these parameters on vf2 the spatial distribution of vf2 showed that high concentration area was in the center of limin district fig 5 the unique geochemical characteristics controlled by tectonic and river factors formed a reducing environment with sealing performance and enrichment of organic matter these provided good conditions for mineral dissolution and reaction including iron manganese and fluorine which increased their presence in the groundwater another important source was anthropogenic sources many factories such as steel manufacture and biological pharmaceuticals were located in the region industrial wastewater and solid wastes had influence on the concentration of iron manganese and fluorine therefore vf2 in 2016 still represented original geological environment pollution based on the water rock interaction and infiltration of industrial and domestic wastewater the third varifactor vf3 accounting for 12 32 of the total variance had strong and positive loading on nh4 n no3 and no2 with moderate or positive loading on hpo4 2 hco3 cod and so4 2 it was found from the correlation matrix in 2016 that mn2 was negatively correlated with nutrients which indicated competition between nutrients and manganese for dissolved oxygen fig 4 according to the spatial distribution characteristics of this factor the high concentration area of nitrogen was mainly concentrated in western limin district fig 5 the ammonia nitrogen pollutant was often found in landfill leachate and in waste products such as sewage liquid manure and other organic waste products among the numerous sources of ammonia nitrogen that released by decomposition of organic matter and fertilizer from agricultural applications was the major contributing source different types of agriculture in the western area generated non point source pollution that had a high percentage of nitrogen from pesticides and fertilizers therefore the third varifactor was called the non point source pollution of nitrogen based on agricultural irrigation and domestic sewage effluent finally the fourth varifactor vf4 which accounted for 7 02 of the total variance had positive loading only on cod this indicated approximately the total amount of organic matter in the groundwater the spatial distribution of vf4 showed that the areas with a high factor score 0 7 were mainly located in western limin district southwestern songbei district and in the parts of the northwest close to the hulan river fig 5 also located there was the harbin biological medicine factory with activities mainly related to drug production medical devices and functional foods and with a large amount of organic wastewater discharge furthermore there were also domestic garbage collection stations which contained organic matter and a large number of microorganisms the leachate from these went through the aeration zone and caused groundwater pollution to a certain degree therefore vf4 was representing organic pollution in groundwater 3 2 source apportionment using apcs mlr model after identifying possible pollution sources the contribution of each source to groundwater quality variables was apportioned using apcs mlr according to the results by thurston and spengler 1985 when n m 50 n represents the number of samples and m represents the number of pollutants for analysis a reliable pca fa result could be obtained the number of data samples in the present study met this requirement during the factor extraction process the principle of eigenvalue 1 was adopted to identify five and four primary factors in 2006 and 2016 respectively tables 6 and 7 as shown in these tables the r2 values of the studied parameters concentrations were 0 7 for both calculations using the receptor model and the actual observations this indicated that there was good consistency between the modeled and observed values and that the source apportionment results were reliable furthermore the ratio of the mean observed and estimated values of almost all the groundwater quality variables suggested goodness of the receptor model approach to the source apportionment of the study area groundwater in 2006 most variables were primarily influenced by point source pollution from water rock interaction and industrial and domestic sewage effluent vf1 representing the salt ions were k na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl hco3 tds and th of which the contributions were 61 24 70 31 74 35 73 84 70 45 67 85 71 21 72 87 and 80 36 respectively the contribution of the remaining groundwater quality parameters was between 1 01 no3 and 18 86 f the contribution from original geological metal pollution vf2 for different groundwater quality parameters ranged from 0 67 tds to 70 06 fe2 this was mainly embodied in metallic elements such as fe2 and mn2 of which the contribution was 63 17 and 66 54 respectively furthermore the contribution to f was 76 79 the sources of these latter three ions had good consistency the contribution of non point source pollution of nitrogen vf3 for different parameters accounted for between 3 37 ca2 and 78 06 no3 the contribution of nh4 n no3 and no2 was 69 04 78 06 and 71 21 respectively and the contribution of the remaining parameters was 15 it was found that the contribution of typical fluoride pollution vf4 to groundwater quality parameters in 2006 ranged from 0 49 na to 56 79 f it was also observed that the high percentage of ca2 35 24 was related to f the reversible reaction of caf2 gave it a dual control effect on f and ca2 the hpo4 2 factor vf5 was responsible for 56 45 hpo4 2 and 29 53 cod respectively this factor also accounted for 3 58 8 83 of nitrogen concentration generally the average contributions indicated that point source pollution vf1 original geological metal pollution vf2 non point source pollution of nitrogen vf3 typical fluoride pollution vf4 and non point source pollution of phosphorus vf5 for the different parameters concentrations of groundwater quality in 2006 were 36 41 15 61 9 90 9 01 and 5 63 respectively fig 7 in the study area in 2016 most variables were primarily influenced by point source pollution from water rock interaction and industrial and domestic sewage effluent vf1 representing the salt ions including na ca2 mg2 so4 2 cl th and tds their contributions were 75 51 77 42 63 84 68 35 57 85 75 63 and 71 42 respectively the other groundwater quality parameters were from 1 35 cod to 41 38 mn furthermore th had a high percentage 75 63 and the enrichment of ca2 and mg2 was related to increase of the th concentration the contribution of original geological environment pollution vf2 to the different groundwater quality parameters ranged from 0 81 so4 2 to 80 11 mn2 the contribution for the three major parameters was fe2 78 65 mn2 80 11 and f 73 59 while the contribution of the remaining indicators was 20 the contribution of non point source pollution of nitrogen vf3 to different quality parameters was between 1 17 ca2 and 78 34 no3 the contributions to nh4 n no3 and no2 were all 70 and to potassium was 60 81 this indicated the same source as for the nitrogen series parameters generally the nitrogen element transformation was closely related to the cod and the contribution of vf3 to cod was 45 62 it was found that the contribution of organic pollution vf4 to groundwater quality parameters accounted for between 0 03 fe2 and 74 60 cod this indicated that the highest percentage of cod resulted from this source all in all the average contributions indicated that point source pollution vf1 primary geological environment pollution vf2 non point source pollution of nitrogen vf3 and organic pollution vf4 contributions to the different groundwater quality parameters were 40 71 21 31 12 32 and 7 02 respectively in 2016 fig 6 in addition the major pollution variables that exceeded the standard could be categorized into three groups heavy metals fe2 mn2 nitrogen nh4 n no3 and no2 and organic pollution cod the calculated average contribution of the different potential pollution sources to heavy metals nutrients and organic pollution in 2006 and 2016 based on tables 5 and 6 are presented in a pie chart fig 7 the results showed that based on the special environmental geochemistry vf2 the contribution of original geological environment pollution was 68 30 and 74 81 in 2006 and 2016 respectively the point source pollution vf1 discharged made a contribution of 14 94 which included the major sources of heavy metals such as iron and manganese accordingly non point source of nitrogen vf3 was the major source of nitrogen in groundwater 70 10 contribution in 2006 and 76 77 contribution in 2016 organic pollution vf4 with 60 81 contribution and non point source nitrogen vf3 with 19 61 contribution in 2016 were the major sources of chemical oxygen demand in groundwater quality in addition non point source phosphate pollution vf5 made a 29 53 contribution and typical fluorine enrichment pollution vf4 made a 20 74 contribution in 2006 3 3 analysis of groundwater quality evolution from 2006 to 2016 3 3 1 evolution analysis for groundwater quality and groundwater chemistry type to analyze the causes of groundwater evolution the third class groundwater quality of the groundwater quality standard gb t14848 93 was used to evaluate the overall condition of the groundwater quality a column graph indicating conditions that exceeded the standard rate was drawn by means of statistical analysis for the groundwater quality in the study area fig 8 the results showed that the main pollution parameters in the study area were iron manganese and ammonia nitrogen manganese and ammonia nitrogen both exceeded the standard 80 and iron was close to 80 in 2006 in 2016 the over standard level for iron and manganese was slightly lower and the rate of ammonia nitrogen increased compared with 2006 this indicated increasing contamination by ammonia nitrogen in 2016 the over standard rate of nitrites and nitrates was below 20 and the trend of increase was marked compared with 2006 in addition the chemical oxygen demand deriving from sewage and industrial wastewater increased to above 10 this indicated that groundwater organic pollution was becoming more serious phreatic water is the main type of groundwater resource in the study area and factors such as climate hydrological geography and anthropogenic activities have great influence on it the chemical species in the groundwater changed constantly in terms of their spatial distribution and principal pollution components in relation to the continuous development of industry and agriculture taking the major groundwater ions as variables a piper diagram analysis was done for the selected water samples the results are shown in a piper hydrochemistry diagram for 2006 and 2016 fig 9 the comparison between groundwater quality dataset in the study area at the initial stage of urbanization 2006 and after rapid development through urbanization 2016 highlighted some differences between them fig 9 the groundwater samples fell into the lower left side of the cationic triangle with the highest amount of sodium and calcium occupying second place the water sample points were centered in the middle and left with the highest amount of bicarbonate chloride took second place in the anionic triangle in 2006 the principal hydrochemistry types in 2006 were ca na hco3 na ca hco3 and ca so4 cl in 2016 the principal hydrochemistry types were ca mg so4 na ca so4 cl ca so4 cl and na ca mg so4 this indicated that the chemistry of the shallow groundwater in the study area had changed and become more polluted since 2006 groundwater anions were mostly hco3 in 2006 but were predominantly so4 2 and cl in 2016 groundwater samples with high so4 2 and cl concentrations corresponded with cultivated land or low density building site areas where there were plenty of fertilizer e g ammonium sulfate residuals and some small factories discharging so4 2 respectively in addition lateral flow from the rivers might be another important source for high so4 2 content in the groundwater 3 3 2 analysis of the evolution of land use types in 2006 and 2016 land use type was not only the foundation of the ecosystem but also the most important indicator of anthropogenic activity for human geography systems with interaction between anthropogenic activity and the natural environment the degree of connection depended on the land use type and the density of human beings koh et al 2010 different types of land uses were not only related to social development but also to the evolution of groundwater quality social development during urbanization changed the structure of the urban surfaces the original groundwater system was adjusted so that industrial wastewater agricultural irrigation runoff and domestic sewage infiltrated the aquifer changing the circulation system of the groundwater it was decided to use the changes of land use type indicated in remote sensing data via the interpretation of harbin 2006 and 2016 to analyze the evolution of the groundwater quality the results showed that the land use type was developing including dry farmland area reduced by 10 69 building site area increased by 5 77 forestland area increased by 2 73 grassland area increased by 0 69 and the percentage of unexploited area decreased by 0 43 from 2006 to 2016 table 8 cultivated land was first for transfer amount and the amount of building site area transferred was 25 22 km2 this indicated internal causes for organic pollution in the groundwater to a certain extent land use types characterize human activity and the interaction between land use type and groundwater chemical composition could be measured spatially to reveal significant influences on groundwater from 2006 to 2016 fig 10 it was concluded that the main land use types were dry farmland forested land and building sites in the study area in 2006 and their percentages were 63 14 12 38 and 10 79 respectively in 2016 dry fields building site areas and forested land were the main land use types 52 45 16 56 and 15 11 respectively this revealed that the area of dry fields had been reduced by 10 69 and the building site area increased by 25 22 km2 during the interval from 2006 to 2016 table 8 comparative analysis of the spatial distribution of vf1 and the land use type in 2006 and 2016 revealed that the area of high factor scores 0 80 based on water rock interaction industrial effluent and domestic sewage discharge increased significantly compared by 2016 this change was mostly in the limin groundwater source and songbei district on the north bank of the songhua river this was consistent with the growth of building in the site area the increase of population inevitably leads to increasing demand for groundwater and building site area the resulting groundwater overexploitation changed the oxidation reduction conditions and strengthened interactions between the mineral dissolution and groundwater moreover sewage emissions had increased significantly which also led to increased amounts of basic ions entering the groundwater the high concentration of vf2 was generally distributed in the center of the study area and the high concentration of iron and manganese reflected the expansion of the building site areas the minerals that included iron manganese and fluorine leached in response to the acid and alkali solubility effects caused by discharge of industrial wastewater and hydrodynamic filtration by concentrated mining of the groundwater sources this resulted in enrichment of iron manganese and fluorine in the protogenic geological environment the high concentration of nitrogen vf3 was located on agricultural land in western areas and the reduction of agricultural land e g dry farmland also agreed with decrease in the area of non point nutrients this reflected the characteristic nitrogen pollution in the study area during 2006 2016 the excessive fertilizer and pesticides caused serious nitrogen pollution in the groundwater in addition fluorine and phosphate contamination was concentrated in the agricultural and building areas in the western and southwestern areas in 2006 the space distribution of organic pollution cod was significantly related to the distribution of agricultural cultivation and building site area which were characterized by organic pollutants in the groundwater therefore the pollution resulted from anthropogenic factors due to agriculture irrigation and discharge of domestic and industrial wastewater the major new sources of groundwater contamination it could be concluded that the groundwater potential pollution sources presented an obvious spatial distribution the high concentration areas were mainly distributed in the western and northwestern areas especially downstream of the songhua river the land use types had great influence on the spatial distribution of potential pollution sources and there was good consistency between the change of land use types and the spatial distribution of potential pollution sources of groundwater from 2006 to 2016 4 conclusions pca and fa along with the apcs mlr receptor model were used to assess the potential pollution sources of groundwater and to apportion the contributions of different pollution sources to each groundwater quality parameters from 2006 to 2016 in the limin groundwater source area in harbin northeastern china the change of groundwater chemistry type and the evolution of land use types from 2006 to 2016 were analyzed to reveal the causes for the changing groundwater quality five and four potential pollution sources were identified in 2006 and 2016 respectively the major potential pollution sources which had significant effect on groundwater quality variables could be categorized into three groups heavy metals iron manganese nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrates and organic pollution chemical oxygen demand results showed that water rock interaction agricultural fertilizer pollution and emission of domestic and industrial wastewater were most responsible for the evolution of groundwater contamination it was concluded that the groundwater potential pollution sources presented an obvious spatial distribution and that the high concentration areas were mainly distributed in the western and northwestern areas especially downstream of the songhua river the land use types had great influence on the spatial distribution of potential pollution sources and there was good consistency between the change of land use types and the spatial distribution of potential pollution sources of groundwater from 2006 to 2016 this study showed the feasibility and reliability of the combined use of these multivariate statistical techniques to explore the evolution of groundwater quality pca coupled with apcs mlr has become a versatile tool for pollution source identification and source apportionment

1634,a semi analytical numerical method for modeling matrix diffusion in heterogeneous and fractured groundwater systems is developed this is a significant extension of the falta and wang 2017 method that only applied to diffusion in an aquitard of infinite thickness the current solution allows for the low permeability matrix to be embedded within a numerical gridblock having finite average thickness a specified volume fraction and a specified interfacial area with the high permeability domain the new formulation also allows for coupled parent daughter decay reactions with multiple species that each have independent retardation factors decay rates and yield coefficients in both the high and low permeability parts of the system the method uses a fitting function to approximate the transient concentration profile in the low permeability part of each gridblock so that the matrix diffusion flux into the high permeability part of the gridblock can be computed as a concentration dependent source sink term this approach is efficient because the only unknowns in each gridblock are the concentrations in the high permeability domain so there is practically no increase in computational effort compared to a conventional transport simulation the method is shown to compare favorably with an analytical solution for matrix diffusion in fractured media with parallel fractures with an analytical solution for matrix diffusion with parent daughter decay reactions with laboratory experiments of matrix diffusion in a layered system with a laboratory experiment involving lens shaped inclusions and with fine grid numerical simulations of transport in highly heterogeneous systems keywords matrix diffusion semi analytical numerical modeling 1 introduction groundwater has been contaminated at thousands of sites around the world as a result of leaks and spills of hazardous materials these primary sources of contamination are often referred to as source zones and they can lead to extensive dissolved contamination plumes secondary sources of contamination such as dissolved chemicals in low permeability zones result in plume persistence and limitations for plume remediation as a consequence of the process of matrix diffusion mackay and cherry 1989 chapman and parker 2005 matrix diffusion is the process of mass transfer of solutes between high permeability zones and surrounding low permeability zones due to a concentration gradient this process is known as forward diffusion when the transport is from high to low permeability zones forward diffusion takes place during a loading period usually when contaminants reach the aquifer after the contaminant source has been removed the concentration gradient reverses and diffusion goes from low to high permeability zones resulting in back diffusion liu and ball 2002 chapman and parker 2005 falta 2005 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 therefore low permeability zones act as contaminant sinks first and later serve as contaminant sources to transmissive zones with flowing groundwater due to matrix diffusion mackay and cherry 1989 chapman and parker 2005 seyedabbasi et al 2012 back diffusion of contaminants from low permeability areas can result in plume persistence and severe limitations in remediation efforts chapman and parker 2005 rasa et al 2011 seyedabbasi et al 2012 yang et al 2015 there are analytical solutions available to model matrix diffusion tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 liu and ball 2002 sale et al 2008 yang et al 2015 however they are constrained to simple geometries corresponding to ideal cases numerical simulations studies of matrix diffusion chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 rasa et al 2011 chapman et al 2012 chapman and parker 2013 have shown the ability to reproduce the transient matrix diffusion effects it has been demonstrated that very fine discretization is required in order to reproduce the diffusive fluxes at the high permeability low permeability interfaces often controlled by concentration gradients at the scale of centimeters or less chapman et al 2012 high resolution grids result in an excessive computational effort that makes it difficult to use this approach for 3 dimensional field scale problems an alternative to the conventional numerical transport modeling approach uses a dual domain system with local one dimensional discretization of the low permeability zones this method was originally developed for heat and mass transfer in multiphase flow simulators by pruess and narasimhan 1985 and it was used by chen et al 2015 for modeling thermal remediation of chlorinated solvents in fractured rocks carey et al 2015 have implemented a similar formulation in a numerical groundwater transport model and they used it to simulate matrix diffusion a different modeling approach combines analytical and numerical modeling this method was developed in petroleum reservoir engineering to calculate heat conductive flux from a permeable reservoir to an impermeable caprock additionally it has been successfully used in fractured reservoir configurations the semi analytical method discretizes only the high permeability parts of the aquifer in the numerical model and the heat conduction flux is treated as a temperature dependent source sink term calculated analytically in each gridblock at every time step vinsome and westerveld 1980 pruess and wu 1988 pruess and wu 1993 this semi analytical method was adapted to the matrix diffusion process given that the matrix diffusion equations and heat conduction equations are analogous bear et al 1994 falta and wang 2017 falta and wang 2017 implemented the matrix diffusion semi analytical method for the case of an aquifer in contact with a thick aquitard with diffusion of a single solute that undergoes first order decay we have extended that method to the more general case of heterogeneous and fractured aquifers where the low permeability matrix volumes have a finite average thickness and where multiple solutes can undergo first order parent daughter decay reactions 2 matrix diffusion semi analytical method matrix diffusion in low permeability materials can be approximated as a one dimensional process that depends on the distance from the interface with the high permeability material z l the governing partial differential equations for transient matrix diffusion assuming first order decay of a component m 1 that produces a daughter compound m are 1 r lm c lm t τ l d 2 c lm z l 2 λ lm c lm m 1 2 r lm c lm t τ l d 2 c lm z l 2 y lm 1 λ lm 1 c lm 1 λ lm c lm m 1 here the subscript l refers to the low permeability material c lm is the aqueous mass concentration of component m in the low permeability material r lm is the retardation factor of component m τ l is the tortuosity d is the molecular diffusion coefficient λ lm is the first order decay rate of component m and y m 1 is the mass yield of daughter component m from parent compound m 1 eq 2 can be repeated for subsequent daughter products to form a complete decay chain for example at a site where tetrachloroethylene pce undergoes decay to form trichloroethylene tce and the tce decays to form cis 1 2 dichloroethylene dce which decays to form vinyl chloride vc pce would be the parent compound m 1 governed by eq 1 while tce dce and vc would be daughter compounds governed by eq 2 with m 2 3 and 4 respectively the semi analytical method is based on the thermal conduction approximation developed by vinsome and westerveld 1980 bear et al 1994 and falta and wang 2017 adapted the visnome and westerveld model to the problem of matrix diffusion in a semi infinite aquitard using the mathematical analogy between transient heat conduction and transient matrix diffusion the approach is based on the use of a fitting function to describe the concentration profile as a function of distance from the interface in the low permeability matrix 3 c lm z l t c m t δt p m z l q m z l 2 e z l d m where c m t δt is the current concentration of component m at the interface between high permeability and low permeability zones and p m and q m are fitting parameters the concentration c m t δt is the concentration that is solved for in each gridblock of a normal numerical simulation and it is assumed to represent the average concentration in the high permeability part of the gridblock the concentration penetration depth d m is defined by 4 d m κ lm t 2 κ lm τ l d r lm the zero level of the concentrations in eq 3 correspond to the initial uniform concentrations in the low permeability zone which is usually zero the fitting parameters p m and q m are determined by two conservation of mass laws the first constraint requires the fitting function to satisfy the governing equation at the high permeability low permeability interface 5 r lm c lm t τ l d 2 c lm z l 2 z l 0 y lm 1 λ lm 1 c lm 1 z l 0 λ l c lm z l 0 the component production term in eq 5 is only used for daughter products m 1 in order to discretize the equation a first order finite difference approximation is applied to the time derivative c lm and c lm 1 are replaced with the trial functions on the right hand side which results in 6 r lm c m t δt c m t δ t τ l d c m t δt d m 2 2 p m d m 2 q m y lm 1 λ lm 1 c m 1 t δt λ lm c m t δt the second constraint is the mass conservation of the components in the low permeability material this requires that the rate of change of total mass in the matrix is to equal the mass flux across the interface minus the rate of decay in the matrix plus the rate of production in the matrix for an ideal semi infinite aquitard case the integral of distance into low permeability areas is defined from zero to infinity falta and wang 2017 this study deals with finite embedded heterogeneities such as low permeability lenses and layers or fractured porous media with parallel fractures thus the mass conservation constraint must account for a finite diffusion distance the characteristic maximum diffusion length l corresponds to the average maximum depth or distance of diffusion into the low permeability material for a layered system l would be the half thickness of the low permeability layers and for a system of parallel fractures l would be equal to one half of the fracture spacing the low permeability matrix mass balance constraint becomes 7 r lm t 0 l c lm dz l τ l d c lm z l z l 0 y lm 1 λ lm 1 0 l c lm 1 dz l λ lm 0 l c lm dz l the concentration integrals in eq 7 are directly related to the mass of the components

corresponding to the definition of i t in falta and wang 2017 replacing the time derivative in eq 7 with a finite difference approximation of the concentration integral and substituting c lm with the

aquifer gridblocks containing low permeability zones and they are updated at each time step to represent the changing concentration profile in the low permeability zones the concentration integral i m t δt is recalculated at every time step in every gridblock using eq 9 and it is stored for use in the next time step i m t for the special case of diffusion in a semi infinite aquitard with no reactions the formulation becomes equivalent to the original vinsome and westerveld 1980 method for heat conduction and to the bear et al 1994 method for diffusion 2 1 calculation of matrix diffusion mass flow the matrix diffusion mass flow entering or leaving the high permeability zone is described by fick s first law of diffusion substituting the low permeability material concentration by the trial function 19 m m a md ϕ l τ l d c lm z l z l 0 a md ϕ l τ l d c m t δt d m p m where ϕ l is the porosity of the low permeability material and a md is the matrix diffusion area defined as the interfacial area between the high permeability and low permeability zones eq 14 for p m can be rewritten as 20 p m a m c m t δ t b m t δt with 21 a m e m a m 2 κ lm δ t a m 2 d m 2 a m λ lm 2 r lm κ

is 23 m a md ϕ l τ l d a m 1 d m c m t δt b m t δt the matrix diffusion mass flow becomes a linearly concentration dependent source sink term added in the numerical transport model gridblocks that contain or are adjacent to low permeability materials the b m t δt term eq 22 that appears in the gradient expression for component m does not depend on the current concentration of m but it does depend on the previous concentration and integral of m as well as on the current concentration and integral of the parent compound m 1 the semi analytical approximation for matrix diffusion with a finite diffusion length does not force the concentration gradient at the symmetry boundary z l l to be zero this might seem to be a significant limitation of the formulation but we have not found that to be true in practice as evidenced by the comparisons in the following sections it appears that it is sufficient to accurately represent the concentration gradient at the interface and the mass balance in the low permeability material this observation is similar to that made by pruess and wu 1993 in their study of heat conduction in cubic matrix blocks using a similar semi analytic method they tried adding a cubic term to the fitting function so that the additional free parameter could be used to force the concentration gradient to be zero at z l l but found that this formulation gave less accurate results than the two parameter fitting function they observed that forcing the zero gradient condition at z l l resulted in a less accurate representation of the gradient at the interface 2 2 numerical formulation the diffusive mass flow given by eq 23 can be added to implicit numerical transport models as a concentration dependent source sink term a key aspect of this method is that the numerical method only solves the conservation of mass equations in the high permeability part of the model the low permeability mass balance is maintained by the time dependent concentration integrals for each component in each gridblock eq 9 there are two main geometrical configurations that are considered for the low permeability material for the case of a semi infinite aquitard that is adjacent to a high permeability aquifer the aquifer is treated normally in the numerical formulation and the matrix diffusion flux only occurs in the elements that are adjacent to the low permeability material falta and wang 2017 for the case of embedded low permeability heterogeneity or in fractured systems the volume fraction of the two materials in each gridblock must be specified denoting the volume fraction of the high permeability material as v f the volume of high permeability material in a gridblock of total volume v i would be v f v i using the integral finite difference method narasimhan and witherspoon 1976 the mass balance equation component m in the high permeability part of an element i is given by 24 v f v i dm i m dt j f ij m a ij q i m where m i m is the mass of component m per volume of high permeability material f ij m is the mass flux of m entering element i from neighboring elements j a ij is the interfacial area between elements i and elements j and q i m is an internal source sink term for m in element i this source sink term accounts for decay and production reactions in the high permeability part of the gridblock and for the matrix diffusion mass flow from the semi analytical method eq 23 the mass fluxes f m include advection and hydrodynamic dispersion freeze and cherry 1979 fetter 2008 hydrodynamic dispersion includes both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion the mass term for each component in the high permeability material is 25 m m ϕ r m c m here ϕ is the porosity of the high permeability material and r m is the solute retardation factor for component m in the high permeability material with the integral finite difference formulation it is possible to use both structured and unstructured grids see for example panday et al 2013 for the purpose of illustration the transport equation using the semi analytical approach was expressed for a three dimensional system using cartesian coordinates the system assumes uniform groundwater flow in the horizontal x direction and dispersion in all three directions i j k first order parent daughter decay production is considered in the aqueous phase part of the high permeability material a uniform grid with spacing of δx δy and δz is assumed along with a finite difference approximation for the concentration gradients in the dispersive fluxes and upstream weighting for the advective term under these conditions the discretized transport equation with a fully implicit formulation is 26 v f δ x δ y δ zϕ r m c i j k m t δ t c i j k m t δ t v x δ y

j k m t δt where v x is the darcy velocity in the horizontal direction d x d y and d z are dispersion coefficients in the x y and z directions r m is the component m retardation factor in the high permeability material λ m is the aqueous decay rate in the high permeability material and y m 1 is the mass yield coefficient for production of m from decay of m 1 in the high permeability material the darcy velocity is defined on a total area basis including both media and the dispersive fluxes have been modified by including the high permeability volume fraction the equations for the m components are coupled by the daughter production terms in both the high permeability and low permeability parts of the system the matrix diffusion area and volume fraction depend on the nature of the matrix diffusion geometry if the gridblock does not contain any low permeability material but it is adjacent to a semi infinite aquitard v f is equal to 1 and a md δxδy if the gridblock contains low permeability material then v f 1 and a md and l are determined by the geometry the semi analytical method has 3 geometrical parameters but these can be reduced to two parameters by considering that the volume of low permeability material in a gridblock should be equal to the product of the matrix diffusion area and the characteristic average maximum diffusion length then for a total volume of v i 27 v i 1 v f a md l and only two of the three parameters need to be specified eq 26 gives a system of linear equations that can be solved by various methods in the present work a fortran program was written using the gauss siedel iterative method during each iteration the computational method first updates the parent compound m 1 in a gridblock followed by the daughter products m 2 3 4 before moving to the next gridblock with this ordering the component production terms are calculated using the updated value of the parent concentration c m 1 t δt in each gridblock a graphical user interface has been developed for the fortran program by farhat et al 2018 and the resulting model called remchlor md is available free of charge 3 comparisons with analytical solutions the earlier formulation for matrix diffusion in semi infinite aquitards was tested extensively by falta and wang 2017 here we compare the new formulation for matrix diffusion with an analytical solution for matrix diffusion in fractured porous media with parallel fractures and with a solution for diffusion with a series of parent daughter decay reactions 3 1 matrix diffusion in a system with parallel fractures sudicky and frind 1982 developed an analytical solution for transport in a fractured system with a single set of parallel fractures and matrix diffusion their solution is implemented in the craflush and crafit computer programs toran 2000 which were used for the comparison the simulation considers the introduction of a dissolved contaminant at 100 mg l at the upstream end of a system of parallel fractures the fracture spacing is 0 5 m and each fracture has an aperture of 100 μm the pore velocity in the fractures was set to 100 m yr which is equivalent to a darcy velocity of 0 02 m yr due to the very small area of the fractures relative to the total area with this geometry the volume fraction of the high permeability material the fractures is only 0 0002 the 100 mg l source is maintained for a period of 50 years before it is removed and the system is flushed with clean water for an additional 150 years the semi analytical model was set up as a 1 d system with 200 gridblocks using a gridblock spacing of 1 m and a time step of 0 1 yr the grid dimensions in the y and z directions were 1 m a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 5 m was used in the sudicky and frind model but that value was set to zero in the semi analytic model because the upstream weighting scheme used for advection produces numerical dispersion with a dispersivity of 0 5 m with the selected grid spacing no solute decay was considered and the retardation factors were 1 in the fracture and 2 in the matrix each gridblock in the simulation has a volume of 1 m3 with a matrix diffusion area of 4 m2 and a characteristic diffusion length of 0 25 m additional model parameters are shown in table 1 the analytical and semi analytical solutions are compared in fig 1 with a pore velocity of 100 m yr in the absence of matrix diffusion the contaminant would move 5000 m in 50 years and it would be quickly swept out of the fracture during the flushing period with matrix diffusion the movement of the contaminant in the fracture is greatly reduced to the extent that after 50 years of transport the contaminant has moved only a few tens of m from the source during the 150 year flushing period concentrations in the fracture remain high due the back diffusion and the solute is still found within a few tens of m of the source the semi analytical method compares very favorably with the analytical solution for this problem where the transport is almost completely dominated by matrix diffusion the favorable comparison extends over several log cycles of concentration to values below 1 μg l not shown 3 2 matrix diffusion in an aquitard with coupled first order parent daughter reactions falta and wang 2017 adapted the crank 1975 analytical solution for one dimensional diffusion with first order decay for diffusion in porous media with a step function source term that solution can be further extended to the case of coupled series of parent daughter chain decay reactions by using the biochlor analytic transform solution method aziz et al 2000 sun et al 1999 the modified crank solution was compared to the semi analytic solution using a single numerical gridblock to represent an aquifer that is adjacent to a semi infinite aquitard for a case where pce decays to tce to dce to vc at time zero the concentration of pce in the aquifer gridblock is raised from 0 to 100 mg l and it is maintained at that level by injecting water into the gridblock with that concentration at a high rate no decay of the pce occurs in the aquifer gridblock the pce diffuses into the aquitard using the semi analytic method where it decays to produce tce then dce then vc the aquitard was given a porosity of 0 45 and a tortuosity of 0 30 this value of tortuosity is representative of a fine grained silt or clay aquitard carey et al 2016 the molecular diffusion coefficient was set to 1 10 9 m2 s the retardation factors for all 4 components were 2 and the decay rates were 0 0693 yr 1 a ten year half life the yield coefficients for the pce tce tce dce and dce vc transformations were set to the ratio of molecular weight 0 795 0 737 and 0 640 respectively the analytical and semi analytical solutions after 50 years of diffusion are compared in fig 2 because the semi analytical solution only used one gridblock the 50 year simulation ran in a few milliseconds the semi analytical curves in this figure were computed using the concentration fitting functions eq 3 with the computed values of c m d m p m and q m at 50 years as the pce diffuses into the aquitard it decays to produce tce which in turn produces dce which produces vc since the concentrations of tce and other daughter products are maintained at zero in the aquifer gridblock by the rapid flushing with water only containing pce these components are actively back diffusing into the aquifer while the pce is undergoing forward diffusion the semi analytical approach appears to match the exact solution well in this comparison especially near the interface with the high permeability zone in addition to the tests with analytical solutions shown here and in falta and wang 2017 we have conducted extensive mass balance tests on the semi analytic method these numerical tests involve 3d numerical grids with tens of thousands of elements with transport that is dominated by matrix diffusion and daughter product generation in the low permeability domain these mass balance tests were set up with simplified source concentration terms so that the mass discharge and total mass in the system at any time is known in each case we have found that the global mass balance error is extremely small and is comparable to the convergence tolerance used in the gauss siedel iterative solution to eq 26 this excellent mass balance behavior is due to the enforcement of the mass balance constraint eq 7 and the fact that the concentration integrals of each component in each gridblock are stored at the end of each time step for use in the next time step 4 comparisons with experimental results in this section the matrix diffusion semi analytical method is compared to experimental results from two published studies both studies consisted of laboratory scale tracer experiments with concentrations sources that were maintained for a period of time followed by a period of flushing with clean water 4 1 matrix diffusion in a thin clay layer yang et al 2015 conducted laboratory scale tracer experiments to study forward and back diffusion in a thin clay layer overlying a sand layer in a 28 1 2 12 cm flow chamber yang et al 2014 the first experiment i was carried out as shown in fig 3 a 4 cm thick sand layer was placed at the bottom of the flow chamber followed by a 6 cm thick layer of kaolinite clay a solution containing 200 mg l of bromide was flushed through the sand at a rate of 0 018 ml min for 22 days immediately after the tracer injection flushing continued with clean water for 32 days the experiment was repeated experiment iii using a sand thickness of 3 cm and a clay thickness of 2 cm the tracer solution was flushed for 10 days followed by clean water for 30 days the solution was injected at a flow rate of 0 01 ml min in that test the semi analytical method was used to simulate these experiments using a simple 1 d numerical grid with 20 gridblocks in the horizontal x direction the direction of flow each gridblock includes both the sand and the clay but flow only occurs in the sand with matrix diffusion in the clay the bromide concentrations were initialized to zero at time zero the inlet bromide concentration was set to 200 mg l and maintained at this value for 22 and 10 days for experiments i and iii respectively to account for the flushing with clean water the inlet concentration was set to zero again for 32 and 30 days respectively the darcy velocity is calculated as the volumetric flow rate divided by the cross sectional area of flow that is q divided by δyδz where δy represents the thickness of the sandtank and δz represents the height of the tank the matrix diffusion area in each gridblock a md is the interfacial area between the high permeability and low permeability zones for the simple 2 layer clay sand configuration the matrix diffusion area corresponds to the product of the grid spacing in the x and y directions δx and δy respectively the sand volume fraction v f is defined as the ratio of the sand layer volume product of δx δy and thickness of sand to the total volume product of δx δy and δz generally the characteristic average maximum diffusion length parameter l corresponds to the one half of the depth or vertical thickness of the low permeability clay because this configuration shows only one sand clay interface with a no flow boundary the characteristic diffusion length is equal to the total thickness of the clay layer the input parameters for the model were obtained directly and calculated from yang et al 2015 and yang and jawitz personal communication 2016 they are listed in table 2 the effluent breakthrough curves obtained by yang et al 2015 for experiments i and iii are shown in fig 4 where the x axis is expressed as produced pore volumes two graphs are shown for each experiment in linear and log scale the bromide concentration sharply decreases after the source is removed at 14 3 pv and 4 8 pv for experiments i and iii respectively this is followed by tailing behavior shown in fig 4 the experiment i used a clay thickness of 6 cm and for the experimental conditions the clay layer acts almost like an infinite thickness layer in that case yang et al 2015 were able to match this experimental result with an analytical solution using a single image source to account for the no flow reflection boundary at the top of the flow cell their experiment iii used a clay thickness of 2 cm and shows a strong boundary effect from the no flow boundary at the top of the cell yang et al 2015 were able to capture this behavior in their analytical solution using six or more image sources to account for the reflection boundary the semi analytical model appears to capture the matrix diffusion effects seen in both experiments fig 4 the calculated coefficient of determination is 0 879 for experiment i and 0 866 for experiment iii the visual comparison and coefficients of determination suggest a good fit of the experimental data there are small differences between the semi analytical model and the experimental data at the leading edge of the curve in experiment i and after removing the source for experiment iii but the overall match between the two curves is close 4 2 matrix diffusion with embedded low permeability zones doner 2008 carried out a set of laboratory experiments at using a 1 07 0 03 0 84 m tank filled with sand and four embedded clay lenses a tracer solution containing 400 mg l of fluorescein and 90 mg l of bromide was flushed through the sandbox for 22 days followed by flushing of clean water for 100 more days the flow rate during the experiment was not constant during the first 10 days the solution flowed through the sandbox at a rate of 0 9 ml min and it was later increased to and held constant at 1 5 ml min the setup of the sandbox experiment is shown in fig 5 with the approximate dimension of the clay lenses determined from digitization rohatgi 2017 and scaling chapman et al 2012 simulated this experiment numerically to study the validity of several high resolution 2 d numerical models to simulate diffusion in and out of low permeability areas the tested models showed close matches to the experimental data but required fine grids 9000 24 000 gridblocks and temporal discretization the semi analytical model of this experiment was built as a 1 d model with 50 gridblocks in the horizontal x direction to simulate the high permeability zone with an embedded matrix diffusion area representing the clay lenses the matrix diffusion area for each of the clay lenses is the lens perimeter times the thickness of the sandbox the total matrix diffusion area is the sum of the individual lens matrix diffusion areas and it was estimated as 0 193 m2 with 50 gridblocks this gives an interfacial area per gridblock a md of 3 85 10 3 m2 the high low permeability zone ratio was specified as the volume fraction the volume of sand required for the volume fraction was computed from the overall sand area 0 26 m2 specified in chapman et al 2012 the estimated sand volume fraction v f was 0 711 the experiment was carried out with a variable volumetric rate and the current numerical formulation of the semi analytical method uses a constant value the value of 1 5 ml min was chosen to be used in the semi analytical method for the calculation of the darcy velocity because it was implemented for a longer period of time during the sandbox testing the maximum average diffusion length l is a complex parameter to establish directly for this experiment since all the clay lenses have different shapes however it can be estimated from the volume fraction and interfacial area using eq 27 which represents a volume balance on the clay based on this calculation the characteristic average diffusion length was estimated as 4 05 cm the input parameters for the semi analytical model are presented in table 3 they are the same for both bromide and fluorescein except for the diffusion coefficients and sand retardation factors the matrix tortuosity value of 0 3 was estimated from carey et al 2016 the parameter values other than a md and l were obtained and calculated from chapman et al 2012 and doner 2008 at time zero the inlet bromide and fluorescein concentrations were set to the specified values in table 3 maintaining these concentrations constant for 22 days after this time the tracer inlet concentrations were reset to zero for 100 more days the simulation results are compared to the experimental data in fig 6 the concentration profiles for the experimental data in fig 6 show a sharp rise and decrease of concentration after the sudden occurrence of the tracer solutions at time zero and later on after the removal of the tracer source at 22 days followed by a tailing effect on the graphs at later times there is a shift to the left in the leading edge of the bromide and fluorescein curves caused by the difference of volumetric flow rates between the experiment and the semi analytical model by choosing the higher volumetric rate for the semi analytical model the expected effluent concentrations during the first 10 days of the experiment are achieved at a faster time the coefficient of determination for the simulated bromide breakthrough curve is 0 66 and for the fluorescein breakthrough curve r2 0 88 additional simulations were performed using larger and smaller values of l but these did not substantially improve the match with experimental data compared to the initial estimated value of l 5 comparison with 3 d fine grid numerical simulations a set of fine grid numerical flow and transport simulations were run using highly heterogeneous 3d grids these synthetic examples are intended to mimic the solute transport behavior at real sites that have interlayered zones of sands and clays the transport in these simulations is strongly influenced by matrix diffusion resulting in extensive tailing of concentrations after a contaminant source is removed these fine grid model scenarios were then replicated with much coarser homogeneous numerical grids using the semi analytical method to model the subgridblock scale matrix diffusion two highly heterogeneous scenarios were created using the t progs transition probability statistics program carle 1999 the hypothetical site geology was created modifying the t progs borehole data from an aquaveo gms example aquaveo 2016 resulting in boreholes representative of a sand clay system that is dominated by clay the generated heterogeneous sand clay distribution was an input to modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 for the flow field and transport simulations respectively two distinct heterogeneity configurations were generated with the t progs simulations one of them consisted of a system with long horizontally connected sand zones to ensure groundwater flow through the model referred to as the lens case the second configuration used a more random but still spatially correlated distribution of materials in all directions referred to as the random case the 3 d grid used for both cases was the same with an extent of 1052 84 m in x direction 615 7 m in the y direction and 41 15 m in the vertical direction the grid spacing in the x direction was 10 42 m and it was 8 80 m in the y direction the grid spacing in the vertical direction was set to 10 cm based on a grid refinement exercise previously carried out muskus 2017 the resulting numerical grid contains 2 828 000 gridblocks and it is computationally demanding to run the simulations requiring hours or even days for each transport simulation 5 1 lens case 5 1 1 modflow mt3dms model after loading the synthetic borehole data into gms aquaveo 2017 and the t progs module the transition data were calculated using t progs the sand proportion was set as 28 82 so the clay proportion was automatically set as 71 18 the average sand lens thickness in the vertical direction was 0 61 m the lens ratios are defined as the lens length in the desired direction divided by the lens thickness for the sand this parameter was set to 118 67 for the horizontal ratio and the default value of 10 for the dip y lens ratio t progs automatically set the clay parameters with 2 73 m for the average lens thickness the horizontal lens ratio as 65 50 and the dip lens ratio as 5 52 the material set generated for the lens case is shown in fig 7 and displays elongated sand zones in the horizontal direction as discussed before the vertical magnification was set as 2 in order to have a better view of the material distribution in order to create the flow field the hydraulic conductivity was set as 9 14 m d for the sand and 3 05 10 4 m d for the low permeability clay constant hydraulic head conditions were maintained at the two ends of the model to maintain a hydraulic gradient of 0 00975 the modflow flow model was run to steady state producing an average darcy velocity of 5 614 m yr the modflow simulation took about 17 min in a workstation with an intel i7 cpu at 3 60 ghz and provided the head contours shown in fig 8 the modflow flow field was used for the mt3dms transport simulation the mt3dms simulation considers advection and diffusion with minimal hydrodynamic dispersion the advective flux was computed using upstream weighting and the effective diffusion coefficient the product of the diffusion coefficient and the tortuosity was set to 0 025 m2 yr attempting to run the model with zero values for the dispersivities resulted in numerical errors so the longitudinal dispersivity was set to 1 cm and the transverse and vertical dispersivities set to 1 mm the simulation time for the mass transport model was a total of 230 years a tce source of 10 000 μg l was placed slightly downstream from the model inlet column 15 and water was allowed to flow through the source this location was chosen to reduce the observed lateral dispersion of the plume when the source was located in the first column of the model where a constant head is maintained the contamination source was laid out over a total area of 36 19 m2 comprised by two cells in the y direction and 20 cells in the z direction the constant concentration condition was set only in the sand cells of the source area represented in fig 9 as blue triangles and outlined by the red square the tce source was maintained constant for 30 years at which point it was removed and followed by advective flushing for 200 years with a time step of 0 02 years the tce retardation factor was set to one and no decay was considered due to the size and fine discretization of the numerical model a large computational effort was necessary to run the transport simulation this resulted in several hours 6 8 h for the mass transport simulation with the tce source present and up to 45 h for the simulation of advective flushing 5 1 2 semi analytical model the implementation of the semi analytical method was performed with the fortran formulation of remchlor md for the embedded heterogeneity case the semi analytical method works under the assumption that the high permeability zone is well mixed therefore the semi analytical model uses a homogeneous uniform velocity in the transmissive zone in this formulation of remchlor md only half of the model in the y dir is being simulated due to assumed symmetry about y 0 the approach followed to set up the semi analytical model was to fit the approximated area of the source in mt3dms into one active gridblock of the semi analytical model making sure that the mass discharge from the source in the semi analytical model matched the mt3dms value this was accomplished by modifying the initial concentration of tce in the source gridblock based on the mass discharge observed in the fine grid mt3dms model the source concentration in the semi analytical model source element was maintained at 4341 μg l during the 30 year loading period the grid spacing in the horizontal flow direction was set to 20 85 m using 44 gridblocks for the y direction nine cells were used with δy 17 59 m the model had 18 layers with a vertical spacing of 1 85 m resulting in a much coarser grid than the mt3dms model with 7128 gridblocks equivalent to 14 256 gridblocks for a full model in the y direction the darcy velocity used in the semi analytical model was calculated as the average between the darcy flux in the inlet and outlet face of the modflow model a value of 5 614 m yr the source was placed in the upstream end of the model in the center of the grid the parameters for transport in the transmissive zone were set equal to the values used in the mt3dms modflow model with the exception of the transverse and vertical dispersivities which were set to 0 5 m and 5 10 3 m respectively these two parameters used larger values than the mt3dms model to account for the lateral and vertical dispersion caused by the strong heterogeneity the values for the transverse and vertical dispersivities were calibrated with the plume extents from the mt3dms simulation a trial and error procedure was followed assigning different values for α y and α z until the tce concentration contours in plan and cross sectional view from the semi analytical model resembled those from mt3dms properties like porosity tortuosity and retardation factor in the low permeability zone were set equal to the values in the mt3dms model the molecular diffusion coefficient for tce is the same as used before 3 15 10 2 m2 yr the sand volume fraction was set to the 0 288 sand proportion stated in t progs to estimate the average diffusion length three randomly selected lateral faces of the model were chosen to determine the average thickness of clay layers each vertical column in the face was treated as a separate borehole and the thickness of clay in each borehole section was measured and recorded the clay thickness of the total cross sectional area was calculated as a volumetric weighted average to give more contribution to higher diffusion lengths to the averaged value since clay lenses usually have both top and bottom faces in contact with the transmissive zone diffusion into the clay from both faces is thought to meet in the middle of the low permeability lens thus the characteristic average diffusion length was calculated as half of the average clay thickness for each cross sectional area in the mt3dms modflow model resulting in an average value of 1 85 m using eq 27 the matrix diffusion area was estimated as 261 37 m2 in each gridblock a calibrated diffusion length of 1 5 m was also used with a correspondent a md 322 34 m2 using a time step of 0 5 years the fortran module of remchlor md ran in about 13 s for the 230 year simulation the plume contours of the mt3dms and the semi analytical model results were compared side by side to verify that the plume shape and extents are similar the tce concentration distribution from the remchlor md output file was input to surfer golden software 2017 to create 2 d concentration contour maps vertical and horizontal slices were made in the middle of both models at different times to have a better visualization and comparison of the concentration contours obtained this is observed in figs 10 and 11 which shows the contours for l 1 5 m the graph axis lengths are shown in units of feet 1 ft 0 3048 m in this figure the different tce contours in figs 10 and 11 show the evolution of the tce plume in time the visual comparisons suggest a very good correspondence between mt3dms and the semi analytical model given by the similar extents of each contour zone though the semi analytical model results are of course smoother due to the homogeneous conditions the fine grid contours in figs 10 and 11 depend on the which slice of gridblocks is chosen for plotting at early times figs 10a and 11a the tce appears at different locations in different slices of the fine grid model making it appear that the semi analytical model is over predicting concentration however both models have the plume mass at this time and if multiple slices of the fine grid model are superposed they look more similar to the semi analytical model the mt3dms and semi analytical model estimated mass discharge rates in the outlet face of the model last row x were compared and are shown in fig 12 for the initial and calibrated diffusion lengths of 1 85 m and 1 5 m respectively the comparison of the mass discharge rate graphs shows a fast rise and decrease of the mass discharge rate followed by tailing behavior corresponding to the trend observed in the effluent concentration profiles studied in previous sections the response of the model for the diffusion length of 1 85 m seems to be a bit too fast suggesting that the initial estimate for the matrix diffusion area was too small with l 1 5 m the mass discharge curve looks closer to the curve from the fine grid simulation showing an improvement from the simulation with the higher diffusion length the coefficient of determination for l 1 5 m was estimated as 0 974 versus 0 849 for l 1 85 m confirming the apparent improvement in the visual comparison the mass discharge at the outlet face can be converted to an average concentration in the high permeability zones by dividing the mass discharge by the water volumetric discharge calculated using the darcy velocity and area 5 2 random case 5 2 1 modflow mt3dms model as discussed before the grid and borehole data used for both the lens and random cases were the same the main difference between the two cases is the material distribution obtained from t progs the sand proportion for this case had to be increased to 35 to provide enough interconnected transmissive paths to allow significant flow through the model as with the lens case the thickness of the sand was set to 0 61 m to control vertical spreading of the contaminant plume the lens ratios for the horizontal and dip y direction were set as 18 and 7 5 respectively for the clay the t progs generated values were 2 73 m for the vertical lens length 7 471 for the lens ratio in x and 3 113 for the lens ratio in y using these parameters the material distribution shown in fig 13 was obtained the parameters used for the flow field generation and transport simulation were essentially the same as in the lens case the simulation time for the flushing period had to be increased to 400 years because of plume persistence other than the 400 year flushing period all the input parameters for the mt3dms simulation are the same as described previously the random case transport simulation with source on ran for 8 10 h in a workstation with an intel i7 cpu at 3 60 ghz the run time increased to 60 h for the clean water flushing simulation this is explained not only by the size and refinement of the model but also by the added 200 years of simulation in the flushing period 5 2 2 semi analytical model the semi analytical model for the random case was set up in the same way as the lens case however since the material distribution affects several variables the values input in the model differed the grid used for the random case had 44 cells in the horizontal direction with a δx 20 85 m 16 cells in the y direction with a grid spacing of 17 59 m and 14 layers with a vertical spacing of 2 88 m for a total of 9856 gridblocks 19 712 on a full model basis the average darcy velocity from the modflow simulation for this case was 2 697 m yr the lower value in comparison with the previous scenario happened most likely because the transmissive zone pathways are interrupted by low permeability zones with more frequency than before due to the randomized material distribution to maintain the same source mass discharge as the mt3dms model the tce source concentration was set to 6409 7 μg l in the source element as before the source placed in the middle layer at the upstream end of the model just as in the lens case the transverse and vertical dispersivities were calibrated with the fine grid numerical simulation plume extents several values of α y and α z were tried until the tce concentration contours from the mt3dms and semi analytical models were similar for α y 2 m and α z 0 014 m the sand volume fraction was set to the value from t progs 0 351 the diffusion length was estimated with the volume weighted mean procedure explained in the lens case resulting in a value 1 21 m the matrix diffusion area was then estimated from eq 27 as 564 89 m2 per gridblock the calibrated diffusion length was 1 35 m with a matrix diffusion area of 507 84 m2 as before the time step was 0 5 years and the number of time steps increased to 860 because of the longer flushing time used in the mt3dms model for the random case this model ran in 28 s on the same computer the longer run time with respect to the lens case was expected due to the bigger size of the random case model the side by side comparison of the contour plumes of the mt3dms and the semi analytical model for are shown in figs 14 and 15 these contours are representative of the calibrated diffusion length 1 35 m results and the layout of the graphs is the same as in the lens case showing front views plane xz and map views plane xy of the tce concentration contours at 10 years 30 years and 130 years the plume extents estimated with the semi analytical model display a good match to the mt3dms model contours and again the semi analytical model contours are smoother due to the homogeneous conditions and coarse grid the comparison of mass discharge rate at the outlet face over time between the mt3dms and the semi analytical models is shown in fig 16 for the uncalibrated and calibrated values of diffusion length the curves from both models display the fast rise and decrease of tce mass discharge rate followed by tailing behavior seen in the lens case the calculated coefficient of determination of 0 970 for the uncalibrated diffusion length of 1 21 m suggests that the response of the semi analytical model matches the overall behavior of the mass discharge rate in the random system however the semi analytical model curve is shifted slightly to the right indicating that the mass is leaving the random scenario at a slower pace than what the numerical simulation proposes the mass discharge rate curve for the calibrated diffusion length of 1 35 m appears closer to the data from the mt3dms model during the rise and decrease portions and it presents a smaller peak than the uncalibrated curve the calculated coefficient of determination of 0 993 supports the global improvement of the fit with the calibrated l 6 conclusions the semi analytical method from vinsome and westerveld 1980 was adapted to the process of matrix diffusion for finite embedded heterogeneity scenarios in groundwater chemical transport modeling the method was tested against analytical solutions experimental results from laboratory scale flow chamber studies and with fine grid numerical simulations using highly heterogeneous domains the results in each case showed good agreement demonstrating the utility of the matrix diffusion semi analytical numerical method even for systems with highly complex heterogeneities present three geometric parameters are used in the semi analytical method for finite embedded heterogeneities the high permeability material volume fraction v f the high low permeability material interface area a md and the average maximum diffusion length l a simple geometrical relationship was defined that relates the three parameters to reduce the number of unknowns to only two of the three the results obtained using this 2 parameter approach provided a decent match with the fine grid simulation data without calibration and a good match with small adjustments to l the semi analytical method implementation proved to be extremely efficient providing with run times ranging from fractions of seconds up to approximately half a minute depending on the size and resolution of the model and the simulated periods of time the method has been implemented in a screening level numerical model called remchlor md that considers uniform flow in a homogeneous system with matrix diffusion this model is available from the authors free of charge the semi analytical method presented here is well suited for use in any implicit numerical transport model because it can be added as an implicit concentration dependent source sink term to the discretized equations acknowledgements the authors would like to thank minjune yang and james jawitz at the university of florida for providing unpublished data and information about their matrix

1634,a semi analytical numerical method for modeling matrix diffusion in heterogeneous and fractured groundwater systems is developed this is a significant extension of the falta and wang 2017 method that only applied to diffusion in an aquitard of infinite thickness the current solution allows for the low permeability matrix to be embedded within a numerical gridblock having finite average thickness a specified volume fraction and a specified interfacial area with the high permeability domain the new formulation also allows for coupled parent daughter decay reactions with multiple species that each have independent retardation factors decay rates and yield coefficients in both the high and low permeability parts of the system the method uses a fitting function to approximate the transient concentration profile in the low permeability part of each gridblock so that the matrix diffusion flux into the high permeability part of the gridblock can be computed as a concentration dependent source sink term this approach is efficient because the only unknowns in each gridblock are the concentrations in the high permeability domain so there is practically no increase in computational effort compared to a conventional transport simulation the method is shown to compare favorably with an analytical solution for matrix diffusion in fractured media with parallel fractures with an analytical solution for matrix diffusion with parent daughter decay reactions with laboratory experiments of matrix diffusion in a layered system with a laboratory experiment involving lens shaped inclusions and with fine grid numerical simulations of transport in highly heterogeneous systems keywords matrix diffusion semi analytical numerical modeling 1 introduction groundwater has been contaminated at thousands of sites around the world as a result of leaks and spills of hazardous materials these primary sources of contamination are often referred to as source zones and they can lead to extensive dissolved contamination plumes secondary sources of contamination such as dissolved chemicals in low permeability zones result in plume persistence and limitations for plume remediation as a consequence of the process of matrix diffusion mackay and cherry 1989 chapman and parker 2005 matrix diffusion is the process of mass transfer of solutes between high permeability zones and surrounding low permeability zones due to a concentration gradient this process is known as forward diffusion when the transport is from high to low permeability zones forward diffusion takes place during a loading period usually when contaminants reach the aquifer after the contaminant source has been removed the concentration gradient reverses and diffusion goes from low to high permeability zones resulting in back diffusion liu and ball 2002 chapman and parker 2005 falta 2005 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008 therefore low permeability zones act as contaminant sinks first and later serve as contaminant sources to transmissive zones with flowing groundwater due to matrix diffusion mackay and cherry 1989 chapman and parker 2005 seyedabbasi et al 2012 back diffusion of contaminants from low permeability areas can result in plume persistence and severe limitations in remediation efforts chapman and parker 2005 rasa et al 2011 seyedabbasi et al 2012 yang et al 2015 there are analytical solutions available to model matrix diffusion tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 liu and ball 2002 sale et al 2008 yang et al 2015 however they are constrained to simple geometries corresponding to ideal cases numerical simulations studies of matrix diffusion chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 rasa et al 2011 chapman et al 2012 chapman and parker 2013 have shown the ability to reproduce the transient matrix diffusion effects it has been demonstrated that very fine discretization is required in order to reproduce the diffusive fluxes at the high permeability low permeability interfaces often controlled by concentration gradients at the scale of centimeters or less chapman et al 2012 high resolution grids result in an excessive computational effort that makes it difficult to use this approach for 3 dimensional field scale problems an alternative to the conventional numerical transport modeling approach uses a dual domain system with local one dimensional discretization of the low permeability zones this method was originally developed for heat and mass transfer in multiphase flow simulators by pruess and narasimhan 1985 and it was used by chen et al 2015 for modeling thermal remediation of chlorinated solvents in fractured rocks carey et al 2015 have implemented a similar formulation in a numerical groundwater transport model and they used it to simulate matrix diffusion a different modeling approach combines analytical and numerical modeling this method was developed in petroleum reservoir engineering to calculate heat conductive flux from a permeable reservoir to an impermeable caprock additionally it has been successfully used in fractured reservoir configurations the semi analytical method discretizes only the high permeability parts of the aquifer in the numerical model and the heat conduction flux is treated as a temperature dependent source sink term calculated analytically in each gridblock at every time step vinsome and westerveld 1980 pruess and wu 1988 pruess and wu 1993 this semi analytical method was adapted to the matrix diffusion process given that the matrix diffusion equations and heat conduction equations are analogous bear et al 1994 falta and wang 2017 falta and wang 2017 implemented the matrix diffusion semi analytical method for the case of an aquifer in contact with a thick aquitard with diffusion of a single solute that undergoes first order decay we have extended that method to the more general case of heterogeneous and fractured aquifers where the low permeability matrix volumes have a finite average thickness and where multiple solutes can undergo first order parent daughter decay reactions 2 matrix diffusion semi analytical method matrix diffusion in low permeability materials can be approximated as a one dimensional process that depends on the distance from the interface with the high permeability material z l the governing partial differential equations for transient matrix diffusion assuming first order decay of a component m 1 that produces a daughter compound m are 1 r lm c lm t τ l d 2 c lm z l 2 λ lm c lm m 1 2 r lm c lm t τ l d 2 c lm z l 2 y lm 1 λ lm 1 c lm 1 λ lm c lm m 1 here the subscript l refers to the low permeability material c lm is the aqueous mass concentration of component m in the low permeability material r lm is the retardation factor of component m τ l is the tortuosity d is the molecular diffusion coefficient λ lm is the first order decay rate of component m and y m 1 is the mass yield of daughter component m from parent compound m 1 eq 2 can be repeated for subsequent daughter products to form a complete decay chain for example at a site where tetrachloroethylene pce undergoes decay to form trichloroethylene tce and the tce decays to form cis 1 2 dichloroethylene dce which decays to form vinyl chloride vc pce would be the parent compound m 1 governed by eq 1 while tce dce and vc would be daughter compounds governed by eq 2 with m 2 3 and 4 respectively the semi analytical method is based on the thermal conduction approximation developed by vinsome and westerveld 1980 bear et al 1994 and falta and wang 2017 adapted the visnome and westerveld model to the problem of matrix diffusion in a semi infinite aquitard using the mathematical analogy between transient heat conduction and transient matrix diffusion the approach is based on the use of a fitting function to describe the concentration profile as a function of distance from the interface in the low permeability matrix 3 c lm z l t c m t δt p m z l q m z l 2 e z l d m where c m t δt is the current concentration of component m at the interface between high permeability and low permeability zones and p m and q m are fitting parameters the concentration c m t δt is the concentration that is solved for in each gridblock of a normal numerical simulation and it is assumed to represent the average concentration in the high permeability part of the gridblock the concentration penetration depth d m is defined by 4 d m κ lm t 2 κ lm τ l d r lm the zero level of the concentrations in eq 3 correspond to the initial uniform concentrations in the low permeability zone which is usually zero the fitting parameters p m and q m are determined by two conservation of mass laws the first constraint requires the fitting function to satisfy the governing equation at the high permeability low permeability interface 5 r lm c lm t τ l d 2 c lm z l 2 z l 0 y lm 1 λ lm 1 c lm 1 z l 0 λ l c lm z l 0 the component production term in eq 5 is only used for daughter products m 1 in order to discretize the equation a first order finite difference approximation is applied to the time derivative c lm and c lm 1 are replaced with the trial functions on the right hand side which results in 6 r lm c m t δt c m t δ t τ l d c m t δt d m 2 2 p m d m 2 q m y lm 1 λ lm 1 c m 1 t δt λ lm c m t δt the second constraint is the mass conservation of the components in the low permeability material this requires that the rate of change of total mass in the matrix is to equal the mass flux across the interface minus the rate of decay in the matrix plus the rate of production in the matrix for an ideal semi infinite aquitard case the integral of distance into low permeability areas is defined from zero to infinity falta and wang 2017 this study deals with finite embedded heterogeneities such as low permeability lenses and layers or fractured porous media with parallel fractures thus the mass conservation constraint must account for a finite diffusion distance the characteristic maximum diffusion length l corresponds to the average maximum depth or distance of diffusion into the low permeability material for a layered system l would be the half thickness of the low permeability layers and for a system of parallel fractures l would be equal to one half of the fracture spacing the low permeability matrix mass balance constraint becomes 7 r lm t 0 l c lm dz l τ l d c lm z l z l 0 y lm 1 λ lm 1 0 l c lm 1 dz l λ lm 0 l c lm dz l the concentration integrals in eq 7 are directly related to the mass of the components in the low permeability material the solution of the concentration integrals in eq 7 using the trial functions have the form 8 i m t 0 l c lm dz l c m t d m p m d m 2 2 q m d m 3 c m t d m p m d m l p

corresponding to the definition of i t in falta and wang 2017 replacing the time derivative in eq 7 with a finite difference approximation of the concentration integral and substituting c lm with the

aquifer gridblocks containing low permeability zones and they are updated at each time step to represent the changing concentration profile in the low permeability zones the concentration integral i m t δt is recalculated at every time step in every gridblock using eq 9 and it is stored for use in the next time step i m t for the special case of diffusion in a semi infinite aquitard with no reactions the formulation becomes equivalent to the original vinsome and westerveld 1980 method for heat conduction and to the bear et al 1994 method for diffusion 2 1 calculation of matrix diffusion mass flow the matrix diffusion mass flow entering or leaving the high permeability zone is described by fick s first law of diffusion substituting the low permeability material concentration by the trial function 19 m m a md ϕ l τ l d c lm z l z l 0 a md ϕ l τ l d c m t δt d m p m where ϕ l is the porosity of the low permeability material and a md is the matrix diffusion area defined as the interfacial area between the high permeability and low permeability zones eq 14 for p m can be rewritten as 20 p m a m c m t δ t b m t δt with 21 a m e m a m 2 κ lm δ t a m 2 d m 2 a m λ lm 2 r lm κ

is 23 m a md ϕ l τ l d a m 1 d m c m t δt b m t δt the matrix diffusion mass flow becomes a linearly concentration dependent source sink term added in the numerical transport model gridblocks that contain or are adjacent to low permeability materials the b m t δt term eq 22 that appears in the gradient expression for component m does not depend on the current concentration of m but it does depend on the previous concentration and integral of m as well as on the current concentration and integral of the parent compound m 1 the semi analytical approximation for matrix diffusion with a finite diffusion length does not force the concentration gradient at the symmetry boundary z l l to be zero this might seem to be a significant limitation of the formulation but we have not found that to be true in practice as evidenced by the comparisons in the following sections it appears that it is sufficient to accurately represent the concentration gradient at the interface and the mass balance in the low permeability material this observation is similar to that made by pruess and wu 1993 in their study of heat conduction in cubic matrix blocks using a similar semi analytic method they tried adding a cubic term to the fitting function so that the additional free parameter could be used to force the concentration gradient to be zero at z l l but found that this formulation gave less accurate results than the two parameter fitting function they observed that forcing the zero gradient condition at z l l resulted in a less accurate representation of the gradient at the interface 2 2 numerical formulation the diffusive mass flow given by eq 23 can be added to implicit numerical transport models as a concentration dependent source sink term a key aspect of this method is that the numerical method only solves the conservation of mass equations in the high permeability part of the model the low permeability mass balance is maintained by the time dependent concentration integrals for each component in each gridblock eq 9 there are two main geometrical configurations that are considered for the low permeability material for the case of a semi infinite aquitard that is adjacent to a high permeability aquifer the aquifer is treated normally in the numerical formulation and the matrix diffusion flux only occurs in the elements that are adjacent to the low permeability material falta and wang 2017 for the case of embedded low permeability heterogeneity or in fractured systems the volume fraction of the two materials in each gridblock must be specified denoting the volume fraction of the high permeability material as v f the volume of high permeability material in a gridblock of total volume v i would be v f v i using the integral finite difference method narasimhan and witherspoon 1976 the mass balance equation component m in the high permeability part of an element i is given by 24 v f v i dm i m dt j f ij m a ij q i m where m i m is the mass of component m per volume of high permeability material f ij m is the mass flux of m entering element i from neighboring elements j a ij is the interfacial area between elements i and elements j and q i m is an internal source sink term for m in element i this source sink term accounts for decay and production reactions in the high permeability part of the gridblock and for the matrix diffusion mass flow from the semi analytical method eq 23 the mass fluxes f m include advection and hydrodynamic dispersion freeze and cherry 1979 fetter 2008 hydrodynamic dispersion includes both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion the mass term for each component in the high permeability material is 25 m m ϕ r m c m here ϕ is the porosity of the high permeability material and r m is the solute retardation factor for component m in the high permeability material with the integral finite difference formulation it is possible to use both structured and unstructured grids see for example panday et al 2013 for the purpose of illustration the transport equation using the semi analytical approach was expressed for a three dimensional system using cartesian coordinates the system assumes uniform groundwater flow in the horizontal x direction and dispersion in all three directions i j k first order parent daughter decay production is considered in the aqueous phase part of the high permeability material a uniform grid with spacing of δx δy and δz is assumed along with a finite difference approximation for the concentration gradients in the dispersive fluxes and upstream weighting for the advective term under these conditions the discretized transport equation with a fully implicit formulation is 26 v f δ x δ y δ zϕ r m c i j k m t δ t c i j k m t δ t v x δ y

permeability material λ m is the aqueous decay rate in the high permeability material and y m 1 is the mass yield coefficient for production of m from decay of m 1 in the high permeability material the darcy velocity is defined on a total area basis including both media and the dispersive fluxes have been modified by including the high permeability volume fraction the equations for the m components are coupled by the daughter production terms in both the high permeability and low permeability parts of the system the matrix diffusion area and volume fraction depend on the nature of the matrix diffusion geometry if the gridblock does not contain any low permeability material but it is adjacent to a semi infinite aquitard v f is equal to 1 and a md δxδy if the gridblock contains low permeability material then v f 1 and a md and l are determined by the geometry the semi analytical method has 3 geometrical parameters but these can be reduced to two parameters by considering that the volume of low permeability material in a gridblock should be equal to the product of the matrix diffusion area and the characteristic average maximum diffusion length then for a total volume of v i 27 v i 1 v f a md l and only two of the three parameters need to be specified eq 26 gives a system of linear equations that can be solved by various methods in the present work a fortran program was written using the gauss siedel iterative method during each iteration the computational method first updates the parent compound m 1 in a gridblock followed by the daughter products m 2 3 4 before moving to the next gridblock with this ordering the component production terms are calculated using the updated value of the parent concentration c m 1 t δt in each gridblock a graphical user interface has been developed for the fortran program by farhat et al 2018 and the resulting model called remchlor md is available free of charge 3 comparisons with analytical solutions the earlier formulation for matrix diffusion in semi infinite aquitards was tested extensively by falta and wang 2017 here we compare the new formulation for matrix diffusion with an analytical solution for matrix diffusion in fractured porous media with parallel fractures and with a solution for diffusion with a series of parent daughter decay reactions 3 1 matrix diffusion in a system with parallel fractures sudicky and frind 1982 developed an analytical solution for transport in a fractured system with a single set of parallel fractures and matrix diffusion their solution is implemented in the craflush and crafit computer programs toran 2000 which were used for the comparison the simulation considers the introduction of a dissolved contaminant at 100 mg l at the upstream end of a system of parallel fractures the fracture spacing is 0 5 m and each fracture has an aperture of 100 μm the pore velocity in the fractures was set to 100 m yr which is equivalent to a darcy velocity of 0 02 m yr due to the very small area of the fractures relative to the total area with this geometry the volume fraction of the high permeability material the fractures is only 0 0002 the 100 mg l source is maintained for a period of 50 years before it is removed and the system is flushed with clean water for an additional 150 years the semi analytical model was set up as a 1 d system with 200 gridblocks using a gridblock spacing of 1 m and a time step of 0 1 yr the grid dimensions in the y and z directions were 1 m a longitudinal dispersivity of 0 5 m was used in the sudicky and frind model but that value was set to zero in the semi analytic model because the upstream weighting scheme used for advection produces numerical dispersion with a dispersivity of 0 5 m with the selected grid spacing no solute decay was considered and the retardation factors were 1 in the fracture and 2 in the matrix each gridblock in the simulation has a volume of 1 m3 with a matrix diffusion area of 4 m2 and a characteristic diffusion length of 0 25 m additional model parameters are shown in table 1 the analytical and semi analytical solutions are compared in fig 1 with a pore velocity of 100 m yr in the absence of matrix diffusion the contaminant would move 5000 m in 50 years and it would be quickly swept out of the fracture during the flushing period with matrix diffusion the movement of the contaminant in the fracture is greatly reduced to the extent that after 50 years of transport the contaminant has moved only a few tens of m from the source during the 150 year flushing period concentrations in the fracture remain high due the back diffusion and the solute is still found within a few tens of m of the source the semi analytical method compares very favorably with the analytical solution for this problem where the transport is almost completely dominated by matrix diffusion the favorable comparison extends over several log cycles of concentration to values below 1 μg l not shown 3 2 matrix diffusion in an aquitard with coupled first order parent daughter reactions falta and wang 2017 adapted the crank 1975 analytical solution for one dimensional diffusion with first order decay for diffusion in porous media with a step function source term that solution can be further extended to the case of coupled series of parent daughter chain decay reactions by using the biochlor analytic transform solution method aziz et al 2000 sun et al 1999 the modified crank solution was compared to the semi analytic solution using a single numerical gridblock to represent an aquifer that is adjacent to a semi infinite aquitard for a case where pce decays to tce to dce to vc at time zero the concentration of pce in the aquifer gridblock is raised from 0 to 100 mg l and it is maintained at that level by injecting water into the gridblock with that concentration at a high rate no decay of the pce occurs in the aquifer gridblock the pce diffuses into the aquitard using the semi analytic method where it decays to produce tce then dce then vc the aquitard was given a porosity of 0 45 and a tortuosity of 0 30 this value of tortuosity is representative of a fine grained silt or clay aquitard carey et al 2016 the molecular diffusion coefficient was set to 1 10 9 m2 s the retardation factors for all 4 components were 2 and the decay rates were 0 0693 yr 1 a ten year half life the yield coefficients for the pce tce tce dce and dce vc transformations were set to the ratio of molecular weight 0 795 0 737 and 0 640 respectively the analytical and semi analytical solutions after 50 years of diffusion are compared in fig 2 because the semi analytical solution only used one gridblock the 50 year simulation ran in a few milliseconds the semi analytical curves in this figure were computed using the concentration fitting functions eq 3 with the computed values of c m d m p m and q m at 50 years as the pce diffuses into the aquitard it decays to produce tce which in turn produces dce which produces vc since the concentrations of tce and other daughter products are maintained at zero in the aquifer gridblock by the rapid flushing with water only containing pce these components are actively back diffusing into the aquifer while the pce is undergoing forward diffusion the semi analytical approach appears to match the exact solution well in this comparison especially near the interface with the high permeability zone in addition to the tests with analytical solutions shown here and in falta and wang 2017 we have conducted extensive mass balance tests on the semi analytic method these numerical tests involve 3d numerical grids with tens of thousands of elements with transport that is dominated by matrix diffusion and daughter product generation in the low permeability domain these mass balance tests were set up with simplified source concentration terms so that the mass discharge and total mass in the system at any time is known in each case we have found that the global mass balance error is extremely small and is comparable to the convergence tolerance used in the gauss siedel iterative solution to eq 26 this excellent mass balance behavior is due to the enforcement of the mass balance constraint eq 7 and the fact that the concentration integrals of each component in each gridblock are stored at the end of each time step for use in the next time step 4 comparisons with experimental results in this section the matrix diffusion semi analytical method is compared to experimental results from two published studies both studies consisted of laboratory scale tracer experiments with concentrations sources that were maintained for a period of time followed by a period of flushing with clean water 4 1 matrix diffusion in a thin clay layer yang et al 2015 conducted laboratory scale tracer experiments to study forward and back diffusion in a thin clay layer overlying a sand layer in a 28 1 2 12 cm flow chamber yang et al 2014 the first experiment i was carried out as shown in fig 3 a 4 cm thick sand layer was placed at the bottom of the flow chamber followed by a 6 cm thick layer of kaolinite clay a solution containing 200 mg l of bromide was flushed through the sand at a rate of 0 018 ml min for 22 days immediately after the tracer injection flushing continued with clean water for 32 days the experiment was repeated experiment iii using a sand thickness of 3 cm and a clay thickness of 2 cm the tracer solution was flushed for 10 days followed by clean water for 30 days the solution was injected at a flow rate of 0 01 ml min in that test the semi analytical method was used to simulate these experiments using a simple 1 d numerical grid with 20 gridblocks in the horizontal x direction the direction of flow each gridblock includes both the sand and the clay but flow only occurs in the sand with matrix diffusion in the clay the bromide concentrations were initialized to zero at time zero the inlet bromide concentration was set to 200 mg l and maintained at this value for 22 and 10 days for experiments i and iii respectively to account for the flushing with clean water the inlet concentration was set to zero again for 32 and 30 days respectively the darcy velocity is calculated as the volumetric flow rate divided by the cross sectional area of flow that is q divided by δyδz where δy represents the thickness of the sandtank and δz represents the height of the tank the matrix diffusion area in each gridblock a md is the interfacial area between the high permeability and low permeability zones for the simple 2 layer clay sand configuration the matrix diffusion area corresponds to the product of the grid spacing in the x and y directions δx and δy respectively the sand volume fraction v f is defined as the ratio of the sand layer volume product of δx δy and thickness of sand to the total volume product of δx δy and δz generally the characteristic average maximum diffusion length parameter l corresponds to the one half of the depth or vertical thickness of the low permeability clay because this configuration shows only one sand clay interface with a no flow boundary the characteristic diffusion length is equal to the total thickness of the clay layer the input parameters for the model were obtained directly and calculated from yang et al 2015 and yang and jawitz personal communication 2016 they are listed in table 2 the effluent breakthrough curves obtained by yang et al 2015 for experiments i and iii are shown in fig 4 where the x axis is expressed as produced pore volumes two graphs are shown for each experiment in linear and log scale the bromide concentration sharply decreases after the source is removed at 14 3 pv and 4 8 pv for experiments i and iii respectively this is followed by tailing behavior shown in fig 4 the experiment i used a clay thickness of 6 cm and for the experimental conditions the clay layer acts almost like an infinite thickness layer in that case yang et al 2015 were able to match this experimental result with an analytical solution using a single image source to account for the no flow reflection boundary at the top of the flow cell their experiment iii used a clay thickness of 2 cm and shows a strong boundary effect from the no flow boundary at the top of the cell yang et al 2015 were able to capture this behavior in their analytical solution using six or more image sources to account for the reflection boundary the semi analytical model appears to capture the matrix diffusion effects seen in both experiments fig 4 the calculated coefficient of determination is 0 879 for experiment i and 0 866 for experiment iii the visual comparison and coefficients of determination suggest a good fit of the experimental data there are small differences between the semi analytical model and the experimental data at the leading edge of the curve in experiment i and after removing the source for experiment iii but the overall match between the two curves is close 4 2 matrix diffusion with embedded low permeability zones doner 2008 carried out a set of laboratory experiments at using a 1 07 0 03 0 84 m tank filled with sand and four embedded clay lenses a tracer solution containing 400 mg l of fluorescein and 90 mg l of bromide was flushed through the sandbox for 22 days followed by flushing of clean water for 100 more days the flow rate during the experiment was not constant during the first 10 days the solution flowed through the sandbox at a rate of 0 9 ml min and it was later increased to and held constant at 1 5 ml min the setup of the sandbox experiment is shown in fig 5 with the approximate dimension of the clay lenses determined from digitization rohatgi 2017 and scaling chapman et al 2012 simulated this experiment numerically to study the validity of several high resolution 2 d numerical models to simulate diffusion in and out of low permeability areas the tested models showed close matches to the experimental data but required fine grids 9000 24 000 gridblocks and temporal discretization the semi analytical model of this experiment was built as a 1 d model with 50 gridblocks in the horizontal x direction to simulate the high permeability zone with an embedded matrix diffusion area representing the clay lenses the matrix diffusion area for each of the clay lenses is the lens perimeter times the thickness of the sandbox the total matrix diffusion area is the sum of the individual lens matrix diffusion areas and it was estimated as 0 193 m2 with 50 gridblocks this gives an interfacial area per gridblock a md of 3 85 10 3 m2 the high low permeability zone ratio was specified as the volume fraction the volume of sand required for the volume fraction was computed from the overall sand area 0 26 m2 specified in chapman et al 2012 the estimated sand volume fraction v f was 0 711 the experiment was carried out with a variable volumetric rate and the current numerical formulation of the semi analytical method uses a constant value the value of 1 5 ml min was chosen to be used in the semi analytical method for the calculation of the darcy velocity because it was implemented for a longer period of time during the sandbox testing the maximum average diffusion length l is a complex parameter to establish directly for this experiment since all the clay lenses have different shapes however it can be estimated from the volume fraction and interfacial area using eq 27 which represents a volume balance on the clay based on this calculation the characteristic average diffusion length was estimated as 4 05 cm the input parameters for the semi analytical model are presented in table 3 they are the same for both bromide and fluorescein except for the diffusion coefficients and sand retardation factors the matrix tortuosity value of 0 3 was estimated from carey et al 2016 the parameter values other than a md and l were obtained and calculated from chapman et al 2012 and doner 2008 at time zero the inlet bromide and fluorescein concentrations were set to the specified values in table 3 maintaining these concentrations constant for 22 days after this time the tracer inlet concentrations were reset to zero for 100 more days the simulation results are compared to the experimental data in fig 6 the concentration profiles for the experimental data in fig 6 show a sharp rise and decrease of concentration after the sudden occurrence of the tracer solutions at time zero and later on after the removal of the tracer source at 22 days followed by a tailing effect on the graphs at later times there is a shift to the left in the leading edge of the bromide and fluorescein curves caused by the difference of volumetric flow rates between the experiment and the semi analytical model by choosing the higher volumetric rate for the semi analytical model the expected effluent concentrations during the first 10 days of the experiment are achieved at a faster time the coefficient of determination for the simulated bromide breakthrough curve is 0 66 and for the fluorescein breakthrough curve r2 0 88 additional simulations were performed using larger and smaller values of l but these did not substantially improve the match with experimental data compared to the initial estimated value of l 5 comparison with 3 d fine grid numerical simulations a set of fine grid numerical flow and transport simulations were run using highly heterogeneous 3d grids these synthetic examples are intended to mimic the solute transport behavior at real sites that have interlayered zones of sands and clays the transport in these simulations is strongly influenced by matrix diffusion resulting in extensive tailing of concentrations after a contaminant source is removed these fine grid model scenarios were then replicated with much coarser homogeneous numerical grids using the semi analytical method to model the subgridblock scale matrix diffusion two highly heterogeneous scenarios were created using the t progs transition probability statistics program carle 1999 the hypothetical site geology was created modifying the t progs borehole data from an aquaveo gms example aquaveo 2016 resulting in boreholes representative of a sand clay system that is dominated by clay the generated heterogeneous sand clay distribution was an input to modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 for the flow field and transport simulations respectively two distinct heterogeneity configurations were generated with the t progs simulations one of them consisted of a system with long horizontally connected sand zones to ensure groundwater flow through the model referred to as the lens case the second configuration used a more random but still spatially correlated distribution of materials in all directions referred to as the random case the 3 d grid used for both cases was the same with an extent of 1052 84 m in x direction 615 7 m in the y direction and 41 15 m in the vertical direction the grid spacing in the x direction was 10 42 m and it was 8 80 m in the y direction the grid spacing in the vertical direction was set to 10 cm based on a grid refinement exercise previously carried out muskus 2017 the resulting numerical grid contains 2 828 000 gridblocks and it is computationally demanding to run the simulations requiring hours or even days for each transport simulation 5 1 lens case 5 1 1 modflow mt3dms model after loading the synthetic borehole data into gms aquaveo 2017 and the t progs module the transition data were calculated using t progs the sand proportion was set as 28 82 so the clay proportion was automatically set as 71 18 the average sand lens thickness in the vertical direction was 0 61 m the lens ratios are defined as the lens length in the desired direction divided by the lens thickness for the sand this parameter was set to 118 67 for the horizontal ratio and the default value of 10 for the dip y lens ratio t progs automatically set the clay parameters with 2 73 m for the average lens thickness the horizontal lens ratio as 65 50 and the dip lens ratio as 5 52 the material set generated for the lens case is shown in fig 7 and displays elongated sand zones in the horizontal direction as discussed before the vertical magnification was set as 2 in order to have a better view of the material distribution in order to create the flow field the hydraulic conductivity was set as 9 14 m d for the sand and 3 05 10 4 m d for the low permeability clay constant hydraulic head conditions were maintained at the two ends of the model to maintain a hydraulic gradient of 0 00975 the modflow flow model was run to steady state producing an average darcy velocity of 5 614 m yr the modflow simulation took about 17 min in a workstation with an intel i7 cpu at 3 60 ghz and provided the head contours shown in fig 8 the modflow flow field was used for the mt3dms transport simulation the mt3dms simulation considers advection and diffusion with minimal hydrodynamic dispersion the advective flux was computed using upstream weighting and the effective diffusion coefficient the product of the diffusion coefficient and the tortuosity was set to 0 025 m2 yr attempting to run the model with zero values for the dispersivities resulted in numerical errors so the longitudinal dispersivity was set to 1 cm and the transverse and vertical dispersivities set to 1 mm the simulation time for the mass transport model was a total of 230 years a tce source of 10 000 μg l was placed slightly downstream from the model inlet column 15 and water was allowed to flow through the source this location was chosen to reduce the observed lateral dispersion of the plume when the source was located in the first column of the model where a constant head is maintained the contamination source was laid out over a total area of 36 19 m2 comprised by two cells in the y direction and 20 cells in the z direction the constant concentration condition was set only in the sand cells of the source area represented in fig 9 as blue triangles and outlined by the red square the tce source was maintained constant for 30 years at which point it was removed and followed by advective flushing for 200 years with a time step of 0 02 years the tce retardation factor was set to one and no decay was considered due to the size and fine discretization of the numerical model a large computational effort was necessary to run the transport simulation this resulted in several hours 6 8 h for the mass transport simulation with the tce source present and up to 45 h for the simulation of advective flushing 5 1 2 semi analytical model the implementation of the semi analytical method was performed with the fortran formulation of remchlor md for the embedded heterogeneity case the semi analytical method works under the assumption that the high permeability zone is well mixed therefore the semi analytical model uses a homogeneous uniform velocity in the transmissive zone in this formulation of remchlor md only half of the model in the y dir is being simulated due to assumed symmetry about y 0 the approach followed to set up the semi analytical model was to fit the approximated area of the source in mt3dms into one active gridblock of the semi analytical model making sure that the mass discharge from the source in the semi analytical model matched the mt3dms value this was accomplished by modifying the initial concentration of tce in the source gridblock based on the mass discharge observed in the fine grid mt3dms model the source concentration in the semi analytical model source element was maintained at 4341 μg l during the 30 year loading period the grid spacing in the horizontal flow direction was set to 20 85 m using 44 gridblocks for the y direction nine cells were used with δy 17 59 m the model had 18 layers with a vertical spacing of 1 85 m resulting in a much coarser grid than the mt3dms model with 7128 gridblocks equivalent to 14 256 gridblocks for a full model in the y direction the darcy velocity used in the semi analytical model was calculated as the average between the darcy flux in the inlet and outlet face of the modflow model a value of 5 614 m yr the source was placed in the upstream end of the model in the center of the grid the parameters for transport in the transmissive zone were set equal to the values used in the mt3dms modflow model with the exception of the transverse and vertical dispersivities which were set to 0 5 m and 5 10 3 m respectively these two parameters used larger values than the mt3dms model to account for the lateral and vertical dispersion caused by the strong heterogeneity the values for the transverse and vertical dispersivities were calibrated with the plume extents from the mt3dms simulation a trial and error procedure was followed assigning different values for α y and α z until the tce concentration contours in plan and cross sectional view from the semi analytical model resembled those from mt3dms properties like porosity tortuosity and retardation factor in the low permeability zone were set equal to the values in the mt3dms model the molecular diffusion coefficient for tce is the same as used before 3 15 10 2 m2 yr the sand volume fraction was set to the 0 288 sand proportion stated in t progs to estimate the average diffusion length three randomly selected lateral faces of the model were chosen to determine the average thickness of clay layers each vertical column in the face was treated as a separate borehole and the thickness of clay in each borehole section was measured and recorded the clay thickness of the total cross sectional area was calculated as a volumetric weighted average to give more contribution to higher diffusion lengths to the averaged value since clay lenses usually have both top and bottom faces in contact with the transmissive zone diffusion into the clay from both faces is thought to meet in the middle of the low permeability lens thus the characteristic average diffusion length was calculated as half of the average clay thickness for each cross sectional area in the mt3dms modflow model resulting in an average value of 1 85 m using eq 27 the matrix diffusion area was estimated as 261 37 m2 in each gridblock a calibrated diffusion length of 1 5 m was also used with a correspondent a md 322 34 m2 using a time step of 0 5 years the fortran module of remchlor md ran in about 13 s for the 230 year simulation the plume contours of the mt3dms and the semi analytical model results were compared side by side to verify that the plume shape and extents are similar the tce concentration distribution from the remchlor md output file was input to surfer golden software 2017 to create 2 d concentration contour maps vertical and horizontal slices were made in the middle of both models at different times to have a better visualization and comparison of the concentration contours obtained this is observed in figs 10 and 11 which shows the contours for l 1 5 m the graph axis lengths are shown in units of feet 1 ft 0 3048 m in this figure the different tce contours in figs 10 and 11 show the evolution of the tce plume in time the visual comparisons suggest a very good correspondence between mt3dms and the semi analytical model given by the similar extents of each contour zone though the semi analytical model results are of course smoother due to the homogeneous conditions the fine grid contours in figs 10 and 11 depend on the which slice of gridblocks is chosen for plotting at early times figs 10a and 11a the tce appears at different locations in different slices of the fine grid model making it appear that the semi analytical model is over predicting concentration however both models have the plume mass at this time and if multiple slices of the fine grid model are superposed they look more similar to the semi analytical model the mt3dms and semi analytical model estimated mass discharge rates in the outlet face of the model last row x were compared and are shown in fig 12 for the initial and calibrated diffusion lengths of 1 85 m and 1 5 m respectively the comparison of the mass discharge rate graphs shows a fast rise and decrease of the mass discharge rate followed by tailing behavior corresponding to the trend observed in the effluent concentration profiles studied in previous sections the response of the model for the diffusion length of 1 85 m seems to be a bit too fast suggesting that the initial estimate for the matrix diffusion area was too small with l 1 5 m the mass discharge curve looks closer to the curve from the fine grid simulation showing an improvement from the simulation with the higher diffusion length the coefficient of determination for l 1 5 m was estimated as 0 974 versus 0 849 for l 1 85 m confirming the apparent improvement in the visual comparison the mass discharge at the outlet face can be converted to an average concentration in the high permeability zones by dividing the mass discharge by the water volumetric discharge calculated using the darcy velocity and area 5 2 random case 5 2 1 modflow mt3dms model as discussed before the grid and borehole data used for both the lens and random cases were the same the main difference between the two cases is the material distribution obtained from t progs the sand proportion for this case had to be increased to 35 to provide enough interconnected transmissive paths to allow significant flow through the model as with the lens case the thickness of the sand was set to 0 61 m to control vertical spreading of the contaminant plume the lens ratios for the horizontal and dip y direction were set as 18 and 7 5 respectively for the clay the t progs generated values were 2 73 m for the vertical lens length 7 471 for the lens ratio in x and 3 113 for the lens ratio in y using these parameters the material distribution shown in fig 13 was obtained the parameters used for the flow field generation and transport simulation were essentially the same as in the lens case the simulation time for the flushing period had to be increased to 400 years because of plume persistence other than the 400 year flushing period all the input parameters for the mt3dms simulation are the same as described previously the random case transport simulation with source on ran for 8 10 h in a workstation with an intel i7 cpu at 3 60 ghz the run time increased to 60 h for the clean water flushing simulation this is explained not only by the size and refinement of the model but also by the added 200 years of simulation in the flushing period 5 2 2 semi analytical model the semi analytical model for the random case was set up in the same way as the lens case however since the material distribution affects several variables the values input in the model differed the grid used for the random case had 44 cells in the horizontal direction with a δx 20 85 m 16 cells in the y direction with a grid spacing of 17 59 m and 14 layers with a vertical spacing of 2 88 m for a total of 9856 gridblocks 19 712 on a full model basis the average darcy velocity from the modflow simulation for this case was 2 697 m yr the lower value in comparison with the previous scenario happened most likely because the transmissive zone pathways are interrupted by low permeability zones with more frequency than before due to the randomized material distribution to maintain the same source mass discharge as the mt3dms model the tce source concentration was set to 6409 7 μg l in the source element as before the source placed in the middle layer at the upstream end of the model just as in the lens case the transverse and vertical dispersivities were calibrated with the fine grid numerical simulation plume extents several values of α y and α z were tried until the tce concentration contours from the mt3dms and semi analytical models were similar for α y 2 m and α z 0 014 m the sand volume fraction was set to the value from t progs 0 351 the diffusion length was estimated with the volume weighted mean procedure explained in the lens case resulting in a value 1 21 m the matrix diffusion area was then estimated from eq 27 as 564 89 m2 per gridblock the calibrated diffusion length was 1 35 m with a matrix diffusion area of 507 84 m2 as before the time step was 0 5 years and the number of time steps increased to 860 because of the longer flushing time used in the mt3dms model for the random case this model ran in 28 s on the same computer the longer run time with respect to the lens case was expected due to the bigger size of the random case model the side by side comparison of the contour plumes of the mt3dms and the semi analytical model for are shown in figs 14 and 15 these contours are representative of the calibrated diffusion length 1 35 m results and the layout of the graphs is the same as in the lens case showing front views plane xz and map views plane xy of the tce concentration contours at 10 years 30 years and 130 years the plume extents estimated with the semi analytical model display a good match to the mt3dms model contours and again the semi analytical model contours are smoother due to the homogeneous conditions and coarse grid the comparison of mass discharge rate at the outlet face over time between the mt3dms and the semi analytical models is shown in fig 16 for the uncalibrated and calibrated values of diffusion length the curves from both models display the fast rise and decrease of tce mass discharge rate followed by tailing behavior seen in the lens case the calculated coefficient of determination of 0 970 for the uncalibrated diffusion length of 1 21 m suggests that the response of the semi analytical model matches the overall behavior of the mass discharge rate in the random system however the semi analytical model curve is shifted slightly to the right indicating that the mass is leaving the random scenario at a slower pace than what the numerical simulation proposes the mass discharge rate curve for the calibrated diffusion length of 1 35 m appears closer to the data from the mt3dms model during the rise and decrease portions and it presents a smaller peak than the uncalibrated curve the calculated coefficient of determination of 0 993 supports the global improvement of the fit with the calibrated l 6 conclusions the semi analytical method from vinsome and westerveld 1980 was adapted to the process of matrix diffusion for finite embedded heterogeneity scenarios in groundwater chemical transport modeling the method was tested against analytical solutions experimental results from laboratory scale flow chamber studies and with fine grid numerical simulations using highly heterogeneous domains the results in each case showed good agreement demonstrating the utility of the matrix diffusion semi analytical numerical method even for systems with highly complex heterogeneities present three geometric parameters are used in the semi analytical method for finite embedded heterogeneities the high permeability material volume fraction v f the high low permeability material interface area a md and the average maximum diffusion length l a simple geometrical relationship was defined that relates the three parameters to reduce the number of unknowns to only two of the three the results obtained using this 2 parameter approach provided a decent match with the fine grid simulation data without calibration and a good match with small adjustments to l the semi analytical method implementation proved to be extremely efficient providing with run times ranging from fractions of seconds up to approximately half a minute depending on the size and resolution of the model and the simulated periods of time the method has been implemented in a screening level numerical model called remchlor md that considers uniform flow in a homogeneous system with matrix diffusion this model is available from the authors free of charge the semi analytical method presented here is well suited for use in any implicit numerical transport model because it can be added as an implicit concentration dependent source sink term to the discretized equations acknowledgements the authors would like to thank minjune yang and james jawitz at the university of florida for providing unpublished data and information about their matrix
