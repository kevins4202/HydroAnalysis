9650,rain fed crops are a major crop type and their water use is extremely vulnerable to climate change studying the water requirement characteristics of rain fed crops in different growth stages and associated climatic driving factors is of great significance for sustainable crop production the water footprint wf of crops can comprehensively reflect the type and quantity of water consumption during the crop growth period previous studies have focused on quantifying the crop wf throughout the growth period and less attention has been given to quantifying the crop wf in different growth stages this study quantified the wfs of rain fed maize and associated climatic driving factors in five growth stages from 1996 to 2018 in northeast china the results show that 1 the wf of rain fed maize in each growth stage showed distinct differences the highest wf occurred in the tasseling milky growth stage whereas the lowest wf occurred in the sowing emergence growth stage 2 the variation trends of maize wf in different growth stages were heterogeneous across northeast china the declining trends were mainly distributed in the southwest while increasing trends were mainly distributed in the east in most growth stages 3 sunshine hours and temperature had a greater impact on the maize wf in most growth stages the impacts of other climatic factors on the wf of rain fed maize differed among different growth stages precipitation contributed much more to the variation in maize wf in early growth stages relative humidity had the greatest impact on the wf of maize in the jointing tasseling growth stage and wind speed played a major role in the variation in the maize wf at the milky mature growth stage management measures should be adjusted to alleviate the impact of climatic conditions on crop water consumption in different growth stages according to the results keywords water footprint rain fed maize different growth stages climatic factors 1 introduction crop production is the guarantee of food security and is also the largest consumer of water resources herath et al 2013 in the wake of increasing competition for water resources and coupled with the challenges posed by climatic change the available water resources for crop production are being increasingly constrained therefore irrigated crops have received much attention rain fed crops account for approximately 80 of the total physical agricultural area and produce approximately 60 of the world s staple food fao 2011 and the water use of rain fed crops is extremely vulnerable to climate change due to their vast area and lack of irrigation water the rational and accurate evaluation of water use in rain fed crop production can improve agricultural water management practices thus to ensure food security and maintain sustainable rain fed crop production the characteristics of water use for rain fed crops need to be accurately quantified previous assessments of crop water use have mainly focused on irrigation water and ignored the important role of precipitation and soil water in the agricultural production process cao et al 2018 zwart et al 2010 while there is no or little irrigation water precipitation and soil water are more important during the rain fed crop growth process the water footprint wf provides a new and comprehensive approach for assessments of water resource utilization during the crop production process hoekstra et al 2011 li et al 2020 in agroecosystems the wf of crop production is defined as the volume of freshwater required for crop growth and the dilution of pollutants during the crop growing process hoekstra et al 2011 the wf includes three components blue green and grey water footprints wfblue wfgreen and wfgrey mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 wfblue refers to the volume of irrigation water supplied by surface water or groundwater consumed during the crop growth process wfgreen is defined as the volume of rain water consumed during the crop growth process wfgrey is the volume of freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants during the crop production process hoekstra et al 2011 the wf can reflect the type and quantity of crop water consumed during the crop growth period which broadens the evaluation system of crop water use and provides complete water resource utilization for decision making li et al 2020 siebert and d√∂ll 2010 sun et al 2012 at present an increasing number of scholars have studied the application of wf theory to the process of crop production the majority of studies have focused on the quantitative analysis of the wfs of a variety of crop production systems including irrigated and rain fed crop systems at the global hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 national ababaei and ramezani etedali 2017 chapagain and hoekstra 2007 govere et al 2020 and district scales casella et al 2019 luan et al 2018 marano and filippi 2015 despite rain fed crops being involved adequate irrigation was assumed during the crop growth period in wf estimation duan et al 2016 resulting in the overestimation of the blue wf therefore the actual water use of rain fed crops needs to be assessed moreover existing studies treat the wfs of crop production during the entire growth period as a whole and less attention had been paid to quantifying the crop wfs of different growth stages the generated results only reflect the overall water use of crops during the whole production process and do not reflect the characteristics of crop water use the type and quantity of water consumption in different growth stages of the crop growth process providing data not detailed enough for agricultural water management to further clarify crop water use during the crop growth period and provide more detailed references for optimizing water management it is necessary to comprehensively assess crop water use in each growth stage the wf of crop production is inextricably related to the fluctuation of climate conditions lamastra et al 2014 the wf wfblue and wfgreen of crop production is determined by actual crop evapotranspiration etc and crop yield in the growth period hoekstra et al 2011 climatic factors can affect both etc and crop yield challinor et al 2014 fan et al 2016 for example rising temperatures increase etc and decrease crop yield where temperature constrains crop growth turral et al 2011 ultimately leading to an increase in the crop wf the relationship between climatic factors and crop wf varies among previous studies the effect of climatic factors on both crop yield and crop water requirements led to a 4 increase in the wfblue of irrigated crops in zimbabwe and the most significant climatic variables involved were solar radiation mean temperatures precipitation and maximum temperatures govere et al 2020 temperature and wind speed were significantly correlated with the wf of the irrigated crop and the total contribution of climatic factors to crop wf was measured as 10 45 for the hetao irrigation district of china sun et al 2012 the assessment of the impact of climatic factors on the crop wf has focused on irrigated crops within the whole growth stage and research on quantifying the effects of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed crops in different growth stages is lacking in fact compared with irrigated crops the wf of rain fed crops may be more vulnerable to climate change due to a lack of irrigation water zhao et al 2019 rain fed crop characteristics and climate conditions change throughout the crop growth process and the impacts of climatic factors on water use of rain fed crops vary in different growth stages to better capture the impact of climate driving factors on crop water use it is essential to quantify the relatively important climatic factors that affect the wf in different growth stages identifying the relationship between the rain fed crop wf and the associated climatic drivers in different growth stages is conductive to formulate the measures to cope with the climatic change northeast china is an important commodity grain base providing approximately one third of the country s total food production as one of the major grain crops of northeast china maize is a rain fed crop that accounts for about 35 of the country s total maize yield chen et al 2014 and is extremely critical to food safety in china and even globally zhao et al 2015 unfortunately northeast china experiences serious water shortages and in the region water is the main constraint on rain fed maize production duan et al 2016 meanwhile northeast china is one of the most susceptible regions to climate change where the water consumption of rain fed maize can be affected at different growth stages liu et al 2013b hence it is necessary to evaluate the water consumption of maize production in different growth stages and analyze such patterns in northeast china this paper quantifies the maize wfs of different growth stages in 36 prefectures of northeast china and analyzes their temporal spatial distribution characteristics for 1996 2018 then the impacts of climatic driving factors on maize wf are assessed and the main climatic factors causing variation in maize wf of different growth stages are identified a comprehensive analysis of the variability of maize wfs and the associated climatic drivers in different growth stages can be further understood to help clarify the specific impacts of climatic factors on the wf and adjust management measures to improve crop water use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area northeast china lies between 38 43 53 33 n and 118 53 135 05 e covering an area of 7 87 105 km2 includes the whole administrative region of the heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces and is divided into 36 prefectures fig 1 most of northeast china is characterized by a temperate monsoon climate with an uneven spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation the mean annual temperature varies spatially from north to south from 4 2 to 12 9 c mean annual precipitation varies significantly and increases from 450 mm in the northwest to 1070 mm in the southeast precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september which coincides with the maize growing season in northeast china the main types of soil are black soil dark brown soil and brown soil spring maize is a major cereal crop and typical rain fed crop in northeast china and the proportions of maize planting area of the total planting area in the heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces are 79 7 61 2 and 51 7 respectively 2 2 data sources phenological meteorological and agricultural data of maize production are used phenological data on maize production were collected from 81 agricultural observation stations fig 1 including data on the date of each maize growth stage meteorological data of the daily scale were obtained from 69 meteorological stations fig 1 including data on average temperatures maximum temperatures minimum temperatures precipitation wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours for the period of 1996 2018 phenological and meteorological data were collected from the china meteorological data sharing network http data cma cn the agricultural data on maize production cover the maize sowing areas and maize yield of 36 prefectures across northeast china for 1996 2018 and were obtained from official statistical yearbook records http tjj jl gov cn tjsj tjnj http tjj hlj gov cn tjsj tjnj and http tjj ln gov cn tjsj sjcx because maize yield was obtained at the prefecture level the data of phenological or meteorological stations across each prefecture needed to be transformed into prefecture level data the method of weighted averaging was used to transform the stations data into prefecture level data when two phenological or meteorological stations are close in distance we generally regarded them as one station by averaging the value of these two stations data and then average it with the data of other stations across the prefecture to transform into prefecture level data 2 3 cropwat model in our study the cropwat model was used to calculate effective precipitation reference crop evapotranspiration and actual crop evapotranspiration in each prefecture the cropwat model developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations allan and pereira 1998 is a practical tool that can be used to assessments of effective precipitation evapotranspiration and crop water requirement based on soil climate and crop data all procedures of calculation used in the cropwat model were based on fao publications no 56 crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water requirements the total available soil water moisture the difference in soil moisture content between field capacity and wilting point is a required parameter in the cropwat model to calculate effective precipitation which was obtained from the chinese soil hydrographic dataset for each prefecture dai et al 2013 these soil data could reflect accurately the total available soil water moisture of each prefecture which has been used in many studies chen et al 2020 de lannoy et al 2014 li et al 2018 2 4 calculation of maize wf values of different growth stages based on phenological data of maize production and other studies guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the maize growth period was divided into five stages the sowing emergence growth stage g1 emergence jointing growth stage g2 jointing tasseling growth stage g3 tasseling milky growth stage g4 and milky mature growth stage g5 fig 2 the average length of the g1 g5 was 17 days 43 days 20 days 30 days and 28 days respectively as spring drought often occurs to guarantee maize sowing a certain quantity of water in g1 is used as irrigation water creating a microenvironment with sufficient soil water to ensure germination and seedling establishment feng et al 2009 qin et al 2016 because the amounts of irrigation water in g1 are difficult to acquire for 36 prefectures across northeast china we assumed the maize to be fully irrigated in g1 the maize then receives no irrigation water in any other stage fig 2 the blue and green wfs were calculated for each growth stage of maize production the w f g r e e n g 1 and w f b l u e g 1 were defined as the green wf and blue wf of maize production in g1 respectively calculated by eqs 1 4 1 w f g r e e n g 1 c w u g r e e n g 1 y 10 n m e t g r e e n g 1 y 2 w f b l u e g 1 c w u b l u e g 1 y 10 n m e t b l u e g 1 y 3 e t g r e e n

in gi grow stage in year j if the slope is greater than 0 the wf followed an increasing trend when the slope is lower than 0 the wf tends to decrease the statistical significance of the wf trend was evaluated by a two tailed t test liu et al 2019 2 6 analysis of climatic factors caused wf variation referring to relevant studies on the impact of climatic factors on the wf of crops gao et al 2021 sun et al 2012 and considering the availability of data five climatic variables were used in this study table 1 to analyze the magnitude of the relationship between climatic factors and the wf pearson s correlation analysis was applied and statistical significance was assessed by a two tailed t test wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 the positive negative correlation coefficients indicate that the climatic factors played a catalytic inhibitory role in the wf to further identify the main climatic factors that caused the variation in the maize wf across different growth stages the lindeman merenda and gold lmg method based on multivariate linear models in the r package relaimpo was used groemping 2006 the lmg method can better distinguish the relative importance of correlated regression variables in multivariate linear models and overcome multicollinearity problems groemping 2006 murray et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 the specific process of this method was applied as follows 11 w f g i

entire growth period exhibited a fluctuating and decreasing trend from 1996 to 2018 fig 3 the average wftotal was 735 65 m3 ton 1 showing an insignificant downward rate p 0 05 of 5 03 m3 ton 1a 1 and the maximum and minimum values of the wftotal occurred in 2000 1174 42 m3 ton 1 and 1998 567 09 m3 ton 1 respectively fig 3 the average wfgreen was 695 78 m3 ton 1 and the trend of the wfgreen was basically consistent with that of the wftotal showing a rate of 4 94 m3 ton 1 a 1 p 0 05 the average share of the wfgreen of the wftotal was 94 58 indicating that the wfgreen dominated the wftotal of maize production in northeast china the average wfblue was 39 87 m3 ton 1 with a slight annual decline of 0 09 m3 ton 1 a 1 p 0 05 and accounted for 5 42 of the wftotal the maize wf in each growth stage showed distinct differences throughout the maize growth process fig 4 the value of the wf in g1 was the lowest ranging from 39 08 m3 ton 1 to 88 57 m3 ton 1 then the water consumption of maize increased significantly in g2 and the range of the wfg2 fell within 121 57 m3 ton 1 281 77 m3 ton 1 the wfg3 was slightly lower than the wfg2 with a range of 115 13 m3 ton 1 275 92 m3 ton 1 the wfg4 was the highest of the growth stages ranging from 146 85 m3 ton 1 to 293 19 m3 ton 1 from g4 to g5 maize growth gradually slowed and water consumption showed a downward trend in general the different maize growth stages showed obvious differences in water consumption due to the influence of many factors such as the duration of each growth stage plant growth characteristics ground coverage and climate conditions the wfg1 included the blue wf 64 35 and green wf 35 65 and irrigation water played an important role in g1 the wfg2 wfg5 were green wfs due to the lack of irrigation water from g2 g5 the variations in maize wfs from g1 g5 for 1996 2018 show a decreasing trend to varying degrees but the trend is not significant p 0 05 fig 5 specifically the wfg1 had the lowest rate of decline 0 03 m3 ton 1 a 1 fig 5a a stronger decreasing trend in the wf was found in g2 and g3 at 1 84 m3 ton 1 a 1 and 1 37 m3 ton 1 a 1 respectively fig 5b and c the wfg4 showed a slight downward rate of 0 53 m3 ton 1 a 1 fig 5e while the wfg5 had a higher rate of decline and the rate of decline of the wfg5 was 1 15 m3 ton 1 fig 5e the proportion of the wfg1 wfg5 of the total wf exhibited structural changes from 1996 to 2018 the proportions of the wfg1 and wfg4 of the total wf of maize experienced an upward trend at rates of 0 03 a 1 and 0 10 a 1 respectively fig 5a and d in particular the proportion of the wfg4 increased significantly p 0 05 in contrast the proportions of the wfg2 wfg3 and wfg5 showed a downward but insignificant trend p 0 05 fig 5b c and e respectively 3 2 spatial variation of the maize wf in different growth stages the spatial distributions of the average wftotal wfgreen and wfblue values of maize across the entire growth period were uneven from 1996 to 2018 in northeast china fig 6 the average wftotal ranged from 462 m3 ton 1 siping to 1138 m3 ton 1 chaoyang lower values of wftotal were mainly concentrated in the center of northeast china whereas higher values of wftotal were mainly aggregated in the south and northwest of northeast china fig 6a the central region of northeast china is one of the three golden maize belts in the world where climate conditions and fertile soil black soil are favorable for maize growth furthermore the flat terrain and high levels of mechanization in this area are more conducive to agricultural management therefore the yield of maize in this area was the highest leading to a lower maize wf regions with high wf values are usually located in mountainous areas with poor soil and low maize yields resulting in a high maize wf the spatial distribution of average wfgreen was basically consistent with that of the wftotal fig 6b because the green water was the main component of the wftotal however the spatial pattern of the average wfblue differed from those of the wfgreen and wftotal higher wfblue values were mainly distributed in the south and west of northeast china and lower wfblue values were distributed in the east of northeast china fig 6c mainly due to the spatial distribution of precipitation the trends of maize wf for the whole growth period show pronounced spatial heterogeneity from 1996 to 2018 in northeast china fig 6 the wftotal increased in 41 67 of the prefectures in the study area with 11 11 showing a significant increasing trend p 0 05 at a rate of over 6 m3 ton 1 a 1 mainly in the central and eastern regions of northeast china fig 6a prefectures with a declining trend 58 33 were mainly located in the southwest and northwest of northeast china with 8 33 showing a significant declining trend p 0 05 at a rate of more than 15 m3 ton 1 a 1 the spatial distribution of the wfgreen trend was similar to that of the wftotal fig 6b different from the trend distributions of the wftotal and wfgreen the wfblue with an increasing trend 58 33 was mainly aggregated in the southeastern and central areas of northeast china while downward trends 41 67 were distributed in western northeast china fig 6c the change in the wfblue in all prefectures was not significant the spatial distributions of the average wf for g1 g5 were basically the same from 1996 to 2018 fig 7 the prefectures with higher wfs in each growth stage were located in the south and northwest of northeast china while the prefectures with lower wfs in each growth stage were located in the middle of northeast china the wf trends in different growth stages were heterogeneous across northeast china from 1996 2018 fig 7 during g1 the wfg1 increased in 63 89 of the prefectures in the study area and 8 33 of the prefectures showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 with a rate of 0 3 m3 ton 1 a 1 0 6 m3 ton 1 a 1 mainly in southeastern and central northeast china fig 7a the prefectures with a strong declining trend 6 m3 ton 1 a 1 to 9 m3 ton 1 a 1 were mainly distributed in the southwest of northeast china though the trend was not significant in g2 the wfg2 exhibited a downward trend in most of the prefectures 83 33 and only a small area 16 67 presented increasing trends the prefectures with a significant downward trend 8 33 occurred in northeastern and northwestern northeast china fig 7b for g3 the wfg3 showed a declining trend in 63 89 of the prefectures and an increasing trend in 36 11 of the prefectures fig 7c in terms of g4 the wfg4 increased in 58 34 of the prefectures in the study area with 13 89 showing a significant increasing trend p 0 05 over 1 8 m3 ton 1 a 1 mainly in the eastern regions of northeast china fig 7d the wfg4 exhibited a significant downward trend only in 2 78 of the prefectures in g5 the wfg5 exhibited an increasing trend in 36 11 of the prefectures and was mainly observed in southeastern northeast china while a downward trend in 63 89 of the prefectures was aggregated in the west of northeast china fig 7e the spatial differences in the wf trends of five growth stages in northeast china were mainly caused by the variation of climate conditions maize growth characteristics and the yield in 36 prefectures 3 3 effect of climatic factors on the maize wf in different growth stages the maize wf was closely related to climatic factors according to the correlation analysis fig 8 specifically wind speed sunshine hours and temperature were positively correlated with the maize wf in each growth stage temperature and sunshine hours had a significant positive correlation p 0 05 with the wftotal and wfg2 wfg4 the largest correlation coefficients between sunshine hours temperature and the maize wf were found in g3 and g2 as 0 69 and 0 54 p 0 01 respectively in contrast a negative correlation was observed between precipitation relative humidity and the maize wf at each growth stage there was a significant correlation p 0 05 between precipitation relative humidity and the wftotal and wfg2 wfg4 precipitation had the most negative correlation coefficient 0 62 with the wfg2 while relative humidity had the largest negative correlation coefficient 0 74 with the wfg3 in addition climatic factors were not significantly related to the wfg1 and wfg5 p 0 05 the relative importance of climatic factors to variability in the maize wf was assessed using the lmg method the results show that the climatic factors together explained 44 7 of the variance in the wftotal for the entire growth period and temperature and sunshine hours were the two main climatic factors affecting the wftotal contributing 33 64 15 04 of the variance and 30 78 13 76 of the variance respectively fig 9a the relative importance of the climatic factors to the variability in maize wf varied from g1 g5 for g1 the climatic factors explained only 7 of the variance in the wfg1 and sunshine hours temperature and precipitation contributed 28 04 1 93 of the variance 26 19 1 83 of the variance and 24 10 1 69 of the variance respectively fig 9b indicating that these three factors were relatively important compared to that of the wfg1 the climatic factors explained much more of the variance in the wfg2 51 19 of the variance and sunshine hours relative humidity and precipitation were relatively important contributing 30 56 15 64 of the variance 24 59 12 59 of the variance and 22 54 11 54 of the variance respectively climatic factors most explained the variance in the wfg3 62 28 variance at g3 and the most important climatic factor was relative humidity with a contribution of 32 12 20 of the variance followed by sunshine hours with a contribution of 27 95 17 41 of the variance fig 9c for g4 the climatic factors explained 51 08 of the variance in the wfg4 fig 9d and sunshine hours were identified as the most important climatic factor with a contribution of 31 52 followed by temperature and precipitation similar to what was found for the wfg4 the climatic factors explained 51 12 of the variance in the wfg5 and temperature and sunshine hours played a greater role in the wfg5 with contributions of 30 78 and 25 59 respectively fig 9e win in the g5 played a greater role in the variation of wf 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the calculated maize wf results the maize wf of the entire growth period has been widely reported but the results vary table 2 these discrepancies are likely due to the different models regions study periods and data considered first with regard to models we quantified the maize wf based on the cropwat model one of the most widely used models some studies have adopted the grid based dynamic water balance model mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and swat model luan et al 2018 although the cropwat model was used to study the same region in duan et al the results differ for blue and green wfs especially for the former the main reason is that maize was assumed to be fully irrigated throughout the growth period in duan et al while maize was rain fed in our study which is consistent with actual production conditions second that variation in maize wf results is linked to the different regions and different study periods considered the wfblue of maize was recorded as 600 m3 ton 1 in the hetao irrigation district from 2003 to 2012 luan et al 2018 far exceeding our results 39 m3 ton 1 this is because the hetao irrigation district includes irrigated agriculture with little precipitation 145 216 mm luan et al 2018 and maize grows mainly depending on irrigation water there is more precipitation 450 1070 mm in northeast china and maize is mainly dependent on precipitation leading to lower maize wfblue values third the use of different data resources has also resulted in varied maize wf values some researchers have adopted the reference crop coefÔ¨Åcient kc provided by fao 56 duan et al 2016 sun et al 2013a due to the different geographic environments of crop growth the value of kc varies across different regions the kc used in our study was taken from field experiments conducted in different regions of northeast china which was more detailed and accurate in addition previous studies used climatic data of a monthly scale duan et al 2016 sun et al 2013a while we used daily climatic data to improve the accuracy of maize wf assessment wfgrey was the most distinctive component of the wf theory we also assessed temporal and spatial variation of maize wfgrey in northeast china fig s1 and s2 the average wfgrey was 271 01 m3 ton 1 in northeast china accounted for 29 61 of the total of wfblue wfgreen and wfgrey which was similar to that of duan et al due to lack of the data of fertilizer consumption in different growth stages the estimation of wfgrey only focused on that of the whole growth period thus the study on wfgrey in different growth stages will be the future research direction to explore the changing characteristics during the growth period 4 2 the relationships between maize wf and its climatic driving factors in different growth stages previous studies treated the crop wf as a whole for the entire growth period only reflecting the overall water use of crops exploring the temporal and spatial variation of wfs in different growth stages would exhibit the wf differences and wf change characteristics among each growing stage which could further reflect variation characteristics in the quantity and type of water consumption in different growth stages comprehensively based on the quantifying wf of each growing stage we further quantified the effect of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed maize in the different growth stages exploring the climatic driving factors of different growth stages could help clarify the specific impacts of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed crops and could generate strategies for coping with the climatic change and improve the water use efficiency in the rain fed crop our results show that the maize wf clearly varies and that the main climatic factors affecting the maize wf vary across different growth stages these differences are likely due to the variation in maize characteristics and climate conditions present in different growth stages from g1 g2 the sowing to jointing stage maize plants mainly developed in the root system and stems and leaves grew slowly with less transpiration leading to low crop water requirements climatic conditions such as lower temperatures and shorter sunshine periods in northeast china tang and guo 2016 resulted in low crop evapotranspiration fig 10 although crop evapotranspiration from g1 g2 was lower the value of the wfg2 was much higher than that of the wfg1 fig 4 mainly due to the longest growth period of g2 fig 10 regarding the impact of climatic factors on the wfg1 wfg2 sunshine hours and temperature played an important role in the variation of the wfg1 and wfg2 sunshine hours and temperature were the key drivers of maize photosynthesis and were crucial for maize germination the stress of low temperatures and limited sunshine hours from sowing to emergence may reduce the germination rate and lead to poor seedling establishment such conditions may also hinder the growth of maize functional leaves miedema 1982 affecting leaf transpiration apart from temperature and sunshine hours precipitation also played an important role in the wfg1 wfg2 mainly because precipitation was unstable and rare in the early growing stage g1 g2 unfortunately seasonal drought often affects maize crops in the spring and the probability of continuous drought continues to increase guo et al 2017 it was inferred that continuous drought influences the rate of maize emergence and seedling growth and that precipitation might have a greater impact on maize wfg1 wfg2 values in northeast china in the future with the continuous growth and development of maize and variation in climatic conditions daily average water consumption reaches a peak in g3 fig 10 there was a parallel growth stage of vegetative growth and reproductive growth in g3 which was the fastest stage of maize growth with higher crop water requirements meanwhile climatic conditions such as a higher daily average temperature and longer daily average sunshine hours caused higher levels of daily evapotranspiration zhang et al 2007 however although daily average water consumption was the highest in g3 the annual average wfg3 was not the largest mainly because the g3 growing period was shorter fig 10 in terms of the impact of climatic factors on the wf in g3 relative humidity was relatively important in affecting the variation in the wf in g3 pollen absorbed moisture from the air and bonded into clusters when relative humidity was higher making it difficult to complete pollination when pollen was transferred to filaments during the tasseling period wang et al 2015 this process may affect the variations in maize yield and the wf from g4 g5 the maize crops were mainly in the reproductive growth period maize growth gradually slowed and daily average water consumption dropped fig 10 however compared to the wfs of other growth stages the wfg4 was the highest due to a longer growth period and higher daily water consumption fig 10 regarding the effect of climatic factors on the wfg4 wfg5 sunshine hours and temperature were relatively important mainly because g4 g5 were critical stages of yield components and more than 90 of maize kernel weight came from photosynthesis after pollination water consumption was also sensitive to temperature because temperature was an important driving force behind the grain dehydration of maize from g4 g5 wind speed also played a major role in the wf in g5 higher wind speeds have adverse effects on maize growth and cause maize lodging sun et al 2016 leading to a higher wf in this growth period 4 3 mitigating the adverse impact of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed crops previous studies mainly focus on quantifying the impacts of climate factors on the wf of irrigated crops and show that climatic factors explain about 10 of the variation in the wf of irrigated crops sun et al 2013b indicating that irrigated crops are more dependent on human factors than on climate factors this study shows climatic factors to explain 44 7 of the variability in the wf of rain fed maize overall indicating that climatic factors have a greater impact on the wf of rain fed crops than on that of irrigated crops although climatic conditions are uncontrollable some measures for agricultural management would reduce the impact of climatic change on wf and ensure sustainable rain fed crop production mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 reasonable agricultural management measures such as delaying the sowing date optimizing plant density choosing maize cultivars and implementing conservation tillage can avoid seasonal drought and reduce crop evapotranspiration and drainage losses to mitigate the effects of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed maize in different growth stages in northeast china meanwhile agricultural management measures can also increase yield to improve water use efficiency in rain fed maize suitably delaying the sowing date can prevent spring drought for rain fed maize production in northeast china and reduce the influence of lower precipitation on maize production in the early growth stage g1 g2 this is conducive to increasing maize yield and water use efficiency in rain fed farming systems liu et al 2013a lu et al 2017 optimizing plant density sun et al 2016 and choosing maize cultivars with lodging resistance could reduce maize lodging xue et al 2017 and improve the maize yield huang et al 2021 to relieve the impact of wind speeds in g5 and increase water use efficiency implementing conservation tillage can conserve more soil water and reduce the drainage losses to improve the utilization efficiency of precipitation zhang et al 2015 2018 which will help reduce the effect of spring drought on maize production from g1 g2 meanwhile conservation tillage will reduce actual crop evapotranspiration busari et al 2015 caused by longer sunshine hours and higher temperatures from g4 g5 in addition conservation tillage also enhances soil properties and increases yields to improve water use efficiency in rain fed agriculture zhang et al 2018 5 conclusion this study analyzed the wf of rain fed maize in five different growth stages in 36 prefectures of northeast china and identified associated climatic driving factors for 1996 2018 in general the wf of rain fed maize in each growth stage clearly varied mainly due to the variation in maize characteristics and climate conditions in different growth stages the wf was the highest in the tasseling milky growth stage whereas the lowest wf was found in the sowing emergence growth stage the blue wf accounted for 5 42 of the total wf and only appeared in the sowing emergence growth stage the green wf served as the primary water source for maize growth from the emergence jointing to milky mature growth stages and accounted for 94 58 of the total wf the wf trends of each growth stage show spatial variability in northeast china a trend of increasing wfs was found in the east and a decreasing trend was found in the southwest of northeast china in most growth stages it was not neglected that regions with increasing trends of wf indicated that crop water consumption increased which may be not conducive to efficient water use in crop production sunshine hours and temperature greatly affected variation in the wf in most growth stages precipitation had strong effects on the wf in the sowing emergence and emergence jointing growth stages relative humidity played the most central role in the wf in the jointing tasseling growth stage while wind speed had a greater impact on the wf in the milky mature growth stage appropriately adjusting agricultural measures could

9650,rain fed crops are a major crop type and their water use is extremely vulnerable to climate change studying the water requirement characteristics of rain fed crops in different growth stages and associated climatic driving factors is of great significance for sustainable crop production the water footprint wf of crops can comprehensively reflect the type and quantity of water consumption during the crop growth period previous studies have focused on quantifying the crop wf throughout the growth period and less attention has been given to quantifying the crop wf in different growth stages this study quantified the wfs of rain fed maize and associated climatic driving factors in five growth stages from 1996 to 2018 in northeast china the results show that 1 the wf of rain fed maize in each growth stage showed distinct differences the highest wf occurred in the tasseling milky growth stage whereas the lowest wf occurred in the sowing emergence growth stage 2 the variation trends of maize wf in different growth stages were heterogeneous across northeast china the declining trends were mainly distributed in the southwest while increasing trends were mainly distributed in the east in most growth stages 3 sunshine hours and temperature had a greater impact on the maize wf in most growth stages the impacts of other climatic factors on the wf of rain fed maize differed among different growth stages precipitation contributed much more to the variation in maize wf in early growth stages relative humidity had the greatest impact on the wf of maize in the jointing tasseling growth stage and wind speed played a major role in the variation in the maize wf at the milky mature growth stage management measures should be adjusted to alleviate the impact of climatic conditions on crop water consumption in different growth stages according to the results keywords water footprint rain fed maize different growth stages climatic factors 1 introduction crop production is the guarantee of food security and is also the largest consumer of water resources herath et al 2013 in the wake of increasing competition for water resources and coupled with the challenges posed by climatic change the available water resources for crop production are being increasingly constrained therefore irrigated crops have received much attention rain fed crops account for approximately 80 of the total physical agricultural area and produce approximately 60 of the world s staple food fao 2011 and the water use of rain fed crops is extremely vulnerable to climate change due to their vast area and lack of irrigation water the rational and accurate evaluation of water use in rain fed crop production can improve agricultural water management practices thus to ensure food security and maintain sustainable rain fed crop production the characteristics of water use for rain fed crops need to be accurately quantified previous assessments of crop water use have mainly focused on irrigation water and ignored the important role of precipitation and soil water in the agricultural production process cao et al 2018 zwart et al 2010 while there is no or little irrigation water precipitation and soil water are more important during the rain fed crop growth process the water footprint wf provides a new and comprehensive approach for assessments of water resource utilization during the crop production process hoekstra et al 2011 li et al 2020 in agroecosystems the wf of crop production is defined as the volume of freshwater required for crop growth and the dilution of pollutants during the crop growing process hoekstra et al 2011 the wf includes three components blue green and grey water footprints wfblue wfgreen and wfgrey mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 wfblue refers to the volume of irrigation water supplied by surface water or groundwater consumed during the crop growth process wfgreen is defined as the volume of rain water consumed during the crop growth process wfgrey is the volume of freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants during the crop production process hoekstra et al 2011 the wf can reflect the type and quantity of crop water consumed during the crop growth period which broadens the evaluation system of crop water use and provides complete water resource utilization for decision making li et al 2020 siebert and d√∂ll 2010 sun et al 2012 at present an increasing number of scholars have studied the application of wf theory to the process of crop production the majority of studies have focused on the quantitative analysis of the wfs of a variety of crop production systems including irrigated and rain fed crop systems at the global hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 national ababaei and ramezani etedali 2017 chapagain and hoekstra 2007 govere et al 2020 and district scales casella et al 2019 luan et al 2018 marano and filippi 2015 despite rain fed crops being involved adequate irrigation was assumed during the crop growth period in wf estimation duan et al 2016 resulting in the overestimation of the blue wf therefore the actual water use of rain fed crops needs to be assessed moreover existing studies treat the wfs of crop production during the entire growth period as a whole and less attention had been paid to quantifying the crop wfs of different growth stages the generated results only reflect the overall water use of crops during the whole production process and do not reflect the characteristics of crop water use the type and quantity of water consumption in different growth stages of the crop growth process providing data not detailed enough for agricultural water management to further clarify crop water use during the crop growth period and provide more detailed references for optimizing water management it is necessary to comprehensively assess crop water use in each growth stage the wf of crop production is inextricably related to the fluctuation of climate conditions lamastra et al 2014 the wf wfblue and wfgreen of crop production is determined by actual crop evapotranspiration etc and crop yield in the growth period hoekstra et al 2011 climatic factors can affect both etc and crop yield challinor et al 2014 fan et al 2016 for example rising temperatures increase etc and decrease crop yield where temperature constrains crop growth turral et al 2011 ultimately leading to an increase in the crop wf the relationship between climatic factors and crop wf varies among previous studies the effect of climatic factors on both crop yield and crop water requirements led to a 4 increase in the wfblue of irrigated crops in zimbabwe and the most significant climatic variables involved were solar radiation mean temperatures precipitation and maximum temperatures govere et al 2020 temperature and wind speed were significantly correlated with the wf of the irrigated crop and the total contribution of climatic factors to crop wf was measured as 10 45 for the hetao irrigation district of china sun et al 2012 the assessment of the impact of climatic factors on the crop wf has focused on irrigated crops within the whole growth stage and research on quantifying the effects of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed crops in different growth stages is lacking in fact compared with irrigated crops the wf of rain fed crops may be more vulnerable to climate change due to a lack of irrigation water zhao et al 2019 rain fed crop characteristics and climate conditions change throughout the crop growth process and the impacts of climatic factors on water use of rain fed crops vary in different growth stages to better capture the impact of climate driving factors on crop water use it is essential to quantify the relatively important climatic factors that affect the wf in different growth stages identifying the relationship between the rain fed crop wf and the associated climatic drivers in different growth stages is conductive to formulate the measures to cope with the climatic change northeast china is an important commodity grain base providing approximately one third of the country s total food production as one of the major grain crops of northeast china maize is a rain fed crop that accounts for about 35 of the country s total maize yield chen et al 2014 and is extremely critical to food safety in china and even globally zhao et al 2015 unfortunately northeast china experiences serious water shortages and in the region water is the main constraint on rain fed maize production duan et al 2016 meanwhile northeast china is one of the most susceptible regions to climate change where the water consumption of rain fed maize can be affected at different growth stages liu et al 2013b hence it is necessary to evaluate the water consumption of maize production in different growth stages and analyze such patterns in northeast china this paper quantifies the maize wfs of different growth stages in 36 prefectures of northeast china and analyzes their temporal spatial distribution characteristics for 1996 2018 then the impacts of climatic driving factors on maize wf are assessed and the main climatic factors causing variation in maize wf of different growth stages are identified a comprehensive analysis of the variability of maize wfs and the associated climatic drivers in different growth stages can be further understood to help clarify the specific impacts of climatic factors on the wf and adjust management measures to improve crop water use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area northeast china lies between 38 43 53 33 n and 118 53 135 05 e covering an area of 7 87 105 km2 includes the whole administrative region of the heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces and is divided into 36 prefectures fig 1 most of northeast china is characterized by a temperate monsoon climate with an uneven spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation the mean annual temperature varies spatially from north to south from 4 2 to 12 9 c mean annual precipitation varies significantly and increases from 450 mm in the northwest to 1070 mm in the southeast precipitation is mainly concentrated from june to september which coincides with the maize growing season in northeast china the main types of soil are black soil dark brown soil and brown soil spring maize is a major cereal crop and typical rain fed crop in northeast china and the proportions of maize planting area of the total planting area in the heilongjiang jilin and liaoning provinces are 79 7 61 2 and 51 7 respectively 2 2 data sources phenological meteorological and agricultural data of maize production are used phenological data on maize production were collected from 81 agricultural observation stations fig 1 including data on the date of each maize growth stage meteorological data of the daily scale were obtained from 69 meteorological stations fig 1 including data on average temperatures maximum temperatures minimum temperatures precipitation wind speed relative humidity and sunshine hours for the period of 1996 2018 phenological and meteorological data were collected from the china meteorological data sharing network http data cma cn the agricultural data on maize production cover the maize sowing areas and maize yield of 36 prefectures across northeast china for 1996 2018 and were obtained from official statistical yearbook records http tjj jl gov cn tjsj tjnj http tjj hlj gov cn tjsj tjnj and http tjj ln gov cn tjsj sjcx because maize yield was obtained at the prefecture level the data of phenological or meteorological stations across each prefecture needed to be transformed into prefecture level data the method of weighted averaging was used to transform the stations data into prefecture level data when two phenological or meteorological stations are close in distance we generally regarded them as one station by averaging the value of these two stations data and then average it with the data of other stations across the prefecture to transform into prefecture level data 2 3 cropwat model in our study the cropwat model was used to calculate effective precipitation reference crop evapotranspiration and actual crop evapotranspiration in each prefecture the cropwat model developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations allan and pereira 1998 is a practical tool that can be used to assessments of effective precipitation evapotranspiration and crop water requirement based on soil climate and crop data all procedures of calculation used in the cropwat model were based on fao publications no 56 crop evapotranspiration guidelines for computing crop water requirements the total available soil water moisture the difference in soil moisture content between field capacity and wilting point is a required parameter in the cropwat model to calculate effective precipitation which was obtained from the chinese soil hydrographic dataset for each prefecture dai et al 2013 these soil data could reflect accurately the total available soil water moisture of each prefecture which has been used in many studies chen et al 2020 de lannoy et al 2014 li et al 2018 2 4 calculation of maize wf values of different growth stages based on phenological data of maize production and other studies guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 the maize growth period was divided into five stages the sowing emergence growth stage g1 emergence jointing growth stage g2 jointing tasseling growth stage g3 tasseling milky growth stage g4 and milky mature growth stage g5 fig 2 the average length of the g1 g5 was 17 days 43 days 20 days 30 days and 28 days respectively as spring drought often occurs to guarantee maize sowing a certain quantity of water in g1 is used as irrigation water creating a microenvironment with sufficient soil water to ensure germination and seedling establishment feng et al 2009 qin et al 2016 because the amounts of irrigation water in g1 are difficult to acquire for 36 prefectures across northeast china we assumed the maize to be fully irrigated in g1 the maize then receives no irrigation water in any other stage fig 2 the blue and green wfs were calculated for each growth stage of maize production the w f g r e e n g 1 and w f b l u e g 1 were defined as the green wf and blue wf of maize production in g1 respectively calculated by eqs 1 4 1 w f g r e e n g 1 c w u g r e e n g 1 y 10 n m e t g r e e n g 1 y 2 w f b l u e g 1 c w u b l u e g 1 y 10 n m e t b l u e g 1 y 3 e t g r e e n

in gi grow stage in year j if the slope is greater than 0 the wf followed an increasing trend when the slope is lower than 0 the wf tends to decrease the statistical significance of the wf trend was evaluated by a two tailed t test liu et al 2019 2 6 analysis of climatic factors caused wf variation referring to relevant studies on the impact of climatic factors on the wf of crops gao et al 2021 sun et al 2012 and considering the availability of data five climatic variables were used in this study table 1 to analyze the magnitude of the relationship between climatic factors and the wf pearson s correlation analysis was applied and statistical significance was assessed by a two tailed t test wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 the positive negative correlation coefficients indicate that the climatic factors played a catalytic inhibitory role in the wf to further identify the main climatic factors that caused the variation in the maize wf across different growth stages the lindeman merenda and gold lmg method based on multivariate linear models in the r package relaimpo was used groemping 2006 the lmg method can better distinguish the relative importance of correlated regression variables in multivariate linear models and overcome multicollinearity problems groemping 2006 murray et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 the specific process of this method was applied as follows 11 w f g i

entire growth period exhibited a fluctuating and decreasing trend from 1996 to 2018 fig 3 the average wftotal was 735 65 m3 ton 1 showing an insignificant downward rate p 0 05 of 5 03 m3 ton 1a 1 and the maximum and minimum values of the wftotal occurred in 2000 1174 42 m3 ton 1 and 1998 567 09 m3 ton 1 respectively fig 3 the average wfgreen was 695 78 m3 ton 1 and the trend of the wfgreen was basically consistent with that of the wftotal showing a rate of 4 94 m3 ton 1 a 1 p 0 05 the average share of the wfgreen of the wftotal was 94 58 indicating that the wfgreen dominated the wftotal of maize production in northeast china the average wfblue was 39 87 m3 ton 1 with a slight annual decline of 0 09 m3 ton 1 a 1 p 0 05 and accounted for 5 42 of the wftotal the maize wf in each growth stage showed distinct differences throughout the maize growth process fig 4 the value of the wf in g1 was the lowest ranging from 39 08 m3 ton 1 to 88 57 m3 ton 1 then the water consumption of maize increased significantly in g2 and the range of the wfg2 fell within 121 57 m3 ton 1 281 77 m3 ton 1 the wfg3 was slightly lower than the wfg2 with a range of 115 13 m3 ton 1 275 92 m3 ton 1 the wfg4 was the highest of the growth stages ranging from 146 85 m3 ton 1 to 293 19 m3 ton 1 from g4 to g5 maize growth gradually slowed and water consumption showed a downward trend in general the different maize growth stages showed obvious differences in water consumption due to the influence of many factors such as the duration of each growth stage plant growth characteristics ground coverage and climate conditions the wfg1 included the blue wf 64 35 and green wf 35 65 and irrigation water played an important role in g1 the wfg2 wfg5 were green wfs due to the lack of irrigation water from g2 g5 the variations in maize wfs from g1 g5 for 1996 2018 show a decreasing trend to varying degrees but the trend is not significant p 0 05 fig 5 specifically the wfg1 had the lowest rate of decline 0 03 m3 ton 1 a 1 fig 5a a stronger decreasing trend in the wf was found in g2 and g3 at 1 84 m3 ton 1 a 1 and 1 37 m3 ton 1 a 1 respectively fig 5b and c the wfg4 showed a slight downward rate of 0 53 m3 ton 1 a 1 fig 5e while the wfg5 had a higher rate of decline and the rate of decline of the wfg5 was 1 15 m3 ton 1 fig 5e the proportion of the wfg1 wfg5 of the total wf exhibited structural changes from 1996 to 2018 the proportions of the wfg1 and wfg4 of the total wf of maize experienced an upward trend at rates of 0 03 a 1 and 0 10 a 1 respectively fig 5a and d in particular the proportion of the wfg4 increased significantly p 0 05 in contrast the proportions of the wfg2 wfg3 and wfg5 showed a downward but insignificant trend p 0 05 fig 5b c and e respectively 3 2 spatial variation of the maize wf in different growth stages the spatial distributions of the average wftotal wfgreen and wfblue values of maize across the entire growth period were uneven from 1996 to 2018 in northeast china fig 6 the average wftotal ranged from 462 m3 ton 1 siping to 1138 m3 ton 1 chaoyang lower values of wftotal were mainly concentrated in the center of northeast china whereas higher values of wftotal were mainly aggregated in the south and northwest of northeast china fig 6a the central region of northeast china is one of the three golden maize belts in the world where climate conditions and fertile soil black soil are favorable for maize growth furthermore the flat terrain and high levels of mechanization in this area are more conducive to agricultural management therefore the yield of maize in this area was the highest leading to a lower maize wf regions with high wf values are usually located in mountainous areas with poor soil and low maize yields resulting in a high maize wf the spatial distribution of average wfgreen was basically consistent with that of the wftotal fig 6b because the green water was the main component of the wftotal however the spatial pattern of the average wfblue differed from those of the wfgreen and wftotal higher wfblue values were mainly distributed in the south and west of northeast china and lower wfblue values were distributed in the east of northeast china fig 6c mainly due to the spatial distribution of precipitation the trends of maize wf for the whole growth period show pronounced spatial heterogeneity from 1996 to 2018 in northeast china fig 6 the wftotal increased in 41 67 of the prefectures in the study area with 11 11 showing a significant increasing trend p 0 05 at a rate of over 6 m3 ton 1 a 1 mainly in the central and eastern regions of northeast china fig 6a prefectures with a declining trend 58 33 were mainly located in the southwest and northwest of northeast china with 8 33 showing a significant declining trend p 0 05 at a rate of more than 15 m3 ton 1 a 1 the spatial distribution of the wfgreen trend was similar to that of the wftotal fig 6b different from the trend distributions of the wftotal and wfgreen the wfblue with an increasing trend 58 33 was mainly aggregated in the southeastern and central areas of northeast china while downward trends 41 67 were distributed in western northeast china fig 6c the change in the wfblue in all prefectures was not significant the spatial distributions of the average wf for g1 g5 were basically the same from 1996 to 2018 fig 7 the prefectures with higher wfs in each growth stage were located in the south and northwest of northeast china while the prefectures with lower wfs in each growth stage were located in the middle of northeast china the wf trends in different growth stages were heterogeneous across northeast china from 1996 2018 fig 7 during g1 the wfg1 increased in 63 89 of the prefectures in the study area and 8 33 of the prefectures showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 with a rate of 0 3 m3 ton 1 a 1 0 6 m3 ton 1 a 1 mainly in southeastern and central northeast china fig 7a the prefectures with a strong declining trend 6 m3 ton 1 a 1 to 9 m3 ton 1 a 1 were mainly distributed in the southwest of northeast china though the trend was not significant in g2 the wfg2 exhibited a downward trend in most of the prefectures 83 33 and only a small area 16 67 presented increasing trends the prefectures with a significant downward trend 8 33 occurred in northeastern and northwestern northeast china fig 7b for g3 the wfg3 showed a declining trend in 63 89 of the prefectures and an increasing trend in 36 11 of the prefectures fig 7c in terms of g4 the wfg4 increased in 58 34 of the prefectures in the study area with 13 89 showing a significant increasing trend p 0 05 over 1 8 m3 ton 1 a 1 mainly in the eastern regions of northeast china fig 7d the wfg4 exhibited a significant downward trend only in 2 78 of the prefectures in g5 the wfg5 exhibited an increasing trend in 36 11 of the prefectures and was mainly observed in southeastern northeast china while a downward trend in 63 89 of the prefectures was aggregated in the west of northeast china fig 7e the spatial differences in the wf trends of five growth stages in northeast china were mainly caused by the variation of climate conditions maize growth characteristics and the yield in 36 prefectures 3 3 effect of climatic factors on the maize wf in different growth stages the maize wf was closely related to climatic factors according to the correlation analysis fig 8 specifically wind speed sunshine hours and temperature were positively correlated with the maize wf in each growth stage temperature and sunshine hours had a significant positive correlation p 0 05 with the wftotal and wfg2 wfg4 the largest correlation coefficients between sunshine hours temperature and the maize wf were found in g3 and g2 as 0 69 and 0 54 p 0 01 respectively in contrast a negative correlation was observed between precipitation relative humidity and the maize wf at each growth stage there was a significant correlation p 0 05 between precipitation relative humidity and the wftotal and wfg2 wfg4 precipitation had the most negative correlation coefficient 0 62 with the wfg2 while relative humidity had the largest negative correlation coefficient 0 74 with the wfg3 in addition climatic factors were not significantly related to the wfg1 and wfg5 p 0 05 the relative importance of climatic factors to variability in the maize wf was assessed using the lmg method the results show that the climatic factors together explained 44 7 of the variance in the wftotal for the entire growth period and temperature and sunshine hours were the two main climatic factors affecting the wftotal contributing 33 64 15 04 of the variance and 30 78 13 76 of the variance respectively fig 9a the relative importance of the climatic factors to the variability in maize wf varied from g1 g5 for g1 the climatic factors explained only 7 of the variance in the wfg1 and sunshine hours temperature and precipitation contributed 28 04 1 93 of the variance 26 19 1 83 of the variance and 24 10 1 69 of the variance respectively fig 9b indicating that these three factors were relatively important compared to that of the wfg1 the climatic factors explained much more of the variance in the wfg2 51 19 of the variance and sunshine hours relative humidity and precipitation were relatively important contributing 30 56 15 64 of the variance 24 59 12 59 of the variance and 22 54 11 54 of the variance respectively climatic factors most explained the variance in the wfg3 62 28 variance at g3 and the most important climatic factor was relative humidity with a contribution of 32 12 20 of the variance followed by sunshine hours with a contribution of 27 95 17 41 of the variance fig 9c for g4 the climatic factors explained 51 08 of the variance in the wfg4 fig 9d and sunshine hours were identified as the most important climatic factor with a contribution of 31 52 followed by temperature and precipitation similar to what was found for the wfg4 the climatic factors explained 51 12 of the variance in the wfg5 and temperature and sunshine hours played a greater role in the wfg5 with contributions of 30 78 and 25 59 respectively fig 9e win in the g5 played a greater role in the variation of wf 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the calculated maize wf results the maize wf of the entire growth period has been widely reported but the results vary table 2 these discrepancies are likely due to the different models regions study periods and data considered first with regard to models we quantified the maize wf based on the cropwat model one of the most widely used models some studies have adopted the grid based dynamic water balance model mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and swat model luan et al 2018 although the cropwat model was used to study the same region in duan et al the results differ for blue and green wfs especially for the former the main reason is that maize was assumed to be fully irrigated throughout the growth period in duan et al while maize was rain fed in our study which is consistent with actual production conditions second that variation in maize wf results is linked to the different regions and different study periods considered the wfblue of maize was recorded as 600 m3 ton 1 in the hetao irrigation district from 2003 to 2012 luan et al 2018 far exceeding our results 39 m3 ton 1 this is because the hetao irrigation district includes irrigated agriculture with little precipitation 145 216 mm luan et al 2018 and maize grows mainly depending on irrigation water there is more precipitation 450 1070 mm in northeast china and maize is mainly dependent on precipitation leading to lower maize wfblue values third the use of different data resources has also resulted in varied maize wf values some researchers have adopted the reference crop coefÔ¨Åcient kc provided by fao 56 duan et al 2016 sun et al 2013a due to the different geographic environments of crop growth the value of kc varies across different regions the kc used in our study was taken from field experiments conducted in different regions of northeast china which was more detailed and accurate in addition previous studies used climatic data of a monthly scale duan et al 2016 sun et al 2013a while we used daily climatic data to improve the accuracy of maize wf assessment wfgrey was the most distinctive component of the wf theory we also assessed temporal and spatial variation of maize wfgrey in northeast china fig s1 and s2 the average wfgrey was 271 01 m3 ton 1 in northeast china accounted for 29 61 of the total of wfblue wfgreen and wfgrey which was similar to that of duan et al due to lack of the data of fertilizer consumption in different growth stages the estimation of wfgrey only focused on that of the whole growth period thus the study on wfgrey in different growth stages will be the future research direction to explore the changing characteristics during the growth period 4 2 the relationships between maize wf and its climatic driving factors in different growth stages previous studies treated the crop wf as a whole for the entire growth period only reflecting the overall water use of crops exploring the temporal and spatial variation of wfs in different growth stages would exhibit the wf differences and wf change characteristics among each growing stage which could further reflect variation characteristics in the quantity and type of water consumption in different growth stages comprehensively based on the quantifying wf of each growing stage we further quantified the effect of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed maize in the different growth stages exploring the climatic driving factors of different growth stages could help clarify the specific impacts of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed crops and could generate strategies for coping with the climatic change and improve the water use efficiency in the rain fed crop our results show that the maize wf clearly varies and that the main climatic factors affecting the maize wf vary across different growth stages these differences are likely due to the variation in maize characteristics and climate conditions present in different growth stages from g1 g2 the sowing to jointing stage maize plants mainly developed in the root system and stems and leaves grew slowly with less transpiration leading to low crop water requirements climatic conditions such as lower temperatures and shorter sunshine periods in northeast china tang and guo 2016 resulted in low crop evapotranspiration fig 10 although crop evapotranspiration from g1 g2 was lower the value of the wfg2 was much higher than that of the wfg1 fig 4 mainly due to the longest growth period of g2 fig 10 regarding the impact of climatic factors on the wfg1 wfg2 sunshine hours and temperature played an important role in the variation of the wfg1 and wfg2 sunshine hours and temperature were the key drivers of maize photosynthesis and were crucial for maize germination the stress of low temperatures and limited sunshine hours from sowing to emergence may reduce the germination rate and lead to poor seedling establishment such conditions may also hinder the growth of maize functional leaves miedema 1982 affecting leaf transpiration apart from temperature and sunshine hours precipitation also played an important role in the wfg1 wfg2 mainly because precipitation was unstable and rare in the early growing stage g1 g2 unfortunately seasonal drought often affects maize crops in the spring and the probability of continuous drought continues to increase guo et al 2017 it was inferred that continuous drought influences the rate of maize emergence and seedling growth and that precipitation might have a greater impact on maize wfg1 wfg2 values in northeast china in the future with the continuous growth and development of maize and variation in climatic conditions daily average water consumption reaches a peak in g3 fig 10 there was a parallel growth stage of vegetative growth and reproductive growth in g3 which was the fastest stage of maize growth with higher crop water requirements meanwhile climatic conditions such as a higher daily average temperature and longer daily average sunshine hours caused higher levels of daily evapotranspiration zhang et al 2007 however although daily average water consumption was the highest in g3 the annual average wfg3 was not the largest mainly because the g3 growing period was shorter fig 10 in terms of the impact of climatic factors on the wf in g3 relative humidity was relatively important in affecting the variation in the wf in g3 pollen absorbed moisture from the air and bonded into clusters when relative humidity was higher making it difficult to complete pollination when pollen was transferred to filaments during the tasseling period wang et al 2015 this process may affect the variations in maize yield and the wf from g4 g5 the maize crops were mainly in the reproductive growth period maize growth gradually slowed and daily average water consumption dropped fig 10 however compared to the wfs of other growth stages the wfg4 was the highest due to a longer growth period and higher daily water consumption fig 10 regarding the effect of climatic factors on the wfg4 wfg5 sunshine hours and temperature were relatively important mainly because g4 g5 were critical stages of yield components and more than 90 of maize kernel weight came from photosynthesis after pollination water consumption was also sensitive to temperature because temperature was an important driving force behind the grain dehydration of maize from g4 g5 wind speed also played a major role in the wf in g5 higher wind speeds have adverse effects on maize growth and cause maize lodging sun et al 2016 leading to a higher wf in this growth period 4 3 mitigating the adverse impact of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed crops previous studies mainly focus on quantifying the impacts of climate factors on the wf of irrigated crops and show that climatic factors explain about 10 of the variation in the wf of irrigated crops sun et al 2013b indicating that irrigated crops are more dependent on human factors than on climate factors this study shows climatic factors to explain 44 7 of the variability in the wf of rain fed maize overall indicating that climatic factors have a greater impact on the wf of rain fed crops than on that of irrigated crops although climatic conditions are uncontrollable some measures for agricultural management would reduce the impact of climatic change on wf and ensure sustainable rain fed crop production mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 reasonable agricultural management measures such as delaying the sowing date optimizing plant density choosing maize cultivars and implementing conservation tillage can avoid seasonal drought and reduce crop evapotranspiration and drainage losses to mitigate the effects of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed maize in different growth stages in northeast china meanwhile agricultural management measures can also increase yield to improve water use efficiency in rain fed maize suitably delaying the sowing date can prevent spring drought for rain fed maize production in northeast china and reduce the influence of lower precipitation on maize production in the early growth stage g1 g2 this is conducive to increasing maize yield and water use efficiency in rain fed farming systems liu et al 2013a lu et al 2017 optimizing plant density sun et al 2016 and choosing maize cultivars with lodging resistance could reduce maize lodging xue et al 2017 and improve the maize yield huang et al 2021 to relieve the impact of wind speeds in g5 and increase water use efficiency implementing conservation tillage can conserve more soil water and reduce the drainage losses to improve the utilization efficiency of precipitation zhang et al 2015 2018 which will help reduce the effect of spring drought on maize production from g1 g2 meanwhile conservation tillage will reduce actual crop evapotranspiration busari et al 2015 caused by longer sunshine hours and higher temperatures from g4 g5 in addition conservation tillage also enhances soil properties and increases yields to improve water use efficiency in rain fed agriculture zhang et al 2018 5 conclusion this study analyzed the wf of rain fed maize in five different growth stages in 36 prefectures of northeast china and identified associated climatic driving factors for 1996 2018 in general the wf of rain fed maize in each growth stage clearly varied mainly due to the variation in maize characteristics and climate conditions in different growth stages the wf was the highest in the tasseling milky growth stage whereas the lowest wf was found in the sowing emergence growth stage the blue wf accounted for 5 42 of the total wf and only appeared in the sowing emergence growth stage the green wf served as the primary water source for maize growth from the emergence jointing to milky mature growth stages and accounted for 94 58 of the total wf the wf trends of each growth stage show spatial variability in northeast china a trend of increasing wfs was found in the east and a decreasing trend was found in the southwest of northeast china in most growth stages it was not neglected that regions with increasing trends of wf indicated that crop water consumption increased which may be not conducive to efficient water use in crop production sunshine hours and temperature greatly affected variation in the wf in most growth stages precipitation had strong effects on the wf in the sowing emergence and emergence jointing growth stages relative humidity played the most central role in the wf in the jointing tasseling growth stage while wind speed had a greater impact on the wf in the milky mature growth stage appropriately adjusting agricultural measures could mitigate the impact of climatic factors on the wf of rain fed maize declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9651,the rational development and utilization of saline soils and brackish water resources has aroused great concern in the world in the present study the soil column leaching indoor simulation method was conducted to explore the salt migration characteristics in highly saline soil both brackish water 2 84 g l and yellow river water 0 51 g l were used for leaching to analyze and compare their corresponding required leaching volume soil desalination rate chemical ion composition the results showed that 1 the required leaching volume of yellow river water and brackish water were 535 875 mm and 455 1125 mm depth of soil column is 100 cm respectively the desalination time and required leaching volume of brackish water are less than yellow river water for 0 20 cm layer while for layers below 20 cm depth the desalination time and required leaching volume of yellow river water are less than brackish water to satisfy the growth of general crops the required leaching water volume of yellow river water and brackish water were 472 7 mm and 754 20 mm respectively the planned desalination depth is 0 60 cm 2 the desalination rate of the soil column leached with yellow river water was 140 higher than brackish water the soil salinity after leaching with yellow river water and brackish water was only 21 01 and 31 96 of the initial salinity simultaneously the ph and rsc residual sodium carbonate in each layer increased less under brackish water leaching than yellow river water while the sar sodium adsorption ratio in the soil column leached with brackish water decreased more than yellow river water therefore the saline land reclamation with brackish water provides an alternative solution to alleviate freshwater scarcity and guarantee the general crops growth in the yellow river delta keywords brackish water highly saline soil leaching desalination ion migration 1 introduction in china there is about 36 7 million ha saline alkali land of various types of saline alkali land resources which is regarded as an extremely important reserve land resource thereinto 12 33 million ha of saline land is of agricultural use prospects 2 13 million ha of arable land with saline obstacles has not been treated and transformed and 10 2 million ha of saline wasteland has not been used and newly formed yang et al 2015 salinization has seriously restricted the development of agriculture freshwater resources available for saline soil reclamation and agricultural production is becoming scarcer with rapid economic development therefore exploring scientific and suitable methods for saline soil reclamation and brackish water utilization has become a research hotspot for the agricultural development in saline land soil salinization in the yellow river delta is widespread the extremely high salinity makes the soil characterized with high electrical conductivity ec high sodium adsorption ratio sar low organic matter content poor soil physical structure and poor fertilizer retention capacity such characteristics as mentioned above will inhibit crop growth and yield thus desalination is an essential prerequisite to develop and utilize saline alkali land resources traditionally the main method of soil desalination in the yellow river delta is leaching with large amounts of freshwater resources however the shortage of freshwater resources in the yellow river delta has become an important limiting factor to develop and utilize the saline land what is worse seawater intrusion over exploitation of freshwater and uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation aggravated the freshwater crisis brackish water is widely distributed in the yellow river delta and mostly exists in the form of shallow groundwater liu et al 2012 it has been shown that brackish water with a salinity of 2 5 g l can be used as an alternative for agricultural crop production wang et al 2014 2017 li et al 2018 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2016 wang 2018 in recent years many scholars have conducted relevant studies on the relationship between brackish water irrigation and soil salt migration in terms of the effect of brackish water irrigation on soil physicochemical properties liu et al 2018 studied the effect of brackish water of different salinity on the infiltration characteristics and concluded that the cumulative infiltration capacity and wetting front migration depth increased with the increasing brackish water salinity he also found that there exists a linear relationship between the wetting front depth and cumulative infiltration capacity of brackish water meanwhile the cumulative infiltration capacity and wetting front migration depth varied with the infiltration time subjecting to a power function relationship liu et al 2018 the research showed that the infiltration coefficient increased first and then decreased with the increase of salinity and the infiltration index decreased continuously the conductivity of soil increased continuously around the axis of micro wetting zone and reached the maximum at the wet front and the desalting area was related to the shape of wet body and distributed in a ring shape zhang et al 2017 under brackish water irrigation the soil infiltration capacity increased and the hydraulic conductivity of yellow brown soil increased more obviously and compared with fresh water infiltration the saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil infiltration rate of silty sand and yellow brown loam increased with brackish water infiltration tang et al 2016 studies have shown that brackish water irrigation brings in salt along with soil moisture which not only causes a potential crisis of salinization but may also have a direct impact on plant growth guo et al 2017 ma et al 2010 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 the above studies mainly focused on the water migration characteristics of non saline soils under brackish water irrigation and there were fewer studies on the salt migration of highly saline soils under brackish water irrigation conditions considering the saline alkali land holds a promising potential for expanding the cultivated land resource we hypothesized that the local marginal water resources such as the abundant brackish water resource endowment can be applied to the saline land reclamation the accessibility of the hypothesis could provide an alternative solution to relief the freshwater scarcity thus this study conducted a sophisticated soil column simulation experiments to achieve the following specific goals 1 study the salt migration characteristics and the required leaching volume of brackish water for the highly saline soils in the yellow river delta 2 explore the prospect of brackish water applicationment in saline land reclamation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling location and soil physiochemical properties the soil samples were taken from the experimental station of yantai institute of coastal zone research chinese academy of sciences kenli county 118 58 38 74 118 58 58 77 e 37 45 36 32 37 46 15 56 n where no vegetation cover or disturbance occurred soil samples were taken using the cutting ring method from the 0 100 cm depth layer at 20 cm intervals the soil bulk density of each sample was measured with oven dry method the other soil samples were screened and sieved through 2 mm mesh after air dried and then filled in cylindrical buckets height 120 cm diameter 20 cm in layers to form soil columns the soil columns were filled in sequence according to the measured bulk density of the initial undisturbed soil the disturbed soil was loaded into the column at 20 cm increments each layer was filled in 4 times 5 cm each time to achieve a uniform compaction during filling process the surface of the lower layer was firstly roughed before filling the upper layer to guarantee the close linkage at the bottom of the column 10 cm thick of quartz sand was laid as a filter layer to prevent the soil particles from blocking the outfall soil particle size composition was determined using the laser mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern uk at the center for testing and analysis institute of coastal zone research chinese academy of sciences soil texture was classified according to the usda classification system the total salt content was measured by mass method recommended by ly t 1251 1999 the conductivity was measured by conductivity meter ddsj 318 china and the ph value was measured by ph meter phs 3e china the soil ion content was determined by the extraction solution with 1 5 soil water ratio the concentrations of cl so4 2 na k mg2 and ca2 were measured by dionex ics3000 ion chromatograph in the test and analysis center of yantai coastal zone research institute chinese academy of sciences hco3 and co3 2 were determined by double indicator method the specific physical and chemical properties of the test soil are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 2 leaching water brackish water and yellow river water were used for leaching table 3 yellow river water fresh water was taken from the outlet of yellow river in kenli county and brackish water was obtained by diluting the groundwater of yellow river farm in kenli county by 7 times classified by natural water salinity standard freshwater 0 1 0 g l brackish water 1 0 3 0 g l saline water 3 0 10 0 g l salt brine 10 0 100 0 g l brine 100 0 g l 2 3 test method the experiment was conducted with soil columns to simulate leaching with different water types at the bottom of the soil column a drainage hole was set to discharge the leachate the column was placed on a triangular stand and a triangular flask was used to collect the leachate at the lower end of the soil column the ech2o soil moisture monitoring system measurement indexes volume water content 1 3 apparent dielectric constant 1 15 temperature 1 conductivity 5 10 manufacturer american decagon company was used to monitor the water and salt migration which consists of an em50 data collector and five 5te sensors for soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity measurements the 5te sensors were buried at 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 90 cm depth from the soil surface fig 1 it is shown from the literature that the suitable soil salinity for general crop growth should be no more than 0 3 dong et al 2017 chen et al 2014 ye 2004 the salinity of the saturated soil solution is 3 g l which is approximately equal to the soil salt content of 0 3 therefore a salinity of less than 3 g l in the leached filtrate was used as a marker for the end of the test the test was conducted using brackish water 2 84 g l and yellow river water 0 51 g l as leaching water the yellow river water treatment was set as the control group during leaching the leachate was collected and measured for salinity every 4 h the leaching test would be ended until the salinity of the leachate was less than 3 g l at the end of the test the test soil column was dismantled and soil samples were taken in layers to measure total salinity ec electrical conductivity ph sar sodium adsorption ratio rsc residual sodium carbonate and desalination rate sar and rsc were calculated as follows 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 where the cations na ca2 and mg2 concentration were expressed in mmol l 2 rsc co 3 2 hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 where the ions co 3 2 hco 3 na ca2 and mg2 concentration were expressed in mmol l the desalination rate v de refers to the amount of desalination per unit time in the desalination process of the saline soil column and the desalination efficiency e de refers to the amount of desalination per unit water volume in the desalination process ma et al 2011 which is calculated by the formula 3 v de m 1 m 2 t 4 e de m 1 m 2 w wherein m 1 is the initial leachate salinity of the soil column g l m 2 is the final leachate salinity of the soil column g l t is the desalination duration h and w is the total water volume used for leaching l 3 results 3 1 leaching water volume and soil desalination rate 3 1 1 total volume of water required for leaching the soil column was filled with air dried soil with very low water content at the beginning of the test in the test the pores of the soil column were gradually filled with water and the soil water content gradually reached saturation state until the leachate flowed out from the bottom both air drying and saturation state were the limit state of soil water content the soil would absorb a lot of water from air drying to saturation conditions because a considerable part of water would be remained in the soil column before leaching therefore the water demand for leaching and desalination were not a fixed value when the leachate flowed out of the bottom of the soil column it was the beginning point of overall soil desalination in this test when there was leachate out of the bottom of the column it took 52 h and 59 8 h under the yellow river water and brackish water leaching conditions respectively the leaching process would be terminated when the salinity of leachate was less than 3 g l the consumed water volumes of yellow river water and brackish water were 875 mm and 1125 mm and the leachate collected from the bottom of soil column were 340 mm and 670 mm respectively it could be inferred that the water retained in the soil column were 535 mm and 455 mm respectively thus the required leaching water amount for yellow river water and brackish water were 535 mm 875 mm and 455 mm 1125 mm respectively it can be seen from fig 2 that the water infiltration in the soil column during leaching consists of two stages in the first stage there was a transition from the air dry state to the saturation state the soil was gradually infiltrated by water from the surface to reach saturation state resulting in the matrix potential gradually increased to 0 obviously the water infiltrated downward at this stage was driven by the joint action of gravitational potential and matrix potential the larger the soil water potential gradient was the larger the rate of water infiltration as the leaching wetting front gradually moved downward the soil was gradually wetted and the soil profile moisture content became gradually saturated and consistent then the column achieve a stable infiltration state namely the water infiltration per unit time was constant which symbolized the completion of the first stage in the second stage the whole soil column was completely saturated the water in the soil column flowed only under the action of gravity driven by unit gradient so the flow rate was relatively slower and stable under yellow river water leaching conditions the first 52 h was regarded as the first stage and from then on belonged to the second stage the water consumption rate of the soil column was faster in the first stage with infiltration rate of 9 3 mm h and the infiltration rate in the second stage was 5 6 mm h the turning point between the two stages was also about 59 8 h under the conditions of brackish water leaching the infiltration rate of the first stage was 8 7 mm h and that of the second stage was 5 8 mm h the water infiltration rate of the yellow river water in the first stage was 107 higher than brackish water while lower 104 in the second stage in the first stage the initial soil columns were completely air dried and the infiltration rate was fast the infiltration rate of yellow river water was greater than brackish water in the first stage by contrast the infiltration rate of brackish water in the second stage was faster than yellow river water 3 1 2 desalination time and desalination water requirement for different soil layer the soil salts move downward along with the transport of gravity water the migration speed of salts is related to the speed of gravity water which is mainly influenced by the permeability and drainage capacity of the soil for each soil layer when the electrical conductivity monitored from the sensor at 10 30 and 50 cm depth was less than 1 5 ms cm the soil salt content was less than 0 3 after conversion between conductivity and salt content the layer was considered to have achieved the desalination requirement it was available to obtain the duration time required for each soil layer achieving desalination requirement by the continuous sensor monitoring accordingly the infiltration water amount flowing into the soil column were the required leaching amount table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the desalination time and leaching quota of brackish water were less than those of yellow river water in the 0 20 cm soil layer but those of the soil layer below 20 cm depth were greater than yellow river water the results of the leaching test showed that the highly saline land could become an alternative habitat for plant growth via brackish water leaching the required amount of yellow river water and brackish water was respective 472 7 mm and 754 20 mm for saline soil to reach appropriate growing environment of general crops the planned desalination depth is 0 60 cm 3 1 3 desalination rate of soil column the desalination process started when the leachate discharged from the bottom of the soil column and ended until the salinity of the leachate being less than 3 g l the desalination rate was calculated according to the reduction of salinity and the duration time table 5 the desalination rate of soil column under yellow river water leaching was 3 10 g l h being 1 40 times of that under the brackish water leaching 2 21 g l h the desalination efficiency 0 18 g l2 of the yellow river soil column was 13 higher than that of the brackish water 0 16 g l2 3 1 4 variation of leachate salinity with the accumulated amount the relationship between leachate salinity and accumulated leachate volume for the two soil columns was illustrated in fig 3 the leachate salinity decreased sharply at the early stage and stabilized at the later stage when the accumulated volume of leachate was less than 63 7 mm the salinity of leachate from brackish water leaching was higher than that from yellow river water leaching the initial leachate salinity under brackish water leaching was much higher than that under yellow river water leaching which mainly caused by the higher salinity of brackish water itself however the reduction speed of salinity was faster than yellow river water leaching when the accumulated volume of leachate was over 63 7 mm the reduction rate of salinity under yellow river water leaching was greater than or equal to that under brackish water leaching until the accumulated leachate volume reaching up to 98 6 mm the reduction rate of salinity of the two treatments became similar to each other as a result the leachate salinity from yellow river water was lower than that of brackish water after the accumulated amount exceeded 98 6 mm 3 2 changes of leachate ions and soil characteristic indexes

leaching the increase of ph value in each layer under brackish water leaching was less than that under the yellow river water leaching and although there was an increase of ph value in each layer of soil column under the brackish water leaching it was still within the permissible range for general plant growth except that the ph value of 20 40 cm soil layer under the leaching of the yellow river water was greater than 9 during the leaching process the sar value of each soil layer profile of the soil column decreased and the rsc value increased while the reduction of sar value in the brackish water leaching soil column was greater than that in the yellow river water leaching soil column while the rsc value increment in the brackish water leaching soil column was less than that in the

saline land reclamation and development 4 discussion 4 1 brackish water infiltration improves the saline soil permeability higher salinity of leaching water promote the infiltration under the saturated soil column conditions which is similar to the findings of salinity and infiltration rate studies obtained by other scholars yu et al 2021 as the salinity of the leaching water increases the soil salt concentration rises and the diffused double electron layer squeezes toward the surface of the clay particles which weakens the repulsive force between the soil particles so that the flocculation between particles is strengthened and the agglomeration is enhanced zhang et al 2021 then the soil structure becomes more stable and the large pores in the soil become more which enhances the water conductivity of the soil as a result the water migration rate becomes faster just as the faster increase of the cumulative leaching water amount in the later stage of infiltration fig 2 soil

9651,the rational development and utilization of saline soils and brackish water resources has aroused great concern in the world in the present study the soil column leaching indoor simulation method was conducted to explore the salt migration characteristics in highly saline soil both brackish water 2 84 g l and yellow river water 0 51 g l were used for leaching to analyze and compare their corresponding required leaching volume soil desalination rate chemical ion composition the results showed that 1 the required leaching volume of yellow river water and brackish water were 535 875 mm and 455 1125 mm depth of soil column is 100 cm respectively the desalination time and required leaching volume of brackish water are less than yellow river water for 0 20 cm layer while for layers below 20 cm depth the desalination time and required leaching volume of yellow river water are less than brackish water to satisfy the growth of general crops the required leaching water volume of yellow river water and brackish water were 472 7 mm and 754 20 mm respectively the planned desalination depth is 0 60 cm 2 the desalination rate of the soil column leached with yellow river water was 140 higher than brackish water the soil salinity after leaching with yellow river water and brackish water was only 21 01 and 31 96 of the initial salinity simultaneously the ph and rsc residual sodium carbonate in each layer increased less under brackish water leaching than yellow river water while the sar sodium adsorption ratio in the soil column leached with brackish water decreased more than yellow river water therefore the saline land reclamation with brackish water provides an alternative solution to alleviate freshwater scarcity and guarantee the general crops growth in the yellow river delta keywords brackish water highly saline soil leaching desalination ion migration 1 introduction in china there is about 36 7 million ha saline alkali land of various types of saline alkali land resources which is regarded as an extremely important reserve land resource thereinto 12 33 million ha of saline land is of agricultural use prospects 2 13 million ha of arable land with saline obstacles has not been treated and transformed and 10 2 million ha of saline wasteland has not been used and newly formed yang et al 2015 salinization has seriously restricted the development of agriculture freshwater resources available for saline soil reclamation and agricultural production is becoming scarcer with rapid economic development therefore exploring scientific and suitable methods for saline soil reclamation and brackish water utilization has become a research hotspot for the agricultural development in saline land soil salinization in the yellow river delta is widespread the extremely high salinity makes the soil characterized with high electrical conductivity ec high sodium adsorption ratio sar low organic matter content poor soil physical structure and poor fertilizer retention capacity such characteristics as mentioned above will inhibit crop growth and yield thus desalination is an essential prerequisite to develop and utilize saline alkali land resources traditionally the main method of soil desalination in the yellow river delta is leaching with large amounts of freshwater resources however the shortage of freshwater resources in the yellow river delta has become an important limiting factor to develop and utilize the saline land what is worse seawater intrusion over exploitation of freshwater and uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation aggravated the freshwater crisis brackish water is widely distributed in the yellow river delta and mostly exists in the form of shallow groundwater liu et al 2012 it has been shown that brackish water with a salinity of 2 5 g l can be used as an alternative for agricultural crop production wang et al 2014 2017 li et al 2018 liu et al 2015 chen et al 2016 wang 2018 in recent years many scholars have conducted relevant studies on the relationship between brackish water irrigation and soil salt migration in terms of the effect of brackish water irrigation on soil physicochemical properties liu et al 2018 studied the effect of brackish water of different salinity on the infiltration characteristics and concluded that the cumulative infiltration capacity and wetting front migration depth increased with the increasing brackish water salinity he also found that there exists a linear relationship between the wetting front depth and cumulative infiltration capacity of brackish water meanwhile the cumulative infiltration capacity and wetting front migration depth varied with the infiltration time subjecting to a power function relationship liu et al 2018 the research showed that the infiltration coefficient increased first and then decreased with the increase of salinity and the infiltration index decreased continuously the conductivity of soil increased continuously around the axis of micro wetting zone and reached the maximum at the wet front and the desalting area was related to the shape of wet body and distributed in a ring shape zhang et al 2017 under brackish water irrigation the soil infiltration capacity increased and the hydraulic conductivity of yellow brown soil increased more obviously and compared with fresh water infiltration the saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil infiltration rate of silty sand and yellow brown loam increased with brackish water infiltration tang et al 2016 studies have shown that brackish water irrigation brings in salt along with soil moisture which not only causes a potential crisis of salinization but may also have a direct impact on plant growth guo et al 2017 ma et al 2010 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 the above studies mainly focused on the water migration characteristics of non saline soils under brackish water irrigation and there were fewer studies on the salt migration of highly saline soils under brackish water irrigation conditions considering the saline alkali land holds a promising potential for expanding the cultivated land resource we hypothesized that the local marginal water resources such as the abundant brackish water resource endowment can be applied to the saline land reclamation the accessibility of the hypothesis could provide an alternative solution to relief the freshwater scarcity thus this study conducted a sophisticated soil column simulation experiments to achieve the following specific goals 1 study the salt migration characteristics and the required leaching volume of brackish water for the highly saline soils in the yellow river delta 2 explore the prospect of brackish water applicationment in saline land reclamation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling location and soil physiochemical properties the soil samples were taken from the experimental station of yantai institute of coastal zone research chinese academy of sciences kenli county 118 58 38 74 118 58 58 77 e 37 45 36 32 37 46 15 56 n where no vegetation cover or disturbance occurred soil samples were taken using the cutting ring method from the 0 100 cm depth layer at 20 cm intervals the soil bulk density of each sample was measured with oven dry method the other soil samples were screened and sieved through 2 mm mesh after air dried and then filled in cylindrical buckets height 120 cm diameter 20 cm in layers to form soil columns the soil columns were filled in sequence according to the measured bulk density of the initial undisturbed soil the disturbed soil was loaded into the column at 20 cm increments each layer was filled in 4 times 5 cm each time to achieve a uniform compaction during filling process the surface of the lower layer was firstly roughed before filling the upper layer to guarantee the close linkage at the bottom of the column 10 cm thick of quartz sand was laid as a filter layer to prevent the soil particles from blocking the outfall soil particle size composition was determined using the laser mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern uk at the center for testing and analysis institute of coastal zone research chinese academy of sciences soil texture was classified according to the usda classification system the total salt content was measured by mass method recommended by ly t 1251 1999 the conductivity was measured by conductivity meter ddsj 318 china and the ph value was measured by ph meter phs 3e china the soil ion content was determined by the extraction solution with 1 5 soil water ratio the concentrations of cl so4 2 na k mg2 and ca2 were measured by dionex ics3000 ion chromatograph in the test and analysis center of yantai coastal zone research institute chinese academy of sciences hco3 and co3 2 were determined by double indicator method the specific physical and chemical properties of the test soil are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 2 leaching water brackish water and yellow river water were used for leaching table 3 yellow river water fresh water was taken from the outlet of yellow river in kenli county and brackish water was obtained by diluting the groundwater of yellow river farm in kenli county by 7 times classified by natural water salinity standard freshwater 0 1 0 g l brackish water 1 0 3 0 g l saline water 3 0 10 0 g l salt brine 10 0 100 0 g l brine 100 0 g l 2 3 test method the experiment was conducted with soil columns to simulate leaching with different water types at the bottom of the soil column a drainage hole was set to discharge the leachate the column was placed on a triangular stand and a triangular flask was used to collect the leachate at the lower end of the soil column the ech2o soil moisture monitoring system measurement indexes volume water content 1 3 apparent dielectric constant 1 15 temperature 1 conductivity 5 10 manufacturer american decagon company was used to monitor the water and salt migration which consists of an em50 data collector and five 5te sensors for soil moisture temperature and electrical conductivity measurements the 5te sensors were buried at 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 70 cm and 90 cm depth from the soil surface fig 1 it is shown from the literature that the suitable soil salinity for general crop growth should be no more than 0 3 dong et al 2017 chen et al 2014 ye 2004 the salinity of the saturated soil solution is 3 g l which is approximately equal to the soil salt content of 0 3 therefore a salinity of less than 3 g l in the leached filtrate was used as a marker for the end of the test the test was conducted using brackish water 2 84 g l and yellow river water 0 51 g l as leaching water the yellow river water treatment was set as the control group during leaching the leachate was collected and measured for salinity every 4 h the leaching test would be ended until the salinity of the leachate was less than 3 g l at the end of the test the test soil column was dismantled and soil samples were taken in layers to measure total salinity ec electrical conductivity ph sar sodium adsorption ratio rsc residual sodium carbonate and desalination rate sar and rsc were calculated as follows 1 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 where the cations na ca2 and mg2 concentration were expressed in mmol l 2 rsc co 3 2 hco 3 ca 2 mg 2 where the ions co 3 2 hco 3 na ca2 and mg2 concentration were expressed in mmol l the desalination rate v de refers to the amount of desalination per unit time in the desalination process of the saline soil column and the desalination efficiency e de refers to the amount of desalination per unit water volume in the desalination process ma et al 2011 which is calculated by the formula 3 v de m 1 m 2 t 4 e de m 1 m 2 w wherein m 1 is the initial leachate salinity of the soil column g l m 2 is the final leachate salinity of the soil column g l t is the desalination duration h and w is the total water volume used for leaching l 3 results 3 1 leaching water volume and soil desalination rate 3 1 1 total volume of water required for leaching the soil column was filled with air dried soil with very low water content at the beginning of the test in the test the pores of the soil column were gradually filled with water and the soil water content gradually reached saturation state until the leachate flowed out from the bottom both air drying and saturation state were the limit state of soil water content the soil would absorb a lot of water from air drying to saturation conditions because a considerable part of water would be remained in the soil column before leaching therefore the water demand for leaching and desalination were not a fixed value when the leachate flowed out of the bottom of the soil column it was the beginning point of overall soil desalination in this test when there was leachate out of the bottom of the column it took 52 h and 59 8 h under the yellow river water and brackish water leaching conditions respectively the leaching process would be terminated when the salinity of leachate was less than 3 g l the consumed water volumes of yellow river water and brackish water were 875 mm and 1125 mm and the leachate collected from the bottom of soil column were 340 mm and 670 mm respectively it could be inferred that the water retained in the soil column were 535 mm and 455 mm respectively thus the required leaching water amount for yellow river water and brackish water were 535 mm 875 mm and 455 mm 1125 mm respectively it can be seen from fig 2 that the water infiltration in the soil column during leaching consists of two stages in the first stage there was a transition from the air dry state to the saturation state the soil was gradually infiltrated by water from the surface to reach saturation state resulting in the matrix potential gradually increased to 0 obviously the water infiltrated downward at this stage was driven by the joint action of gravitational potential and matrix potential the larger the soil water potential gradient was the larger the rate of water infiltration as the leaching wetting front gradually moved downward the soil was gradually wetted and the soil profile moisture content became gradually saturated and consistent then the column achieve a stable infiltration state namely the water infiltration per unit time was constant which symbolized the completion of the first stage in the second stage the whole soil column was completely saturated the water in the soil column flowed only under the action of gravity driven by unit gradient so the flow rate was relatively slower and stable under yellow river water leaching conditions the first 52 h was regarded as the first stage and from then on belonged to the second stage the water consumption rate of the soil column was faster in the first stage with infiltration rate of 9 3 mm h and the infiltration rate in the second stage was 5 6 mm h the turning point between the two stages was also about 59 8 h under the conditions of brackish water leaching the infiltration rate of the first stage was 8 7 mm h and that of the second stage was 5 8 mm h the water infiltration rate of the yellow river water in the first stage was 107 higher than brackish water while lower 104 in the second stage in the first stage the initial soil columns were completely air dried and the infiltration rate was fast the infiltration rate of yellow river water was greater than brackish water in the first stage by contrast the infiltration rate of brackish water in the second stage was faster than yellow river water 3 1 2 desalination time and desalination water requirement for different soil layer the soil salts move downward along with the transport of gravity water the migration speed of salts is related to the speed of gravity water which is mainly influenced by the permeability and drainage capacity of the soil for each soil layer when the electrical conductivity monitored from the sensor at 10 30 and 50 cm depth was less than 1 5 ms cm the soil salt content was less than 0 3 after conversion between conductivity and salt content the layer was considered to have achieved the desalination requirement it was available to obtain the duration time required for each soil layer achieving desalination requirement by the continuous sensor monitoring accordingly the infiltration water amount flowing into the soil column were the required leaching amount table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the desalination time and leaching quota of brackish water were less than those of yellow river water in the 0 20 cm soil layer but those of the soil layer below 20 cm depth were greater than yellow river water the results of the leaching test showed that the highly saline land could become an alternative habitat for plant growth via brackish water leaching the required amount of yellow river water and brackish water was respective 472 7 mm and 754 20 mm for saline soil to reach appropriate growing environment of general crops the planned desalination depth is 0 60 cm 3 1 3 desalination rate of soil column the desalination process started when the leachate discharged from the bottom of the soil column and ended until the salinity of the leachate being less than 3 g l the desalination rate was calculated according to the reduction of salinity and the duration time table 5 the desalination rate of soil column under yellow river water leaching was 3 10 g l h being 1 40 times of that under the brackish water leaching 2 21 g l h the desalination efficiency 0 18 g l2 of the yellow river soil column was 13 higher than that of the brackish water 0 16 g l2 3 1 4 variation of leachate salinity with the accumulated amount the relationship between leachate salinity and accumulated leachate volume for the two soil columns was illustrated in fig 3 the leachate salinity decreased sharply at the early stage and stabilized at the later stage when the accumulated volume of leachate was less than 63 7 mm the salinity of leachate from brackish water leaching was higher than that from yellow river water leaching the initial leachate salinity under brackish water leaching was much higher than that under yellow river water leaching which mainly caused by the higher salinity of brackish water itself however the reduction speed of salinity was faster than yellow river water leaching when the accumulated volume of leachate was over 63 7 mm the reduction rate of salinity under yellow river water leaching was greater than or equal to that under brackish water leaching until the accumulated leachate volume reaching up to 98 6 mm the reduction rate of salinity of the two treatments became similar to each other as a result the leachate salinity from yellow river water was lower than that of brackish water after the accumulated amount exceeded 98 6 mm 3 2 changes of leachate ions and soil characteristic indexes after desalination 3 2 1 ionic composition of the leachate during the desalination process it can be seen in fig 4 cl na ca2 mg2 and k in the leachate under yellow river water leaching conditions decreased much faster than those in the leachate under brackish water leaching for hco3 and so4 2 the concentration increased rapidly and then decreased sharply meanwhile the change rates of hco3 and so4 2 concentrations in the leachate under the yellow river water leaching were greater than those under the brackish water leaching in terms of both the ascending and descending processes in the later stage of leaching the concentration of various ions stabilized gradually 3 2 2 soil characteristic indexes after desalination significant changes in total soil salinity sar rsc and ph had been occurred before and after leaching with both water types the desalination effect was gradually weakened along with the depth under both yellow river water and brackish water leaching conditions taking the weakest desalination layer 80 100 cm as an example the total salt content after leaching with yellow river water and brackish water accounted for only 21 01 and 31 96 of that before desalination respectively it indicated that the effect of desalination was obvious during the leaching experiment and the desalination effect of yellow river water leaching performed better than brackish water leaching the increase of ph value in each layer under brackish water leaching was less than that under the yellow river water leaching and although there was an increase of ph value in each layer of soil column under the brackish water leaching it was still within the permissible range for general plant growth except that the ph value of 20 40 cm soil layer under the leaching of the yellow river water was greater than 9 during the leaching process the sar value of each soil layer profile of the soil column decreased and the rsc value increased while the reduction of sar value in the brackish water leaching soil column was greater than that in the yellow river water leaching soil column while the rsc value increment in the brackish water leaching soil column was less than that in the yellow river water leaching soil column generally speaking sar and rsc were within the allowable range of general plant growth table 6 in summary saline soils can be desalinated through brackish water leaching to meet the requirements of plant growth when the leaching came to the end the ph value of the soil under brackish water leaching conditions tended to increase though it did not exceed the tolerance range for plant growth what s more all the other indexes met the requirements for plant growth in the case of shortage of fresh water resources brackish water performs great potential in

two plant densities d1 80 000 plants ha 1 d2 100 000 plants ha 1 and four n rates n0 0 n120 120 kg ha 1 n180 180 kg ha 1 n240 240 kg ha 1 were set in 2018 while a higher plant density d3 120 000 plants ha 1 was further considered in 2020 the results showed that grain yield economic benefit wp and nitrogen use efficiency were significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction except for economic benefit average grain yield increased and then decreased with increasing n rate under d1 and d2 with the maximum values under n180 in both 2018 12 193 kg ha 1 and 16 650 kg ha 1 and 2020 11 136 kg ha 1 and 15 093 kg ha 1 while it continued to increase as n rate increased under d3 in 2020 on average d2 produced significantly higher grain yield than d1 in both 2018 13 464 kg ha 1 and 10 477 kg ha 1 and 2020 13 268 kg ha 1 and 9 859 kg ha 1 while grain yield under d2 13 366 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than that under d3 12 301 kg ha 1 and d1 10 168 kg ha 1 in 2020 similar trends to grain yield were also obtained for economic benefit overall grain yield economic benefit wp and n partial factor productivity under d2n180 was significantly increased by 41 6 52 6 33

water productivity partial factor productivity 1 introduction maize zea mays l is an important cereal crop that feeds 60 of the world dietary needs along with wheat and rice fao 2020 the yield of maize needs to double by 2050 to ensure global food security shiferaw et al 2011 tilman et al 2011 rosegrant and ringler 2009 the maize planting area in china has exceeded 35 45 m ha no 1 globally while the annual production is 2 18 pg and accounts for 22 0 of the world s total production but this is still 13 4 less than that in the united states fao stat 2020 the arid region of northwest china is a characterized by a typical continental dry climate with annual average precipitation of only 150 mm and evaporation as high as 2000 2600 mm the unique climatic conditions and abundant light and heat resources in this region have created a good prerequisite for the development of maize planting industry making northwest china one of the main producing areas of spring maize owing to the recent rapid agricultural modernization in china drip fertigation has been widely used in agricultural production to increase the crop yield and utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer wang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 zou et al 2021 nitrogen n is the largest nutrient element in crop demand a large number of studies have shown that the application of nitrogen fertilizer greatly promotes the development of world agriculture improved the production level of global food crops and played a huge role in ensuring global food security lemcoff and loomis 1994 tilman et al 2002 wang et al 2018 in developing countries more than 55 of the increase in food production comes from the application of fertilizers particularly nitrogen fertilizer however the excessive nitrogen application may not significantly improve crop yield or even decrease crop yield which also causes a large waste of resources and further produces a series of ecological and environmental problems such as increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition le et al 2010 increased greenhouse gas emissions zhang et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 excessive nitrate in groundwater zhang et al 2021 zhao and chen 2006 optimizing nitrogen application rate and improving nitrogen use efficiency nue are crucial for achieving the sustainable development of agricultural environment in china in addition to n fertilization plant density is also one crucial factor that determines maize yield being possible to increase maize grain yield economic benefit and water productivity amanullah et al 2009 liu et al 2017a b xu et al 2017 nevertheless when the plant density is too high the capability of light penetrating through the lower canopy will be reduced leading to the premature senescence of the lower leaves and the reduction of radiation use efficiency zhang et al 2019 guo et al 2021 increased plant density can increase canopy light interception crop canopy productivity harvest index biomass and yield within a certain range liu et al 2017a xu et al 2017 therefore increasing plant density is one of the ways in which maize yield can be improved and it is currently the most straightforward and effective cultivation technique the optimal plant density for maximum maize yield varies in different regions which depends on climate factors soil fertility maize variety planting date planting mode and harvest time previous studies indicate that maize yield at a certain plant density can be variable among different n application rates it is thus of great importance to explore the interaction between plant density and n rate and determine how to optimize maize production and water productivity by regulating plant density and minimizing n input under drip irrigation conditions the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate the interactive effects of plant density and n rate on grain yield economic benefit wp and nue of drip fertigated spring maize in northwest china and 2 explore the ranges of plant density and n rate for simultaneously optimizing maize productivity wp and economic benefit 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a two year field experiment was conducted on

maize productivity wp and economic benefit hou et al 2021 3 results 3 1 grain yield and its components grain yield was significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction in both years table 1 in 2018 average grain yield first increased and then decreased as n rate increased peaking under n180 under both d1 12 193 kg ha 1 and d2 16 650 kg ha 1 similarly the maximum yield was obtained under n180 under d1 and d2 in 2020 with the values of 14 560 and 17 644 kg ha 1 respectively however grain yield continued to increase with the increasing n rate under d3 in 2020 with the peak value of 16 037 kg ha 1 under n240 on average d3 produced higher grain yield than d1 by 22 2 but lower grain yield than d2 by 5 6 in 2020 in 2018 increased plant density from d1 to d2 was accompanied by an increase in grain yield in 2020 grain yield increased as the plant density increased from d1 to d3 under n0 and n120 but it first increased and then decreased under n180 and n240 the maximum grain yield was obtained under d2n180 which was 31 and 17 higher than those under d1n180 and d3n180 respectively insignificant difference in grain yield was found between d1n240 and d2n120 in 2020 and similar results were obtained between d1n180 and d3n120 overall grain yield under d2n180 was significantly increased by 41 6 compared with that under d1n240 in the two years the grain number per ear was significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction in both years table 1 the grain number per ear first increased and then decreased as the increased n rate increased in both years the ear number was affected by plant density p 0 01 but not affected by n rate or plant density n rate interaction plant density and n rate had significant influence on the 100 grain weight in both years but their interaction had no significant effect on the 100 grain weight d1 increased the mean grain number per ear by 5 0 and 16 4 compared to d2 and d3 d3 increased the ear number but reduced the 100 grain weight compared with d1 as shown in table 2 the net income exhibited a similar trend to that of grain yield in the two years in 2018 the net income increased initially and then decreased with the increase of n rate the maximum net income was obtained at n180 under d2 13 180 cny ha 1 in 2018 which was increased by 3 4 and 66 9 in comparison with those under d2n240 and d1n180 respectively similarly the maximum net income was obtained under d2n180 12 096 cny ha 1 in 2020 which was increased by 9 3 35 4 and 18 6 in comparison with those under d2n240 d1n180 and d3n180 respectively the net income was averagely increased by 2 864 cny ha 1 as the plant density increased from d1 to d2 while it was averagely decreased by 656 cny ha 1 as the plant density increased from d2 to d3 compared with d1n240 d1n180 reduced n rate by 33 3 but the average net income increased by 10 7 990 cny ha 1 compared with d2n240 there was no significant difference between d2n180 in net income the combination of denser plant density d2 and reduced n rate n180 obtained the maximal economic benefit 3 2 evapotranspiration and water productivity both plant density and n rate as well as their interaction exerted significant influence on et in the two years table 3 increased plant density was accompanied by an increase in et in both years by 24 1 between d2 and d1 in 2018 by 16 7 between d2 and d1 and by 21 3 between d3 and d1 in 2020 since the rainfall and irrigation amount in 2020 was greater than that in 2018 et in 2020 was generally higher than that in 2018 the difference in irrigation amount was the major cause of the difference in et and also the irrigation amount had a positive correlation with et in the two years et under n240 was significantly higher than that under n180 p 0 05 under d2 in 2018 but the opposite result was obtained in 2020 the fixed effects of n rate plant density and two way interaction on wp were significant p 0 05 in both 2018 and 2020 except for that n rate had no significant effect on wp in 2018 in 2018 average wp initially increased with the increasing n rate from 0 to 180 kg ha 1 and then decreased from 108 to 240 kg ha 1 and the highest wp occurred under n180 similar results were also obtained in 2020 except for that under d3 average wp was 2 88 kg m 3 under d1 3 16 kg m 3 under d2 and 2 80 kg m 3 under d3 while average wp was 2 76 kg m 3 under n120 3 31 kg m 3 under n180 and 2 94 kg m 3 under n240 which was increased by 4 5 21 0 and 11 5 compared to that under n0 respectively average wp increased markedly from d1 to d2 and then decreased under d3 average wp under d1 and d3 were 8 8 and 12 7 lower than that under d2 specially wp was not significant different among various n rates under d3 the changes in iwp were consistent with those in grain yield 3 3 nitrogen accumulation and distribution plant density n rate and their interaction had significant p 0 05 or extremely significant p 0 01 influence on total n uptake by maize plants in both years table 4 the effect of n rate on n uptake was greater than that of plant density at the same plant density total n uptake by maize plants increased with the increase in n rate n fertilizer application was effective to increase the nitrogen uptake of maize plants but the increasing rate varied among different plant density treatments in comparison with n0 n uptake was increased by 39 67 in the treatments with n applied the total n uptake was increased by 40 0 under d1 46 9 under d2 and 52 9 under d3 no significant difference was observed in total n uptake between d2n240 and d3n240 in 2020 at n180 total n uptake increased with the increase of plant density and total n uptake under d3 was not significant from that under d2 the nitrogen distribution rates of stems leaves and grains at maturity were 11 3 25 6 12 2 25 7 and 49 6 69 3 with the average values of 21 4 13 5 and 65 1 respectively in 2018 the leaf n uptake basically maintained an increasing trend with the increase in n rate at the same plant density but there was no significant difference between d2n180 and d2n240 similar results were also obtained in 2020 but there was no significant difference between d3n180 and d3n240 at n180 and n240 the leaf n uptake was not significant different among different plant densities at n0 and n120 the leaf n uptake increased with the increase in plant density in both years at the same plant density the n uptake of stems and leaves showed similar trends at the same plant density grain n uptake increased with the increase in n rate and reached the maximum value under n240 the maximum grain n uptake was 125 1 137 1 and 151 9 kg ha 1 under d1 d2 and d3 respectively compared with n240 grain n uptake was increased by 19 7 18 7 and 22 8 under n180 n120 and n0 respectively n rate had a significant effect on nitrogen residue in the soil profile while plant density and the interaction between plant density and n rate had no significant effect on nitrogen residue in the soil profile excessive n fertilizer application led to a high no3 n residual in the soil the no3 n residual in the soil profile increased with the increase in n rate 3 4 nitrogen use efficiency plant density n rate and their interaction significantly affected the n partial productivity npfp in both years except for n rate in 2018 table 5 in both years npfp decreased with the increasing n rate at the same plant density in 2018 npfp was averagely decreased by 20 7 kg kg 1 with an increase in n rate by 60 kg ha 1 in 2018 d2n180 and d2n240 had no significant difference in grain yield p 0 05 but npfp was significantly higher under d2n180 compared with that under d2n240 p 0 05 d2n180 increased npfp by 12 7 and 44 1 compared with d1n240 and d2n240 respectively p 0 05 in 2020 npfp reached the maximum under d3n120 which was 124 8 kg kg 1 compared with d1n240 d2n240 and d3n240 d2n180 increased npfp by 44 2 27 5 and 33 0 respectively p 0

which was 28 9 kg kg 1 in 2018 and 31 2 kg kg 1 in 2020 compared to d2 nae was increased by 16 3 and 39 3 under d3 and d1 at n120 respectively increasing n rate remarkably reduced nae but the reduction rate was different among different plant densities compared with n120 n240 and n180 reduced nae by 58 and 62 under d1 by 25 and 59 under d2 and by 16 and 19 under d3 nutrient utilization efficiency nute refers to the efficiency of converting the unit nitrogen fertilizer input into yield n rate had extremely significant effect on nute p 0 01 but plant density and the interaction between n rate and plant density had no significant effect on nute p 0 05 in 2018 nute initially increased and then decreased with the increase in n rate and reached the maximum under d2n180 which was significantly improved by 36 9 and 16 5 compared with that under d2n240 and d1n180 in 2020 nute initially increased and then decreased with the increase in n rate under d1 and d2 and gradually increased with the increasing n rate at d3 overall nute achieved the maximum value under d2n180 which was significantly improved by 7 8 and 22 1 compared with that under d3n180 and d2n240 there was no correlation between plant density and nute plant density significantly affected nhi p 0 01 but n rate and the two way interaction had no significant effect on nhi p 0 05 in 2018 nhi significantly

plant density and nitrogen rate ranges for optimal grain yield economic return and water productivity there were significant p 0 05 interaction effects of plant density and n rate on grain yield wp and net return table 6 shows the fitted binary quadratic regression equations between grain yield wp and net return and plant density and n rate p 0 01 the interaction effects of plant density and n rate on grain yield wp and net return were convex downwards fig 3a c in this study the optimal ranges of plant density and nitrogen rate was determined with the target of 95 of the maximum grain yield wp and economic return from fig 3 the plant density of 93 500 116 500 plants ha 1 and n rate of 185 240 kg ha 1 were able to obtain 95 of the maximum grain yield the plant density of 91 500 110 000 plants ha 1 and n rate of 110 205 kg ha 1 were able to obtain 95 of the maximum water productivity and the plant density of 95 000 117 500 plants ha 1 and n rate of 155 240 kg ha 1 were able to obtain 95 of the maximum economic benefit the overlap between the plant density and nitrogen rate was plant density of 95 000 110 000 plants ha 1 and nitrogen rate of 185 205 kg ha 1 which were the recommended ranges of plant density and nitrogen rate for the sustainable maize production under drip irrigation in the study region 4 discussion 4 1 effects of plant density and n rate on maize yield and economic benefit grain yield was significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction in both years increasing the plant density of drought tolerant varieties in arid areas is a primary cultivation measure for improving maize yield in our study grain yield responded positively to the increase of plant density from 80 000 plants ha 1 to 100 000 plants ha 1 regardless of n rate the reduction in the productivity of individual plant can be partially compensated by an accompanying increase in the number of plants per unit area fang et al 2018 however grain yield decreased when increasing plant density from 10 000 plants ha 1 to 120 000 plants ha 1 in 2020 this was because the seasonal interception of solar radiation was aggravated when plant density was too high which lowered the canopy photosynthesis and biomass accumulation resulting in the reduction of grain yield coetto et al 2013 besides crowding could not offset the reduction in grain yield per plant resulting from intense intraspecific competition for water and fertilizer resources boomsma et al 2009 shafi et al 2012 in our study the kernel number and 100 kernel weight greatly decreased under the high plant density leading to the decline in maize yield previous studies have shown that high grain yield is associated with high crop n requirement dharmakeerthi et al 2005 meng et al 2016 in this study maize yield first increased and then decreased as n rate increased peaking at n180 at low and medium plant densities which was similar to the finding of liu et al 2017 who found an optimum n rate of 184 5 kg ha 1 among the range of 0 300 kg ha 1 in improving maize yield n180 reduced n rate by 25 without compromising grain production compared with n240 excessive application of n fertilizer is reported to inhibit root growth and development thereby reducing the ability of roots to absorb nutrients and water efficiently liu et al 2017 the optimal n concentrations during grain filling helps to reduce n translocated from vegetative organs to grains which may result in delayed leaf senescence fageria and baligar 2005 prolonged dry matter accumulation marques and aguiar 2017 and higher grain yield liu et al 2019 however grain yield continued to increase with the increasing n rate at high plant density maize may reduce the ability of using soil n at the post silking stage and adequate n supplementation and uptake by plants during grain filling may be thus needed to increase grain yield when grown at excessively high plant densities liu et al 2019 the results indicated that the optimal grain yield could be obtained by appropriately increasing plant density 100 000 plants ha 1 and reducing n rate 180 kg ha 1 one of the main goals in agriculture is economic benefit at the same n rate increasing plant density within a certain range can acquire an increase in economic benefit due to the increased grain yield the net income was averagely increased by 2 864 cny ha 1 as the plant density increased from d1 to d2 while it was averagely decreased by 656 cny ha 1 as the plant density increased from d2 to d3 at the same plant density the net income first increased and then decreased as the n rate increased indicating that net income was not always proportional to n rate in all cases which was consistent with previous studies he et al 2014 in our study the maximum net return 13 180 cny ha 1 was achieved with plant density of 100 000 plants ha 1 d2 and nitrogen rate of 180 n180 kg ha 1 in other words an increase in economic benefit by 738 cny ha 1 was achieved with a reduction of 60 kg ha 1 in n rate this was attributed to the effective plant density involved in this study which facilitated the accumulation of dry mass in maize kernels therefore appropriate reduction in n consumption also improved resource use efficiencies while ensuring grain yield 4 2 effects of plant density and n rate on water productivity the improvement in wp of grain yield is the focus of researchers and producers wp was quadratically correlated with plant density in our study the plant density had a significant p 0 05 effect on wp compared with d1 d2 significantly increased average wp by 8 8 hern√°ndez et al 2021 reported that the response of wp to increasing plant density from 4 to 8 or from 4 to 12 plants m 2 was influenced by seasonal water supply higher plant densities promoted larger wp in maize under non water limited environments however d3 significantly p 0 05 reduced average wp under various n rates by 12 7 compared with d2 which was caused by the significant reduction in grain yield and increase in et under d3 compared with those under d2 although the main purpose of n fertilization is to raise crop yield but is has never been considered as a measure for water conservation n fertilization also plays a very important role in increase of the proportion of water used by plants wp is influenced by crop yield irrigation amount and method et crop environment and climatic characteristics zou et al 2021 zou et al 2020 in our study n rate had a significant p 0 05 effect on wp wp first increased with the increase in n rate at low and medium densities this was because the principal basis of n nutrient input on improvement of water use was to promote plant growth and allow more rapid expansion of the canopy in addition wp under n240 was lower than that under n180 at d1 and d2 this was due to a higher sensitivity to soil water by the plant at higher n rate as a final result n fertilization significantly increased wp as reported by a variety of experiments li et al 2009 4 3 effects of plant density and n rate on nitrogen use efficiency an optimal rate of n application is expected to produce a balance between crop demand and n supply and ensure maximum crop production while conserving resources and protecting against environmental damage ciampitti and vyn 2011 n utilization efficiency nute is an important factor affecting economic and environmental benefits sanda√±a et al 2021 the increase in n application rates is usually accompanied by a decrease in nute ju and christie 2011 significant effects of n rate were also observed on nute including nae nre and nhi in our study conversely reducing the n application rate can create a balance between crop demand and n supply chen et al 2015 in this study the optimal maize yield and nute was obtained at a n rate of 180 kg ha 1 which ensured the grain yield and reduced n rate a study in nebraska the united states showed that when the n rate was less than or close to the optimal economic n rate the best maize yield 14 800 kg ha 1 and nre 67 were guaranteed at an n rate of 171 kg ha 1 wortmann et al 2011 nute decreased significantly when increasing n rate to 240 kg ha 1 excessive n application is not conducive to the increase in grain yield and increases the loss of nitrogen and leaching beyond the rhizosphere which leads to a decrease in nute correndo et al 2021 npfp reflects the ability of crops to utilize soil nitrogen pool and exogenous nitrogen input to achieve economic output cassman et al 1998 achieving high npfp is one of the main objectives of current agricultural production during the two growing seasons the average npfp was 63 kg kg 1 which was consistent with previous research results chen et al 2011 promoting the transfer of nitrogen stored in vegetative organs to grains at grain filling stage and improving nitrogen assimilation after silking can jointly achieve high grain yield and n productivity liu et al 2015 in our study increasing plant density from d1 to d2 increased the npfp it was mainly because increasing plant density could maximize the uptake of applied nutrients in the form of fertilizers and also available n from other organic sources however npfp decreased when the plant density increased from d2 to d3 this can be due to that maize plants under crowding stress high plant density had lower n concentration on leaf blades the main reservoir organs of pre flowering n uptake due to changes in n partitioning among plant organs nasielski and deen 2019 nhi as an important agronomic index representing the extent of nitrogen transfer from vegetative structure to reproductive structure ciampitti and vyn 2011 plant n accumulation increased with increasing n rate but the n accumulation in the grain was not significantly different between n180 and n240 in our study and nhi was greater under n180 than n240 which indicated that increased n in the plants did not transfer to the grain resulting in excessive n absorption and residual n in the vegetative organs in this study the average nhi over the two growing seasons was 63 1 which was similar to the results of ciampitti and vyn 2013 average 64 this may be due to the increase in grain yield driving nitrogen distribution and transport liu et al 2015 soil no3 n content can directly reflect the effective soil n fertility nitrogen use and growth status of maize were extremely sensitive to n fertilizer supply after two harvest seasons of maize when n rate ranged within 0 180 kg ha 1 the effective soil n fertility declined 4 4 optimizing plant density and nitrogen rate ranges for acceptable grain yield economic return and water productivity in agricultural production it is not possible to obtain optimal values of different goals for example increasing n rate within a certain range generally increased maize yield but increased cost and reduced n use efficiency through the regression analysis a reasonable interval can be determined to meet requirements in recent years researchers have taken the crop yield wp and n use efficiency and economic benefit as goals and used regression analysis to determine the optimal irrigation and fertilization regimes for crops such as maize zou et al 2020 cotton hou et al 2021 and cucumber wang et al 2019 however few studies have used this method to quantify optimal plant density in this study the regression analysis was applied to obtain the relationship between crop yield wp economic benefit and plant density and n rate this study explored the optimal ranges of plant density and n rate that could obtain 95 of the maximum grain yield wp and economic benefit at the same time the results indicated that the optimal ranges of plant density of 95 000 110 000 plants ha 1 and n rate of 185 205 kg ha 1 were able to simultaneously obtain 95 of the maximum grain yield water productivity and economic benefit 5 conclusions in the arid region of northwest china low density planting 80 000 plants ha 1 and excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer 240 kg ha 1 are commonly applied which often limits maize yield and water nitrogen use efficiency the results showed that maize yield economic benefit water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency were significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction except for economic return grain yield increased and then decreased with increasing n rate under d1 and d2 but it continued to increase under d3 grain yield first increased and then decreased with the increasing plant density regardless of n rate similar results were also obtained for economic benefit grain yield economic benefit wp and n partial factor productivity under d2n180 was significantly increased compared with those under the conventional management practice d1n240 grain yield water productivity and economic benefit simultaneously obtained 95 of their maximum values with plant density of 95 000 110 000 plants ha 1 and n rate of 185 205 kg ha 1 which was recommended for achieving the sustainable development of maize in the study region further studies may focus on the interaction of irrigation amount n rate and plant density

9652,plant density and nitrogen n rate are two important factors affecting maize yield however the interacting effects of plant density and nitrogen rate on maize production and water productivity are still poorly understood especially under drip irrigation conditions a two year field experiment was carried out to determine the interactive effects of plant density and n rate on grain yield economic benefit water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency of drip fertigated spring maize zea mays l in northwest china based on the local plant density of 80 000 plants ha 1 and n rate of 240 kg ha 1

plants ha 1 was further considered in 2020 the results showed that grain yield economic benefit wp and nitrogen use efficiency were significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction except for economic benefit average grain yield increased and then decreased with increasing n rate under d1 and d2 with the maximum values under n180 in both 2018 12 193 kg ha 1 and 16 650 kg ha 1 and 2020 11 136 kg ha 1 and 15 093 kg ha 1 while it continued to increase as n rate increased under d3 in 2020 on average d2 produced significantly higher grain yield than d1 in both 2018 13 464 kg ha 1 and 10 477 kg ha 1 and 2020 13 268 kg ha 1 and 9 859 kg ha 1 while grain yield under d2 13 366 kg ha 1 was significantly higher than that under d3 12 301 kg ha 1 and d1 10 168 kg ha 1 in 2020 similar trends to grain yield were also obtained for economic benefit overall grain yield economic benefit wp and n partial factor productivity under d2n180 was significantly increased by 41 6 52 6 33

water productivity partial factor productivity 1 introduction maize zea mays l is an important cereal crop that feeds 60 of the world dietary needs along with wheat and rice fao 2020 the yield of maize needs to double by 2050 to ensure global food security shiferaw et al 2011 tilman et al 2011 rosegrant and ringler 2009 the maize planting area in china has exceeded 35 45 m ha no 1 globally while the annual production is 2 18 pg and accounts for 22 0 of the world s total production but this is still 13 4 less than that in the united states fao stat 2020 the arid region of northwest china is a characterized by a typical continental dry climate with annual average precipitation of only 150 mm and evaporation as high as 2000 2600 mm the unique climatic conditions and abundant light and heat resources in this region have created a good prerequisite for the development of maize planting industry making northwest china one of the main producing areas of spring maize owing to the recent rapid agricultural modernization in china drip fertigation has been widely used in agricultural production to increase the crop yield and utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer wang et al 2021 yan et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 zou et al 2021 nitrogen n is the largest nutrient element in crop demand a large number of studies have shown that the application of nitrogen fertilizer greatly promotes the development of world agriculture improved the production level of global food crops and played a huge role in ensuring global food security lemcoff and loomis 1994 tilman et al 2002 wang et al 2018 in developing countries more than 55 of the increase in food production comes from the application of fertilizers particularly nitrogen fertilizer however the excessive nitrogen application may not significantly improve crop yield or even decrease crop yield which also causes a large waste of resources and further produces a series of ecological and environmental problems such as increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition le et al 2010 increased greenhouse gas emissions zhang et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 excessive nitrate in groundwater zhang et al 2021 zhao and chen 2006 optimizing nitrogen application rate and improving nitrogen use efficiency nue are crucial for achieving the sustainable development of agricultural environment in china in addition to n fertilization plant density is also one crucial factor that determines maize yield being possible to increase maize grain yield economic benefit and water productivity amanullah et al 2009 liu et al 2017a b xu et al 2017 nevertheless when the plant density is too high the capability of light penetrating through the lower canopy will be reduced leading to the premature senescence of the lower leaves and the reduction of radiation use efficiency zhang et al 2019 guo et al 2021 increased plant density can increase canopy light interception crop canopy productivity harvest index biomass and yield within a certain range liu et al 2017a xu et al 2017 therefore increasing plant density is one of the ways in which maize yield can be improved and it is currently the most straightforward and effective cultivation technique the optimal plant density for maximum maize yield varies in different regions which depends on climate factors soil fertility maize variety planting date planting mode and harvest time previous studies indicate that maize yield at a certain plant density can be variable among different n application rates it is thus of great importance to explore the interaction between plant density and n rate and determine how to optimize maize production and water productivity by regulating plant density and minimizing n input under drip irrigation conditions the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate the interactive effects of plant density and n rate on grain yield economic benefit wp and nue of drip fertigated spring maize in northwest china and 2 explore the ranges of plant density and n rate for simultaneously optimizing maize productivity wp and economic benefit 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a two year field experiment was conducted on

responses of grain yield wp and economic benefit to plant density and n rate the surfaces were overlapped to obtain the appropriate ranges of plant density and n rate that simultaneously optimize maize productivity wp and economic benefit hou et al 2021 3 results 3 1 grain yield and its components grain yield was significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction in both years table 1 in 2018 average grain yield first increased and then decreased as n rate increased peaking under n180 under both d1 12 193 kg ha 1 and d2 16 650 kg ha 1 similarly the maximum yield was obtained under n180 under d1 and d2 in 2020 with the values of 14 560 and 17 644 kg ha 1 respectively however grain yield continued to increase with the increasing n rate under d3 in 2020 with the peak value of 16 037 kg ha 1 under n240 on average d3 produced higher grain yield than d1 by 22 2 but lower grain yield than d2 by 5 6 in 2020 in 2018 increased plant density from d1 to d2 was accompanied by an increase in grain yield in 2020 grain yield increased as the plant density increased from d1 to d3 under n0 and n120 but it first increased and then decreased under n180 and n240 the maximum grain yield was obtained under d2n180 which was 31 and 17 higher than those under d1n180 and d3n180 respectively insignificant difference in grain yield was found between d1n240 and d2n120 in 2020 and similar results were obtained between d1n180 and d3n120 overall grain yield under d2n180 was significantly increased by 41 6 compared with that under d1n240 in the two years the grain number per ear was significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction in both years table 1 the grain number per ear first increased and then decreased as the increased n rate increased in both years the ear number was affected by plant density p 0 01 but not affected by n rate or plant density n rate interaction plant density and n rate had significant influence on the 100 grain weight in both years but their interaction had no significant effect on the 100 grain weight d1 increased the mean grain number per ear by 5 0 and 16 4 compared to d2 and d3 d3 increased the ear number but reduced the 100 grain weight compared with d1 as shown in table 2 the net income exhibited a similar trend to that of grain yield in the two years in 2018 the net income increased initially and then decreased with the increase of n rate the maximum net income was obtained at n180 under d2 13 180 cny ha 1 in 2018 which was increased by 3 4 and 66 9 in comparison with those under d2n240 and d1n180 respectively similarly the maximum net income was obtained under d2n180 12 096 cny ha 1 in 2020 which was increased by 9 3 35 4 and 18 6 in comparison with those under d2n240 d1n180 and d3n180 respectively the net income was averagely increased by 2 864 cny ha 1 as the plant density increased from d1 to d2 while it was averagely decreased by 656 cny ha 1 as the plant density increased from d2 to d3 compared with d1n240 d1n180 reduced n rate by 33 3 but the average net income increased by 10 7 990 cny ha 1 compared with d2n240 there was no significant difference between d2n180 in net income the combination of denser plant density d2 and reduced n rate n180 obtained the maximal economic benefit 3 2 evapotranspiration and water productivity both plant density and n rate as well as their interaction exerted significant influence on et in the two years table 3 increased plant density was accompanied by an increase in et in both years by 24 1 between d2 and d1 in 2018 by 16 7 between d2 and d1 and by 21 3 between d3 and d1 in 2020 since the rainfall and irrigation amount in 2020 was greater than that in 2018 et in 2020 was generally higher than that in 2018 the difference in irrigation amount was the major cause of the difference in et and also the irrigation amount had a positive correlation with et in the two years et under n240 was significantly higher than that under n180 p 0 05 under d2 in 2018 but the opposite result was obtained in 2020 the fixed effects of n rate plant density and two way interaction on wp were significant p 0 05 in both 2018 and 2020 except for that n rate had no significant effect on wp in 2018 in 2018 average wp initially increased with the increasing n rate from 0 to 180 kg ha 1 and then decreased from 108 to 240 kg ha 1 and the highest wp occurred under n180 similar results were also obtained in 2020 except for that under d3 average wp was 2 88 kg m 3 under d1 3 16 kg m 3 under d2 and 2 80 kg m 3 under d3 while average wp was 2 76 kg m 3 under n120 3 31 kg m 3 under n180 and 2 94 kg m 3 under n240 which was increased by 4 5 21 0 and 11 5 compared to that under n0 respectively average wp increased markedly from d1 to d2 and then decreased under d3 average wp under d1 and d3 were 8 8 and 12 7 lower than that under d2 specially wp was not significant different among various n rates under d3 the changes in iwp were consistent with those in grain yield 3 3 nitrogen accumulation and distribution plant density n rate and their interaction had significant p 0 05 or extremely significant p 0 01 influence on total n uptake by maize plants in both years table 4 the effect of n rate on n uptake was greater than that of plant density at the same plant density total n uptake by maize plants increased with the increase in n rate n fertilizer application was effective to increase the nitrogen uptake of maize plants but the increasing rate varied among different plant density treatments in comparison with n0 n uptake was increased by 39 67 in the treatments with n applied the total n uptake was increased by 40 0 under d1 46 9 under d2 and 52 9 under d3 no significant difference was observed in total n uptake between d2n240 and d3n240 in 2020 at n180 total n uptake increased with the increase of plant density and total n uptake under d3 was not significant from that under d2 the nitrogen distribution rates of stems leaves and grains at maturity were 11 3 25 6 12 2 25 7 and 49 6 69 3 with the average values of 21 4 13 5 and 65 1 respectively in 2018 the leaf n uptake basically maintained an increasing trend with the increase in n rate at the same plant density but there was no significant difference between d2n180 and d2n240 similar results were also obtained in 2020 but there was no significant difference between d3n180 and d3n240 at n180 and n240 the leaf n uptake was not significant different among different plant densities at n0 and n120 the leaf n uptake increased with the increase in plant density in both years at the same plant density the n uptake of stems and leaves showed similar trends at the same plant density grain n uptake increased with the increase in n rate and reached the maximum value under n240 the maximum grain n uptake was 125 1 137 1 and 151 9 kg ha 1 under d1 d2 and d3 respectively compared with n240 grain n uptake was increased by 19 7 18 7 and 22 8 under n180 n120 and n0 respectively n rate had a significant effect on nitrogen residue in the soil profile while plant density and the interaction between plant density and n rate had no significant effect on nitrogen residue in the soil profile excessive n fertilizer application led to a high no3 n residual in the soil the no3 n residual in the soil profile increased with the increase in n rate 3 4 nitrogen use efficiency plant density n rate and their interaction significantly affected the n partial productivity npfp in both years except for n rate in 2018 table 5 in both years npfp decreased with the increasing n rate at the same plant density in 2018 npfp was averagely decreased by 20 7 kg kg 1 with an increase in n rate by 60 kg ha 1 in 2018 d2n180 and d2n240 had no significant difference in grain yield p 0 05 but npfp was significantly higher under d2n180 compared with that under d2n240 p 0 05 d2n180 increased npfp by 12 7 and 44 1 compared with d1n240 and d2n240 respectively p 0 05 in 2020 npfp reached the maximum under d3n120 which was 124 8 kg kg 1 compared with d1n240 d2n240 and d3n240 d2n180 increased npfp by 44 2 27 5 and 33 0 respectively p 0 05 the agronomic efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer nae comprehensively reflects the apparent recovery rate and physiological efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer plant density n rate and their interaction had significant effects on nae in the two years p 0 05 nae increased initially and then decreased with the increase in plant density in the two years nae reached the maximum under d2n120 which was 28 9 kg kg 1 in 2018 and 31 2 kg kg 1 in 2020 compared to d2 nae was increased by 16 3 and 39 3 under d3 and d1 at n120 respectively increasing n rate remarkably reduced nae but the reduction rate was different among different plant densities compared with n120 n240 and n180 reduced nae by 58 and 62 under d1 by 25 and 59 under d2 and by 16 and 19 under d3 nutrient utilization efficiency nute refers to the efficiency of converting the unit nitrogen fertilizer input into yield n rate had extremely significant effect on nute p 0 01 but plant density and the interaction between n rate and plant density had no significant effect on nute p 0 05 in 2018 nute initially increased and then decreased with the increase in n rate and reached the maximum under d2n180 which was significantly improved by 36 9 and 16 5 compared with that under d2n240 and d1n180 in 2020 nute initially increased and then decreased with the increase in n rate under d1 and d2 and gradually increased with the increasing n rate at d3 overall nute achieved the maximum value under d2n180 which was significantly improved by 7 8 and 22 1 compared with that under d3n180 and d2n240 there was no correlation between plant density and nute plant density significantly affected nhi p 0 01 but n rate and the two way interaction had no significant effect on nhi p 0 05 in 2018 nhi significantly increased when the nitrogen rate ranged 0 180 kg ha 1 but it decreased at 240 kg ha 1 under d1 under d2 n fertilization significantly increased nhi but there was no significant difference between the fertilized treatments similar trends were obtained under d1 and d2 in 2020 n application significantly increased nhi under d3 but there was no significant difference among the fertilized treatments in both years nhi decreased significantly with the increase in plant density at the same n rate nhi first increased and then decreased with the increase in plant density under n240 3 5 determination of plant density and nitrogen rate ranges for optimal grain yield economic return and water productivity there were significant p 0 05 interaction effects of plant density and n rate on grain yield wp and net return table 6 shows the fitted binary quadratic regression equations between grain yield wp and net return and plant density and n rate p 0 01 the interaction effects of plant density and n rate on grain yield wp and net return were convex downwards fig 3a c in this study the optimal ranges of plant density and nitrogen rate was determined with the target of 95 of the maximum grain yield wp and economic return from fig 3 the plant density of 93 500 116 500 plants ha 1 and n rate of 185 240 kg ha 1 were able to obtain 95 of the maximum grain yield the plant density of 91 500 110 000 plants ha 1 and n rate of 110 205 kg ha 1 were able to obtain 95 of the maximum water productivity and the plant density of 95 000 117 500 plants ha 1 and n rate of 155 240 kg ha 1 were able to obtain 95 of the maximum economic benefit the overlap between the plant density and nitrogen rate was plant density of 95 000 110 000 plants ha 1 and nitrogen rate of 185 205 kg ha 1 which were the recommended ranges of plant density and nitrogen rate for the sustainable maize production under drip irrigation in the study region 4 discussion 4 1 effects of plant density and n rate on maize yield and economic benefit grain yield was significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction in both years increasing the plant density of drought tolerant varieties in arid areas is a primary cultivation measure for improving maize yield in our study grain yield responded positively to the increase of plant density from 80 000 plants ha 1 to 100 000 plants ha 1 regardless of n rate the reduction in the productivity of individual plant can be partially compensated by an accompanying increase in the number of plants per unit area fang et al 2018 however grain yield decreased when increasing plant density from 10 000 plants ha 1 to 120 000 plants ha 1 in 2020 this was because the seasonal interception of solar radiation was aggravated when plant density was too high which lowered the canopy photosynthesis and biomass accumulation resulting in the reduction of grain yield coetto et al 2013 besides crowding could not offset the reduction in grain yield per plant resulting from intense intraspecific competition for water and fertilizer resources boomsma et al 2009 shafi et al 2012 in our study the kernel number and 100 kernel weight greatly decreased under the high plant density leading to the decline in maize yield previous studies have shown that high grain yield is associated with high crop n requirement dharmakeerthi et al 2005 meng et al 2016 in this study maize yield first increased and then decreased as n rate increased peaking at n180 at low and medium plant densities which was similar to the finding of liu et al 2017 who found an optimum n rate of 184 5 kg ha 1 among the range of 0 300 kg ha 1 in improving maize yield n180 reduced n rate by 25 without compromising grain production compared with n240 excessive application of n fertilizer is reported to inhibit root growth and development thereby reducing the ability of roots to absorb nutrients and water efficiently liu et al 2017 the optimal n concentrations during grain filling helps to reduce n translocated from vegetative organs to grains which may result in delayed leaf senescence fageria and baligar 2005 prolonged dry matter accumulation marques and aguiar 2017 and higher grain yield liu et al 2019 however grain yield continued to increase with the increasing n rate at high plant density maize may reduce the ability of using soil n at the post silking stage and adequate n supplementation and uptake by plants during grain filling may be thus needed to increase grain yield when grown at excessively high plant densities liu et al 2019 the results indicated that the optimal grain yield could be obtained by appropriately increasing plant density 100 000 plants ha 1 and reducing n rate 180 kg ha 1 one of the main goals in agriculture is economic benefit at the same n rate increasing plant density within a certain range can acquire an increase in economic benefit due to the increased grain yield the net income was averagely increased by 2 864 cny ha 1 as the plant density increased from d1 to d2 while it was averagely decreased by 656 cny ha 1 as the plant density increased from d2 to d3 at the same plant density the net income first increased and then decreased as the n rate increased indicating that net income was not always proportional to n rate in all cases which was consistent with previous studies he et al 2014 in our study the maximum net return 13 180 cny ha 1 was achieved with plant density of 100 000 plants ha 1 d2 and nitrogen rate of 180 n180 kg ha 1 in other words an increase in economic benefit by 738 cny ha 1 was achieved with a reduction of 60 kg ha 1 in n rate this was attributed to the effective plant density involved in this study which facilitated the accumulation of dry mass in maize kernels therefore appropriate reduction in n consumption also improved resource use efficiencies while ensuring grain yield 4 2 effects of plant density and n rate on water productivity the improvement in wp of grain yield is the focus of researchers and producers wp was quadratically correlated with plant density in our study the plant density had a significant p 0 05 effect on wp compared with d1 d2 significantly increased average wp by 8 8 hern√°ndez et al 2021 reported that the response of wp to increasing plant density from 4 to 8 or from 4 to 12 plants m 2 was influenced by seasonal water supply higher plant densities promoted larger wp in maize under non water limited environments however d3 significantly p 0 05 reduced average wp under various n rates by 12 7 compared with d2 which was caused by the significant reduction in grain yield and increase in et under d3 compared with those under d2 although the main purpose of n fertilization is to raise crop yield but is has never been considered as a measure for water conservation n fertilization also plays a very important role in increase of the proportion of water used by plants wp is influenced by crop yield irrigation amount and method et crop environment and climatic characteristics zou et al 2021 zou et al 2020 in our study n rate had a significant p 0 05 effect on wp wp first increased with the increase in n rate at low and medium densities this was because the principal basis of n nutrient input on improvement of water use was to promote plant growth and allow more rapid expansion of the canopy in addition wp under n240 was lower than that under n180 at d1 and d2 this was due to a higher sensitivity to soil water by the plant at higher n rate as a final result n fertilization significantly increased wp as reported by a variety of experiments li et al 2009 4 3 effects of plant density and n rate on nitrogen use efficiency an optimal rate of n application is expected to produce a balance between crop demand and n supply and ensure maximum crop production while conserving resources and protecting against environmental damage ciampitti and vyn 2011 n utilization efficiency nute is an important factor affecting economic and environmental benefits sanda√±a et al 2021 the increase in n application rates is usually accompanied by a decrease in nute ju and christie 2011 significant effects of n rate were also observed on nute including nae nre and nhi in our study conversely reducing the n application rate can create a balance between crop demand and n supply chen et al 2015 in this study the optimal maize yield and nute was obtained at a n rate of 180 kg ha 1 which ensured the grain yield and reduced n rate a study in nebraska the united states showed that when the n rate was less than or close to the optimal economic n rate the best maize yield 14 800 kg ha 1 and nre 67 were guaranteed at an n rate of 171 kg ha 1 wortmann et al 2011 nute decreased significantly when increasing n rate to 240 kg ha 1 excessive n application is not conducive to the increase in grain yield and increases the loss of nitrogen and leaching beyond the rhizosphere which leads to a decrease in nute correndo et al 2021 npfp reflects the ability of crops to utilize soil nitrogen pool and exogenous nitrogen input to achieve economic output cassman et al 1998 achieving high npfp is one of the main objectives of current agricultural production during the two growing seasons the average npfp was 63 kg kg 1 which was consistent with previous research results chen et al 2011 promoting the transfer of nitrogen stored in vegetative organs to grains at grain filling stage and improving nitrogen assimilation after silking can jointly achieve high grain yield and n productivity liu et al 2015 in our study increasing plant density from d1 to d2 increased the npfp it was mainly because increasing plant density could maximize the uptake of applied nutrients in the form of fertilizers and also available n from other organic sources however npfp decreased when the plant density increased from d2 to d3 this can be due to that maize plants under crowding stress high plant density had lower n concentration on leaf blades the main reservoir organs of pre flowering n uptake due to changes in n partitioning among plant organs nasielski and deen 2019 nhi as an important agronomic index representing the extent of nitrogen transfer from vegetative structure to reproductive structure ciampitti and vyn 2011 plant n accumulation increased with increasing n rate but the n accumulation in the grain was not significantly different between n180 and n240 in our study and nhi was greater under n180 than n240 which indicated that increased n in the plants did not transfer to the grain resulting in excessive n absorption and residual n in the vegetative organs in this study the average nhi over the two growing seasons was 63 1 which was similar to the results of ciampitti and vyn 2013 average 64 this may be due to the increase in grain yield driving nitrogen distribution and transport liu et al 2015 soil no3 n content can directly reflect the effective soil n fertility nitrogen use and growth status of maize were extremely sensitive to n fertilizer supply after two harvest seasons of maize when n rate ranged within 0 180 kg ha 1 the effective soil n fertility declined 4 4 optimizing plant density and nitrogen rate ranges for acceptable grain yield economic return and water productivity in agricultural production it is not possible to obtain optimal values of different goals for example increasing n rate within a certain range generally increased maize yield but increased cost and reduced n use efficiency through the regression analysis a reasonable interval can be determined to meet requirements in recent years researchers have taken the crop yield wp and n use efficiency and economic benefit as goals and used regression analysis to determine the optimal irrigation and fertilization regimes for crops such as maize zou et al 2020 cotton hou et al 2021 and cucumber wang et al 2019 however few studies have used this method to quantify optimal plant density in this study the regression analysis was applied to obtain the relationship between crop yield wp economic benefit and plant density and n rate this study explored the optimal ranges of plant density and n rate that could obtain 95 of the maximum grain yield wp and economic benefit at the same time the results indicated that the optimal ranges of plant density of 95 000 110 000 plants ha 1 and n rate of 185 205 kg ha 1 were able to simultaneously obtain 95 of the maximum grain yield water productivity and economic benefit 5 conclusions in the arid region of northwest china low density planting 80 000 plants ha 1 and excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer 240 kg ha 1 are commonly applied which often limits maize yield and water nitrogen use efficiency the results showed that maize yield economic benefit water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency were significantly affected by plant density n rate and their interaction except for economic return grain yield increased and then decreased with increasing n rate under d1 and d2 but it continued to increase under d3 grain yield first increased and then decreased with the increasing plant density regardless of n rate similar results were also obtained for economic benefit grain yield economic benefit wp and n partial factor productivity under d2n180 was significantly increased compared with those under the conventional management practice d1n240 grain yield water productivity and economic benefit simultaneously obtained 95 of their maximum values with plant density of 95 000 110 000 plants ha 1 and n rate of 185 205 kg ha 1 which was recommended for achieving the sustainable development of maize in the study region further studies may focus on the interaction of irrigation amount n rate and plant density

9653,the effects of varying irrigation volume and placement regulated deficit irrigation that irrigated the entire root zone versus partial root zone drying that irrigated only half of the root zone at a time on drip irrigated peppermint mentha piperita l were studied treatments included full irrigation fi and regulated deficit irrigation receiving 85 70 55 and 40 of the irrigation volume of the full irrigation treatment rdi85 rdi70 rdi55 and rdi40 respectively and partial root zone drying receiving 70 55 and 40 of the irrigation volume of the full irrigation treatment prd70 prd55 and prd40 respectively plants were harvested at mid flowering stage over two consecutive seasons the steam distillation method used to extract essential oil at the first harvest biological yield dried leaf and stem weight generally did not significantly differ between the full irrigation partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation treatments but yield of rdi40 decreased by 33 compared to fi plants however deficit irrigation strategies significantly increased essential oil yield and ratio percentage of essential oil in 80 g of leaves with the highest biological yield in fi and highest essential oil yield in prd70 at rates of 1942 kg ha and 23 7 kg ha respectively irrigation water productivity based on oil yield was significantly higher in partial root zone drying treatments than full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments with the highest value achieved in prd55 at a rate of 0 0191 kg m3 at the second harvest plant biological yield components were not affected by the irrigation treatments but again the partial root zone drying treatments produced higher essential oil ratio and yield since the major goal of peppermint production is to extract its oil it is recommended to apply a moderate water deficit with the prd70 and prd55 techniques to allow significant 30 45 water saving and also reasonable yield keywords drought stress essential oil leaves yield soil moisture 1 introduction increased water demands to grow food for the escalating population and competition for finite water resources makes it imperative to consider efficient and optimized irrigation strategies for crop production deficit irrigation applying less water than crop evapotranspiration can improve water productivity wp and allow economic benefits by maximizing crop yields per amount of water consumed du et al 2015 however research is needed to determine regulated deficit irrigation effects on the essential oil composition of aromatic and medicinal herbs plant water deficit affects plant physiological and growth related parameters in different ways regulated deficit irrigation decreases irrigation during particular stages of plant development saving water and regulating growth while marginally decreasing yield and quality chai and costa et al 2015 2007 regulated deficit irrigation has repeatedly proved to be an effective tool to optimize water use efficiency wue of different fruit tree crops such as grapes pears and citrus romero et al 2013 2014 sometimes deficit irrigation can positively affect crop quality by reducing berry cracking in table grape faci et al 2014 and enhancing fruit quality including fruit firmness soluble solid content sugar acid ratio and vitamin c content in pear jujube cui et al 2008 whether such studies have been conducted because of the complexity of oil productions mechanism researches on regulated deficit irrigation effects on essential oil of aromatic and medicinal herbs needs to be done to achieve conclusive reports partial root zone drying only irrigates part of the root zone at each irrigation event while the remainder is left to dry to a specified soil water content regularly irrigation is shifted between the different parts of the root zone this technique allows signals of soil drying such as abscisic acid aba to be transmitted from root to shoot to regulate growth and water consumption wang et al 2012 partial root zone drying can conserve water and increase water productivity iqbal et al 2020a 2020b and enhance crop and fruit quality jovanovic and stikic 2018 however its impacts on crops where the harvested portion is the leaf have not been extensively investigated medicinal plants with high economic value can produce more income for farmers than other plants when water is scarce applying deficit irrigation to medicinal plants could enhance economic gain by increasing composition ekren et al 2012 reported that deficit irrigation enhances the essential oil ratio of purple basil ocimum basilicum furthermore essential oil percent was increased in green basil ocimum basilicum subjected to water stress khalil et al 2010 although sustained deficit irrigation decreased shoot biomass of spearmint mentha spicata water use efficiency and oil yield level were maintained with little effect on oil quality okwany et al 2012 when spearmint received 60 less water than fully irrigated plants the same quantity and quality of essential oil was produced but with increased water use efficiency and lower overall production costs nakawuka et al 2014 however it can be difficult to predict the impact of deficit irrigation on medicinal plants selmar et al 2013 peppermint mentha x piperita is widely used in medicines hygiene and oral medications and is cultivated as a fresh herb for its dry leaves and also essential oil its essential oil is widely consumed in confectionary and aromatherapy products mouthwashes pharmaceuticals chewing gum and toothpaste zheljazkov et al 2010 limited soil moisture could affect the production of secondary metabolites in aromatic and medicinal plants abdi et al 2019 reported that water deficit plants irrigated to 60 of field capacity fc increased essential oil content of peppermint with the highest essential oil percentage observed at 25 of fc treatment however whether these positive effects on peppermint quality are affected by irrigation placement partial root zone drying is unknown the objective of this study was to determine the response of peppermint yield components fresh herbage yield biological yield dried herbage dried leaves and dried stem oil yield and water productivity to regulated deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying in the field conditions across two harvest seasons to the best of our knowledge the effects of partial root zone drying on medicinal plants and especially peppermint have not yet been investigated by other researchers 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were carried out in 2013 at the research farm of sari agricultural sciences and natural resources university sari iran the mean air temperature during the growing period was 24 7 c weather data was collected at a nearby 12 km distant climate station fig 1 illustrates precipitation during two growing seasons the soil texture was a clay loam of ph 7 4 containing 0 98 organic carbon and 100 mg kg exchangeable potassium and 1 8 mg kg available phosphorus available phosphorus was measured by the olsen et al 1954 method soil water content at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp was 40 8 and 20 4 in the plant root zone respectively soil bulk density was 1 36 g cm3 therefore available volumetric soil water content was 20 4 peppermint seedlings were transplanted on 07 may 2013 with flowers appearing approximately two months after transplanting the first harvest occurred on 06 august 2013 and the second harvest occurred on 12 october 2013 flowering started on 23 july 2013 for the first season and 11 september 2013 for the second season the experimental area was divided into 32 plots of 3 2 m length width each plot comprised five rows of three meters long with 40 cm between rows and 20 cm spacing between plants in each row plant density was 125 000 plants per hectare 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments as indicated in fig 2 the experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications and eight irrigation treatments a buffer zone of 2 m was considered between the blocks and 1 5 m between the plots in each block fig 2 the irrigation treatments comprised full irrigation fi that received 100 of irrigation demand regulated deficit irrigation treatments rdi85 rdi70 rdi55 and rdi40 that received 85 70 55 and 40 of the full irrigation treatment at each irrigation event to both sides of the root zone respectively and partial root zone drying treatments prd70 prd55 and prd40 that received 70 55 and 40 of the full irrigation treatment in one side of root zone at each irrigation event respectively the treatments were summarized in table 1 both irrigation lines were open at each irrigation event in the full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments but only one irrigation line was open in the partial root zone drying treatments with the other closed to ensure partial root zone drying the wet and dry sides of the root zone were swapped every second irrigation event plant water requirements calculated as crop evapotranspiration etc during peppermint growing season were estimated by monitoring the soil water balance components thus 1 p i c e t c d r Œ¥ s where p is rainfall or precipitation i is irrigation c is a capillary rise from groundwater table Œ¥ s is the change in soil water storage over the irrigation cycle d is drainage beneath root zone and r is runoff the capillary rise was assumed to be zero because of the deep water table 2 5 m and short length of peppermint roots 15 cm allen et al 1998 soil moisture was monitored at 10 cm intervals with a tdr time domain reflectometer probe idrg sms t 2 sensor the envitronics lab san diego usa before each irrigation event at 20 cm depth throughout most of the growing season no soil moisture changes were observed meaning no water drained from root zone during the first harvest season there was not enough precipitation fig 1 to supply water for the root zone to reach field capacity as long as the soil water content in the root zone was below field capacity the soil could not drain and d zero allen et al 1998 at the end of the second season during five rainfall events water drained below the root zone according to changes in the water level of observation wells 64 1 mm was recorded as deep percolation in the first and second harvest seasons since the intensity of precipitation was less than the rate of water infiltration into the soil no runoff was recorded also the rate of irrigation application was less than the rate of water infiltration in the soil and caused no surface runoff variation in water table height was monitored in two observation wells around the field with no changes were observed during the growing season also the soil water content was measured at first and end of the growing season in the root zone 10 and 20 cm depths and there were no changes in soil water content net irrigation requirement i n mm was determined as follows 2 i n i 1 n Œ∏ fc Œ∏ bi d i where Œ∏ fc and Œ∏ bi are volumetric soil water content at field capacity and before irrigation respectively d i is soil layer depth mm i is layer number and n is a number of layers Œ∏ fc was measured in the field and laboratory before planting time Œ∏ bi was measured by the time domain reflectometry method before each irrigation event tdr probes were used to measure soil moisture variations at 10 cm intervals in full irrigation plots to a depth of 20 cm irrigation was applied every three days to replace water depleted from the root zone between irrigation events eq 2 no significant rainfall fell during the deficit irrigation treatments in the first harvest season due to heavy rainfall in the second season only five irrigations were applied fig 1 a surface drip irrigation system with two parallel drip tape lines with emitters spaced every 20 cm was used to apply irrigation to treatments to each row of the plot fig 3 each drip tape line had separate valves to apply partial root zone drying irrigation water was supplied from a well near the field fig 3 initially all plots received the same irrigation volume to ensure uniform stand establishment across all plots deficit irrigation treatments implemented 40 days after transplanting for an area of four plots of each treatment the required irrigation volume was calculated according to eq 2 and table 1 and delivered to each treatment by managing the valves on each plot irrigation volumes applied to each plot were measured using a flowmeter since the flowmeter was placed at the inlet of the irrigation system fig 2 each treatment was irrigated separately after calculating the water required for each plot using eq 2 and considering four plots multiplying the amount of water required for each plot in number 4 irrigation started simultaneously four plots relating to each treatment were irrigated once the calculated volume of water was reached by the flowmeter irrigation stopped then irrigation of the next treatment began 2 3 measurements and analysis plants were harvested in the mid flowering stage 92 days after planting two adjacent rows of plants were removed on 06 august 2013 for the first harvest after a further 67 days the second harvest occurred on 12 october 2013 in both harvests plant stems were cut 5 cm above the soil surface to allow continued growth plants were weighed for fresh herbage yield and then air dried in the shade for one week and then weighed again for biological yield a clevenger apparatus was used to determine the essential oil content of air dried flowers and leaves samples were finely ground and eighty grams distilled with 500 ml water for three hours the essential oil content and percentage of essential oil were calculated wet harvest index whi is the ratio of the oil yield and dried leaf weight to the harvested green herbage wet mass basis okwany et

p 0 01 in spss version 21 furthermore to distinguish effects of irrigation volume and placement on oil parameters 2 way anova was used for the rdi70 rdi55 and rdi40 and corresponding partial root zone drying treatments prd70 prd55 and prd40 3 results and discussion fig 4 summarizes soil water content variations during the two harvest seasons heavy rainfall events in the second growing season resulted in just five irrigation events being applied and most of the water was supplied from rainfall fig 1 the depths of irrigation applied were presented in fig 5 3 1 yield components the irrigation treatments significantly affected fresh herbage yield and biological yield at the first harvest table 2 maximum fresh herbage yield corresponded to the fi treatment 9427 kg ha whereas the lowest yield was observed in the rdi40 treatment 5729 kg ha soil water deficit also significantly reduced fresh herbage yield of peppermint ghanbari et al 2013 spearmint okwany et al 2012 meskelu et al 2014 basil khalil et al 2010 ekren et al 2012 and lemon balm melissa officinalis ozturk et al 2004 there was no significant difference between fi rdi85 and prd70 treatments partial root zone drying treatments outperformed regulated deficit irrigation treatments in terms of fresh herbage yield at the corresponding irrigation levels of 70 55 and 40 of field capacity among the partial root zone drying treatments the prd70 treatment had the highest fresh herbage yield which was not significantly different from the full irrigation treatment fresh herbage yield decreased significantly compared to the fi treatment with increasing deficits similar to the results of fresh herbage yield the highest biological yield was achieved in the fi treatment 1942 kg ha and the lowest one observed in rdi40 treatment 1288 kg ha only this treatment significantly differed from the other full irrigation partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation treatments the yield of herbaceous plants comprises leaves and stems but these components did not significantly differ between treatments table 2 nevertheless deficit irrigation significantly decreased the leaf dry weight of purple basil ekren et al 2012 and peppermint ghanbari and ariafar 2013 restricting the root system may have induced additional plant stress in the latter s pot trials whereas the root system was not constrained in the current field study the wet harvest index of leaves tended to increase in both partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation treatments but was not high enough to compensate for the significant reduction in fresh herbage yield and biological yield a similar response occurred in the dragon s head dracocephalum moldavica kalvanagh and heris 2013 decreased leaf turgor which limits cell development and stem and leaf growth is the first sign of water deficit changes in cellular growth are highly sensitive to water shortage ekren et al 2012 with biological and seed yield of cumin cuminum cyminum decreased after applying water deficit treatments alinian and razmjoo 2014 this significant reduction in yield and yield components was probably associated with less translocation of photosynthesis from source to sink leaves and lower availability of nutrients under drought stress ghanbari and ariafar 2013 also reported that water deficit decreased peppermint stem and leaf mass due to decreased radiation interception by the plant canopy decreased photosynthetic active radiation uptake efficiency and restricted biomass yield with declining harvest index table 3 summarizes the yield and yield components of peppermint under the different treatments at the second harvest no significant difference was observed in yield components as reported by okwany et al 2012 in spearmint intense rainfall in the three weeks prior to the second harvest likely alleviated the effects of water deficit so yield components were not affected 3 2 essential oil ratio and yield although full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments had similar essential oil ratios the highest values of 2 45 and 2 38 occurred in the prd55 and prd70 treatments respectively fig 6a the highest oil yield 23 67 kg ha occurred in the prd70 treatment and the lowest 11 kg ha occurred in the rdi40 treatment fig 6b despite less irrigation the regulated deficit irrigation treatments did not significantly differ from the full irrigation treatment nevertheless essential oil yield and oil ratio was highest in the rdi70 treatment and tended to decrease with lower irrigation volumes applying prd70 and prd55 significantly increased oil yield at the same irrigation volume partial root zone drying treatments outperformed regulated deficit irrigation treatments in terms of oil yield and they produced more than the full irrigation treatment table 4 increased essential oil ratio in medicinal and aromatic plants affected by water deficit has also been documented by nakawuka et al 2014 in spearmint ghanbari and ariafar 2013 and charles et al 1990 in peppermint ozturk et al 2004 in lemon balm and ekren et al 2012 in purple basil in peppermint maximum shoot weight occurred when plants were grown in soil held at 70 of field capacity while maximum oil yield and essential oil ratio occurred at 50 and 30 of fc respectively ghanbari and ariafar 2013 in most medicinal and aromatic plants soil water deficit increases the essential oil ratio with more secondary metabolites produced to enhance shoot antioxidant status rahmani et al 2012 essential oil accumulation could result from changes in biomass partitioning between growth and secondary metabolism with more carbon skeletons supplied for terpene biosynthesis and production charles et al 1990 water deficit induced stomatal closure could amplify the production of natural products like essential oils because decreased co2 uptake diminishes utilization of reduction equivalents of nadph h for co2 fixation through calvin cycle thereby stimulating nadph h accumulation thus metabolism is pushed towards the synthesis of highly reduced compounds such as essential oils alkaloids or isoprenoids selmar and kleinw√§chter 2013 essential oil yield is determined by the interaction between leaf weight the major source of essential oils and essential oil ratio depending upon the plant species and level of soil water deficit drought stress could have a different effect on the levels of metabolites like essential oil farahani et al 2009 whereas soil water deficit increased essential oil yield in spearmint okwany et al 2012 and peppermint ghanbari and ariafar 2013 the oil yield of peppermint khorasaninejad et al 2011 and marigold rahmani et al 2012 were decreased during water deficit peppermint plant physiological interactions adjusted towards producing more essential oil while maintaining leaf production which enhanced the essential oil ratio moderate soil water deficit significantly increased wet harvest index based on oil yield fig 6c the highest oil harvest index achieved at prd55 treatment was more than double that of the fi treatment while there was no significant difference between regulated deficit irrigation treatments the partial root zone drying treatments had a higher wet harvest index based on oil yield since the essential oil ratio significantly increased whereas there was no significant decrease in leaf weight however applying a 40 water deficit in both regulated deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying treatments decreased the wet harvest index mainly by significantly reducing oil yield since fresh herbage yield didn t change drought stress increased the harvest index of cumin alinian and razmjoo 2014 and spearmint okwany et al 2012 thus implementing deficit irrigation techniques could benefit the farmer by saving costs associated with distillation facilities irrigation costs pumping energy transportation and harvesting expenditure and enhancing profits if the oil quality and yield are sufficiently maintained okwany et al 2012 oil yield components at the second harvest showed similar trends to the first harvest but with lower amounts fig 8a again partial root zone drying treatments outperformed full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments although plant yield components did not significantly differ oil yield components differed for two reasons firstly secondary metabolism was sufficiently sensitive to water deficit that heavy rainfall in the second season couldn t restore the oil production mechanism s to generate uniform results in oil yield whereas herbage yield was stable water deficit significantly enhanced oil yield table 3 and fig 8b secondly root sourced chemical signals such as aba generated by the dry part of the root zone may stimulate secondary metabolite production in the shoot iqbal et al 2020a arreola et al 2006 reported that moderately stressed seedlings had greater and more active root growth than well irrigated plants especially when the soil water content was low after transplanting to the field while prolonged deficit irrigation treatments are likely to alter root architecture stimulation of aba synthesis in response to vertical and horizontal soil moisture heterogeneity pu√©rtolas et al 2015 is likely to result in continued root to shoot aba signaling during the second harvest season however these hypotheses should be further investigated by measuring root system dynamics and leaf biochemical aba and essential oil production mechanisms 3 3 water productivity total irrigation consumption prior to the first harvest was 2022 m3 ha in the fi treatment with proportionally less applied to the partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation treatments based on biological yield the prd40 treatment had the highest water productivity 1 939 kg m3 while the lowest 0 96 kg m3 occurred in the fi treatment fig 7a the prd55 rdi55 and prd70 treatments did not significantly differ as water use decreased water productivity significantly linearly increased due to approximately constant biological yield in both regulated deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying treatments while water deficit did not significantly affect wp of purple basil ekren et al 2012 regulated deficit irrigation also increased wp of cumin based on seed yield alinian and razmjoo 2014 and spearmint okwany et al 2012 however there are species differences in water consumption and the rate which they convert it to total biomass partial root zone drying treatments resulted in the highest water productivity based on oil yield with no significant difference between full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments which had much lower values independent of the level of water deficit while the oil yield of regulated deficit irrigation treatments was approximately constant partial root zone drying treatments significantly increased oil yield thereby increasing water productivity however regulated deficit irrigation enhanced water productivity of both spearmint meskelu et al 2014 and native spearmint nakawuka et al 2014 suggesting the specific irrigation to enhance oil yield may vary between species and or production systems nevertheless the highly significant difference between irrigation placement treatments suggests that plant physiological and metabolic responses can be adjusted for commercial benefits by applying partial root zone drying table 4 4 conclusions irrigation techniques such as partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation that deliberately withhold irrigation can enhance water productivity of peppermint if a reasonable production level is maintained if fresh peppermint leaf production is required moderate water stress rdi70 or prd70 would be suggested however since the primary goal of peppermint cultivation is oil production applying partial root zone drying at 70 or 55 of field capacity is highly recommended although partial root zone drying clearly decreased plant biomass yield oil yields increased which would lower transportation and distillation costs in view of localized water shortages and the high economic value of the peppermint partial root zone drying seems a desirable management option for farmers in the north of iran declaration of competing interest the

9653,the effects of varying irrigation volume and placement regulated deficit irrigation that irrigated the entire root zone versus partial root zone drying that irrigated only half of the root zone at a time on drip irrigated peppermint mentha piperita l were studied treatments included full irrigation fi and regulated deficit irrigation receiving 85 70 55 and 40 of the irrigation volume of the full irrigation treatment rdi85 rdi70 rdi55 and rdi40 respectively and partial root zone drying receiving 70 55 and 40 of the irrigation volume of the full irrigation treatment prd70 prd55 and prd40 respectively plants were harvested at mid flowering stage over two consecutive seasons the steam distillation method used to extract essential oil at the first harvest biological yield dried leaf and stem weight generally did not significantly differ between the full irrigation partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation treatments but yield of rdi40 decreased by 33 compared to fi plants however deficit irrigation strategies significantly increased essential oil yield and ratio percentage of essential oil in 80 g of leaves with the highest biological yield in fi and highest essential oil yield in prd70 at rates of 1942 kg ha and 23 7 kg ha respectively irrigation water productivity based on oil yield was significantly higher in partial root zone drying treatments than full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments with the highest value achieved in prd55 at a rate of 0 0191 kg m3 at the second harvest plant biological yield components were not affected by the irrigation treatments but again the partial root zone drying treatments produced higher essential oil ratio and yield since the major goal of peppermint production is to extract its oil it is recommended to apply a moderate water deficit with the prd70 and prd55 techniques to allow significant 30 45 water saving and also reasonable yield keywords drought stress essential oil leaves yield soil moisture 1 introduction increased water demands to grow food for the escalating population and competition for finite water resources makes it imperative to consider efficient and optimized irrigation strategies for crop production deficit irrigation applying less water than crop evapotranspiration can improve water productivity wp and allow economic benefits by maximizing crop yields per amount of water consumed du et al 2015 however research is needed to determine regulated deficit irrigation effects on the essential oil composition of aromatic and medicinal herbs plant water deficit affects plant physiological and growth related parameters in different ways regulated deficit irrigation decreases irrigation during particular stages of plant development saving water and regulating growth while marginally decreasing yield and quality chai and costa et al 2015 2007 regulated deficit irrigation has repeatedly proved to be an effective tool to optimize water use efficiency wue of different fruit tree crops such as grapes pears and citrus romero et al 2013 2014 sometimes deficit irrigation can positively affect crop quality by reducing berry cracking in table grape faci et al 2014 and enhancing fruit quality including fruit firmness soluble solid content sugar acid ratio and vitamin c content in pear jujube cui et al 2008 whether such studies have been conducted because of the complexity of oil productions mechanism researches on regulated deficit irrigation effects on essential oil of aromatic and medicinal herbs needs to be done to achieve conclusive reports partial root zone drying only irrigates part of the root zone at each irrigation event while the remainder is left to dry to a specified soil water content regularly irrigation is shifted between the different parts of the root zone this technique allows signals of soil drying such as abscisic acid aba to be transmitted from root to shoot to regulate growth and water consumption wang et al 2012 partial root zone drying can conserve water and increase water productivity iqbal et al 2020a 2020b and enhance crop and fruit quality jovanovic and stikic 2018 however its impacts on crops where the harvested portion is the leaf have not been extensively investigated medicinal plants with high economic value can produce more income for farmers than other plants when water is scarce applying deficit irrigation to medicinal plants could enhance economic gain by increasing composition ekren et al 2012 reported that deficit irrigation enhances the essential oil ratio of purple basil ocimum basilicum furthermore essential oil percent was increased in green basil ocimum basilicum subjected to water stress khalil et al 2010 although sustained deficit irrigation decreased shoot biomass of spearmint mentha spicata water use efficiency and oil yield level were maintained with little effect on oil quality okwany et al 2012 when spearmint received 60 less water than fully irrigated plants the same quantity and quality of essential oil was produced but with increased water use efficiency and lower overall production costs nakawuka et al 2014 however it can be difficult to predict the impact of deficit irrigation on medicinal plants selmar et al 2013 peppermint mentha x piperita is widely used in medicines hygiene and oral medications and is cultivated as a fresh herb for its dry leaves and also essential oil its essential oil is widely consumed in confectionary and aromatherapy products mouthwashes pharmaceuticals chewing gum and toothpaste zheljazkov et al 2010 limited soil moisture could affect the production of secondary metabolites in aromatic and medicinal plants abdi et al 2019 reported that water deficit plants irrigated to 60 of field capacity fc increased essential oil content of peppermint with the highest essential oil percentage observed at 25 of fc treatment however whether these positive effects on peppermint quality are affected by irrigation placement partial root zone drying is unknown the objective of this study was to determine the response of peppermint yield components fresh herbage yield biological yield dried herbage dried leaves and dried stem oil yield and water productivity to regulated deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying in the field conditions across two harvest seasons to the best of our knowledge the effects of partial root zone drying on medicinal plants and especially peppermint have not yet been investigated by other researchers 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were carried out in 2013 at the research farm of sari agricultural sciences and natural resources university sari iran the mean air temperature during the growing period was 24 7 c weather data was collected at a nearby 12 km distant climate station fig 1 illustrates precipitation during two growing seasons the soil texture was a clay loam of ph 7 4 containing 0 98 organic carbon and 100 mg kg exchangeable potassium and 1 8 mg kg available phosphorus available phosphorus was measured by the olsen et al 1954 method soil water content at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp was 40 8 and 20 4 in the plant root zone respectively soil bulk density was 1 36 g cm3 therefore available volumetric soil water content was 20 4 peppermint seedlings were transplanted on 07 may 2013 with flowers appearing approximately two months after transplanting the first harvest occurred on 06 august 2013 and the second harvest occurred on 12 october 2013 flowering started on 23 july 2013 for the first season and 11 september 2013 for the second season the experimental area was divided into 32 plots of 3 2 m length width each plot comprised five rows of three meters long with 40 cm between rows and 20 cm spacing between plants in each row plant density was 125 000 plants per hectare 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments as indicated in fig 2 the experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications and eight irrigation treatments a buffer zone of 2 m was considered between the blocks and 1 5 m between the plots in each block fig 2 the irrigation treatments comprised full irrigation fi that received 100 of irrigation demand regulated deficit irrigation treatments rdi85 rdi70 rdi55 and rdi40 that received 85 70 55 and 40 of the full irrigation treatment at each irrigation event to both sides of the root zone respectively and partial root zone drying treatments prd70 prd55 and prd40 that received 70 55 and 40 of the full irrigation treatment in one side of root zone at each irrigation event respectively the treatments were summarized in table 1 both irrigation lines were open at each irrigation event in the full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments but only one irrigation line was open in the partial root zone drying treatments with the other closed to ensure partial root zone drying the wet and dry sides of the root zone were swapped every second irrigation event plant water requirements calculated as crop evapotranspiration etc during peppermint growing season were estimated by monitoring the soil water balance components thus 1 p i c e t c d r Œ¥ s where p is rainfall or precipitation i is irrigation c is a capillary rise from groundwater table Œ¥ s is the change in soil water storage over the irrigation cycle d is drainage beneath root zone and r is runoff the capillary rise was assumed to be zero because of the deep water table 2 5 m and short length of peppermint roots 15 cm allen et al 1998 soil moisture was monitored at 10 cm intervals with a tdr time domain reflectometer probe idrg sms t 2 sensor the envitronics lab san diego usa before each irrigation event at 20 cm depth throughout most of the growing season no soil moisture changes were observed meaning no water drained from root zone during the first harvest season there was not enough precipitation fig 1 to supply water for the root zone to reach field capacity as long as the soil water content in the root zone was below field capacity the soil could not drain and d zero allen et al 1998 at the end of the second season during five rainfall events water drained below the root zone according to changes in the water level of observation wells 64 1 mm was recorded as deep percolation in the first and second harvest seasons since the intensity of precipitation was less than the rate of water infiltration into the soil no runoff was recorded also the rate of irrigation application was less than the rate of water infiltration in the soil and caused no surface runoff variation in water table height was monitored in two observation wells around the field with no changes were observed during the growing season also the soil water content was measured at first and end of the growing season in the root zone 10 and 20 cm depths and there were no changes in soil water content net irrigation requirement i n mm was determined as follows 2 i n i 1 n Œ∏ fc Œ∏ bi d i where Œ∏ fc and Œ∏ bi are volumetric soil water content at field capacity and before irrigation respectively d i is soil layer depth mm i is layer number and n is a number of layers Œ∏ fc was measured in the field and laboratory before planting time Œ∏ bi was measured by the time domain reflectometry method before each irrigation event tdr probes were used to measure soil moisture variations at 10 cm intervals in full irrigation plots to a depth of 20 cm irrigation was applied every three days to replace water depleted from the root zone between irrigation events eq 2 no significant rainfall fell during the deficit irrigation treatments in the first harvest season due to heavy rainfall in the second season only five irrigations were applied fig 1 a surface drip irrigation system with two parallel drip tape lines with emitters spaced every 20 cm was used to apply irrigation to treatments to each row of the plot fig 3 each drip tape line had separate valves to apply partial root zone drying irrigation water was supplied from a well near the field fig 3 initially all plots received the same irrigation volume to ensure uniform stand establishment across all plots deficit irrigation treatments implemented 40 days after transplanting for an area of four plots of each treatment the required irrigation volume was calculated according to eq 2 and table 1 and delivered to each treatment by managing the valves on each plot irrigation volumes applied to each plot were measured using a flowmeter since the flowmeter was placed at the inlet of the irrigation system fig 2 each treatment was irrigated separately after calculating the water required for each plot using eq 2 and considering four plots multiplying the amount of water required for each plot in number 4 irrigation started simultaneously four plots relating to each treatment were irrigated once the calculated volume of water was reached by the flowmeter irrigation stopped then irrigation of the next treatment began 2 3 measurements and analysis plants were harvested in the mid flowering stage 92 days after planting two adjacent rows of plants were removed on 06 august 2013 for the first harvest after a further 67 days the second harvest occurred on 12 october 2013 in both harvests plant stems were cut 5 cm above the soil surface to allow continued growth plants were weighed for fresh herbage yield and then air dried in the shade for one week and then weighed again for biological yield a clevenger apparatus was used to determine the essential oil content of air dried flowers and leaves samples were finely ground and eighty grams distilled with 500 ml water for three hours the essential oil content and percentage of essential oil were calculated wet harvest index whi is the ratio of the oil yield and dried leaf weight to the harvested green herbage wet mass basis okwany et

p 0 01 in spss version 21 furthermore to distinguish effects of irrigation volume and placement on oil parameters 2 way anova was used for the rdi70 rdi55 and rdi40 and corresponding partial root zone drying treatments prd70 prd55 and prd40 3 results and discussion fig 4 summarizes soil water content variations during the two harvest seasons heavy rainfall events in the second growing season resulted in just five irrigation events being applied and most of the water was supplied from rainfall fig 1 the depths of irrigation applied were presented in fig 5 3 1 yield components the irrigation treatments significantly affected fresh herbage yield and biological yield at the first harvest table 2 maximum fresh herbage yield corresponded to the fi treatment 9427 kg ha whereas the lowest yield was observed in the rdi40 treatment 5729 kg ha soil water deficit also significantly reduced fresh herbage yield of peppermint ghanbari et al 2013 spearmint okwany et al 2012 meskelu et al 2014 basil khalil et al 2010 ekren et al 2012 and lemon balm melissa officinalis ozturk et al 2004 there was no significant difference between fi rdi85 and prd70 treatments partial root zone drying treatments outperformed regulated deficit irrigation treatments in terms of fresh herbage yield at the corresponding irrigation levels of 70 55 and 40 of field capacity among the partial root zone drying treatments the prd70 treatment had the highest fresh herbage yield which was not significantly different from the full irrigation treatment fresh herbage yield decreased significantly compared to the fi treatment with increasing deficits similar to the results of fresh herbage yield the highest biological yield was achieved in the fi treatment 1942 kg ha and the lowest one observed in rdi40 treatment 1288 kg ha only this treatment significantly differed from the other full irrigation partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation treatments the yield of herbaceous plants comprises leaves and stems but these components did not significantly differ between treatments table 2 nevertheless deficit irrigation significantly decreased the leaf dry weight of purple basil ekren et al 2012 and peppermint ghanbari and ariafar 2013 restricting the root system may have induced additional plant stress in the latter s pot trials whereas the root system was not constrained in the current field study the wet harvest index of leaves tended to increase in both partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation treatments but was not high enough to compensate for the significant reduction in fresh herbage yield and biological yield a similar response occurred in the dragon s head dracocephalum moldavica kalvanagh and heris 2013 decreased leaf turgor which limits cell development and stem and leaf growth is the first sign of water deficit changes in cellular growth are highly sensitive to water shortage ekren et al 2012 with biological and seed yield of cumin cuminum cyminum decreased after applying water deficit treatments alinian and razmjoo 2014 this significant reduction in yield and yield components was probably associated with less translocation of photosynthesis from source to sink leaves and lower availability of nutrients under drought stress ghanbari and ariafar 2013 also reported that water deficit decreased peppermint stem and leaf mass due to decreased radiation interception by the plant canopy decreased photosynthetic active radiation uptake efficiency and restricted biomass yield with declining harvest index table 3 summarizes the yield and yield components of peppermint under the different treatments at the second harvest no significant difference was observed in yield components as reported by okwany et al 2012 in spearmint intense rainfall in the three weeks prior to the second harvest likely alleviated the effects of water deficit so yield components were not affected 3 2 essential oil ratio and yield although full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments had similar essential oil ratios the highest values of 2 45 and 2 38 occurred in the prd55 and prd70 treatments respectively fig 6a the highest oil yield 23 67 kg ha occurred in the prd70 treatment and the lowest 11 kg ha occurred in the rdi40 treatment fig 6b despite less irrigation the regulated deficit irrigation treatments did not significantly differ from the full irrigation treatment nevertheless essential oil yield and oil ratio was highest in the rdi70 treatment and tended to decrease with lower irrigation volumes applying prd70 and prd55 significantly increased oil yield at the same irrigation volume partial root zone drying treatments outperformed regulated deficit irrigation treatments in terms of oil yield and they produced more than the full irrigation treatment table 4 increased essential oil ratio in medicinal and aromatic plants affected by water deficit has also been documented by nakawuka et al 2014 in spearmint ghanbari and ariafar 2013 and charles et al 1990 in peppermint ozturk et al 2004 in lemon balm and ekren et al 2012 in purple basil in peppermint maximum shoot weight occurred when plants were grown in soil held at 70 of field capacity while maximum oil yield and essential oil ratio occurred at 50 and 30 of fc respectively ghanbari and ariafar 2013 in most medicinal and aromatic plants soil water deficit increases the essential oil ratio with more secondary metabolites produced to enhance shoot antioxidant status rahmani et al 2012 essential oil accumulation could result from changes in biomass partitioning between growth and secondary metabolism with more carbon skeletons supplied for terpene biosynthesis and production charles et al 1990 water deficit induced stomatal closure could amplify the production of natural products like essential oils because decreased co2 uptake diminishes utilization of reduction equivalents of nadph h for co2 fixation through calvin cycle thereby stimulating nadph h accumulation thus metabolism is pushed towards the synthesis of highly reduced compounds such as essential oils alkaloids or isoprenoids selmar and kleinw√§chter 2013 essential oil yield is determined by the interaction between leaf weight the major source of essential oils and essential oil ratio depending upon the plant species and level of soil water deficit drought stress could have a different effect on the levels of metabolites like essential oil farahani et al 2009 whereas soil water deficit increased essential oil yield in spearmint okwany et al 2012 and peppermint ghanbari and ariafar 2013 the oil yield of peppermint khorasaninejad et al 2011 and marigold rahmani et al 2012 were decreased during water deficit peppermint plant physiological interactions adjusted towards producing more essential oil while maintaining leaf production which enhanced the essential oil ratio moderate soil water deficit significantly increased wet harvest index based on oil yield fig 6c the highest oil harvest index achieved at prd55 treatment was more than double that of the fi treatment while there was no significant difference between regulated deficit irrigation treatments the partial root zone drying treatments had a higher wet harvest index based on oil yield since the essential oil ratio significantly increased whereas there was no significant decrease in leaf weight however applying a 40 water deficit in both regulated deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying treatments decreased the wet harvest index mainly by significantly reducing oil yield since fresh herbage yield didn t change drought stress increased the harvest index of cumin alinian and razmjoo 2014 and spearmint okwany et al 2012 thus implementing deficit irrigation techniques could benefit the farmer by saving costs associated with distillation facilities irrigation costs pumping energy transportation and harvesting expenditure and enhancing profits if the oil quality and yield are sufficiently maintained okwany et al 2012 oil yield components at the second harvest showed similar trends to the first harvest but with lower amounts fig 8a again partial root zone drying treatments outperformed full irrigation and regulated deficit irrigation treatments although plant yield components did not significantly differ oil yield components differed for two reasons firstly secondary metabolism was sufficiently sensitive to water deficit that heavy rainfall in the second season couldn t restore the oil production mechanism s to generate uniform results in oil yield whereas herbage yield was stable water deficit significantly enhanced oil yield table 3 and fig 8b secondly root sourced chemical signals such as aba generated by the dry part of the root zone may stimulate secondary metabolite production in the shoot iqbal et al 2020a arreola et al 2006 reported that moderately stressed seedlings had greater and more active root growth than well irrigated plants especially when the soil water content was low after transplanting to the field while prolonged deficit irrigation treatments are likely to alter root architecture stimulation of aba synthesis in response to vertical and horizontal soil moisture heterogeneity pu√©rtolas et al 2015 is likely to result in continued root to shoot aba signaling during the second harvest season however these hypotheses should be further investigated by measuring root system dynamics and leaf biochemical aba and essential oil production mechanisms 3 3 water productivity total irrigation consumption prior to the first harvest was 2022 m3 ha in the fi treatment with proportionally less applied to the partial root zone drying and regulated deficit irrigation treatments based on biological yield the prd40 treatment had the highest water productivity 1 939 kg m3 while the lowest 0 96 kg m3 occurred in the fi treatment fig 7a the prd55 rdi55 and prd70 treatments did not significantly differ as water use decreased water productivity significantly linearly increased due to approximately constant biological yield in both regulated deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying treatments while water deficit did not significantly affect wp of purple basil ekren et al 2012 regulated deficit irrigation also increased wp of cumin based on seed yield alinian and razmjoo 2014 and spearmint okwany et al 2012 however there are species differences in water consumption and the rate which they convert it to total biomass partial root zone drying treatments resulted

security should also be considered when adjustments are made keywords crop water consumption spatiotemporal variation irrigation amount cropping system adjustment hydrological year type 1 introduction water scarcity and drought pose serious threats to the livelihood of farming communities and the economy in many parts of the world alam 2015 the huang huai hai plain 3hp fig 1 located in the north of china and covering an area of 33 000 km2 is recognized as one of the most important agricultural production bases in china providing about 69 and 35 of the nation s wheat and maize respectively liu et al 2010 however it faces severe water shortages due to its heavy agricultural water requirements lei et al 2011 especially for winter wheat irrigation iqbal et al 2014 the main cropping system in the 3hp is a highly intensive winter wheat summer maize wwsm double cropping system tian et al 2017 with two harvests per year and an annual evapotranspiration et of approximately 850 900 mm shen et al 2013 with an annual average precipitation of 580 mm two thirds of which precipitated during the summer months june to september irrigation of summer maize is not necessary however flooding irrigation is applied three or four times a year providing about 300 mm or more of water for winter wheat sun et al 2011 furthermore this cropping system relies heavily on groundwater irrigation because the rivers are inaccessible in many parts in this region liang et al 2019a although the water shortage can be attributed to the water consumption of agriculture industry and private households irrigation for agriculture is responsible for about 70 of the total groundwater consumption zou et al 2015 due to the continuous pumping of groundwater for socioeconomic and agricultural use the hebei plain which covers northern part of the region is now characterized by serious groundwater overexploitation and poor water environments van oort et al 2016 irrigation of 300 mm yr 1 to produce a high winter wheat yield has resulted in a decline in the groundwater level in the north china plain ncp liang et al 2019a and a groundwater depression cone of 50 000 km2 the largest recorded worldwide has formed in this area hu et al 2005 considering the water scarcity and the contradiction between water demand and supply it is extremely important for sustainable agricultural water management strategies to explicitly assess the crop water consumption and irrigation requirements under the existing wwsm cropping system and test other alternative cropping systems that may require less irrigation than the wwsm in the 3hp many studies have been conducted in this region to understand the characteristics of water consumption and water deficits in agriculture and to evaluate the water saving potential of different cropping systems or optimization of irrigation schedules and methods peng et al 2018 explored the water consumption characteristics of winter wheat under different irrigation schedules in northern china their results showed that water consumption increased with the increase in the amount of irrigation with the latter reaching up to 400 mm xiao et al 2019 assessed water consumption in a wheat maize rotation system under different farming practices in the ncp and concluded that the water consumption of wheat and maize in the recommended farming management were 30 and 37 lower respectively than in the farmers conventional practices however previous studies have mainly been field based lv et al 2011 sun et al 2015 providing observations based only on point data and they did not provide an overall assessment of crop water consumption regionally furthermore it is labor intensive and time consuming to estimate water consumption via field experiments on a regional or basin scale firstly it needs numerous field based experiments carried out in different regions secondly spatial heterogeneity of soil and difference in agricultural managements make it incredible to use the same parameter coefficients and even methods in all experiments thirdly long time observation is time consuming limited access to the required data has led scientists to use remote sensing technology to estimate larger scale water consumption remote sensing techniques have been widely used in assessing environmental issues anderson et al 2011 jung et al 2006 yang et al 2012 estimating water balance elhag et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 as well as evaluating agricultural water consumption yang et al 2015 et as one of the most important components in the hydrological processes has been widely used to assess crop water consumption and the amount of irrigation in agricultural production taheri et al 2019 wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2011 in addition various models have been developed based on remote images to estimate et allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 of which sebs the surface energy balance system has been widely used including in spain kwast et al 2009 australia ma et al 2012 turkey gokmen et al 2012 iran mahour et al 2015 the north china plain yang et al 2010a and the haihe river basin china zhao et al 2019 in the 3hp studies have been carried out to evaluate et based on remote sensing models chen et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2014 but few of them investigated crop water consumption and irrigation requirements in more depth mo et al 2009 assessed water consumptions of wheat and maize based on et in the north china plain but the study period was relatively early yang et al 2015 characterized water consumption variations of wheat and maize in 2012 in the huang huai hai plain while long term observations of water consumptions and crop irrigation requirements are in urgent further explorations of the spatiotemporal variability of crop water consumption and the amount of irrigation required over a relatively long period i e 2001 2018 remain scarce in the 3hp especially when precipitation conditions and hydrological year type are introduced in agricultural production precipitation plays an important role especially in arid and semiarid regions precipitation and irrigation are the major water sources for agricultural sustainability chai et al 2013 the amount of precipitation and its seasonal spatiotemporal distribution directly affect the water balance and the irrigation requirements of the different crops within a rotation cycle sun et al 2010 moreover the interannual variability of precipitation has an important impact on the macro allocation of water resources and policymaking along with the dramatic variation in precipitation gaining a deep insight into the spatial distribution of crop water consumption and irrigation requirements in different hydrological year types is of great significance in determining hydrological year types based on annual and crop season precipitation data it is important to characterize crop water consumption in dry normal and wet years the amount of irrigation for crops can also be further determined leading to a more appropriate water allocation and precipitation use therefore it is crucial to investigate the variations in major water cycle components i e crop et precipitation and irrigation requirements in space and time in different hydrological years hence the objectives of the study are to 1 assess a remotely sensed surface energy balance system sebs approach to estimate et in the 3hp 2 characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of crop water consumption and irrigation requirements in different hydrological years during the 2001 2018 period and 3 test alternative cropping systems that may consume less water and require less irrigation than the current wwsm system the aim is to offer some operational guidance for regional crop water management by assessing water cycle components under the existing wwsm and other alternative cropping systems in the 3hp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the huang huai hai plain 3hp 32 08 41 04 n 112 34 119 52 e is a major breadbasket for china it includes parts of the beijing and tianjin municipalities the majority of hebei province the west of shandong province the east and north of henan province and the north of anhui province with a total land area of 330 000 km2 fig 1 the 3hp s climate is temperate and subhumid and it experiences a continental monsoon with an annual average temperature ranging from 10 to 15 and annual precipitation varying from 500 mm to 950 mm of which approximately 60 70 occurs during the summer while the region is prone to drought in the spring wu et al 2018 the land use and land cover consist mainly of cropland grassland forest and built up areas and the largest percentage is cropland the cropping system in the 3hp is mainly comprised of a winter wheat summer maize wwsm rotation system winter wheat ww is sown in early october of the previous year and then harvested in late may or early june while summer maize sm is sown in june and harvested in september in the same year 2 2 methods 2 2 1 sebs in this study a remotely sensed and energy based sebs approach was used to estimate et which is commonly written as 1 r n g 0 h Œª e where r n is the net radiation g 0 is the soil heat flux h is the turbulent sensible heat flux and Œªe is the latent heat flux Œª is the latent heat vaporization and e is the actual evapotranspiration su 2002 the net radiation flux r n is given by 2 r n 1 Œ± r swd Œµ r lwd Œµ œÉ t 0 4 where Œ± is the albedo r swd is the downward solar radiation r lwd is the downward longwave radiation Œµ is the surface emissivity œÉ is the stefan bolzmann constant and t 0 is the surface temperature the soil heat flux g 0 is parameterized as 3 g 0 r n Œ≥ c 1 f c Œ≥ s Œ≥ c where the ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation –≥c 0 05 for full vegetation canopy and –≥s 0 315 for bare soil and f c is the fractional canopy coverage which can be calculated by ndvi normalized difference vegetation index the surface energy balance computation in the sebs algorithm is based on the determination of the relative evaporative fraction energy balance solutions for the limiting cases are used to determine the relative evaporative fraction jin et al 2009 the value of h was determined by considering the limiting values under the dry and wet limit energy balance at limiting cases at the dry moisture limit latent heat Œªe dry becomes zero and sensible heat h dry would be at its maximum by definition from eq 1 it follows that 4 Œª e dry r n g 0 h dry 0 or h dry r n g 0 at the wet limit sensible heat flux h wet reaches its minimum value and evapotranspiration occurs at the potential rate Œªe wet limited only by the available energy it follows that 5 Œª e wet r n g 0 h wet or h wet r n g 0 Œª e wet the evaporative fraction Œª which is the energy used for the evapotranspiration process divided by total available energy r n g 0 is expressed as 6 Œª Œª e r n g by inverting eq 6 latent heat flux is determined by Œªe Œª r n g 0 actual evapotranspiration e was then calculated as e Œªe Œª œÅ w where Œª is the latent heat of vaporization and œÅ w is the density of water however remote sensing images represent an instantaneous observation in time hence e is initially mm s 1 rwasoka et al 2011 it is assumed that the daily evaporative fraction is approximately equal to the instantaneous value jia et al 2009 sugita and brutsaert 1991 the daily et can then be determined as 7 e daily i 0 24 Œª r n g Œª œÅ w 24 h 3600 s 1000 Œª r n g Œª œÅ w 8 or e daily 8 64 10 7 Œª r n Œª œÅ w where e daily is the daily et mm day 1 Œª is the evaporative fraction Œª is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 œÅ w is the density of water kg m 3 r n is the daily net radiation flux and g is the daily soil heat flux and normally assumed negligible as positive flux occur during night and negative during daytime 2 2 2 crop water consumption and irrigation water requirements the crop water consumption was assessed based on et the irrigation water requirement iwr was estimated as the estimated et minus the amount of precipitation which is a method of estimating the amount of irrigation water widely used in many research projects wu et al 2019a yang et al 2010b positive iwr means an actual irrigation application requirement and negative iwr means a rainfall surplus and no real irrigation is needed in addition taking the wwsm cropping system into account this study calculated the water consumption during winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons as well as annual water consumption 2 2 3 mann kendall mk trend analysis the mk trend method was used to analyze the temporal trends of et the nonparametric mk method developed by mann and refined by kendall has been widely used to evaluate the trends in hydrological and meteorological variables jiang et al 2019 tabari et al 2011 in the mk method the null hypothesis h 0 assumes that there is no trend in the data and is tested against the alternative hypothesis h 1 the relevant equations for calculating the mk statistical values of s and z s are as follows gocic and trajkovic 2013 tabari et al 2011 9 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the number of data points and x i and x j are data values at time i and j where j i in the time series respectively eq 9 takes the sign function 1 0 or 1 of all pairwise differences in a data series the test statistic s has mean zero and a variance computed by eq 11 in cases where sample size n is greater than 10 the standard normal statistic test z s is calculated as 10 z s s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 11 vars s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups and t i denotes the number of ties of extent i a tied group is a set of sample data having the same value positive z s values indicate increasing trends while negative z s values signal decreasing trends the test is done at a specific confidence level Œ± when z s z 1 Œ± 2 the null hypothesis is rejected thus a significant trend exists in the time series the value of z 1 Œ± 2 is obtained from the standard normal distribution table 2 2 4 simulation of iwr for different cropping systems in this study the current wwsm cropping system and another four alternative cropping systems reducing wheat or maize cultivations table 1 were set up to study the impact of cropping system changes on the iwr two hypotheses were developed first it was assumed that each cropping system was used starting from 2001 and ending in 2018 and the annual iwr was presented with negative iwrs being set to 0 the iwr was also set to 0 in the fallow season second the iwr of the cropping systems in different hydrological year types during a 2 year rotation period was calculated numerous field scale studies regarding iwr were conducted in four typical agroecological experimental stations in the 3hp at luancheng quzhou yucheng and fengqiu fig 1 li et al 2017 sun et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2007 we then extracted remotely sensed crop water components at the four stations in order to demonstrate the variations of the crop irrigation water requirements 2 2 5 determination of hydrological year type the hydrological year type was determined as follows the first step is to establish the precipitation frequency curve according to the annual precipitation and precipitation of crop growing seasons from 1981 to 2018 and numerate the serial numbers in ascending order from 1 to 38 e g total of 38 years the second is to calculate the frequency with the equation of serial number 100 1 39 the third is to distinguish the dry normal and wet years based on the standards given by china ministry of water resources the specific standards are 37 5 wet year wy 37 5 62 5 normal year ny and 62 5 dry year dy shi et al 2016 hydrological year types with respect to both annual and crop growing seasons were determined table s2 2 3 data the sebs model requires two datasets as inputs the first dataset consists of the land surface temperature albedo and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which can be derived from the daily or 8 composited moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land products or other remote sensing images the second dataset includes air temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure wind speed and downward solar radiation the modis data which has a relatively high temporal resolution from daily to 16 days and acceptable spatial resolution 250 1000 m was used in this study and downloaded from the nasa data center https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov two products including mod09a1 and mod11a2 covering five modis scenes h26v04 h26v05 h27v04 h27v05 h28v05 for the time period of 2001 2018 were downloaded for estimating et over the study area the modis data was processed using the modis reprojection tool mrt for the mosaicking clipping and reprojection of the images and extraction of the channels mod09a1 shortwave channel bands1 7 data were used to calculate the land surface albedo and the ndvi vermote et al 2015 while the land surface temperature was obtained from mod11a2 wan 2015 detailed descriptions regarding these products can be found on the modis website the second dataset was retrieved from the chinese national meteorological information center http data cma cn in addition ancillary data including land use and land cover data a digital elevation model dem and administrative division data were also collected 2 4 validation of sebs in this study sebs was verified using the monthly large lysimeter et records at the luancheng and yucheng stations located in the area s cropland fig 1 overall the estimated et had a good linear relationship with the observed et rmse 28 mm month 1 in luancheng and 37 mm month 1 in yucheng the regression model explained 81 and 67 of the variability in the observed data respectively fig 2 jiang et al 2004 observed that a reasonable upper limit for accuracy in estimating et using satellite data is about 20 meanwhile seguin et al 1999 suggested that the required et retrieval accuracy varies according to the application but is typically 15 30 from this perspective the accuracy of the validation meets the requirements and the model also demonstrates a satisfactory performance in predicting et across the study area furthermore et derived from different methods in other literatures was also collected as shown in table s1 compared with the sebs results the et values obtained from a three layer soil water balance model jiang et al 2008 weighing lysimeter liu and luo 2010 a soil water balance approach meng et al 2012 zhang et al 2004 the fao method sun et al 2011 and the bowen ratio method kong et al 2012 were all close to the corresponding values in this study however values derived from an eddy covariance ec and a large aperture scintillometer las liu et al 2013 showed deviations compared with the sebs results the reason why et estimated by ec was lower than that by sebs may be that ec measurements underestimated the latent heat fluxes due to the energy balance closure lei et al 2010 the reason why et estimated by las is lower than that by ec may be due to the gap filling method of las e g set hlas 0 when hlas 0 which would result in higher values of daily mean hlas and thus et derived from las is underestimated liu et al 2013 valayamkunnath et al 2018 furthermore sebs derived et in this study was calculated based on grids with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km while the et data used to make comparisons were generally based on field experiments due to the spatial scale effect uncertainties inevitably exist between remote sensing based and field based et despite this a region wide remote sensing based method has its own advantages 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of crop water consumption table 2 summarizes the statistical characteristics of the annual ww and sm et and precipitation in different hydrological year types and corresponding crop average yields were also presented spatial distributions for annual ww and sm et for dry years dy normal years ny and wet years wy are presented fig 3 and table s2 it can be observed that the spatial distribution of mean annual et was generally coherent in the dry normal and wet years increasing gradually from southeast to northwest mainly ranging from 700 mm to 900 mm irrespective of the hydrological year type the region averaged et was 779 mm for dy 811 mm for ny and 774 mm for wy it is notable that some regions along the taihang mountain western hebei province also showed a relatively high et during the ww season et showed a spatial distribution similar to that of the annual et and an obvious decreasing trend can be observed in the dy ny and wy with mean values of 433 mm 413 mm and 373 mm respectively this may be explained by the regionally variable vapor pressure deficit vpd generally increased precipitation would provide more water for et and it would also result in a higher relative humidity rh and hence a smaller vpd which would weaken the et rate et in most of shandong henan and anhui varied from 450 mm to 500 mm in dy and 350 450 mm in wy for the sm season et primarily varied from 350 mm to 400 mm across the 3hp in dy in wy a high et 400 450 mm was observed in shandong and most of hebei while in other parts of the 3hp it was mainly 350 400 mm the region averaged summer maize et in dry normal and wet years was 377 mm 392 mm and 396 mm respectively crop average yields table 2 were collected from statistical yearbooks it was observed that total average grain yield got the highest value of 6 19 t ha 1 in ny and the lowest of 5 69 t ha 1 in dy the highest yield of winter wheat was 6 29 t ha 1 in ny followed by 6 15 t ha 1 in dy summer maize average yield was in order of 5 78 dy 6 18 ny 6 20 wy t ha 1 which was same to the trend of et changing total grain yields and wheat maize yields differed in different hydrological year types with the normal year leading to the highest average yields summer maize slightly lower than that in wet year and the lowest variation coefficients on the whole an mk test was carried out in 1 km 1 km grids to reveal the spatiotemporal trends of et fig 4 the annual et showed no significant p 0 05 increase or decrease across the 3hp from 2001 to 2018 except for a small portion of western hebei where et decreased remarkably as for et in the ww season most of the 3hp experienced a nonsignificant increase or decrease excluding the junction of shandong and hebei which witnessed a significant increase in et et in the sm period decreased significantly p 0 05 in the west of hebei which was spatially similar to but larger than the distribution of significantly decreased annual et moreover areas with an increasing et p 0 05 were mainly scattered across henan anhui and southwestern shandong overall no significant increasing or decreasing trends spread across a large area indicating to some extent the relative stability of crop water consumption across the 3hp from 2001 to 2018 the conventional wwsm rotation system may account for this 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of the iwr the annual and crop season et iwr and precipitation p data for luancheng station from 2001 to 2018 were extracted from our remotely sensed images fig 5 it was observed that the annual iwr was positive in all the years investigated with a mean value of 326 mm fig 5a indicating that luancheng required continuous irrigations for the ww season multiyear averaged iwr was 291 mm while precipitation was only 135 mm it is also noteworthy that the iwr in 2011 was up to 401 mm while it was only 47 mm in 2018 the great interannual variations in iwr were attributed to the sharp fluctuations in precipitation during the ww season and precipitation in luancheng is never able to meet the needs of wheat water consumption in contrast the iwr for the sm had a mean value of 32 mm a maximum of 155 mm in 2006 and a minimum of 105 mm in 2016 precipitation in the summer maize period met the basic needs of crop water consumption it is notable that the hydrological year types were not always consistent either annually or for the ww and sm seasons for example 2001 was a dy in the annual cycle and for the sm season yet it was a ny for the ww period the uneven seasonal distributions of precipitation account for this highlighting the need to forecast and use precipitation for better irrigation management in crop seasons furthermore the determination of hydrological year types in this study was based on region averaged precipitation which inevitably weakens the precipitation variations in local areas for instance the annual precipitation was 478 mm in 2007 and 601 mm in 2008 in luancheng although these years were calculated to be wy and ny respectively through the region averaged statistics despite this the results of the study were able to be referenced for regional water management when site specific research was also necessary fig s1 s3 show the iwr variations in quzhou yucheng and fengqiu similar to luancheng the iwr in quzhou also showed great variations the annual ww season and sm season iwr were 260 mm 248 mm and 8 mm respectively additionally yucheng station showed an annual iwr of 298 mm 295 mm for ww and 1 mm for sm respectively the negative iwr values indicate that irrigation was not required precipitation could meet the needs of crop water consumption the three values in fengqiu were 174 mm 234 mm and 62 mm of the four stations fengqiu had the lowest iwr due to its higher precipitation however irrigation was also necessary in the ww season fig s3b precipitation was not sufficient for the maize water consumption in some dry years for instance the iwr of the summer maize in 2013 was 184 mm fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of the iwr in different hydrological years it is clear that the dry year led to the highest iwr and the wet year resulted in the lowest iwr a spatial distribution of iwr decreasing from northwest to southeast was detected in all hydrological years on an annual scale there was a clear divide 1 the northern region consisting of beijing tianjin hebei northwestern shandong and northern henan which witnessed an iwr of over 200 mm in the dry years with western hebei and northwestern shandong having an iwr great than 300 mm and 2 the southern region consisting of anhui central and southern henan and the southwest of shandong which had an iwr lower than 200 mm in normal years the north region had an iwr ranging from 200 mm to 300 mm while it was below 100 mm in the southern region in wet years the iwr was negative in the southern region while western hebei experienced an iwr of over 200 mm during the ww season the iwr was positive irrespective of the hydrological year types in detail the iwr in the northern region ranged from 300 mm to 400 mm in dry years 200 300 mm in normal years and 100 200 mm in wet years it is notable that western hebei as well as northwestern shandong were more iwr intensive compared with the rest of the northern region in the same hydrological year the region averaged iwr for the ww in the dry normal and wet years was 289 mm 223 mm and 143 mm respectively during the sm season the iwr in the north of the 3hp was still over 0 mm in dry years when the precipitation increased there was less regions with a positive iwr despite this part of western hebei was still observed to have an iwr of over 0 mm in wet years the region averaged iwr for the sm in the dry normal and wet years were 15 mm 56 mm and 137 mm respectively 3 3 impacts of cropping system changes on the iwr the currently wwsm rotation system especially the cultivation of winter wheat contributed the most to the high iwr and the continuous decline of groundwater levels min et al 2015 posing significant challenges to the sustainable utilization of regional groundwater moiwo et al 2010 it has become urgent to test alternative cropping systems that may consume less water and require less irrigation than the wwsm in this study five cropping systems table 1 including wwsm were set up to study the impacts of cropping system adjustments on the iwr taking the farmers practices into account a negative iwr was set to 0 indicating that no irrigation was applied when precipitation surpassed et based on the four typical agroecological stations annual iwr of different cropping patterns from 2001 to 2018 was simulated fig 7 wwsm required the highest amount of irrigation and the average iwr for the 18 year period in luancheng quzhou yucheng and fengqiu was 344 mm 281 mm 336 mm and 256 mm respectively with the accumulated reached 6199 mm 5061 mm 6056 mm and 4605 mm in contrast fsmfsm was observed to have the lowest average iwr 119 mm 85 mm 87 mm and 61 mm wmwf presented iwrs second only to that of wwsm due to winter wheat being cultivated twice in a 2 year period the average iwr for wmfsm was 240 mm 183 mm 207 mm and 166 mm in luancheng quzhou yucheng and fengqiu which was 70 65 62 and 65 of that in the wwsm while the wmfm indicated percentages of 61 58 58 and 56 of that for the wwsm respectively spring maize has a longer growth period than summer maize resulting in a greater need for irrigation in addition the annual average iwr of different cropping patterns in luancheng was 344 mm for wwsm 321 mm for wmwf 211 mm for wmfm 240 mm for wmfsm and 119 mm for fsmfsm respectively the average iwr in each station reflected an ordinary irrigation requirement over a long period 2001 2018 in different years the iwr for the same cropping system also varied mainly due to fluctuations in precipitation for example luancheng fsmfsm showed an iwr of 203 mm in 2014 but it was only 104 mm in 2015 and down to 0 in 2016 the interannual variations of the iwr for different cropping patterns made it necessary to explore iwr characteristics in different precipitation conditions and hydrological year types in fig 8 the iwr of the five cropping systems over a 2 year rotation period was simulated luancheng is represented and the hydrological year types were introduced iwr was ordered as wwsm wmwf wmfsm wmfm fsmfsm in all groups for example the variation in iwr was 944 843 656 573 368 mm during continuous dry years dydy and 536 507 398 297 260 mm during continuous wet years wywy during dydy wwsm required irrigation of 472 mm per year while in wywy wwsm required annual irrigation of 268 mm a range of 268 472 mm roughly represented an annual irrigation range under the wwsm cropping system in luancheng in contrast annual irrigation ranged from 134 mm to 287 mm wmfm 254 422 mm wmwf 165 328 mm wmfsm and 62 184 mm fsmfsm for wmwf winter wheat was cultivated twice which did not reduce the demand for irrigation for wmfm and wmfsm due to a reduction in the cultivation of winter wheat around 371 mm 308 mm and 239 mm of irrigation water was saved in dry normal and wet years table 3 shows a comparation of irrigation amounts between wwsm and the other four cropping systems in luancheng compared to wwsm the wmwf wmfm wmfsm and fsmfsm cropping systems saved 6 44 32 and 64 of irrigation water respectively 4 discussion 4 1 crop water consumption in the 3hp et is one of the most important components of water consumption estimation in the agricultural sector in this study the annual et remained relatively stable from 2001 to 2018 across the 3hp significant increases in small areas around the junction between shandong and hebei are consistent with previous studies yan et al 2018 however it was observed that et for ww increased significantly at this junction and et for sm decreased significantly in parts of western hebei the precipitation in both these areas showed no significant temporal trends fig s7 it has been proved that et variations are linked to changes in meteorological factors e g temperature wind vpd yan et al 2018 soil moisture lei and yang 2010 and the prolonging or shortening of the crop growth period as well as other forms of agricultural management spatial distribution patterns in the annual ww season and sm season et are in accordance with previous studies mo et al 2009 yan et al 2018 western hebei s high et can be explained by the fact that it belongs to the intensive agricultural production area located in the taihang mountain s piedmont plain li et al 2011 it is notable that et in the ww season decreased from dy to ny and wy table 2 fig 3 this may be due to having less precipitation and higher vpd in dry years but more precipitation and lower vpd in wet years the 18 year period study 2001 2018 observed 14 years of ny 190 mm of p and wy 229 mm of p for ww suggesting a wetter ww growing season and a less water consumption for ww 413 mm for ny and 373 mm for wy in the period from 1981 to 2000 9 years were determined as dy while ny and wy only accounted for 11 years fan et al 2012 concluded that precipitation in winter increased significantly in the north china plain from 1960 to 2007 which to some extent indicated better precipitation conditions for the ww season however lower precipitation accompanied by higher et should be treated seriously in dry years dy resulted in an increased need for irrigation thus a mid and long term precipitation forecast is necessary to prepare appropriate crop water strategies 4 2 cropping system adjustments and iwr changes since the 1970 s crop production has shifted from two or three crops in 2 years to two crops per year with a wwsm rotation as the dominant system across the 3hp xiao et al 2013 the shifting in cropping systems and improvements in agricultural management have led to a significant increase in crop production over the past decades xiao and tao 2014 however as a result the 3hp has been undergoing a severe water crisis due to the large amount of water required for agriculture especially for winter wheat even a minimum amount of water for irrigation per crop life cycle with the current cropping system can cause a decline in the groundwater table sun et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to test alternative cropping systems that may consume less water and require less irrigation under the existing wwsm rotation system iwr is 332 mm for ww and 8 mm for sm in the north china plain ren et al 2019 meng et al 2012 note that the average iwr from 2004 to 2010 for ww was 290 mm in quzhou this study further demonstrated the spatial distributions of the iwr across the 3hp in different hydrological year types the iwr for ww was positive in most areas even in wet years in the northwest of shandong and the west of hebei the requirements were particularly high 200 300 mm in wy and 300 400 mm in dy in dry years irrigation for sm was also necessary iwr 0 in beijing tianjin hebei shandong and the north of henan it is worth noting that 14 ny and wy years were identified from 2001 to 2018 for ww and sm respectively table s2 indicating better precipitation conditions and thus less need for irrigation compared with the1981 2000 period in which dy accounted for 9 years compared to wwsm the saving potential on irrigation was 45 5 151 mm for wmfm and 23 3 77 mm for wmwf ren et al 2019 with optimal irrigation management irrigation for wmfm and fsmfsm was reduced by 35 and 61 compared with conventional wwsm meng et al 2012 in our investigations e g in luancheng as described below wmfm wmfsm and fsmfsm reduced irrigation by 44 32 and 64 respectively compared to wwsm from 2001 2018 the average iwr for wwsm reached 344 mm while it was 211 mm for wmfm 240 mm for wmfsm and 119 mm for fsmfsm chen et al 2003 note that 150 mm yr 1 would be the upper limit for groundwater pumping to halt the water table decline in the ncp ren et al 2019 concluded that the maximum amount of groundwater extraction that would still sustain groundwater in luancheng was 187 mm yr 1 in this study the annual averaged iwr was 119 mm for fsmfsm 211 mm for wmfm and 240 mm for wmfsm fsmfsm is the ideal cropping system to alleviate the decline in groundwater regarding the replenishment of precipitation for soil water storage and groundwater in the fallow season wmfm and wmfsm may also be alternatives in luancheng in contrast the annual average iwr was 162 mm for wmfm 183 mm for wmfsm 85 mm for fsmfsm in quzhou and 194 mm 207 mm 87 mm respectively in yucheng in fengqiu it was 144 mm 166 mm 61 mm respectively cui et al 2020 concluded that groundwater storage in the midstream and downstream parts of the yellow river has been declining at an increasing rate from the perspective of saving groundwater wmfm wmfsm fsmfsm may also be options in yucheng and fengqiu for the sustainability of groundwater previous studies also focused on modeling agricultural practices that may alleviate or halt groundwater level decline including covering soil surface with plastic film irrigating based on the real time soil moisture reducing input of water and nitrogen etc liang et al 2019a 2019b van oort et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 however on regional levels and considering the operability reducing wheat or maize planting may be the most direct and effective way to reduce iwr and sustain groundwater resources however adjustments in cropping systems would inevitably reduce crop production considering that the 3hp is in a strategic position for domestic food production and security especially for ensuring self sufficiency in terms of wheat supply ren et al 2019 a trade off between cropping system adjustments and food security should be considered critically as recommended cropping systems wmfsm wmfm xiao et al 2017 may gain more attention in the future due to their limited impact on total grain production and greater irrigation water saving potential however wheat is the most important staple food with maize being primarily used as animal feed compensating for wheat yield reductions by increasing maize production should be considered overall factors including crop water consumptions irrigation water requirements water saving potentials groundwater levels food securities socio economic analysis agricultural subsidies water prices and stakeholders views all need consideration when adjusting cropping patterns an et al 2016 liang et al 2019b liu et al 2020 van oort et al 2016 and analysis of agricultural water consumption should gain more attention when striving for groundwater sustainability based on the iwr maps in this study fig 6 it is recommended that wheat planting areas be increased in anhui central and southern henan and the southwest of shandong the south region where the annual iwr is below 200 mm especially in normal and wet years for the ww season despite iwr in dry years ranging from 200 mm to 400 mm the iwr in wet years 8 years table s2 is below 200 mm meanwhile ample summer precipitation would also provide compensation with a significantly increased precipitation since the 1980 s in this region wu et al 2019a additionally considering the predominance of small scale cultivation in the 3hp and conventional flooding irrigation practices technology for improving irrigation methods as well as other forms of field management i e straw mulching and weed control should be promoted 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the usefulness and acceptability of a remotely sensed algorithm sebs in estimating evapotranspiration in the 3hp at regional scale given current data availability however further calibration is necessary to improve et estimates as for crop water consumption no significant p 0 05 increase and decrease in the annual et have been observed et in winter wheat season increased significantly at the junction of hebei and shandong provinces and et in summer maize season decreased significantly in some parts of western hebei from dry to normal and wet years et of winter wheat decreased as 433 413 373 mm crop irrigation water requirement iwr showed considerable spatiotemporal variations anhui central and southern henan as well as southwestern shandong presented an iwr below 200 mm in normal and wet years however the north region of the 3hp has always had an extreme iwr particularly in western hebei and northwestern shandong an annual average iwr from 2001 to 2018 was 344 mm for wwsm winter wheat summer maize 321 mm for wmwf wheat maize wheat fallow 240 mm for wmfsm wheat maize fallow spring maize 211 mm for wmfm wheat maize fallow maize and 119 mm for fsmfsm fallow spring maize fallow spring maize during a 2 year rotation period compared to wwsm wmwf wmfsm wmsm and fsmfsm saved irrigation by 6 32 44 and 64 respectively above results can be referred when making decisions regarding cropping system shifts in water short 3hp last but not least assessing iwr of different cropping systems was based on the grids where agroecological experimental stations lies in upcoming studies spatialization of the iwr combined with cropping systems would be investigated to provide more detailed regional water management guidance funding this work was

et indicated no significant change from 2001 to 2018 which decreased from southeast to northwest and ranged from 700 mm to 900 mm in the winter wheat ww season et increased significantly at the junction of hebei and shandong provinces while it decreased in western hebei during the summer maize sm period moreover et for ww decreased from dry to normal and wet years 433 413 and 373 mm while it increased in sm season 377 392 and 396 mm iwr showed great interannual variability anhui central and southern henan and southwestern shandong presented annual iwr below 200 mm with 100 300 mm in the ww period and 300 0 100 mm in the sm period negative iwr means rainfall surplus and no real irrigation the north of the 3hp required considerable irrigation in the ww season especially in western hebei and northwestern shandong over 300 mm in dry years and 200 mm in wet years with iwr ranging from 100 100 mm in the sm period the 18 year average iwr of wwsm wmwf wmfm wmfsm and fsmfsm was 344

security should also be considered when adjustments are made keywords crop water consumption spatiotemporal variation irrigation amount cropping system adjustment hydrological year type 1 introduction water scarcity and drought pose serious threats to the livelihood of farming communities and the economy in many parts of the world alam 2015 the huang huai hai plain 3hp fig 1 located in the north of china and covering an area of 33 000 km2 is recognized as one of the most important agricultural production bases in china providing about 69 and 35 of the nation s wheat and maize respectively liu et al 2010 however it faces severe water shortages due to its heavy agricultural water requirements lei et al 2011 especially for winter wheat irrigation iqbal et al 2014 the main cropping system in the 3hp is a highly intensive winter wheat summer maize wwsm double cropping system tian et al 2017 with two harvests per year and an annual evapotranspiration et of approximately 850 900 mm shen et al 2013 with an annual average precipitation of 580 mm two thirds of which precipitated during the summer months june to september irrigation of summer maize is not necessary however flooding irrigation is applied three or four times a year providing about 300 mm or more of water for winter wheat sun et al 2011 furthermore this cropping system relies heavily on groundwater irrigation because the rivers are inaccessible in many parts in this region liang et al 2019a although the water shortage can be attributed to the water consumption of agriculture industry and private households irrigation for agriculture is responsible for about 70 of the total groundwater consumption zou et al 2015 due to the continuous pumping of groundwater for socioeconomic and agricultural use the hebei plain which covers northern part of the region is now characterized by serious groundwater overexploitation and poor water environments van oort et al 2016 irrigation of 300 mm yr 1 to produce a high winter wheat yield has resulted in a decline in the groundwater level in the north china plain ncp liang et al 2019a and a groundwater depression cone of 50 000 km2 the largest recorded worldwide has formed in this area hu et al 2005 considering the water scarcity and the contradiction between water demand and supply it is extremely important for sustainable agricultural water management strategies to explicitly assess the crop water consumption and irrigation requirements under the existing wwsm cropping system and test other alternative cropping systems that may require less irrigation than the wwsm in the 3hp many studies have been conducted in this region to understand the characteristics of water consumption and water deficits in agriculture and to evaluate the water saving potential of different cropping systems or optimization of irrigation schedules and methods peng et al 2018 explored the water consumption characteristics of winter wheat under different irrigation schedules in northern china their results showed that water consumption increased with the increase in the amount of irrigation with the latter reaching up to 400 mm xiao et al 2019 assessed water consumption in a wheat maize rotation system under different farming practices in the ncp and concluded that the water consumption of wheat and maize in the recommended farming management were 30 and 37 lower respectively than in the farmers conventional practices however previous studies have mainly been field based lv et al 2011 sun et al 2015 providing observations based only on point data and they did not provide an overall assessment of crop water consumption regionally furthermore it is labor intensive and time consuming to estimate water consumption via field experiments on a regional or basin scale firstly it needs numerous field based experiments carried out in different regions secondly spatial heterogeneity of soil and difference in agricultural managements make it incredible to use the same parameter coefficients and even methods in all experiments thirdly long time observation is time consuming limited access to the required data has led scientists to use remote sensing technology to estimate larger scale water consumption remote sensing techniques have been widely used in assessing environmental issues anderson et al 2011 jung et al 2006 yang et al 2012 estimating water balance elhag et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 as well as evaluating agricultural water consumption yang et al 2015 et as one of the most important components in the hydrological processes has been widely used to assess crop water consumption and the amount of irrigation in agricultural production taheri et al 2019 wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2011 in addition various models have been developed based on remote images to estimate et allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 of which sebs the surface energy balance system has been widely used including in spain kwast et al 2009 australia ma et al 2012 turkey gokmen et al 2012 iran mahour et al 2015 the north china plain yang et al 2010a and the haihe river basin china zhao et al 2019 in the 3hp studies have been carried out to evaluate et based on remote sensing models chen et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2014 but few of them investigated crop water consumption and irrigation requirements in more depth mo et al 2009 assessed water consumptions of wheat and maize based on et in the north china plain but the study period was relatively early yang et al 2015 characterized water consumption variations of wheat and maize in 2012 in the huang huai hai plain while long term observations of water consumptions and crop irrigation requirements are in urgent further explorations of the spatiotemporal variability of crop water consumption and the amount of irrigation required over a relatively long period i e 2001 2018 remain scarce in the 3hp especially when precipitation conditions and hydrological year type are introduced in agricultural production precipitation plays an important role especially in arid and semiarid regions precipitation and irrigation are the major water sources for agricultural sustainability chai et al 2013 the amount of precipitation and its seasonal spatiotemporal distribution directly affect the water balance and the irrigation requirements of the different crops within a rotation cycle sun et al 2010 moreover the interannual variability of precipitation has an important impact on the macro allocation of water resources and policymaking along with the dramatic variation in precipitation gaining a deep insight into the spatial distribution of crop water consumption and irrigation requirements in different hydrological year types is of great significance in determining hydrological year types based on annual and crop season precipitation data it is important to characterize crop water consumption in dry normal and wet years the amount of irrigation for crops can also be further determined leading to a more appropriate water allocation and precipitation use therefore it is crucial to investigate the variations in major water cycle components i e crop et precipitation and irrigation requirements in space and time in different hydrological years hence the objectives of the study are to 1 assess a remotely sensed surface energy balance system sebs approach to estimate et in the 3hp 2 characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of crop water consumption and irrigation requirements in different hydrological years during the 2001 2018 period and 3 test alternative cropping systems that may consume less water and require less irrigation than the current wwsm system the aim is to offer some operational guidance for regional crop water management by assessing water cycle components under the existing wwsm and other alternative cropping systems in the 3hp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the huang huai hai plain 3hp 32 08 41 04 n 112 34 119 52 e is a major breadbasket for china it includes parts of the beijing and tianjin municipalities the majority of hebei province the west of shandong province the east and north of henan province and the north of anhui province with a total land area of 330 000 km2 fig 1 the 3hp s climate is temperate and subhumid and it experiences a continental monsoon with an annual average temperature ranging from 10 to 15 and annual precipitation varying from 500 mm to 950 mm of which approximately 60 70 occurs during the summer while the region is prone to drought in the spring wu et al 2018 the land use and land cover consist mainly of cropland grassland forest and built up areas and the largest percentage is cropland the cropping system in the 3hp is mainly comprised of a winter wheat summer maize wwsm rotation system winter wheat ww is sown in early october of the previous year and then harvested in late may or early june while summer maize sm is sown in june and harvested in september in the same year 2 2 methods 2 2 1 sebs in this study a remotely sensed and energy based sebs approach was used to estimate et which is commonly written as 1 r n g 0 h Œª e where r n is the net radiation g 0 is the soil heat flux h is the turbulent sensible heat flux and Œªe is the latent heat flux Œª is the latent heat vaporization and e is the actual evapotranspiration su 2002 the net radiation flux r n is given by 2 r n 1 Œ± r swd Œµ r lwd Œµ œÉ t 0 4 where Œ± is the albedo r swd is the downward solar radiation r lwd is the downward longwave radiation Œµ is the surface emissivity œÉ is the stefan bolzmann constant and t 0 is the surface temperature the soil heat flux g 0 is parameterized as 3 g 0 r n Œ≥ c 1 f c Œ≥ s Œ≥ c where the ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation –≥c 0 05 for full vegetation canopy and –≥s 0 315 for bare soil and f c is the fractional canopy coverage which can be calculated by ndvi normalized difference vegetation index the surface energy balance computation in the sebs algorithm is based on the determination of the relative evaporative fraction energy balance solutions for the limiting cases are used to determine the relative evaporative fraction jin et al 2009 the value of h was determined by considering the limiting values under the dry and wet limit energy balance at limiting cases at the dry moisture limit latent heat Œªe dry becomes zero and sensible heat h dry would be at its maximum by definition from eq 1 it follows that 4 Œª e dry r n g 0 h dry 0 or h dry r n g 0 at the wet limit sensible heat flux h wet reaches its minimum value and evapotranspiration occurs at the potential rate Œªe wet limited only by the available energy it follows that 5 Œª e wet r n g 0 h wet or h wet r n g 0 Œª e wet the evaporative fraction Œª which is the energy used for the evapotranspiration process divided by total available energy r n g 0 is expressed as 6 Œª Œª e r n g by inverting eq 6 latent heat flux is determined by Œªe Œª r n g 0 actual evapotranspiration e was then calculated as e Œªe Œª œÅ w where Œª is the latent heat of vaporization and œÅ w is the density of water however remote sensing images represent an instantaneous observation in time hence e is initially mm s 1 rwasoka et al 2011 it is assumed that the daily evaporative fraction is approximately equal to the instantaneous value jia et al 2009 sugita and brutsaert 1991 the daily et can then be determined as 7 e daily i 0 24 Œª r n g Œª œÅ w 24 h 3600 s 1000 Œª r n g Œª œÅ w 8 or e daily 8 64 10 7 Œª r n Œª œÅ w where e daily is the daily et mm day 1 Œª is the evaporative fraction Œª is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 œÅ w is the density of water kg m 3 r n is the daily net radiation flux and g is the daily soil heat flux and normally assumed negligible as positive flux occur during night and negative during daytime 2 2 2 crop water consumption and irrigation water requirements the crop water consumption was assessed based on et the irrigation water requirement iwr was estimated as the estimated et minus the amount of precipitation which is a method of estimating the amount of irrigation water widely used in many research projects wu et al 2019a yang et al 2010b positive iwr means an actual irrigation application requirement and negative iwr means a rainfall surplus and no real irrigation is needed in addition taking the wwsm cropping system into account this study calculated the water consumption during winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons as well as annual water consumption 2 2 3 mann kendall mk trend analysis the mk trend method was used to analyze the temporal trends of et the nonparametric mk method developed by mann and refined by kendall has been widely used to evaluate the trends in hydrological and meteorological variables jiang et al 2019 tabari et al 2011 in the mk method the null hypothesis h 0 assumes that there is no trend in the data and is tested against the alternative hypothesis h 1 the relevant equations for calculating the mk statistical values of s and z s are as follows gocic and trajkovic 2013 tabari et al 2011 9 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i where n is the number of data points and x i and x j are data values at time i and j where j i in the time series respectively eq 9 takes the sign function 1 0 or 1 of all pairwise differences in a data series the test statistic s has mean zero and a variance computed by eq 11 in cases where sample size n is greater than 10 the standard normal statistic test z s is calculated as 10 z s s 1 var s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 var s if s 0 11 vars s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 18 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups and t i denotes the number of ties of extent i a tied group is a set of sample data having the same value positive z s values indicate increasing trends while negative z s values signal decreasing trends the test is done at a specific confidence level Œ± when z s z 1 Œ± 2 the null hypothesis is rejected thus a significant trend exists in the time series the value of z 1 Œ± 2 is obtained from the standard normal distribution table 2 2 4 simulation of iwr for different cropping systems in this study the current wwsm cropping system and another four alternative cropping systems reducing wheat or maize cultivations table 1 were set up to study the impact of cropping system changes on the iwr two hypotheses were developed first it was assumed that each cropping system was used starting from 2001 and ending in 2018 and the annual iwr was presented with negative iwrs being set to 0 the iwr was also set to 0 in the fallow season second the iwr of the cropping systems in different hydrological year types during a 2 year rotation period was calculated numerous field scale studies regarding iwr were conducted in four typical agroecological experimental stations in the 3hp at luancheng quzhou yucheng and fengqiu fig 1 li et al 2017 sun et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2007 we then extracted remotely sensed crop water components at the four stations in order to demonstrate the variations of the crop irrigation water requirements 2 2 5 determination of hydrological year type the hydrological year type was determined as follows the first step is to establish the precipitation frequency curve according to the annual precipitation and precipitation of crop growing seasons from 1981 to 2018 and numerate the serial numbers in ascending order from 1 to 38 e g total of 38 years the second is to calculate the frequency with the equation of serial number 100 1 39 the third is to distinguish the dry normal and wet years based on the standards given by china ministry of water resources the specific standards are 37 5 wet year wy 37 5 62 5 normal year ny and 62 5 dry year dy shi et al 2016 hydrological year types with respect to both annual and crop growing seasons were determined table s2 2 3 data the sebs model requires two datasets as inputs the first dataset consists of the land surface temperature albedo and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which can be derived from the daily or 8 composited moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land products or other remote sensing images the second dataset includes air temperature relative humidity atmospheric pressure wind speed and downward solar radiation the modis data which has a relatively high temporal resolution from daily to 16 days and acceptable spatial resolution 250 1000 m was used in this study and downloaded from the nasa data center https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov two products including mod09a1 and mod11a2 covering five modis scenes h26v04 h26v05 h27v04 h27v05 h28v05 for the time period of 2001 2018 were downloaded for estimating et over the study area the modis data was processed using the modis reprojection tool mrt for the mosaicking clipping and reprojection of the images and extraction of the channels mod09a1 shortwave channel bands1 7 data were used to calculate the land surface albedo and the ndvi vermote et al 2015 while the land surface temperature was obtained from mod11a2 wan 2015 detailed descriptions regarding these products can be found on the modis website the second dataset was retrieved from the chinese national meteorological information center http data cma cn in addition ancillary data including land use and land cover data a digital elevation model dem and administrative division data were also collected 2 4 validation of sebs in this study sebs was verified using the monthly large lysimeter et records at the luancheng and yucheng stations located in the area s cropland fig 1 overall the estimated et had a good linear relationship with the observed et rmse 28 mm month 1 in luancheng and 37 mm month 1 in yucheng the regression model explained 81 and 67 of the variability in the observed data respectively fig 2 jiang et al 2004 observed that a reasonable upper limit for accuracy in estimating et using satellite data is about 20 meanwhile seguin et al 1999 suggested that the required et retrieval accuracy varies according to the application but is typically 15 30 from this perspective the accuracy of the validation meets the requirements and the model also demonstrates a satisfactory performance in predicting et across the study area furthermore et derived from different methods in other literatures was also collected as shown in table s1 compared with the sebs results the et values obtained from a three layer soil water balance model jiang et al 2008 weighing lysimeter liu and luo 2010 a soil water balance approach meng et al 2012 zhang et al 2004 the fao method sun et al 2011 and the bowen ratio method kong et al 2012 were all close to the corresponding values in this study however values derived from an eddy covariance ec and a large aperture scintillometer las liu et al 2013 showed deviations compared with the sebs results the reason why et estimated by ec was lower than that by sebs may be that ec measurements underestimated the latent heat fluxes due to the energy balance closure lei et al 2010 the reason why et estimated by las is lower than that by ec may be due to the gap filling method of las e g set hlas 0 when hlas 0 which would result in higher values of daily mean hlas and thus et derived from las is underestimated liu et al 2013 valayamkunnath et al 2018 furthermore sebs derived et in this study was calculated based on grids with a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km while the et data used to make comparisons were generally based on field experiments due to the spatial scale effect uncertainties inevitably exist between remote sensing based and field based et despite this a region wide remote sensing based method has its own advantages 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of crop water consumption table 2 summarizes the statistical characteristics of the annual ww and sm et and precipitation in different hydrological year types and corresponding crop average yields were also presented spatial distributions for annual ww and sm et for dry years dy normal years ny and wet years wy are presented fig 3 and table s2 it can be observed that the spatial distribution of mean annual et was generally coherent in the dry normal and wet years increasing gradually from southeast to northwest mainly ranging from 700 mm to 900 mm irrespective of the hydrological year type the region averaged et was 779 mm for dy 811 mm for ny and 774 mm for wy it is notable that some regions along the taihang mountain western hebei province also showed a relatively high et during the ww season et showed a spatial distribution similar to that of the annual et and an obvious decreasing trend can be observed in the dy ny and wy with mean values of 433 mm 413 mm and 373 mm respectively this may be explained by the regionally variable vapor pressure deficit vpd generally increased precipitation would provide more water for et and it would also result in a higher relative humidity rh and hence a smaller vpd which would weaken the et rate et in most of shandong henan and anhui varied from 450 mm to 500 mm in dy and 350 450 mm in wy for the sm season et primarily varied from 350 mm to 400 mm across the 3hp in dy in wy a high et 400 450 mm was observed in shandong and most of hebei while in other parts of the 3hp it was mainly 350 400 mm the region averaged summer maize et in dry normal and wet years was 377 mm 392 mm and 396 mm respectively crop average yields table 2 were collected from statistical yearbooks it was observed that total average grain yield got the highest value of 6 19 t ha 1 in ny and the lowest of 5 69 t ha 1 in dy the highest yield of winter wheat was 6 29 t ha 1 in ny followed by 6 15 t ha 1 in dy summer maize average yield was in order of 5 78 dy 6 18 ny 6 20 wy t ha 1 which was same to the trend of et changing total grain yields and wheat maize yields differed in different hydrological year types with the normal year leading to the highest average yields summer maize slightly lower than that in wet year and the lowest variation coefficients on the whole an mk test was carried out in 1 km 1 km grids to reveal the spatiotemporal trends of et fig 4 the annual et showed no significant p 0 05 increase or decrease across the 3hp from 2001 to 2018 except for a small portion of western hebei where et decreased remarkably as for et in the ww season most of the 3hp experienced a nonsignificant increase or decrease excluding the junction of shandong and hebei which witnessed a significant increase in et et in the sm period decreased significantly p 0 05 in the west of hebei which was spatially similar to but larger than the distribution of significantly decreased annual et moreover areas with an increasing et p 0 05 were mainly scattered across henan anhui and southwestern shandong overall no significant increasing or decreasing trends spread across a large area indicating to some extent the relative stability of crop water consumption across the 3hp from 2001 to 2018 the conventional wwsm rotation system may account for this 3 2 spatiotemporal variations of the iwr the annual and crop season et iwr and precipitation p data for luancheng station from 2001 to 2018 were extracted from our remotely sensed images fig 5 it was observed that the annual iwr was positive in all the years investigated with a mean value of 326 mm fig 5a indicating that luancheng required continuous irrigations for the ww season multiyear averaged iwr was 291 mm while precipitation was only 135 mm it is also noteworthy that the iwr in 2011 was up to 401 mm while it was only 47 mm in 2018 the great interannual variations in iwr were attributed to the sharp fluctuations in precipitation during the ww season and precipitation in luancheng is never able to meet the needs of wheat water consumption in contrast the iwr for the sm had a mean value of 32 mm a maximum of 155 mm in 2006 and a minimum of 105 mm in 2016 precipitation in the summer maize period met the basic needs of crop water consumption it is notable that the hydrological year types were not always consistent either annually or for the ww and sm seasons for example 2001 was a dy in the annual cycle and for the sm season yet it was a ny for the ww period the uneven seasonal distributions of precipitation account for this highlighting the need to forecast and use precipitation for better irrigation management in crop seasons furthermore the determination of hydrological year types in this study was based on region averaged precipitation which inevitably weakens the precipitation variations in local areas for instance the annual precipitation was 478 mm in 2007 and 601 mm in 2008 in luancheng although these years were calculated to be wy and ny respectively through the region averaged statistics despite this the results of the study were able to be referenced for regional water management when site specific research was also necessary fig s1 s3 show the iwr variations in quzhou yucheng and fengqiu similar to luancheng the iwr in quzhou also showed great variations the annual ww season and sm season iwr were 260 mm 248 mm and 8 mm respectively additionally yucheng station showed an annual iwr of 298 mm 295 mm for ww and 1 mm for sm respectively the negative iwr values indicate that irrigation was not required precipitation could meet the needs of crop water consumption the three values in fengqiu were 174 mm 234 mm and 62 mm of the four stations fengqiu had the lowest iwr due to its higher precipitation however irrigation was also necessary in the ww season fig s3b precipitation was not sufficient for the maize water consumption in some dry years for instance the iwr of the summer maize in 2013 was 184 mm fig 6 shows the spatial distributions of the iwr in different hydrological years it is clear that the dry year led to the highest iwr and the wet year resulted in the lowest iwr a spatial distribution of iwr decreasing from northwest to southeast was detected in all hydrological years on an annual scale there was a clear divide 1 the northern region consisting of beijing tianjin hebei northwestern shandong and northern henan which witnessed an iwr of over 200 mm in the dry years with western hebei and northwestern shandong having an iwr great than 300 mm and 2 the southern region consisting of anhui central and southern henan and the southwest of shandong which had an iwr lower than 200 mm in normal years the north region had an iwr ranging from 200 mm to 300 mm while it was below 100 mm in the southern region in wet years the iwr was negative in the southern region while western hebei experienced an iwr of over 200 mm during the ww season the iwr was positive irrespective of the hydrological year types in detail the iwr in the northern region ranged from 300 mm to 400 mm in dry years 200 300 mm in normal years and 100 200 mm in wet years it is notable that western hebei as well as northwestern shandong were more iwr intensive compared with the rest of the northern region in the same hydrological year the region averaged iwr for the ww in the dry normal and wet years was 289 mm 223 mm and 143 mm respectively during the sm season the iwr in the north of the 3hp was still over 0 mm in dry years when the precipitation increased there was less regions with a positive iwr despite this part of western hebei was still observed to have an iwr of over 0 mm in wet years the region averaged iwr for the sm in the dry normal and wet years were 15 mm 56 mm and 137 mm respectively 3 3 impacts of cropping system changes on the iwr the currently wwsm rotation system especially the cultivation of winter wheat contributed the most to the high iwr and the continuous decline of groundwater levels min et al 2015 posing significant challenges to the sustainable utilization of regional groundwater moiwo et al 2010 it has become urgent to test alternative cropping systems that may consume less water and require less irrigation than the wwsm in this study five cropping systems table 1 including wwsm were set up to study the impacts of cropping system adjustments on the iwr taking the farmers practices into account a negative iwr was set to 0 indicating that no irrigation was applied when precipitation surpassed et based on the four typical agroecological stations annual iwr of different cropping patterns from 2001 to 2018 was simulated fig 7 wwsm required the highest amount of irrigation and the average iwr for the 18 year period in luancheng quzhou yucheng and fengqiu was 344 mm 281 mm 336 mm and 256 mm respectively with the accumulated reached 6199 mm 5061 mm 6056 mm and 4605 mm in contrast fsmfsm was observed to have the lowest average iwr 119 mm 85 mm 87 mm and 61 mm wmwf presented iwrs second only to that of wwsm due to winter wheat being cultivated twice in a 2 year period the average iwr for wmfsm was 240 mm 183 mm 207 mm and 166 mm in luancheng quzhou yucheng and fengqiu which was 70 65 62 and 65 of that in the wwsm while the wmfm indicated percentages of 61 58 58 and 56 of that for the wwsm respectively spring maize has a longer growth period than summer maize resulting in a greater need for irrigation in addition the annual average iwr of different cropping patterns in luancheng was 344 mm for wwsm 321 mm for wmwf 211 mm for wmfm 240 mm for wmfsm and 119 mm for fsmfsm respectively the average iwr in each station reflected an ordinary irrigation requirement over a long period 2001 2018 in different years the iwr for the same cropping system also varied mainly due to fluctuations in precipitation for example luancheng fsmfsm showed an iwr of 203 mm in 2014 but it was only 104 mm in 2015 and down to 0 in 2016 the interannual variations of the iwr for different cropping patterns made it necessary to explore iwr characteristics in different precipitation conditions and hydrological year types in fig 8 the iwr of the five cropping systems over a 2 year rotation period was simulated luancheng is represented and the hydrological year types were introduced iwr was ordered as wwsm wmwf wmfsm wmfm fsmfsm in all groups for example the variation in iwr was 944 843 656 573 368 mm during continuous dry years dydy and 536 507 398 297 260 mm during continuous wet years wywy during dydy wwsm required irrigation of 472 mm per year while in wywy wwsm required annual irrigation of 268 mm a range of 268 472 mm roughly represented an annual irrigation range under the wwsm cropping system in luancheng in contrast annual irrigation ranged from 134 mm to 287 mm wmfm 254 422 mm wmwf 165 328 mm wmfsm and 62 184 mm fsmfsm for wmwf winter wheat was cultivated twice which did not reduce the demand for irrigation for wmfm and wmfsm due to a reduction in the cultivation of winter wheat around 371 mm 308 mm and 239 mm of irrigation water was saved in dry normal and wet years table 3 shows a comparation of irrigation amounts between wwsm and the other four cropping systems in luancheng compared to wwsm the wmwf wmfm wmfsm and fsmfsm cropping systems saved 6 44 32 and 64 of irrigation water respectively 4 discussion 4 1 crop water consumption in the 3hp et is one of the most important components of water consumption estimation in the agricultural sector in this study the annual et remained relatively stable from 2001 to 2018 across the 3hp significant increases in small areas around the junction between shandong and hebei are consistent with previous studies yan et al 2018 however it was observed that et for ww increased significantly at this junction and et for sm decreased significantly in parts of western hebei the precipitation in both these areas showed no significant temporal trends fig s7 it has been proved that et variations are linked to changes in meteorological factors e g temperature wind vpd yan et al 2018 soil moisture lei and yang 2010 and the prolonging or shortening of the crop growth period as well as other forms of agricultural management spatial distribution patterns in the annual ww season and sm season et are in accordance with previous studies mo et al 2009 yan et al 2018 western hebei s high et can be explained by the fact that it belongs to the intensive agricultural production area located in the taihang mountain s piedmont plain li et al 2011 it is notable that et in the ww season decreased from dy to ny and wy table 2 fig 3 this may be due to having less precipitation and higher vpd in dry years but more precipitation and lower vpd in wet years the 18 year period study 2001 2018 observed 14 years of ny 190 mm of p and wy 229 mm of p for ww suggesting a wetter ww growing season and a less water consumption for ww 413 mm for ny and 373 mm for wy in the period from 1981 to 2000 9 years were determined as dy while ny and wy only accounted for 11 years fan et al 2012 concluded that precipitation in winter increased significantly in the north china plain from 1960 to 2007 which to some extent indicated better precipitation conditions for the ww season however lower precipitation accompanied by higher et should be treated seriously in dry years dy resulted in an increased need for irrigation thus a mid and long term precipitation forecast is necessary to prepare appropriate crop water strategies 4 2 cropping system adjustments and iwr changes since the 1970 s crop production has shifted from two or three crops in 2 years to two crops per year with a wwsm rotation as the dominant system across the 3hp xiao et al 2013 the shifting in cropping systems and improvements in agricultural management have led to a significant increase in crop production over the past decades xiao and tao 2014 however as a result the 3hp has been undergoing a severe water crisis due to the large amount of water required for agriculture especially for winter wheat even a minimum amount of water for irrigation per crop life cycle with the current cropping system can cause a decline in the groundwater table sun et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to test alternative cropping systems that may consume less water and require less irrigation under the existing wwsm rotation system iwr is 332 mm for ww and 8 mm for sm in the north china plain ren et al 2019 meng et al 2012 note that the average iwr from 2004 to 2010 for ww was 290 mm in quzhou this study further demonstrated the spatial distributions of the iwr across the 3hp in different hydrological year types the iwr for ww was positive in most areas even in wet years in the northwest of shandong and the west of hebei the requirements were particularly high 200 300 mm in wy and 300 400 mm in dy in dry years irrigation for sm was also necessary iwr 0 in beijing tianjin hebei shandong and the north of henan it is worth noting that 14 ny and wy years were identified from 2001 to 2018 for ww and sm respectively table s2 indicating better precipitation conditions and thus less need for irrigation compared with the1981 2000 period in which dy accounted for 9 years compared to wwsm the saving potential on irrigation was 45 5 151 mm for wmfm and 23 3 77 mm for wmwf ren et al 2019 with optimal irrigation management irrigation for wmfm and fsmfsm was reduced by 35 and 61 compared with conventional wwsm meng et al 2012 in our investigations e g in luancheng as described below wmfm wmfsm and fsmfsm reduced irrigation by 44 32 and 64 respectively compared to wwsm from 2001 2018 the average iwr for wwsm reached 344 mm while it was 211 mm for wmfm 240 mm for wmfsm and 119 mm for fsmfsm chen et al 2003 note that 150 mm yr 1 would be the upper limit for groundwater pumping to halt the water table decline in the ncp ren et al 2019 concluded that the maximum amount of groundwater extraction that would still sustain groundwater in luancheng was 187 mm yr 1 in this study the annual averaged iwr was 119 mm for fsmfsm 211 mm for wmfm and 240 mm for wmfsm fsmfsm is the ideal cropping system to alleviate the decline in groundwater regarding the replenishment of precipitation for soil water storage and groundwater in the fallow season wmfm and wmfsm may also be alternatives in luancheng in contrast the annual average iwr was 162 mm for wmfm 183 mm for wmfsm 85 mm for fsmfsm in quzhou and 194 mm 207 mm 87 mm respectively in yucheng in fengqiu it was 144 mm 166 mm 61 mm respectively cui et al 2020 concluded that groundwater storage in the midstream and downstream parts of the yellow river has been declining at an increasing rate from the perspective of saving groundwater wmfm wmfsm fsmfsm may also be options in yucheng and fengqiu for the sustainability of groundwater previous studies also focused on modeling agricultural practices that may alleviate or halt groundwater level decline including covering soil surface with plastic film irrigating based on the real time soil moisture reducing input of water and nitrogen etc liang et al 2019a 2019b van oort et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 however on regional levels and considering the operability reducing wheat or maize planting may be the most direct and effective way to reduce iwr and sustain groundwater resources however adjustments in cropping systems would inevitably reduce crop production considering that the 3hp is in a strategic position for domestic food production and security especially for ensuring self sufficiency in terms of wheat supply ren et al 2019 a trade off between cropping system adjustments and food security should be considered critically as recommended cropping systems wmfsm wmfm xiao et al 2017 may gain more attention in the future due to their limited impact on total grain production and greater irrigation water saving potential however wheat is the most important staple food with maize being primarily used as animal feed compensating for wheat yield reductions by increasing maize production should be considered overall factors including crop water consumptions irrigation water requirements water saving potentials groundwater levels food securities socio economic analysis agricultural subsidies water prices and stakeholders views all need consideration when adjusting cropping patterns an et al 2016 liang et al 2019b liu et al 2020 van oort et al 2016 and analysis of agricultural water consumption should gain more attention when striving for groundwater sustainability based on the iwr maps in this study fig 6 it is recommended that wheat planting areas be increased in anhui central and southern henan and the southwest of shandong the south region where the annual iwr is below 200 mm especially in normal and wet years for the ww season despite iwr in dry years ranging from 200 mm to 400 mm the iwr in wet years 8 years table s2 is below 200 mm meanwhile ample summer precipitation would also provide compensation with a significantly increased precipitation since the 1980 s in this region wu et al 2019a additionally considering the predominance of small scale cultivation in the 3hp and conventional flooding irrigation practices technology for improving irrigation methods as well as other forms of field management i e straw mulching and weed control should be promoted 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the usefulness and acceptability of a remotely sensed algorithm sebs in estimating evapotranspiration in the 3hp at regional scale given current data availability however further calibration is necessary to improve et estimates as for crop water consumption no significant p 0 05 increase and decrease in the annual et have been observed et in winter wheat season increased significantly at the junction of hebei and shandong provinces and et in summer maize season decreased significantly in some parts of western hebei from dry to normal and wet years et of winter wheat decreased as 433 413 373 mm crop irrigation water requirement iwr showed considerable spatiotemporal variations anhui central and southern henan as well as southwestern shandong presented an iwr below 200 mm in normal and wet years however the north region of the 3hp has always had an extreme iwr particularly in western hebei and northwestern shandong an annual average iwr from 2001 to 2018 was 344 mm for wwsm winter wheat summer maize 321 mm for wmwf wheat maize wheat fallow 240 mm for wmfsm wheat maize fallow spring maize 211 mm for wmfm wheat maize fallow maize and 119 mm for fsmfsm fallow spring maize fallow spring maize during a 2 year rotation period compared to wwsm wmwf wmfsm wmsm and fsmfsm saved irrigation by 6 32 44 and 64 respectively above results can be referred when making decisions regarding cropping system shifts in water short 3hp last but not least assessing iwr of different cropping systems was based on the grids where agroecological experimental stations lies in upcoming studies spatialization of the iwr combined with cropping systems would be investigated to provide more detailed regional water management guidance funding this work was
