objective of this study is to construct and implement an indicator based approach to assess socio hydrological systems with new metrics to evaluate the influence of hydropower development we adopted a conceptual framework in which resilience is a relative complement of vulnerability and dependent on adaptive capacity the framework has eight vulnerability parameters water variation water scarcity water exploitation water pollution natural capacity physical capacity human resource capacity and economic capacity hydropower development was incorporated into a modified resilience framework to

systems are multiscale interdisciplinary frameworks that focus on two way coupling between human and water systems sivapalan et al 2014 the primary focus of resilience research includes theoretical and qualitative interpretations comprehensive methods of evaluating resilience for the purpose of supporting decision making and water resources management are needed although several methods for quantifying resilience have been developed previous efforts have not incorporated hydropower development babel et al 2011 huang and cai 2009 pandey et al 2011 this type of framework is particularly

adjustment and engagement for long term planning wang and blackmore 2009 indicator based frameworks have been developed for vulnerability assessments for various spatial and temporal scales huang and cai 2009 developed a guideline for assessing freshwater resource vulnerability using indicators that reflect resources stress population based development pressures ecological insecurity and management challenges a basin wide assessment using this guideline was developed in nepal by pandey et al 2010 who concluded that vulnerability in nepal was related to poor management capacity pandey et al 2011 focused on evaluating adaptive capacity metrics at different spatial scales district basin country and presented an easily interpretable method babel et al 2011 conducted a basin wide freshwater resource vulnerability assessment utilizing water stress and adaptive capacity as metrics for the bagmati river basin in nepal the study revealed a moderate increase in vulnerability over time due to scarcity and exploitation of water resources however the work of babel et al 2011 did not include stresses related to increased dam and reservoir construction in nepal based on a review of vulnerability studies and resilience literature we adapted a vulnerability index based on census and hydrologic data and established several water stress and adaptive capacity indices necessary to determine the vulnerability of a socio hydrologic system this approach builds off the work of babel et al 2011 in which eight vulnerability parameters were used to assess the capacity of a nepalese river system to water stress we included two additional indicators dam density and reservoir storage capacity to quantify the impact of hydropower development these indicators were incorporated into the water resource exploitation parameter and physical capacity parameter respectively as described in sections 3 1 2 and 3 1 3 additional modifications were made to 1 the water pollution parameter to include river water quality data and 2 the water scarcity parameter to include household access and resource management although various methods for evaluating the impact of dams on hydrologic connectivity and water resources have been developed the limited amount of hydrologic data in nepal constrained us to adopted a simple yet effective metric that has been applied in global and large scale studies anderson et al 2008 nilsson 2005 vörösmarty et al 2010 2 study area the himalayan watersheds and rivers of nepal are characterized as high altitude high gradient systems with significant glacial input and rich biodiversity many of nepal s rivers are tributaries to the ganges river in india the diverse landscape of nepal is comprised of five major river basins the sapta koshi sapta gandaki karnali mahakali and the southern rivers these basins makeup a total of 147 181 square kilometers sharma and awal 2013 unfortunately the lack of widespread and consistent streamflow monitoring makes it challenging to quantitatively describe the country s hydrologic attributes the climate is often characterized by three distinct seasons the summer season the rainy season and the winter season the summer season stretches from march to may and is distinguished by high temperatures which contribute to rain and sleet in the form of local convective storms shrestha 2000 the major impact of climate in the region takes place during the rainy season from june to september when the summer monsoon brings humid air and torrential rainfall the summer monsoon is extremely important to the prosperity of the country s agricultural industry the winter season is the driest season in nepal characterized by clear skies and cold temperatures from october to february shrestha 2000 this climate variability greatly influences socio hydrologic systems and the ability for communities to accommodate agricultural and household water needs hydropower development has been a major objective in nepal

research of babel et al 2011 by proposing indices and indicators that depend upon readily available data we also add new indices for evaluating hydropower development into a modified resilience framework to explore socio hydrological impacts the results were assessed with an emphasis on identifying specific areas in need of improvement and potential solutions 3 1 vulnerability assessment framework a framework was developed to assess the vulnerability of socio hydrological systems to water resource disturbances as a function of water stress and adaptive capacity we adapted previous vulnerability assessment models to incorporate two additional indicators for hydropower development dam density and reservoir storage capacity these indicators were incorporated into the water resource exploitation parameter and physical capacity parameter as described in sections 3 1 2 and 3 1 3 additional modifications were made to the water pollution parameter and water scarcity parameter fig 2 graphically represents the adopted framework for this study 3 1 1 vulnerability index there are many approaches to defining the relationship between water stress and adaptive capacity as they relate to vulnerability including a deductive method liu et al 2013 averaging method alessa et al 2008 and simple quotient method babel et al 2011 fontaine and steinemann 2009 these methods create sub indices for water stress wsi and for adaptive capacity aci for this study we implemented the quotient method shown in eq 1 as it accounts for magnification and dampening for high and low adaptive capacity respectively 1 vi wsi aci descriptions of the wsi and aci and their contributing parameters are presented below the index classification is presented in table 2 3 1 2 water stress index wsi water stress is the status of water resources in meeting overall demands including both socio economic and ecological obligations water stress is also a primary cause of deterioration of freshwater resources huang and cai 2009 the wsi is composed of four weighted parameters water variation wv water scarcity ws water resource exploitation we and water pollution wp wsi is calculated as a summation of the four variables shown in eq 2 2 wsi i 1 n 4 w i wp i where wpi represents the water resource parameters and wi is its associated weight an explanation of weight assignments is presented in section 3 2 3 1 2 1 water resource variation wv the water resource variation parameter wv accounts for potential temporal water shortages due to resource variability wv is determined by evaluating the relative standard deviation or coefficient of variation cv of annual precipitation data for a 10 year period and establishing a critical variance threshold the critical variance threshold was set at 0 4 as an adjustment to the work by huang and cai 2009 because of the short period of record once the threshold is reached the wv parameter value is set at the upper limit of 1 as shown in eq 3 3 wv c v 0 4 c v 0 4 1 c v 0 4 3 1 2 2 water scarcity ws primary contributors to water scarcity ws are access resource management and water quantity available ws was estimated in previous studies and vulnerability assessment guidelines using the falkenmark water stress indicator as a description of water availability in the country babel et al 2011 huang and cai 2009 we estimated ws using metrics that describe the three primary indicators percentage of the population with poor access to water p adequacy of public drinking water facilities a and water availability using the falkenmark water stress indicator f as shown in eq 4 each contributor was weighted equally poor access for this study was defined as water sources other than piped or household connections i e hand pumped covered well uncovered well spout stream river and other the falkenmark water stress indicator is widely known and compares water availability to an established minimum threshold of 1700 m3 capita year falkenmark and widstrand 1992 and is shown in eq 5 the three indicators were aggregated using the standard error method eq 4 4 ws p 2 a 2 f 2 3 5 f 1700 wr per capita wr per capita 1700 m 3 year 1 wr per capita 1700 m 3 year the standard error represents the deviation from the optimal water scarcity parameter value of zero each indicator represents a measure of water scarcity as a deviation from the optimal value the standard error method combines these indicators to represent a gross view of the water scarcity deviation from the optimal value 3 1 2 3 water resource exploitation we water resource exploitation we is presented as the beneficial use of water resources and its impact on sustainability beneficial use is characterized by energy harvesting agricultural and industrial use and potable consumption we calculated we using the standard error method eq 6 the indicators were dam density ρ d eq 7 normalized water resource development rate d r eq 9 and land degradation due to erosion chemical deterioration and physical deterioration l eq 10 the water resource development rate d r is the ratio of total water use to water available d r is normalized by a

using major river water quality data and domestic non point sources nps of pollution water pollution was calculated as the average of nps pollution and water quality using eq 11 for water quality a modified water quality index wqi eq 12 based on global water quality index report 2007 was implemented in order to represent all available water quality measures both physical and chemical ph tds do

aci composed of four parameters natural capacity nc physical capacity pc human resource capacity hc and economic capacity ec aci is calculated as a weighted summation of the four variables shown in eq 17 details on the weighting methodology are presented in section 3 2 17 aci i 1 n 4 w i cp i where cpi represents a capacity parameter and wi is its associated weight 3 1 3 1 natural capacity nc nc can be defined as the environment s ability to cope with water stresses major contributors to the capacity are glacier area snowpack waterbodies and vegetated area these features attenuate flows and runoff provide hydrologic services and contribute to the amount and location of water in a watershed brauman et al 2007 glaciers snowpack and water bodies serve as a natural buffer and are an indicator of natural capacity vegetation cover is representative of forest area and wetlands and therefore an indicator of natural capacity nc babel et al 2011 we estimated nc as the percentage of area classified as forest shrub water and snow using national land use data our calculation modifies the method implemented in babel et al 2011 by adding glacier area snowpack and water bodies to the natural capacity 3 1 3 2 physical capacity pc the integrated capacity of farmers local community members and government entities to divert water to meet water demand is defined as physical capacity pc physical infrastructure such as stream diversions reservoirs private and communal water distribution systems and pumping contribute to the adaptive capacity of the socio hydrologic systems we estimate pc shown in eq 18 using irrigation coverage drinking water coverage and reservoir storage capacity reservoir storage capacity was calculated as the ratio between estimated hydropower dam storage and estimated total water use 18 pc w i i w dw dw s where i is irrigation coverage expressed as the percentage of total regional area that is irrigated wi 0 8 which is the fraction of water used for irrigation pandey et al 2010 dw is drinking water coverage expressed as the percentage of the region with access to safe drinking water sources wdw 0 2 which is the fraction of water used for drinking water pandey et al 2010 and s is the reservoir storage capacity expressed as annual water volume stored per estimated water volume used 3 1 3 3 human resource capacity hrc hrc can be defined as the sociological ability of a system that can help manage or adapt to water stresses or disturbances this parameter is also an indicator of an individual s ability to adapt to new conditions brought on by water stress hrc is calculated by taking the average of the literacy rate the population that can read and write and the economically active population the economically active population is expressed as a percentage the calculation follows the method implemented in babel et al 2011 3 1 3 4 economic capacity ec ec is the financial resource status of a socio hydrological system that can help adjust or adapt to water stresses or disturbances one readily used indicator of financial status is the gross domestic product gdp index nepal and united nations development programme nepal 2014 in order to account for cost of living and inflation rates gdp per capita at purchasing power parity ppp was used in the calculation of the gdp index as shown in eq 19 19 gdpindex log per capita income log min annual income log max annual income log min annual income 3 2 parameter weighting parameter weighting was adopted from babel et al 2011 and pandey et al 2011 who established the weights using the analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp is a rational multi criterion decision making model that provides the means to identify relevant factors and interrelations based on perception saaty 1988 the model establishes a priority of each parameter by creating a parameter hierarchy and then comparing the parameters to each other two at a time the result is the priority or weighting of each parameter with respect to all other parameters saaty 1988 ahp is valuable because of its structured ability to incorporate input from various perspectives and establish an intensity of importance to develop a hierarchy for all criteria saaty 2004 babel et al 2011 conducted a survey consisting of 30 water resource related individuals ranging from government agencies nongovenment agencies consultants and academics the result is a parameter weighting based on societal scientific and governmental perspectives presented in section 4 which is important for the interpretation and understanding of system responses and outcomes 3 3 data collection data limitations were a notable factor for this study and the primary constraint for determining the year for our assessment as 2011 the last census data was collected from previous studies government reports census reports and international organizations and institutions rainfall data water quality and land use information was collected from environment statistics of nepal 2014 social data including water use sanitation education and employment was extracted from nepal living standards survey 2011 national population and housing census 2011 2012 and nepal human development report 2014 hydropower data came from construction licenses for hydropower dams 2017 a summary of this study s data collection is presented in table 3 4 results the vulnerability assessment was evaluated for all five development regions for 2011 and are summarized in table 4 vi values ranged from 0 70 to 1 05 which can be compared to table 2 for interpretation the radar plots shown in figs 3 and 4 are a graphical representation of the wsi parameters and aci parameters respectively for each development region each parameter is represented on the axes all of which originate at the center of the graph overall the country experiences moderate water stress with the regional wsis ranging from 0 42 to 0 62 the western and central development regions experience the highest water stress of all five regions two major contributors are population density and hydropower development as both regions have a large population and the majority of dams as shown in fig 5 the population density causes an increasing demand on existing water and wastewater infrastructure due to rapid development the large hydropower development in these regions tie up resource and hydrologically segregate the region which is reflected in the water exploitation parameter we the far west mid west and eastern development regions show a much smaller impact from hydropower development as there are fewer dams in these regions the western development region had the highest adaptive capacity although all five regions had similar aci values ranging from 0 55 to 0 63 a major limitation demonstrated in this study as well as others e g babel et al 2011 is the weak economic capacity ec in nepal the inability to invest in permanent and robust water infrastructure leads to cheap temporary solutions such as unimproved sanitation and a lack of household toilets as reflected in the water pollution parameter wp 5 discussion the index based vulnerability assessment is a flexible tool that identifies specific targets and system components that are most vulnerable to stresses and is useful for targeting water resource management decisions for improving the resiliency of socio hydrological systems critical reviews and adaptations are required to establish the most appropriate parameter settings relationships and weightings grill et al 2014 we modified and added to previous work to account for hydropower development sharma and awal 2013 and improve parameter characterization our work is the first to apply a socio hydrologic vulnerability framework for the entire country of nepal which allows for comparison of water stresses and adaptive capacities of nepalese development regions we chose to discretize our analysis using nepalese development regions because they were administrative boundaries that aligned with the resolution and availability of data we recognize the limitations associated with inferring generalized vulnerability of nepal using development boundaries however such as those described by the modifiable unit area problem maup wong 2009 nepalese development boundaries are particularly large and decreases in the spatial scales used in our vulnerability framework may highlight the variability in sub indices throughout the country however our approach is a step forward in identifying areas of concern and sub indices that should be the focus for water resource management projects e g build physical capacity build economic capacity strengthen human resource capacity the water stress index wsi results highlight the variability of water challenges in nepal and future improvements to our framework although the works of babel et al 2011 pandey et al 2010 and huang and cai 2009 provided estimates of wp and ws indices we improved these indices by including water quality data from river systems since water quality problems impact human and natural systems this addition is useful for expanding our vulnerability framework to include ecological assessments in the future we found that wv had a large negative impact on western and midwestern development regions which highlights the need for more hydrologic data collection in these regions and demonstrates the need for better parameterization of wv variables the current determination of the parameter is dependent on annual precipitation and does not include discharge data which is important for characterizing hydrologic variability more accurate assessments of water variability could be beneficial for many communities that rely on groundwater and stream diversions in the mountain and terai regions of nepal despite increasing hydropower development and financial and social resource limitations only the central development region is categorized as moderately vulnerable based on our assessment and the vulnerability index classifications presented in table 2 these results are consistent with the findings in babel et al 2011 in which the vulnerability index was close to 1 we found that our results nearly match babel et al 2011 for the central development region which contains the productive bagmati river basin but posed data challenges for the babel et al 2011 study as well in addition one identifiable vulnerability from our assessment scale was overall week economic capacity ec of the country especially in rural regions such as the far western development region a unique aspect of our framework was the incorporation of hydropower development into both the wsi and the aci to reflect hydropower impacts and benefits we found that hydropower development generally weakened system vulnerability and provided little socio hydrologic benefit the main hydrologic benefit of the hydropower development is reservoir storage capacity which dampens the effects of water resource variations and shortages one potential reason for the marginal benefit in nepal is that storage doesn t satisfy much of the water demand fig 6 compares regional water use to dam storage and reveals the minimal contribution of reservoir storage to demand however as hydropower development increases storage capacity could also increase and provide more adaptive capacity 6 conclusion in this study we advance previous vulnerability assessment methods by improving several water stress and adaptive capacity indices necessary to determine the vulnerability of socio hydrologic systems in nepal in particular we add adaptive capacity indicators for dam density and reservoir storage capacity and we modify water pollution and water scarcity sub indices our study reveals the relatively resilient state of nepal s socio hydrologic systems and are consistent with previous work in addition our study shows that the western and central development regions which are both highly populated and pressured by new hydropower development are the most water stressed but also have the highest adaptive capacities compared to other development regions in nepal we recommend that future works focuses on collecting better hydrologic data considering the economic costs of increased adaptive capacity and implementation of our vulnerability

aci composed of four parameters natural capacity nc physical capacity pc human resource capacity hc and economic capacity ec aci is calculated as a weighted summation of the four variables shown in eq 17 details on the weighting methodology are presented in section 3 2 17 aci i 1 n 4 w i cp i where cpi represents a capacity parameter and wi is its associated weight 3 1 3 1 natural capacity nc nc can be defined as the environment s ability to cope with water stresses major contributors to the capacity are glacier area snowpack waterbodies and vegetated area these features attenuate flows and runoff provide hydrologic services and contribute to the amount and location of water in a watershed brauman et al 2007 glaciers snowpack and water bodies serve as a natural buffer and are an indicator of natural capacity vegetation cover is representative of forest area and wetlands and therefore an indicator of natural capacity nc babel et al 2011 we estimated nc as the percentage of area classified as forest shrub water and snow using national land use data our calculation modifies the method implemented in babel et al 2011 by adding glacier area snowpack and water bodies to the natural capacity 3 1 3 2 physical capacity pc the integrated capacity of farmers local community members and government entities to divert water to meet water demand is defined as physical capacity pc physical infrastructure such as stream diversions reservoirs private and communal water distribution systems and pumping contribute to the adaptive capacity of the socio hydrologic systems we estimate pc shown in eq 18 using irrigation coverage drinking water coverage and reservoir storage capacity reservoir storage capacity was calculated as the ratio between estimated hydropower dam storage and estimated total water use 18 pc w i i w dw dw s where i is irrigation coverage expressed as the percentage of total regional area that is irrigated wi 0 8 which is the fraction of water used for irrigation pandey et al 2010 dw is drinking water coverage expressed as the percentage of the region with access to safe drinking water sources wdw 0 2 which is the fraction of water used for drinking water pandey et al 2010 and s is the reservoir storage capacity expressed as annual water volume stored per estimated water volume used 3 1 3 3 human resource capacity hrc hrc can be defined as the sociological ability of a system that can help manage or adapt to water stresses or disturbances this parameter is also an indicator of an individual s ability to adapt to new conditions brought on by water stress hrc is calculated by taking the average of the literacy rate the population that can read and write and the economically active population the economically active population is expressed as a percentage the calculation follows the method implemented in babel et al 2011 3 1 3 4 economic capacity ec ec is the financial resource status of a socio hydrological system that can help adjust or adapt to water stresses or disturbances one readily used indicator of financial status is the gross domestic product gdp index nepal and united nations development programme nepal 2014 in order to account for cost of living and inflation rates gdp per capita at purchasing power parity ppp was used in the calculation of the gdp index as shown in eq 19 19 gdpindex log per capita income log min annual income log max annual income log min annual income 3 2 parameter weighting parameter weighting was adopted from babel et al 2011 and pandey et al 2011 who established the weights using the analytical hierarchy process ahp ahp is a rational multi criterion decision making model that provides the means to identify relevant factors and interrelations based on perception saaty 1988 the model establishes a priority of each parameter by creating a parameter hierarchy and then comparing the parameters to each other two at a time the result is the priority or weighting of each parameter with respect to all other parameters saaty 1988 ahp is valuable because of its structured ability to incorporate input from various perspectives and establish an intensity of importance to develop a hierarchy for all criteria saaty 2004 babel et al 2011 conducted a survey consisting of 30 water resource related individuals ranging from government agencies nongovenment agencies consultants and academics the result is a parameter weighting based on societal scientific and governmental perspectives presented in section 4 which is important for the interpretation and understanding of system responses and outcomes 3 3 data collection data limitations were a notable factor for this study and the primary constraint for determining the year for our assessment as 2011 the last census data was collected from previous studies government reports census reports and international organizations and institutions rainfall data water quality and land use information was collected from environment statistics of nepal 2014 social data including water use sanitation education and employment was extracted from nepal living standards survey 2011 national population and housing census 2011 2012 and nepal human development report 2014 hydropower data came from construction licenses for hydropower dams 2017 a summary of this study s data collection is presented in table 3 4 results the vulnerability assessment was evaluated for all five development regions for 2011 and are summarized in table 4 vi values ranged from 0 70 to 1 05 which can be compared to table 2 for interpretation the radar plots shown in figs 3 and 4 are a graphical representation of the wsi parameters and aci parameters respectively for each development region each parameter is represented on the axes all of which originate at the center of the graph overall the country experiences moderate water stress with the regional wsis ranging from 0 42 to 0 62 the western and central development regions experience the highest water stress of all five regions two major contributors are population density and hydropower development as both regions have a large population and the majority of dams as shown in fig 5 the population density causes an increasing demand on existing water and wastewater infrastructure due to rapid development the large hydropower development in these regions tie up resource and hydrologically segregate the region which is reflected in the water exploitation parameter we the far west mid west and eastern development regions show a much smaller impact from hydropower development as there are fewer dams in these regions the western development region had the highest adaptive capacity although all five regions had similar aci values ranging from 0 55 to 0 63 a major limitation demonstrated in this study as well as others e g babel et al 2011 is the weak economic capacity ec in nepal the inability to invest in permanent and robust water infrastructure leads to cheap temporary solutions such as unimproved sanitation and a lack of household toilets as reflected in the water pollution parameter wp 5 discussion the index based vulnerability assessment is a flexible tool that identifies specific targets and system components that are most vulnerable to stresses and is useful for targeting water resource management decisions for improving the resiliency of socio hydrological systems critical reviews and adaptations are required to establish the most appropriate parameter settings relationships and weightings grill et al 2014 we modified and added to previous work to account for hydropower development sharma and awal 2013 and improve parameter characterization our work is the first to apply a socio hydrologic vulnerability framework for the entire country of nepal which allows for comparison of water stresses and adaptive capacities of nepalese development regions we chose to discretize our analysis using nepalese development regions because they were administrative boundaries that aligned with the resolution and availability of data we recognize the limitations associated with inferring generalized vulnerability of nepal using development boundaries however such as those described by the modifiable unit area problem maup wong 2009 nepalese development boundaries are particularly large and decreases in the spatial scales used in our vulnerability framework may highlight the variability in sub indices throughout the country however our approach is a step forward in identifying areas of concern and sub indices that should be the focus for water resource management projects e g build physical capacity build economic capacity strengthen human resource capacity the water stress index wsi results highlight the variability of water challenges in nepal and future improvements to our framework although the works of babel et al 2011 pandey et al 2010 and huang and cai 2009 provided estimates of wp and ws indices we improved these indices by including water quality data from river systems since water quality problems impact human and natural systems this addition is useful for expanding our vulnerability framework to include ecological assessments in the future we found that wv had a large negative impact on western and midwestern development regions which highlights the need for more hydrologic data collection in these regions and demonstrates the need for better parameterization of wv variables the current determination of the parameter is dependent on annual precipitation and does not include discharge data which is important for characterizing hydrologic variability more accurate assessments of water variability could be beneficial for many communities that rely on groundwater and stream diversions in the mountain and terai regions of nepal despite increasing hydropower development and financial and social resource limitations only the central development region is categorized as moderately vulnerable based on our assessment and the vulnerability index classifications presented in table 2 these results are consistent with the findings in babel et al 2011 in which the vulnerability index was close to 1 we found that our results nearly match babel et al 2011 for the central development region which contains the productive bagmati river basin but posed data challenges for the babel et al 2011 study as well in addition one identifiable vulnerability from our assessment scale was overall week economic capacity ec of the country especially in rural regions such as the far western development region a unique aspect of our framework was the incorporation of hydropower development into both the wsi and the aci to reflect hydropower impacts and benefits we found that hydropower development generally weakened system vulnerability and provided little socio hydrologic benefit the main hydrologic benefit of the hydropower development is reservoir storage capacity which dampens the effects of water resource variations and shortages one potential reason for the marginal benefit in nepal is that storage doesn t satisfy much of the water demand fig 6 compares regional water use to dam storage and reveals the minimal contribution of reservoir storage to demand however as hydropower development increases storage capacity could also increase and provide more adaptive capacity 6 conclusion in this study we advance previous vulnerability assessment methods by improving several water stress and adaptive capacity indices necessary to determine the vulnerability of socio hydrologic systems in nepal in particular we add adaptive capacity indicators for dam density and reservoir storage capacity and we modify water pollution and water scarcity sub indices our study reveals the relatively resilient state of nepal s socio hydrologic systems and are consistent with previous work in addition our study shows that the western and central development regions which are both highly populated and pressured by new hydropower development are the most water stressed but also have the highest adaptive capacities compared to other development regions in nepal we recommend that future works focuses on collecting better hydrologic data considering the economic costs of increased adaptive capacity and implementation of our vulnerability

7201,communities in regions with seasonal rainfall face annual dry seasons during which water shortages and conflicts between different water use sectors may erupt these difficulties increase following wet seasons with low rainfall such as in relation to el niño events in the wet dry tropics of central america hydrologic data are typically scarce in this region making the development of drought adaptation strategies challenging many communities in the region depend on groundwater as their primary water source for instance in the province of guanacaste in costa rica groundwater supplied 78 of the total domestic water demand in 2015 and groundwater recharge from the wet season provides the primary water supply for the subsequent dry season in this research we present a groundwater recharge indicator that can support water managers in preparing for seasonal droughts we developed this tool for an aquifer in northwestern costa rica where we conducted hydrological monitoring of streams and groundwater levels for 2 5 years obtained further hydrological data groundwater levels from 2005 to 2016 and worked with communities to assemble water use data we combined these datasets in a hydrologic model the water evaluation and planning system weap and modelled groundwater recharge from 2005 to 2016 permitting a characterization of the relationship between rainfall and groundwater recharge the groundwater recharge indicator is based on this relationship and allows estimating total groundwater recharge for a wet season from cumulative rainfall measured to date the indicator permits water managers to assess if the current year will likely fall into a low recharge category prior to the end of the wet season this information can then be used to trigger short term adaptation strategies with the goal to bank groundwater while surface water sources are still available in the wet season this indicator based tool was refined through feedback provided in local stakeholder workshops we also assessed the overall accuracy of predicting end of wet season groundwater recharge with cumulative rainfall to date and found that after the first 2 3 months of the wet season prediction accuracies are high leaving 5 6 months of wet season to respond adaptively to the prediction the indicator can help water managers to plan ahead and communicate the need for water conservation demand management and consideration of other water sources such as rain and surface water supply management this idea is transferable to other communities in regions with seasonal rainfall and can support decision makers in increasing the socio hydrological resilience of communities to seasonal droughts keywords groundwater recharge socio hydrology resilience drought wet dry tropics adaptation 1 introduction inter annual variability of seasonal rainfall and groundwater recharge can pose water challenges for communities in regions with extended dry seasons that are reliant on shallow groundwater to meet their water demand these challenges will likely increase in the future with projected increases in seasonal and inter annual rainfall variability in central america magrin et al 2014 and increasing water demands wada and bierkens 2014 seasonality of rainfall defines many climate systems around the world the pacific coast of central america is one of the hotspots of rainfall seasonality together with northeastern brazil western sub saharan and central africa northern australia and parts of southeast asia feng et al 2013 in these regions a temporal mismatch between water availability and water needs can lead to natural and technical water shortages and conflicts between different sectors i e agriculture and domestic water demand and between human and natural system needs ballestero et al 2007 kuzdas and wiek 2014 kuzdas et al 2015b in addition to the seasonal rainfall regime high inter annual rainfall variability characterizes the wet dry tropics of central america one of the main drivers for this is the el niño southern oscillation enso with lower rainfall to this region during el niño periods steyn et al 2016 waylen and laporte 1999 waylen et al 1996 this in turn can lead to increased water shortages such as during the 2014 2016 el niño event sánchez murillo et al 2016 vignola et al 2018 when about 3 5 million people were considered food insecure due to failing crops within the drier pacific coast region of central america fao 2016 with climate change increases in rainfall variability and extremes have been observed over the last decades for central america and more frequent temperature and rainfall extremes are projected for the future due to the high inter annual rainfall variability and the complex interplay of many local and global climatic forces future climate projections have high uncertainty for the region but will likely include more frequent dry conditions hidalgo et al 2013 magrin et al 2014 drought i e the temporary lack of water compared to normal conditions is a combination of both climate induced as well as human induced drought van loon et al 2016 the propagation of meteorological droughts rainfall deficits to hydrological droughts reduced water availabilities is influenced by both catchment properties as well as human actions van loon et al 2016 and in the case of the wet dry tropics of costa rica growing water demands and lack of adaptive management have increased drought conditions in the past ballestero et al 2007 kuzdas et al 2015a population growth in costa rica is projected to increase by 33 by the year 2050 relative to 2011 inec 2014 which will likely put more pressure on water resources and increase vulnerabilities of communities to drought as in many regions with seasonal rainfall regimes communities in the wet dry tropics of costa rica depend primarily on groundwater which supplied 78 of the total domestic water demand in 2015 province of guanacaste cti 2017 guzman 2015 the province of guanacaste has a history of water conflicts between different sectors such as tourism agriculture and communities kuzdas et al 2014 kuzdas and wiek 2014 between 1997 and 2015 95 water related conflicts have been reported in guanacaste esquivel hernández et al 2017 ramírez cover 2008 many of these conflicts evolved around groundwater extractions groundwater allocations between domestic tourism and agricultural sectors and weak water governance structures kuzdas et al 2015a 2014 for many communities groundwater provides the primary water source during the dry season when streamflow is low ballestero et al 2007 kuzdas et al 2015a therefore seasonal groundwater recharge during the wet season is key for replenishing aquifers jasechko et al 2014 and assuring water supply yet groundwater recharge in the tropics is strongly dependent on the intensity of rainfall during the wet season jasechko and taylor 2015 and is more pronounced in years of extreme seasonal rainfall owor et al 2009 taylor et al 2012 this in turn means that in years of low seasonal rainfall groundwater recharge tends to be lower for communities depending on renewable shallow groundwater for their livelihoods and agricultural irrigation this can lead to significant water stress as happened during the dry season following the el niño 2014 2016 event in the dry corridor of costa rica when many community wells ran dry and drought emergencies were declared vignola et al 2018 therefore groundwater has to be managed carefully to ensure water supply lasts throughout the dry season and baseflow and environmental flow needs are respected yet groundwater management is a challenge in the region due to scarce hydrological data and aquifer studies limited oversight of groundwater pumping by government agencies and inefficient water governance ballestero et al 2007 kuzdas et al 2014 vignola et al 2018 the impacts of droughts on communities depend not only on the meteorological events themselves i e the hazard but also on exposure and vulnerability of communities to these extreme events magrin et al 2014 historically central america has been considered as a region with high vulnerabilities of communities to natural disasters due to the levels of poverty and livelihood structures magrin et al 2014 agriculture is one of the most important livelihoods in central america and in particular smallholder and subsistence farmers can be severely impacted by droughts hannah et al 2017 in the wet dry tropics of costa rica most farmers use groundwater based irrigation agriculture in the dry season and rainfed or irrigation both surface water and groundwater based agriculture in the wet season inec 2015 the rural and agricultural communities depend directly on their local water resources and especially rural communities with weak water management structures often suffer the direct effects of droughts kuzdas et al 2015a in these agricultural watersheds social and hydrological processes are tightly connected and processes from one system component will affect the other coupled human water systems socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 this has to be considered when aiming to increase resilience to drought here resilience refers to the capacity of the system to absorb and adapt to recurrent disturbances without major system shifts and to develop with a changing environment folke 2006 folke et al 2016 mao et al 2017 hydrological resilience i e focusing on the response of the water subsystem to extreme events or anthropogenic impacts should not be considered separately from the social system i e social resilience to hydrological hazards but rather the combined socio hydrological resilience should be considered i e the coupled human water system mao et al 2017 to support the development of socio hydrological resilience to droughts it is crucial for scientists to integrate their research within communities and communicate scientific results to local decision makers in a way that they can directly apply and act upon our main goal in this study was to develop a tool that can support water managers to increase the resilience of their communities to seasonal drought groundwater recharge in the wet season is the key process for determining water supplies in the dry season when communities and agriculture rely on groundwater as their primary water source thus we first evaluated the relationship between seasonal rainfall and groundwater recharge for an aquifer in the wet dry tropics of costa rica next we analyzed water use groundwater versus surface water to determine potential sensitivities of the socio hydrological system to external impacts such as reduced rainfall we then combined these hydrological and social analyses to characterize the resilience properties of the system i e adaptive and absorptive capacities and determined how external drivers can lead to negative consequences for the system as well as opportunities for increasing resilience focusing on seasonal droughts following rainfall years with less than normal rainfall we then used these findings to develop a groundwater recharge indicator as a decision support tool for local water managers that could help to increase the socio hydrological resilience to droughts in regions with highly seasonal rainfall and inter annual rainfall variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study focuses on two adjacent watersheds potrero and caimital that share the same aquifer potrero caimital aquifer and are located in the province of guanacaste on the nicoya peninsula in northwestern costa rica fig 1 the surface water divide between both watersheds crosses through the relatively flat alluvial valley that is underlain by the aquifer figs 3 and 4 considering that the potrero caimital aquifer extends through both watersheds and that groundwater extractions surface water groundwater interactions and other hydrological processes will affect and be affected by processes in the two watersheds we included both watersheds in our analysis the potrero watershed comprises about 36 km2 and drains to the northeast into the grande river the caimital watershed 41 km2 drains to the southwest into the quirimán river a tributary to the nosara river the two river mainstems the potrero and caimital rivers are groundwater fed and perennial but have low baseflows during the dry season ephemeral tributaries contribute to streamflow from the hillsides during the wet season and are dry during the dry season fig 3 the province of guanacaste has a wet dry tropical climate mean annual rainfall in nicoya nearby the potrero and caimital watersheds is 2130 mm mean from 1980 to 2016 in nicoya ranging from 1310 mm to 3230 mm and is characterized by a bimodal rainfall distribution with a dry season from december to march and a wet season from april to november fig 2 the wet season is interrupted by a period of lower rainfall in july and august mid summer drought the region also experiences high inter annual variability in rainfall due to a complex interplay of local and remote climate processes one of the main drivers for this is enso with significantly lower rainfall during el niño years steyn et al 2016 the geology of the hills surrounding the valley of the potrero and caimital rivers is dominated by the nicoya complex basaltic sequence and the topography is generally characterized by slopes 10 in this zone fig 4 denyer and baumgartner 2006 loose and non consolidated sandy colluvial sediment deposits dominate along the transition zone from hills to the relatively flat valley losilla and agudelo 2003 within the valley plain slope 10 quaternary alluvial colluvial sediments overlay a layer of fractured basaltic rocks and the low permeability bedrock of the nicoya complex fig 4 the alluvial colluvial deposits consist of a top layer of 3 to 8 m of silty clay and loam above a layer of sand to gravel with clay lenses losilla and agudelo 2003 denyer et al 2013a b the potrero caimital aquifer extends through the alluvial colluvial valley zone and its lower boundary is formed by the low permeability rocks of the nicoya complex fig 4 agudelo 2006 the aquifer is unconfined to semi confined agudelo 2006 groundwater recharge to the potrero caimital aquifer consists of both diffuse direct recharge from infiltration and percolation through the soil layer and focused indirect recharge from downward movement from surface water to the aquifer agudelo 2006 land use in the two watersheds includes forest 52 pasture 38 agricultural 8 as well as residential 2 fig 3 based on a 2010 land use classification by garcia serrano 2015 most agricultural fields are double cropped rainfed rice during the wet season and groundwater irrigated melons during the dry season whereas on some fields rice is planted during the wet season and fields lie fallow in the dry season the potrero and caimital watersheds provide domestic water supply for many communities in the nicoya region domestic water demand in the studied watersheds includes small rural villages located within the watersheds total population of 3823 in 2014 data obtained from ministerio de salud in nicoya furthermore water is transferred via pipelines to the nearby towns of nicoya 24 833 inhabitants district of nicoya inec 2011 and hojancha 4245 inhabitants district of hojancha inec 2011 fig 3 groundwater use dominates although the town of nicoya has a water treatment plant for surface water intake from the potrero river groundwater based irrigation agriculture during the dry season is another important water demand 2 2 hydrological monitoring network limited hydrological data were available for the potrero and caimital watersheds and in particular no continuous streamflow data existed therefore a first step in our project was to install a hydrological monitoring network within the potrero and caimital watersheds that included five stream and three groundwater level stations hund et al 2016 we monitored water levels at 10 minute intervals for 2 5 years from june 2014 to december 2016 discharge measurements were made using the salt solution slug injection method moore 2005 to develop stage discharge rating curves we also installed an eddy covariance ec equipped monitoring station at a melon rice farm located at the watershed divide between the two studied watersheds within the alluvial valley fig 3 this ec monitoring station includes a sonic anemometer and a li cor open path ec system to monitor actual evapotranspiration a vaisala wxt520 weather transmitter to monitor rainfall air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction and air pressure and additional soil and radiation sensors with continuous data recorded in 30 minute intervals from july 2014 within the same farm only 600 m away from our ec monitoring station is a davies weatherlink weather station operated by the farm owners and davies instruments recording hourly values of rainfall air temperature relative humidity air pressure available since 2007 and short wave solar radiation available since 2014 rainfall data from the weatherlink station were used to gap fill the rainfall records from our ec monitoring station during occasional data outages between july 2014 to december 2016 11 of rainfall data were gapfilled this way 2 3 hydrological modelling we developed a hydrological model of the two watersheds using the water evaluation and planning system weap yates et al 2005 weap is a physically based semi distributed model based on the water balance approach and includes a rainfall runoff routine surface water and groundwater storage furthermore it allows hydrological system components to be combined with aspects of the social system such as water use from surface and groundwater sources and representation of irrigation practices the modelled river reaches were the main stems of the potrero and the caimital rivers and their main tributaries these reaches traverse the alluvial valley underlain by the potrero caimital aquifer i e surface water groundwater interaction can occur both focused recharge through infiltration from the river bed and diffuse recharge through percolation through the soil were modelled evapotranspiration from river reaches was assumed at 2 5 of daily streamflow based on a study on riparian evapotranspiration for tropical headwatersheds in costa rica cadol et al 2012 2 3 1 sub catchment delineation watershed processes such as rainfall runoff evapotranspiration and diffuse groundwater recharge are modelled through the catchment routines in the weap model a watershed is divided into sub catchments scs and for every time step in the model a water balance with outflows from and storage changes within the sc is calculated outflows from a sc can be routed to rivers or aquifers each sc is fractionally divided into several classes or hydrological response units hrus hrus represent an area of similar characteristics such as land use soil type or slope for which it can be assumed that the hydrologic response to rainfall in regards to runoff generation groundwater recharge or evapotranspiration would be similar we used the following criteria to guide the delimitation of scs within the model 1 the upslope areas of the monitoring sites 2 the sub catchments of the tributaries to allow routing of tributary runoff into the main stems of the potrero and caimital and 3 the connection of scs to the aquifer to allow modelling diffuse groundwater recharge fig 5 criteria one and two were based on a digital elevation model dem we used the hydrosheds 3 s dem that for the region has an approximately 90 m spatial resolution lehner et al 2008 we hydrologically conditioned the dem with a detailed local stream layer obtained from the area conservación tempisque and delimited the scs using the open source programs whitebox gat lindsay 2016 saga gis and the saga plug in in qgis conrad et al 2015 olaya 2004 qgis development team 2017 next each sub catchment was divided into hrus or fractional areas that were assumed to respond hydrologically similar to a rainfall event the first criterion for the hru definition was land cover which was based on a land use map delineated from satellite imagery from digital globe esri date december 28 2010 with a 5 m resolution and was developed in support with field visits by garcia serrano 2015 we simplified the land use classifications into the main categories of forest pasture residential agriculture rice only and agriculture rice and melons which is a double cropping system of the two crops grown sequentially during a single 12 month period the separation into the rice and melon categories in the agriculture classification accounts for the fact that rainfed rice is grown on a larger area than groundwater irrigated melons and that part of the rice fields wet season lie fallow during the melon season dry season with consequences for evapotranspiration and irrigation to assess potential changes in land use between the start of the modelling period 2005 and the end of the modelling period 2016 we conducted a land use change analysis using qgis and google earth specifically we digitized land use from google earth imagery from march 2005 and february 2016 and compared it to the 2010 land use map for the extent of the watersheds from 2005 to 2010 we found that forest cover increased by approximately 1 pasture cover decreased by 3 agriculture cover did not change and residential coverage increased by 15 which represented less than 0 4 of the total watershed area from 2010 to 2016 forest coverage increased by 6 pasture decreased by 6 and agriculture and residential increased by 5 and 1 respectively overall all land use changes between 2005 and 2016 affected less than 4 of the total watershed area considering this low percentages of land use change found and the limitations of this analysis due to the lack of high resolution imagery we assumed for hydrological modelling purposes that the land use of the studied watersheds was adequately described by the mid point 2010 land use map and was treated as constant throughout the modelling period from 2005 to 2016 the second criterion for hru definition was soil and geology which was based on the three geological categories basalt colluvial and alluvial material this simplification into three categories was based on available soil and geology data for which no more detailed spatial data existed land cover within the basalt zone was dominated by pasture and forest and no residential or agricultural classes were present slope was the third hru criterion it was determined based on the hydrosheds dem aggregated into four slope classes the alluvial colluvial valley zone was mostly flat 0 to 10 slope the basalt zone was generally steeper than the alluvial colluvial valley zone and all four slope classes 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 80 were represented within the hrus of this zone within a sc of the basalt zone there could therefore be eight different fractional areas hru and within a sc of the alluvial colluvial zone connected to aquifer there could be ten different fractional areas considering limited data availability and modelling capacities we assumed that an hru with the same characteristics in one sc was characterized by the same soil parameters as the same hru in another sc 2 3 2 rainfall runoff modelling the rainfall runoff response in a sc can be modelled by different routines within the weap model we used the soil moisture module that allows modelling surface runoff processes by representing each sub catchment with two soil layers sieber and purkey 2015 yates et al 2005 if the sc is connected to an aquifer as the studied one is the second soil layer is replaced by the aquifer layer for each fractional area hru in a sc a water balance is computed at each time step change in soil moisture in the upper soil layer is determined by antecedent soil moisture input through rainfall and loss through evapotranspiration surface runoff interflow and percolation to the lower soil layer or aquifer surface runoff and interflow contribute to streamflow while percolation through the upper soil layer provides diffuse recharge to the underlying aquifer if a stream is hydrologically connected to an aquifer the aquifer provides baseflow to the stream and on the other hand the stream can contribute focused recharge to the aquifer depending on conditions more details on groundwater surface water interaction are described in the groundwater section for the model soil parameter available water holding capacity we used reported values from in situ measurements conducted in the watersheds garcia serrano 2015 soil hydraulic conductivities were used as a calibration parameters as only infiltration capacities at the root zone existed as field measurements and these did not reflect the modelled soil zone which extended between 2 and 10 m in depth soil depth within the alluvial zone was based on lithology profiles of 29 wells available from the national groundwater irrigation and drainage agency of costa rica servicio nacional de aguas subterráneas riego y avenamiento senara no soil depth data existed for the basalt and colluvial zone and these were used as calibration parameters the runoff resistance factor rrf is related to aspects such as slope and leaf area index lai or land use land cover higher values of the rrf lead to less surface runoff higher resistance whereas lower values lead to higher surface runoff and it is usually used as a calibration parameter sieber and purkey 2015 however lai and surface resistance will change over the course of a year in particular in a region like the wet dry tropics where greening up of vegetation and senescence are so pronounced therefore we used lai data to estimate the intra annual variability of the rrf we used the modis lai product modis 15a2 leaf area index and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar 8 day composite modis collection 5 land product for the period 2000 02 18 to 2017 01 01 ornl daac 2008a in order to capture the long term annual seasonality of lai for each land use type forest pasture or agriculture we first assigned a modis lai value to each land use type and then estimated a mean value of modis lai for each day of the year for the period 2000 2016 to relate lai to different land covers modis cells with a high fraction cover fraction cover 89 for forest and pasture 50 for agriculture of one single land use forest pasture or agriculture were selected and mean lai was calculated from all pixels of the same dominant land use next we estimated the 2000 2016 mean value of each 8 day period of the year reported by modis for each land use type then 8 day mean values were linearly interpolated to obtain a daily time series of lai per land use type for the period 2000 2016 annual means of lai per land use type were also calculated for each land use type daily rrf values were expressed in the weap model as the annual mean lai per land use plus or minus the daily variation of lai from the annual mean this allowed us to use the annual mean for the three land use types as a calibration parameter and change this value according to calibration while maintaining seasonal variability the rrf was assumed constant over time for the residential land cover type rrf values were also differentiated between the four slope classes from the hydrosheds dem with initial values adjusted during calibration the preferred flow direction pfd parameter also required for the weap model is a partitioning coefficient related to soil land cover and topography that fractionally partitions between vertical and horizontal flows and was also adjusted during model calibration we ran the model at a daily time step from 2005 to 2016 the time period for when water use records groundwater levels as well as meteorological data were available monthly values of water table depth were obtained from monthly manual measurements recorded by the national groundwater irrigation and drainage agency of costa rica servicio nacional de aguas subterráneas riego y avenamiento senara for 26 wells from june 2015 to september 2015 for 6 wells starting in june 2005 for 2 wells starting in october 2005 for 13 wells starting in june 2012 and another 5 wells starting in july 2012 climate was assumed to be uniform over the two adjacent and relatively small watersheds historical daily precipitation data were obtained from the national meteorological institute of costa rica instituto meteorológico nacional imn for nicoya from january 2005 until june 2014 to run the model daily precipitation data measured at our ec monitoring station were used for the modelling period from july 2014 to december 2016 2 3 3 evapotranspiration modelling evapotranspiration et is estimated by weap applying the crop coefficient method doorenbos and pruitt 1977 this way evapotranspiration from each hru within a sub catchment is estimated as the product of a crop coefficient kc that incorporates land cover characteristics and water requirements and a reference evapotranspiration etref that represents atmospheric water demand based on meteorological conditions the daily etref is calculated by weap using the penman monteith equation modified for a standardized crop of grass shuttleworth 1993 equation 4 2 31 with the input variables including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and cloudiness fraction to estimate etref for the modelling period from 2005 to 2016 a combination of different meteorological datasets had to be used best quality measurements of air temperature relative humidity and wind speed data were available from the ec monitoring station for the duration of the calibration period from 2014 07 04 to 2016 12 31 for the early period from 2005 to 2007 no meteorological data were available from meteorological stations in the region therefore we used climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr air temperature relative humidity and wind speed data saha et al 2010 dee et al 2014 for this period from february 2007 to september 2012 weatherlink station data for location see fig 3 were available for air temperature and relative humidity and the cfsr wind speed data were used cfsr data were also used from september 2012 to the start of our own monitoring in july 2014 cloudiness fraction was another necessary input to estimate etref in the weap model this variable describes the number of bright sunshine hours per day over the total hours of daylight and we estimated it based on total incoming short wave solar radiation available from the weatherlink station from 07 2014 to 12 2016 and from the cfsr dataset for the earlier time period modelled extraterrestrial solar radiation and the angstrom coefficients shuttleworth 1993 equation 4 2 14 we estimated the angstrom coefficients based on the maximum and minimum of the ratio of the measured incoming short wave radiation and the extra terrestrial radiation during that period as 0 05 bs 0 7 the crop coefficient kc represents the ratio between actual et and etref of each land class type five main land use types exist within the potrero and caimital watersheds forest pasture melon crops rice crops and residential mean kc values for each day of year were estimated for melon and rice crops from et values measured in the ec monitoring station at the melon rice farm and estimated etref as calculated by weap using the penman monteith equation but no et measurements were available for the other land use types the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations provides kc estimates for pasture allen et al 1998 but these values were developed for the northern hemisphere and do not reflect the strong seasonal behavior of the wet dry tropics and further no kc estimates were available for seasonally dry forest in the literature therefore we estimated kc for the non crop land use types using the modis evapotranspiration product mod16 modis 16a2 terra evapotranspiration 8 day 1000 m spatial resolution ornl daac 2008b to relate modis et to different land use types within the potrero caimital watersheds similarly to the lai analysis we selected modis pixels that were dominated by one land use type fraction cover 89 for pasture and forest according to the senara land use classification from 2010 and under the assumption that land use change throughout the study period was minimal et values were extracted for each selected homogeneous land use modis pixel and mean values of all homogeneous pixels for each land use type were calculated for each 8 day period from 2005 to 2014 mod16 was not available for 2015 and 2016 at the time of the weap model calibration daily et values were extrapolated from the 8 day period modis et obtained for each land use daily kc values for the period 2005 to 2014 were then calculated as the ratio between the daily extrapolated modis et for each land use type and estimated daily etref as calculated by weap using the penman monteith equation shuttleworth 1993 equation 4 2 31 to generate a daily kc value to be used for every year of the modelling period considering that not all years had available modis et data we calculated a long term mean value of daily kc for each land use type for each day of year based on the daily kc series from the period 2005 to 2014 for fields where only rice was planted in the wet season and fields lay fallow during the dry season kc values derived from measured et were used during the rice growing season wet season and kc values obtained from modis et for pasture land use type were used for the dry season we used these kc values as starting point for our analysis but we found that the weap model underestimated daily et for the three main cover types agriculture forest and pasture relatively to measured values from the ec monitoring station and modis et we found this underestimation of et was due to an oversimplification of the soil water content dynamics by the model which in turn determines soil water available for evapotranspiration based on the atmospheric water demand etref and the land cover characteristic kc weap uses only one soil layer if the sub catchment is connected to an aquifer this layer has to represent the entire vadose zone which in the potrero and caimital watersheds ranged between 2 and 10 m in depth this oversimplification of the soil layer resulted in a systematic underestimation of the soil water content of the root zone and reduction of et values to account for this we rescaled the initial kc values using a constant scaling factor the scaling factor was estimated for each land use type by optimization so that the error of the annual modelled evapotranspiration was minimized in comparison to the empirical evapotranspiration measurements from the ec monitoring station for agriculture and from modis for forest and pasture 2 3 4 groundwater modelling the potrero caimital aquifer extends through the alluvial colluvial zone fig 4 and therefore sub catchments sc in this zone were connected to an aquifer module in the weap model the lower soil layer of the hill zone nicoya complex contributes to baseflows of the streams and tributaries the potrero caimital aquifer was presented as one aquifer storage unit within the weap model the model allows modelling of both diffuse and focused groundwater recharge diffuse recharge is modelled through the catchment routine soil moisture module where downwards percolation through the upper soil layer of each hru enters the aquifer if the sc is connected to an aquifer such as in the alluvial colluvial zone focused recharge is modelled through the surface water groundwater interaction routine in the weap model it is possible to dynamically link river reaches to an alluvial aquifer which was done for all modelled stream reaches within the alluvial colluvial zone that are underlain by the potrero caimital aquifer stream reaches can gain water from the aquifer gaining stream or contribute focused recharge to the aquifer losing stream depending on the level of groundwater in the aquifer sieber and purkey 2015 surface water groundwater interactions are modelled through a stylized groundwater wedge that is connected along to the length of the river reach sieber and purkey 2015 if aquifer levels rise higher than level of equilibrium with the stream seepage occurs from the aquifer to the stream and vice versa if stream water levels rise seepage occurs from stream to aquifer aquifer characteristics such as specific yield and saturated hydraulic conductivity were based on values reported by the costa rican groundwater agency senara garcia serrano 2015 losilla and agudelo 2003 while parameters related to modelling surface water groundwater interaction were used as calibration parameters these parameters included wetted depth in river groundwater storage at equilibrium with the river and horizontal distance from farthest edge of aquifer to river previous authors conducted five pumping tests to estimate the specific yield of the studied aquifer and found that it varied between 0 0007 and 0 008 with a mean of 0 002 losilla and agudelo 2003 they estimated the total storage volume of the aquifer as 40 mm3 assuming an area of 20 km2 a mean aquifer thickness of 20 m and a mean specific yield of 0 002 transmissivity measurements based on pumping tests existed for 49 locations within the study area and varied between 37 2824 m2 day within the alluvial colluvial layer and between 5 6 28 6 m2 day within the fractured basalt layer garcia serrano 2015 losilla and agudelo 2003 reported values of saturated hydraulic conductivities determined based on the transmissivity measurements and aquifer thickness varied between 4 5 and 95 m day with a mean of approximately 26 m day garcia serrano 2015 losilla and agudelo 2003 considering uncertainties and limited details available regarding the hydraulic conductivities and the specific yield we explored a range of values during the calibration process but found that ultimately the reported values represented the aquifer conditions best and adopted these for our modelling 2 3 5 water demand modelling the potrero and caimital watersheds are the key water supply sources for the domestic water demand of many communities in the region water demand is modelled explicitly in weap allowing integration of social aspects of the socio hydrologic system into hydrologic modelling total water demand is disaggregated into demand sites that differ in their end use in their distribution system water supply type or water allocation preference domestic water demand in the potrero and caimital watersheds includes both rural villages located within the watersheds as well as water transfers via pipelines to the towns of nicoya and hojancha located outside the watersheds rural water boards las asociaciones administradoras de los sistemas de acueductos y alcantarillados asadas manage the water distribution from a well in each of the rural villages the national water agency aya instituto costarricense de acueductos y alcantarillados in nicoya and hojancha manages the water transfer from wells in the potrero caimital aquifer to both towns as well as from a withdrawal site for a surface water treatment plant at the potrero river to nicoya most rural households also have their own artisanal well or surface water pump that supplements the water received from the asada distribution system with this supplemental water typically used for laundry and outdoor water uses based on this context to model surface water and groundwater demand from the studied watersheds we accounted for artisanal pumping per household domestic water use per household from rural villages supplied by asada s water extractions managed by aya for water supply to nicoya and hojancha groundwater extractions for irrigation of melon crops and water use for cattle ranching as detailed below population was estimated annually for years 2001 2004 and 2011 based on census data inec 2011 2001 morataya montenegro 2004 and more recent 2014 data that we had obtained from the ministerio de salud in nicoya to interpolate population data between years and extrapolate to 2016 we calculated the annual geometric growth rate for each town ranging from 1 to 7 mean 4 overall the population within the studied watersheds including nicoya and hojancha increased from 29 136 in 2005 to 35 435 in 2016 we estimated the water demand from household pumping based on pumping records at one of our monitoring stations that is located in an artisanal well to our knowledge no other data are available for this type of water use for the rural villages water use data from rural water boards asadas on a household level were only available for the village of caimital from 2012 to 2015 which we had digitized from water bills so we had to assume that the other rural towns had the same per person annual water use than caimital considering that we had both population data and total water use data for caimital from 2014 we assumed the annual water use rate per person from 2014 for all years where no other water use data were available for nicoya and hojancha we obtained water extraction data from the aya in nicoya including information on water sources i e surface water groundwater based on our analysis of the aya extraction data we found that between 2005 and 2016 nicoya used annually between 49 73 groundwater and 27 51 surface water while hojancha used only groundwater to meet their water demands agricultural groundwater based irrigation per hectare was available from one of the main melon farms in the watersheds and we assumed the same water use per hectare for other melon farms cattle pastures are another important land use in the watersheds and we estimated water use for cattle based on the mean number of cattle per hectare in the region inec 2015 and estimated drinking water use per cattle 35 5 l day ayantunde et al 2002 all water operators with a water extraction site well or surface water extraction have to apply for a license at the dirección de agua from the ministerio de ambiente y energia minae these licenses contain information on location operator name water source allowed pumping rates and type of use most of the water operators with a water license are the asadas the aya and the big melon rice farms and were therefore already included in our model for all the other operators we added the water demand indicated in the license to the model while the water licenses provide some indication on water extractions only pumping rates are reported in the license thus it is unclear how many hours an operator might be pumping and what total water volume was extracted further unregistered unlicensed wells also exist in the area therefore real water extractions are likely higher than is reported through the water licenses the water use estimates for this study were however mostly based on monthly extracted volumes documented by the water utility and agricultural companies or estimated based on land use such as ranching i e not based on water licenses alone 2 3 6 model calibration and evaluation we calibrated the model using the streamflow data monitored during the time period from 2014 07 to 2016 12 which contained both drier and wetter years 2015 and 2016 respectively we used a combination of manual sensitivity analysis and calibration and an optimization algorithm the parameter estimation pest algorithm incorporated in weap to determine the parameter set of best fit doherty 2015 sieber and purkey 2015 we then evaluated the model results by comparing measured and modelled streamflow goodness of fit measures including nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 pearson correlation coefficient coefficient of determination and rsr the ratio of the root mean square error over the standard deviation moriasi et al 2007 were calculated for observed and modelled streamflow zambrano bigiarini 2017 and are given in table 1 some of the model uncertainties were due to the challenge of capturing the flashy high streamflows following intensive rainfall events that often occurred within an hourly time scale with a daily model and when model results tended to underestimate the very high flows other uncertainties are due to spatial simplification available input data limitations in both spatial distribution and quality uncertainties associated with the discharge rating curves and estimates of water use where in many cases no detailed data were available for the region 2 4 groundwater recharge indicator development total groundwater recharge to the potrero caimital aquifer was calculated as the sum of modelled recharge from sub catchments diffuse recharge and from surface water focused recharge for each year of the modelling period from 2005 to 2016 to explore the relation between rainfall and groundwater recharge we fit a linear regression model to total annual rainfall and total annual groundwater recharge for comparison to modelled recharge we also attempted to estimate groundwater recharge empirically using the groundwater level fluctuation method as well as by residual of the water budget however due to too many missing components and uncertainties of the empirical data for instance groundwater levels influenced by pumping uncertainties of baseflow neither method could be applied successfully next we calculated the cumulative rainfall and cumulative modelled groundwater recharge throughout each year based on daily data and used this relationship to develop a groundwater recharge indicator here we calculated the 0 25 45 55 75 and 100 percentiles for each day of year based on the daily distribution of the 12 years of the modelling period for both cumulative rainfall and cumulative groundwater recharge based on the percentiles we determined five categories 0 to 25 25 to 45 45 to 55 55 to 75 and 75 100 to quantify how well groundwater recharge can be predicted based on cumulative rainfall throughout the wet season we calculated confusion matrices kuhn 2008 for each day of year for each of the five percentile categories confusion matrices 1 count the number of times that a predicted value matches the true value and 2 report the number of true positives false positives type i error false negatives type ii error and true negatives for each day of year we determined the percentile category into which the cumulative rainfall fell from this we predicted the percentile category into which the cumulative groundwater recharge would be expected to fall at the end of the year predicted category the percentile category of the cumulative groundwater recharge at the end of the year represented the true category we calculated a confusion matrix for each day of the year for each of the 12 years of our modelling period and extracted the overall accuracy we then used locally weighted smoothing wickham 2009 to show the pattern of the overall accuracy throughout the wet season and fit the curve through the origin after the first month of the wet season 3 results and discussion 3 1 water use water extractions from the potrero and caimital watersheds increased by 26 between 2005 and 2016 table 2 this was primarily driven by a fast growing population with annual population growth rates between 1 and 7 mean 4 while land use stayed relatively constant population is expected to continue to grow with a total growth of 23 by 2025 relative to the last census from 2011 for the province of guanacaste and specifically with a 13 increase for the district of nicoya and a 9 increase for the district of hojancha inec 2014a by 2050 a total increase in population by 33 is expected for all of costa rica relative to the 2011 census inec 2014b this indicates increasing pressures on water resources from anthropogenic extractions if water management practices are not adapted according to our study dominant water extractions from the potrero and caimital watersheds are for domestic purposes 94 4 of total extractions in 2016 whereas water extractions for agricultural irrigation 3 9 and cattle ranching 1 7 are lower due to both high land use coverage of forest 52 of total land and seasonal irrigation only during dry season further 69 of total domestic extractions in 2016 were for water transfers to the towns of nicoya and hojancha that are not located within the potrero and caimital watersheds current water use practices focus dominantly on groundwater pumping over surface water use and groundwater pumping has increased by 53 from 2005 to 2016 while surface water use has decreased significantly both in absolute terms as well as in terms of the fraction of total water use table 2 3 2 observed groundwater levels observed groundwater levels in the potrero caimital aquifer fluctuated seasonally as illustrated in the long term record 2005 2015 for well x29 fig 6 a see fig 3 for well location data obtained from senara groundwater levels rose in response to recharge during the wet season and declined during the dry season due to groundwater discharge to streams as baseflow and pumping with an overall range of annual variation of approximately 6 m fig 6 similar seasonal groundwater level fluctuations have been shown for the nimboyores aquifer an alluvial aquifer that is also located within the wet dry tropics of guanacaste garcía and arellano 2012 and these seasonal fluctuations may be a typical feature of alluvial aquifers in this region 3 3 simulated groundwater recharge over the modelled time period from 2005 to 2016 high seasonal rainfall resulted in high seasonal groundwater recharge with a range between 98 mm year and 252 mm year fig 7 a total annual rainfall measured and total groundwater recharge simulated had a significant linear relationship r 2 0 97 p 0 001 fig 7b the percentage of total annual groundwater recharge to total annual rainfall stayed relatively constant for both low and high total annual rainfalls at 7 to 8 in contrast the percentage of total annual streamflow to total annual rainfall increased from 34 to 50 from low to high annual rainfalls suggesting the increased generation of overland flow during high intensity rainfall events overland flow runoff was also evident by high sediment loading in rivers after intensive rainfall events as was observed in the field similar to other tropical aquifers jasechko and taylor 2015 mileham et al 2009 owor et al 2009 sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 taylor et al 2012 intensive seasonal rainfall is important for recharging the potrero caimital aquifer sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 showed the importance of the intensive rainfalls of the second wet season peak in september and october for groundwater recharge for aquifers in the wet dry tropics of costa rica pacific lowlands this is reflected in the increased groundwater recharge that we found for the potrero caimital aquifer in years of high annual rainfall in which monthly rainfall is typically highest during the fall months second peak of the wet season steyn et al 2016 similarly jasechko and taylor 2015 showed that intensive monthly rainfalls contributed disproportionately to groundwater recharge for 14 tropical aquifers across different continents while owor et al 2009 showed that the sum of daily rainfall events and groundwater recharge were linearly related for an aquifer in uganda with better coefficients of determination when only considering daily rainfall events larger than 10 mm a good linear correlation between rainfall and groundwater recharge is not always found studies from large aquifers in east africa mileham et al 2009 taylor et al 2012 found a non linear relation between rainfall and groundwater recharge where episodic recharge events resulting from abnormally high seasonal rainfall interrupted multiannual groundwater level declines taylor et al 2012 in contrast to the majority of the aquifers mentioned above the potrero caimital is a fairly small aquifer with a dominance of clayey loamy soils where flashy surface runoff is the dominant response to intensive rainfall events which helps to explain the good agreement found between annual rainfall and groundwater recharge it is important to remember that the groundwater recharge estimates carry some uncertainty due to modelling assumptions and available input data for instance the definition of the hrus and related simplifications regarding land use and soil may impact modelled diffuse recharge for example toohey et al 2018 showed that soil hydraulic conductivity and percolation was higher at a forest site than at a pasture site for a watershed in the wet tropics in costa rica also the simplified representation of surface water groundwater interactions in the model may have introduced some uncertainties genereux and jordan 2006 showed the importance of groundwater contributions to streams for lowland tropical rainforest watersheds in the wet tropics in costa rica in this case however driven by high interbasin groundwater flow 3 4 socio hydrological resilience increasing water use and seasonal fluctuations of groundwater levels have led to water shortages in the dominantly groundwater dependent communities of the studied region thus droughts and water conflicts often manifest themselves in dry seasons following wet seasons with lower than normal rainfall as occurs in relation to el niño events in western central america the current socio hydrological system is not resilient to these external impacts from reduced rainfall fig 8 left and communities and ecosystems experience socio hydrological drought as a consequence to move towards a more drought resilient system we must first define what socio hydrological resilience means in the context of seasonal droughts in this system conceptualized in fig 8 resilience or the capacity of a system to absorb disturbances without significant challenges to its functioning or structures is composed of absorptive adaptive and transformative capacities mao et al 2017 miller et al 2010 here absorptive capacities refer to system components that can help to lessen impacts of an external event such as reduced rainfall and reduce consequences for both social and hydrological sub systems adaptive capacities are the ability of system components to respond to a disturbance again with the goal of reduced impacts we recognize that what we are defining here as external impacts for this analysis i e rainfall variability is in fact not external to the socio hydrological system as human caused climate change magrin et al 2014 and land use change with related changes in evapotranspiration and precipitation recycling ellison et al 2012 influence the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall in the studied non resilient system reduced rainfall i e a meteorological drought leads to reduced groundwater recharge such that many wells become dry and groundwater extraction becomes insufficient to meet the needs of the rural communities the adaptive capacity of the social sub system is low as there is no direct response in the form of differential water management activities or restrictions due to reduced recharge groundwater pumping continues at high rates until groundwater levels drop below the depth of many wells and water shortages begin to impact rural communities as well as ecosystems absorptive capacities are also low as communities rely mostly on the single resource of groundwater and are not using other water supplies which could help to dampen the shock of reduced groundwater levels while annual renewal rates of the aquifer are relatively high mean of 13 for an estimated total aquifer storage of about 40 mm3 current borehole depths often do not reach lower groundwater levels leading to technical water shortages in contrast in a more resilient system fig 8 right communities would respond adaptively to reduced groundwater recharge during a wet season with reduced rainfall and decrease their groundwater pumping as one measure to lessen impacts on groundwater storage for the subsequent dry season the hydrological sub system one of the barriers to this is information i e that communities become aware of pending challenges early enough to adapt their behavior for wet dry tropical systems the main impacts from reduced rainfall in the wet season i e meteorological droughts often occur later in the following dry season this delay provides an opportunity to make the system more resilient to oncoming impacts an adaptive response and increased absorptive capacity of the system can help to make the socio hydrological system more resilient towards reduced rainfall and seasonal droughts for example once it becomes apparent that total recharge is likely to be lower than normal for a given wet season there is the potential to shift to other water sources such as rainwater harvesting or increased surface water use during the remaining wet season this also increases the absorptive capacity of communities by reducing reliance on groundwater further adaptive responses could include reducing water permits for irrigation of dry season crops after wet seasons with low recharge and improving agricultural soil and water management considering the relatively high total storage volume of the potrero caimital aquifer and groundwater reserves there may also be some buffer capacity for droughts deepening well screen depths of boreholes could reduce technical water shortages and increase resilience to drought however it is a more expensive approach that could lead to equity issues as drilling of deeper boreholes may be restricted to communities or individuals with more financial capacities additionally extracting deeper groundwater may lead to extractions above the sustainable yield of the aquifer i e above the withdrawal rate at which no adverse impacts on ecosystems land subsidence or other aspects of the hydrologic system occur healy 2010 and it could lead to a long term decrease in groundwater levels 3 5 groundwater recharge indicator the key for making the socio hydrological system more resilient to droughts is to increase both absorptive and adaptive capacities absorptive capacities can include more long term strategies such as diversifying water sources from pre dominantly groundwater use adaptive responses need to be made in time for them to be effective in the wet dry tropical climate where drought impacts often occur as a delayed response to the highly variable external driver of reduced rainfall for this adequate information is needed for local decision makers to both assess the situation in time and also to communicate to the general public the need for adaptive response such as water restrictions to address this need we developed an indicator based tool that allows local decision makers to assess the likely status of groundwater reserves in order to provide a framework to react adaptively before major impacts of drought hit one of the main challenges of groundwater is that it is often poorly monitored and inadequately managed as it is less visible than surface water famiglietti 2014 on the other hand rainfall is monitored at least sparingly in most countries of the wet dry tropics and most decision makers have access to rainfall data through their national meteorological institutes we used the strong relation between rainfall and groundwater recharge fig 7 to develop a groundwater recharge indicator fig 9 that represents a cumulative rainfall and b cumulative groundwater recharge over the wet season the 12 years of the modelling period represented a wide range of wet and dry conditions from 1310 mm to 3235 mm for total rainfall and from 98 mm to 252 mm for total groundwater recharge for each day of year we determined the daily distribution of cumulative rainfall and groundwater recharge which were then placed into five percentile categories of rainfall and groundwater recharge respectively very high dark blue high light blue medium yellow low orange very low red the trajectories of cumulative rainfall and groundwater recharge for each year showed that after some variability at the beginning of the wet season they tended to stay within one category for the remainder of the wet season to use this indicator tool one determines the cumulative rainfall to date e g august 1 in fig 9a and the corresponding percentile category this percentile category is then directly related to the projected groundwater recharge category for the same date to determine the projected cumulative recharge fig 9b to explore the validity of this indicator we assessed the overall accuracy of the projected end of year groundwater recharge category estimated from the day of year rainfall category using confusion matrices fig 10 by the end of may to the end of june the accuracy of the projection is high 75 accuracy in most cases in particular for drought projections for high light blue and very high dark blue categories overall accuracy lessens somewhat in july and august which coincides with the timing of the mid summer drought it is important to remember that any model is an abstract and simplified representation of reality beven 2012 and as such there are uncertainties associated with its predictions uncertainties within the modelling can be caused by uncertainties in field measurements such as streamflow and soil measurements in model assumptions and model procedures this should be kept in mind when using the groundwater recharge indicator we tried to limit uncertainties by using the five broad categories of the percentile classes instead of trying to project exact groundwater recharge numbers when using the groundwater recharge indicator it is important to assess cumulative groundwater recharge early on during the wet season i e while it is still raining and there is still water available and not to wait until the end of the wet season when adaptive responses are limited and negative impacts to groundwater storage may already have occurred should the groundwater recharge indicator point to low or very low groundwater recharge immediate actions should be initiated with the overall goal to bank groundwater for the next dry season when it is the only water supply available to this end overall water use can be reduced rainwater can be harvested during the wet season and since high percentages of rainfall leave the watersheds as streamflow during the wet season increased use of surface water during the wet season could reduce the overall impact on groundwater surface water cannot be used much during the dry season as baseflows are low and it would have negative impacts on ecosystems furthermore water managers need to be aware that net recharge at the end of the wet season is likely much lower than total recharge as groundwater pumping and groundwater contributions to baseflow continue throughout the wet season for instance for the modelling period from 2005 to 2016 total annual baseflow from the potrero caimital aquifer to the potrero and caimital rivers and tributaries ranged from 54 to 190 mm between 55 and 85 of annual recharge the groundwater recharge indicator can allow water managers to plan ahead and make informed decisions and importantly to communicate the need for adaptive responses to the public it should be used as a tool for a short term within a wet season adaptive response to rainfall and be integrated within a set of more long term water management strategies that account for increasing water extractions land use change and climate change long term strategies can also help to increase the absorptive capacities of the system and ease the adaptive response to low groundwater recharge predictions while rainfall and climate forecasts are available in the region so far limited translation to consequences on water supplies has been made even though many water managers farmers and general public members identified this as an important need babcock et al 2016 we presented the groundwater recharge indicator during stakeholder workshops in november 2017 in nicoya guanacaste costa rica where it was well received and we refined the tool through the feedback provided in these workshops the concept of the groundwater recharge indicator is potentially adaptable to many regions around the world though it is particularly relevant to regions that experience high rainfall seasonality where a temporal lag between water availability and water needs necessitates an early adaptive response during the wet season to prepare for the following dry season to adapt the groundwater recharge indicator concept to another aquifer groundwater recharge would need to be measured or modelled and the local relationship with cumulative rainfall determined importantly the length of the time series available will impact the robustness of the indictor 4 conclusions communities in regions with seasonal rainfall face a temporal lag between water availabilities and needs this often leads to water shortages and water scarcity during long dry seasons most seasonally dry regions depend on groundwater as their primary water source during the dry season however if not carefully managed groundwater recharge during the wet season may be insufficient to meet water demand during the subsequent dry season in this study we developed a groundwater recharge indicator for an aquifer in the wet dry tropics of costa rica in order to provide a tool that can help communities prepare in a timely manner for dry seasons following wet seasons with low rainfall the tool allows early prediction of the likely groundwater recharge at the end of the wet season based on accumulated seasonal rainfall to date this tool will allow water managers to assess the likely state of groundwater during the wet season when water is still available and implement adaptive responses to low groundwater recharge such as using rain and surface water supply management or water conservation demand management to bank groundwater for the dry season when it is the only water supply this idea can be applicable to other groundwater dependent communities in regions with seasonal rainfall regimes the tool provides a way to communicate scientific results to decision makers to support them in increasing the socio hydrological resilience of their communities to seasonal droughts acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge financial support for this research through the canadian natural

7201,communities in regions with seasonal rainfall face annual dry seasons during which water shortages and conflicts between different water use sectors may erupt these difficulties increase following wet seasons with low rainfall such as in relation to el niño events in the wet dry tropics of central america hydrologic data are typically scarce in this region making the development of drought adaptation strategies challenging many communities in the region depend on groundwater as their primary water source for instance in the province of guanacaste in costa rica groundwater supplied 78 of the total domestic water demand in 2015 and groundwater recharge from the wet season provides the primary water supply for the subsequent dry season in this research we present a groundwater recharge indicator that can support water managers in preparing for seasonal droughts we developed this tool for an aquifer in northwestern costa rica where we conducted hydrological monitoring of streams and groundwater levels for 2 5 years obtained further hydrological data groundwater levels from 2005 to 2016 and worked with communities to assemble water use data we combined these datasets in a hydrologic model the water evaluation and planning system weap and modelled groundwater recharge from 2005 to 2016 permitting a characterization of the relationship between rainfall and groundwater recharge the groundwater recharge indicator is based on this relationship and allows estimating total groundwater recharge for a wet season from cumulative rainfall measured to date the indicator permits water managers to assess if the current year will likely fall into a low recharge category prior to the end of the wet season this information can then be used to trigger short term adaptation strategies with the goal to bank groundwater while surface water sources are still available in the wet season this indicator based tool was refined through feedback provided in local stakeholder workshops we also assessed the overall accuracy of predicting end of wet season groundwater recharge with cumulative rainfall to date and found that after the first 2 3 months of the wet season prediction accuracies are high leaving 5 6 months of wet season to respond adaptively to the prediction the indicator can help water managers to plan ahead and communicate the need for water conservation demand management and consideration of other water sources such as rain and surface water supply management this idea is transferable to other communities in regions with seasonal rainfall and can support decision makers in increasing the socio hydrological resilience of communities to seasonal droughts keywords groundwater recharge socio hydrology resilience drought wet dry tropics adaptation 1 introduction inter annual variability of seasonal rainfall and groundwater recharge can pose water challenges for communities in regions with extended dry seasons that are reliant on shallow groundwater to meet their water demand these challenges will likely increase in the future with projected increases in seasonal and inter annual rainfall variability in central america magrin et al 2014 and increasing water demands wada and bierkens 2014 seasonality of rainfall defines many climate systems around the world the pacific coast of central america is one of the hotspots of rainfall seasonality together with northeastern brazil western sub saharan and central africa northern australia and parts of southeast asia feng et al 2013 in these regions a temporal mismatch between water availability and water needs can lead to natural and technical water shortages and conflicts between different sectors i e agriculture and domestic water demand and between human and natural system needs ballestero et al 2007 kuzdas and wiek 2014 kuzdas et al 2015b in addition to the seasonal rainfall regime high inter annual rainfall variability characterizes the wet dry tropics of central america one of the main drivers for this is the el niño southern oscillation enso with lower rainfall to this region during el niño periods steyn et al 2016 waylen and laporte 1999 waylen et al 1996 this in turn can lead to increased water shortages such as during the 2014 2016 el niño event sánchez murillo et al 2016 vignola et al 2018 when about 3 5 million people were considered food insecure due to failing crops within the drier pacific coast region of central america fao 2016 with climate change increases in rainfall variability and extremes have been observed over the last decades for central america and more frequent temperature and rainfall extremes are projected for the future due to the high inter annual rainfall variability and the complex interplay of many local and global climatic forces future climate projections have high uncertainty for the region but will likely include more frequent dry conditions hidalgo et al 2013 magrin et al 2014 drought i e the temporary lack of water compared to normal conditions is a combination of both climate induced as well as human induced drought van loon et al 2016 the propagation of meteorological droughts rainfall deficits to hydrological droughts reduced water availabilities is influenced by both catchment properties as well as human actions van loon et al 2016 and in the case of the wet dry tropics of costa rica growing water demands and lack of adaptive management have increased drought conditions in the past ballestero et al 2007 kuzdas et al 2015a population growth in costa rica is projected to increase by 33 by the year 2050 relative to 2011 inec 2014 which will likely put more pressure on water resources and increase vulnerabilities of communities to drought as in many regions with seasonal rainfall regimes communities in the wet dry tropics of costa rica depend primarily on groundwater which supplied 78 of the total domestic water demand in 2015 province of guanacaste cti 2017 guzman 2015 the province of guanacaste has a history of water conflicts between different sectors such as tourism agriculture and communities kuzdas et al 2014 kuzdas and wiek 2014 between 1997 and 2015 95 water related conflicts have been reported in guanacaste esquivel hernández et al 2017 ramírez cover 2008 many of these conflicts evolved around groundwater extractions groundwater allocations between domestic tourism and agricultural sectors and weak water governance structures kuzdas et al 2015a 2014 for many communities groundwater provides the primary water source during the dry season when streamflow is low ballestero et al 2007 kuzdas et al 2015a therefore seasonal groundwater recharge during the wet season is key for replenishing aquifers jasechko et al 2014 and assuring water supply yet groundwater recharge in the tropics is strongly dependent on the intensity of rainfall during the wet season jasechko and taylor 2015 and is more pronounced in years of extreme seasonal rainfall owor et al 2009 taylor et al 2012 this in turn means that in years of low seasonal rainfall groundwater recharge tends to be lower for communities depending on renewable shallow groundwater for their livelihoods and agricultural irrigation this can lead to significant water stress as happened during the dry season following the el niño 2014 2016 event in the dry corridor of costa rica when many community wells ran dry and drought emergencies were declared vignola et al 2018 therefore groundwater has to be managed carefully to ensure water supply lasts throughout the dry season and baseflow and environmental flow needs are respected yet groundwater management is a challenge in the region due to scarce hydrological data and aquifer studies limited oversight of groundwater pumping by government agencies and inefficient water governance ballestero et al 2007 kuzdas et al 2014 vignola et al 2018 the impacts of droughts on communities depend not only on the meteorological events themselves i e the hazard but also on exposure and vulnerability of communities to these extreme events magrin et al 2014 historically central america has been considered as a region with high vulnerabilities of communities to natural disasters due to the levels of poverty and livelihood structures magrin et al 2014 agriculture is one of the most important livelihoods in central america and in particular smallholder and subsistence farmers can be severely impacted by droughts hannah et al 2017 in the wet dry tropics of costa rica most farmers use groundwater based irrigation agriculture in the dry season and rainfed or irrigation both surface water and groundwater based agriculture in the wet season inec 2015 the rural and agricultural communities depend directly on their local water resources and especially rural communities with weak water management structures often suffer the direct effects of droughts kuzdas et al 2015a in these agricultural watersheds social and hydrological processes are tightly connected and processes from one system component will affect the other coupled human water systems socio hydrology sivapalan et al 2012 this has to be considered when aiming to increase resilience to drought here resilience refers to the capacity of the system to absorb and adapt to recurrent disturbances without major system shifts and to develop with a changing environment folke 2006 folke et al 2016 mao et al 2017 hydrological resilience i e focusing on the response of the water subsystem to extreme events or anthropogenic impacts should not be considered separately from the social system i e social resilience to hydrological hazards but rather the combined socio hydrological resilience should be considered i e the coupled human water system mao et al 2017 to support the development of socio hydrological resilience to droughts it is crucial for scientists to integrate their research within communities and communicate scientific results to local decision makers in a way that they can directly apply and act upon our main goal in this study was to develop a tool that can support water managers to increase the resilience of their communities to seasonal drought groundwater recharge in the wet season is the key process for determining water supplies in the dry season when communities and agriculture rely on groundwater as their primary water source thus we first evaluated the relationship between seasonal rainfall and groundwater recharge for an aquifer in the wet dry tropics of costa rica next we analyzed water use groundwater versus surface water to determine potential sensitivities of the socio hydrological system to external impacts such as reduced rainfall we then combined these hydrological and social analyses to characterize the resilience properties of the system i e adaptive and absorptive capacities and determined how external drivers can lead to negative consequences for the system as well as opportunities for increasing resilience focusing on seasonal droughts following rainfall years with less than normal rainfall we then used these findings to develop a groundwater recharge indicator as a decision support tool for local water managers that could help to increase the socio hydrological resilience to droughts in regions with highly seasonal rainfall and inter annual rainfall variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this study focuses on two adjacent watersheds potrero and caimital that share the same aquifer potrero caimital aquifer and are located in the province of guanacaste on the nicoya peninsula in northwestern costa rica fig 1 the surface water divide between both watersheds crosses through the relatively flat alluvial valley that is underlain by the aquifer figs 3 and 4 considering that the potrero caimital aquifer extends through both watersheds and that groundwater extractions surface water groundwater interactions and other hydrological processes will affect and be affected by processes in the two watersheds we included both watersheds in our analysis the potrero watershed comprises about 36 km2 and drains to the northeast into the grande river the caimital watershed 41 km2 drains to the southwest into the quirimán river a tributary to the nosara river the two river mainstems the potrero and caimital rivers are groundwater fed and perennial but have low baseflows during the dry season ephemeral tributaries contribute to streamflow from the hillsides during the wet season and are dry during the dry season fig 3 the province of guanacaste has a wet dry tropical climate mean annual rainfall in nicoya nearby the potrero and caimital watersheds is 2130 mm mean from 1980 to 2016 in nicoya ranging from 1310 mm to 3230 mm and is characterized by a bimodal rainfall distribution with a dry season from december to march and a wet season from april to november fig 2 the wet season is interrupted by a period of lower rainfall in july and august mid summer drought the region also experiences high inter annual variability in rainfall due to a complex interplay of local and remote climate processes one of the main drivers for this is enso with significantly lower rainfall during el niño years steyn et al 2016 the geology of the hills surrounding the valley of the potrero and caimital rivers is dominated by the nicoya complex basaltic sequence and the topography is generally characterized by slopes 10 in this zone fig 4 denyer and baumgartner 2006 loose and non consolidated sandy colluvial sediment deposits dominate along the transition zone from hills to the relatively flat valley losilla and agudelo 2003 within the valley plain slope 10 quaternary alluvial colluvial sediments overlay a layer of fractured basaltic rocks and the low permeability bedrock of the nicoya complex fig 4 the alluvial colluvial deposits consist of a top layer of 3 to 8 m of silty clay and loam above a layer of sand to gravel with clay lenses losilla and agudelo 2003 denyer et al 2013a b the potrero caimital aquifer extends through the alluvial colluvial valley zone and its lower boundary is formed by the low permeability rocks of the nicoya complex fig 4 agudelo 2006 the aquifer is unconfined to semi confined agudelo 2006 groundwater recharge to the potrero caimital aquifer consists of both diffuse direct recharge from infiltration and percolation through the soil layer and focused indirect recharge from downward movement from surface water to the aquifer agudelo 2006 land use in the two watersheds includes forest 52 pasture 38 agricultural 8 as well as residential 2 fig 3 based on a 2010 land use classification by garcia serrano 2015 most agricultural fields are double cropped rainfed rice during the wet season and groundwater irrigated melons during the dry season whereas on some fields rice is planted during the wet season and fields lie fallow in the dry season the potrero and caimital watersheds provide domestic water supply for many communities in the nicoya region domestic water demand in the studied watersheds includes small rural villages located within the watersheds total population of 3823 in 2014 data obtained from ministerio de salud in nicoya furthermore water is transferred via pipelines to the nearby towns of nicoya 24 833 inhabitants district of nicoya inec 2011 and hojancha 4245 inhabitants district of hojancha inec 2011 fig 3 groundwater use dominates although the town of nicoya has a water treatment plant for surface water intake from the potrero river groundwater based irrigation agriculture during the dry season is another important water demand 2 2 hydrological monitoring network limited hydrological data were available for the potrero and caimital watersheds and in particular no continuous streamflow data existed therefore a first step in our project was to install a hydrological monitoring network within the potrero and caimital watersheds that included five stream and three groundwater level stations hund et al 2016 we monitored water levels at 10 minute intervals for 2 5 years from june 2014 to december 2016 discharge measurements were made using the salt solution slug injection method moore 2005 to develop stage discharge rating curves we also installed an eddy covariance ec equipped monitoring station at a melon rice farm located at the watershed divide between the two studied watersheds within the alluvial valley fig 3 this ec monitoring station includes a sonic anemometer and a li cor open path ec system to monitor actual evapotranspiration a vaisala wxt520 weather transmitter to monitor rainfall air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction and air pressure and additional soil and radiation sensors with continuous data recorded in 30 minute intervals from july 2014 within the same farm only 600 m away from our ec monitoring station is a davies weatherlink weather station operated by the farm owners and davies instruments recording hourly values of rainfall air temperature relative humidity air pressure available since 2007 and short wave solar radiation available since 2014 rainfall data from the weatherlink station were used to gap fill the rainfall records from our ec monitoring station during occasional data outages between july 2014 to december 2016 11 of rainfall data were gapfilled this way 2 3 hydrological modelling we developed a hydrological model of the two watersheds using the water evaluation and planning system weap yates et al 2005 weap is a physically based semi distributed model based on the water balance approach and includes a rainfall runoff routine surface water and groundwater storage furthermore it allows hydrological system components to be combined with aspects of the social system such as water use from surface and groundwater sources and representation of irrigation practices the modelled river reaches were the main stems of the potrero and the caimital rivers and their main tributaries these reaches traverse the alluvial valley underlain by the potrero caimital aquifer i e surface water groundwater interaction can occur both focused recharge through infiltration from the river bed and diffuse recharge through percolation through the soil were modelled evapotranspiration from river reaches was assumed at 2 5 of daily streamflow based on a study on riparian evapotranspiration for tropical headwatersheds in costa rica cadol et al 2012 2 3 1 sub catchment delineation watershed processes such as rainfall runoff evapotranspiration and diffuse groundwater recharge are modelled through the catchment routines in the weap model a watershed is divided into sub catchments scs and for every time step in the model a water balance with outflows from and storage changes within the sc is calculated outflows from a sc can be routed to rivers or aquifers each sc is fractionally divided into several classes or hydrological response units hrus hrus represent an area of similar characteristics such as land use soil type or slope for which it can be assumed that the hydrologic response to rainfall in regards to runoff generation groundwater recharge or evapotranspiration would be similar we used the following criteria to guide the delimitation of scs within the model 1 the upslope areas of the monitoring sites 2 the sub catchments of the tributaries to allow routing of tributary runoff into the main stems of the potrero and caimital and 3 the connection of scs to the aquifer to allow modelling diffuse groundwater recharge fig 5 criteria one and two were based on a digital elevation model dem we used the hydrosheds 3 s dem that for the region has an approximately 90 m spatial resolution lehner et al 2008 we hydrologically conditioned the dem with a detailed local stream layer obtained from the area conservación tempisque and delimited the scs using the open source programs whitebox gat lindsay 2016 saga gis and the saga plug in in qgis conrad et al 2015 olaya 2004 qgis development team 2017 next each sub catchment was divided into hrus or fractional areas that were assumed to respond hydrologically similar to a rainfall event the first criterion for the hru definition was land cover which was based on a land use map delineated from satellite imagery from digital globe esri date december 28 2010 with a 5 m resolution and was developed in support with field visits by garcia serrano 2015 we simplified the land use classifications into the main categories of forest pasture residential agriculture rice only and agriculture rice and melons which is a double cropping system of the two crops grown sequentially during a single 12 month period the separation into the rice and melon categories in the agriculture classification accounts for the fact that rainfed rice is grown on a larger area than groundwater irrigated melons and that part of the rice fields wet season lie fallow during the melon season dry season with consequences for evapotranspiration and irrigation to assess potential changes in land use between the start of the modelling period 2005 and the end of the modelling period 2016 we conducted a land use change analysis using qgis and google earth specifically we digitized land use from google earth imagery from march 2005 and february 2016 and compared it to the 2010 land use map for the extent of the watersheds from 2005 to 2010 we found that forest cover increased by approximately 1 pasture cover decreased by 3 agriculture cover did not change and residential coverage increased by 15 which represented less than 0 4 of the total watershed area from 2010 to 2016 forest coverage increased by 6 pasture decreased by 6 and agriculture and residential increased by 5 and 1 respectively overall all land use changes between 2005 and 2016 affected less than 4 of the total watershed area considering this low percentages of land use change found and the limitations of this analysis due to the lack of high resolution imagery we assumed for hydrological modelling purposes that the land use of the studied watersheds was adequately described by the mid point 2010 land use map and was treated as constant throughout the modelling period from 2005 to 2016 the second criterion for hru definition was soil and geology which was based on the three geological categories basalt colluvial and alluvial material this simplification into three categories was based on available soil and geology data for which no more detailed spatial data existed land cover within the basalt zone was dominated by pasture and forest and no residential or agricultural classes were present slope was the third hru criterion it was determined based on the hydrosheds dem aggregated into four slope classes the alluvial colluvial valley zone was mostly flat 0 to 10 slope the basalt zone was generally steeper than the alluvial colluvial valley zone and all four slope classes 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 80 were represented within the hrus of this zone within a sc of the basalt zone there could therefore be eight different fractional areas hru and within a sc of the alluvial colluvial zone connected to aquifer there could be ten different fractional areas considering limited data availability and modelling capacities we assumed that an hru with the same characteristics in one sc was characterized by the same soil parameters as the same hru in another sc 2 3 2 rainfall runoff modelling the rainfall runoff response in a sc can be modelled by different routines within the weap model we used the soil moisture module that allows modelling surface runoff processes by representing each sub catchment with two soil layers sieber and purkey 2015 yates et al 2005 if the sc is connected to an aquifer as the studied one is the second soil layer is replaced by the aquifer layer for each fractional area hru in a sc a water balance is computed at each time step change in soil moisture in the upper soil layer is determined by antecedent soil moisture input through rainfall and loss through evapotranspiration surface runoff interflow and percolation to the lower soil layer or aquifer surface runoff and interflow contribute to streamflow while percolation through the upper soil layer provides diffuse recharge to the underlying aquifer if a stream is hydrologically connected to an aquifer the aquifer provides baseflow to the stream and on the other hand the stream can contribute focused recharge to the aquifer depending on conditions more details on groundwater surface water interaction are described in the groundwater section for the model soil parameter available water holding capacity we used reported values from in situ measurements conducted in the watersheds garcia serrano 2015 soil hydraulic conductivities were used as a calibration parameters as only infiltration capacities at the root zone existed as field measurements and these did not reflect the modelled soil zone which extended between 2 and 10 m in depth soil depth within the alluvial zone was based on lithology profiles of 29 wells available from the national groundwater irrigation and drainage agency of costa rica servicio nacional de aguas subterráneas riego y avenamiento senara no soil depth data existed for the basalt and colluvial zone and these were used as calibration parameters the runoff resistance factor rrf is related to aspects such as slope and leaf area index lai or land use land cover higher values of the rrf lead to less surface runoff higher resistance whereas lower values lead to higher surface runoff and it is usually used as a calibration parameter sieber and purkey 2015 however lai and surface resistance will change over the course of a year in particular in a region like the wet dry tropics where greening up of vegetation and senescence are so pronounced therefore we used lai data to estimate the intra annual variability of the rrf we used the modis lai product modis 15a2 leaf area index and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar 8 day composite modis collection 5 land product for the period 2000 02 18 to 2017 01 01 ornl daac 2008a in order to capture the long term annual seasonality of lai for each land use type forest pasture or agriculture we first assigned a modis lai value to each land use type and then estimated a mean value of modis lai for each day of the year for the period 2000 2016 to relate lai to different land covers modis cells with a high fraction cover fraction cover 89 for forest and pasture 50 for agriculture of one single land use forest pasture or agriculture were selected and mean lai was calculated from all pixels of the same dominant land use next we estimated the 2000 2016 mean value of each 8 day period of the year reported by modis for each land use type then 8 day mean values were linearly interpolated to obtain a daily time series of lai per land use type for the period 2000 2016 annual means of lai per land use type were also calculated for each land use type daily rrf values were expressed in the weap model as the annual mean lai per land use plus or minus the daily variation of lai from the annual mean this allowed us to use the annual mean for the three land use types as a calibration parameter and change this value according to calibration while maintaining seasonal variability the rrf was assumed constant over time for the residential land cover type rrf values were also differentiated between the four slope classes from the hydrosheds dem with initial values adjusted during calibration the preferred flow direction pfd parameter also required for the weap model is a partitioning coefficient related to soil land cover and topography that fractionally partitions between vertical and horizontal flows and was also adjusted during model calibration we ran the model at a daily time step from 2005 to 2016 the time period for when water use records groundwater levels as well as meteorological data were available monthly values of water table depth were obtained from monthly manual measurements recorded by the national groundwater irrigation and drainage agency of costa rica servicio nacional de aguas subterráneas riego y avenamiento senara for 26 wells from june 2015 to september 2015 for 6 wells starting in june 2005 for 2 wells starting in october 2005 for 13 wells starting in june 2012 and another 5 wells starting in july 2012 climate was assumed to be uniform over the two adjacent and relatively small watersheds historical daily precipitation data were obtained from the national meteorological institute of costa rica instituto meteorológico nacional imn for nicoya from january 2005 until june 2014 to run the model daily precipitation data measured at our ec monitoring station were used for the modelling period from july 2014 to december 2016 2 3 3 evapotranspiration modelling evapotranspiration et is estimated by weap applying the crop coefficient method doorenbos and pruitt 1977 this way evapotranspiration from each hru within a sub catchment is estimated as the product of a crop coefficient kc that incorporates land cover characteristics and water requirements and a reference evapotranspiration etref that represents atmospheric water demand based on meteorological conditions the daily etref is calculated by weap using the penman monteith equation modified for a standardized crop of grass shuttleworth 1993 equation 4 2 31 with the input variables including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and cloudiness fraction to estimate etref for the modelling period from 2005 to 2016 a combination of different meteorological datasets had to be used best quality measurements of air temperature relative humidity and wind speed data were available from the ec monitoring station for the duration of the calibration period from 2014 07 04 to 2016 12 31 for the early period from 2005 to 2007 no meteorological data were available from meteorological stations in the region therefore we used climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr air temperature relative humidity and wind speed data saha et al 2010 dee et al 2014 for this period from february 2007 to september 2012 weatherlink station data for location see fig 3 were available for air temperature and relative humidity and the cfsr wind speed data were used cfsr data were also used from september 2012 to the start of our own monitoring in july 2014 cloudiness fraction was another necessary input to estimate etref in the weap model this variable describes the number of bright sunshine hours per day over the total hours of daylight and we estimated it based on total incoming short wave solar radiation available from the weatherlink station from 07 2014 to 12 2016 and from the cfsr dataset for the earlier time period modelled extraterrestrial solar radiation and the angstrom coefficients shuttleworth 1993 equation 4 2 14 we estimated the angstrom coefficients based on the maximum and minimum of the ratio of the measured incoming short wave radiation and the extra terrestrial radiation during that period as 0 05 bs 0 7 the crop coefficient kc represents the ratio between actual et and etref of each land class type five main land use types exist within the potrero and caimital watersheds forest pasture melon crops rice crops and residential mean kc values for each day of year were estimated for melon and rice crops from et values measured in the ec monitoring station at the melon rice farm and estimated etref as calculated by weap using the penman monteith equation but no et measurements were available for the other land use types the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations provides kc estimates for pasture allen et al 1998 but these values were developed for the northern hemisphere and do not reflect the strong seasonal behavior of the wet dry tropics and further no kc estimates were available for seasonally dry forest in the literature therefore we estimated kc for the non crop land use types using the modis evapotranspiration product mod16 modis 16a2 terra evapotranspiration 8 day 1000 m spatial resolution ornl daac 2008b to relate modis et to different land use types within the potrero caimital watersheds similarly to the lai analysis we selected modis pixels that were dominated by one land use type fraction cover 89 for pasture and forest according to the senara land use classification from 2010 and under the assumption that land use change throughout the study period was minimal et values were extracted for each selected homogeneous land use modis pixel and mean values of all homogeneous pixels for each land use type were calculated for each 8 day period from 2005 to 2014 mod16 was not available for 2015 and 2016 at the time of the weap model calibration daily et values were extrapolated from the 8 day period modis et obtained for each land use daily kc values for the period 2005 to 2014 were then calculated as the ratio between the daily extrapolated modis et for each land use type and estimated daily etref as calculated by weap using the penman monteith equation shuttleworth 1993 equation 4 2 31 to generate a daily kc value to be used for every year of the modelling period considering that not all years had available modis et data we calculated a long term mean value of daily kc for each land use type for each day of year based on the daily kc series from the period 2005 to 2014 for fields where only rice was planted in the wet season and fields lay fallow during the dry season kc values derived from measured et were used during the rice growing season wet season and kc values obtained from modis et for pasture land use type were used for the dry season we used these kc values as starting point for our analysis but we found that the weap model underestimated daily et for the three main cover types agriculture forest and pasture relatively to measured values from the ec monitoring station and modis et we found this underestimation of et was due to an oversimplification of the soil water content dynamics by the model which in turn determines soil water available for evapotranspiration based on the atmospheric water demand etref and the land cover characteristic kc weap uses only one soil layer if the sub catchment is connected to an aquifer this layer has to represent the entire vadose zone which in the potrero and caimital watersheds ranged between 2 and 10 m in depth this oversimplification of the soil layer resulted in a systematic underestimation of the soil water content of the root zone and reduction of et values to account for this we rescaled the initial kc values using a constant scaling factor the scaling factor was estimated for each land use type by optimization so that the error of the annual modelled evapotranspiration was minimized in comparison to the empirical evapotranspiration measurements from the ec monitoring station for agriculture and from modis for forest and pasture 2 3 4 groundwater modelling the potrero caimital aquifer extends through the alluvial colluvial zone fig 4 and therefore sub catchments sc in this zone were connected to an aquifer module in the weap model the lower soil layer of the hill zone nicoya complex contributes to baseflows of the streams and tributaries the potrero caimital aquifer was presented as one aquifer storage unit within the weap model the model allows modelling of both diffuse and focused groundwater recharge diffuse recharge is modelled through the catchment routine soil moisture module where downwards percolation through the upper soil layer of each hru enters the aquifer if the sc is connected to an aquifer such as in the alluvial colluvial zone focused recharge is modelled through the surface water groundwater interaction routine in the weap model it is possible to dynamically link river reaches to an alluvial aquifer which was done for all modelled stream reaches within the alluvial colluvial zone that are underlain by the potrero caimital aquifer stream reaches can gain water from the aquifer gaining stream or contribute focused recharge to the aquifer losing stream depending on the level of groundwater in the aquifer sieber and purkey 2015 surface water groundwater interactions are modelled through a stylized groundwater wedge that is connected along to the length of the river reach sieber and purkey 2015 if aquifer levels rise higher than level of equilibrium with the stream seepage occurs from the aquifer to the stream and vice versa if stream water levels rise seepage occurs from stream to aquifer aquifer characteristics such as specific yield and saturated hydraulic conductivity were based on values reported by the costa rican groundwater agency senara garcia serrano 2015 losilla and agudelo 2003 while parameters related to modelling surface water groundwater interaction were used as calibration parameters these parameters included wetted depth in river groundwater storage at equilibrium with the river and horizontal distance from farthest edge of aquifer to river previous authors conducted five pumping tests to estimate the specific yield of the studied aquifer and found that it varied between 0 0007 and 0 008 with a mean of 0 002 losilla and agudelo 2003 they estimated the total storage volume of the aquifer as 40 mm3 assuming an area of 20 km2 a mean aquifer thickness of 20 m and a mean specific yield of 0 002 transmissivity measurements based on pumping tests existed for 49 locations within the study area and varied between 37 2824 m2 day within the alluvial colluvial layer and between 5 6 28 6 m2 day within the fractured basalt layer garcia serrano 2015 losilla and agudelo 2003 reported values of saturated hydraulic conductivities determined based on the transmissivity measurements and aquifer thickness varied between 4 5 and 95 m day with a mean of approximately 26 m day garcia serrano 2015 losilla and agudelo 2003 considering uncertainties and limited details available regarding the hydraulic conductivities and the specific yield we explored a range of values during the calibration process but found that ultimately the reported values represented the aquifer conditions best and adopted these for our modelling 2 3 5 water demand modelling the potrero and caimital watersheds are the key water supply sources for the domestic water demand of many communities in the region water demand is modelled explicitly in weap allowing integration of social aspects of the socio hydrologic system into hydrologic modelling total water demand is disaggregated into demand sites that differ in their end use in their distribution system water supply type or water allocation preference domestic water demand in the potrero and caimital watersheds includes both rural villages located within the watersheds as well as water transfers via pipelines to the towns of nicoya and hojancha located outside the watersheds rural water boards las asociaciones administradoras de los sistemas de acueductos y alcantarillados asadas manage the water distribution from a well in each of the rural villages the national water agency aya instituto costarricense de acueductos y alcantarillados in nicoya and hojancha manages the water transfer from wells in the potrero caimital aquifer to both towns as well as from a withdrawal site for a surface water treatment plant at the potrero river to nicoya most rural households also have their own artisanal well or surface water pump that supplements the water received from the asada distribution system with this supplemental water typically used for laundry and outdoor water uses based on this context to model surface water and groundwater demand from the studied watersheds we accounted for artisanal pumping per household domestic water use per household from rural villages supplied by asada s water extractions managed by aya for water supply to nicoya and hojancha groundwater extractions for irrigation of melon crops and water use for cattle ranching as detailed below population was estimated annually for years 2001 2004 and 2011 based on census data inec 2011 2001 morataya montenegro 2004 and more recent 2014 data that we had obtained from the ministerio de salud in nicoya to interpolate population data between years and extrapolate to 2016 we calculated the annual geometric growth rate for each town ranging from 1 to 7 mean 4 overall the population within the studied watersheds including nicoya and hojancha increased from 29 136 in 2005 to 35 435 in 2016 we estimated the water demand from household pumping based on pumping records at one of our monitoring stations that is located in an artisanal well to our knowledge no other data are available for this type of water use for the rural villages water use data from rural water boards asadas on a household level were only available for the village of caimital from 2012 to 2015 which we had digitized from water bills so we had to assume that the other rural towns had the same per person annual water use than caimital considering that we had both population data and total water use data for caimital from 2014 we assumed the annual water use rate per person from 2014 for all years where no other water use data were available for nicoya and hojancha we obtained water extraction data from the aya in nicoya including information on water sources i e surface water groundwater based on our analysis of the aya extraction data we found that between 2005 and 2016 nicoya used annually between 49 73 groundwater and 27 51 surface water while hojancha used only groundwater to meet their water demands agricultural groundwater based irrigation per hectare was available from one of the main melon farms in the watersheds and we assumed the same water use per hectare for other melon farms cattle pastures are another important land use in the watersheds and we estimated water use for cattle based on the mean number of cattle per hectare in the region inec 2015 and estimated drinking water use per cattle 35 5 l day ayantunde et al 2002 all water operators with a water extraction site well or surface water extraction have to apply for a license at the dirección de agua from the ministerio de ambiente y energia minae these licenses contain information on location operator name water source allowed pumping rates and type of use most of the water operators with a water license are the asadas the aya and the big melon rice farms and were therefore already included in our model for all the other operators we added the water demand indicated in the license to the model while the water licenses provide some indication on water extractions only pumping rates are reported in the license thus it is unclear how many hours an operator might be pumping and what total water volume was extracted further unregistered unlicensed wells also exist in the area therefore real water extractions are likely higher than is reported through the water licenses the water use estimates for this study were however mostly based on monthly extracted volumes documented by the water utility and agricultural companies or estimated based on land use such as ranching i e not based on water licenses alone 2 3 6 model calibration and evaluation we calibrated the model using the streamflow data monitored during the time period from 2014 07 to 2016 12 which contained both drier and wetter years 2015 and 2016 respectively we used a combination of manual sensitivity analysis and calibration and an optimization algorithm the parameter estimation pest algorithm incorporated in weap to determine the parameter set of best fit doherty 2015 sieber and purkey 2015 we then evaluated the model results by comparing measured and modelled streamflow goodness of fit measures including nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 pearson correlation coefficient coefficient of determination and rsr the ratio of the root mean square error over the standard deviation moriasi et al 2007 were calculated for observed and modelled streamflow zambrano bigiarini 2017 and are given in table 1 some of the model uncertainties were due to the challenge of capturing the flashy high streamflows following intensive rainfall events that often occurred within an hourly time scale with a daily model and when model results tended to underestimate the very high flows other uncertainties are due to spatial simplification available input data limitations in both spatial distribution and quality uncertainties associated with the discharge rating curves and estimates of water use where in many cases no detailed data were available for the region 2 4 groundwater recharge indicator development total groundwater recharge to the potrero caimital aquifer was calculated as the sum of modelled recharge from sub catchments diffuse recharge and from surface water focused recharge for each year of the modelling period from 2005 to 2016 to explore the relation between rainfall and groundwater recharge we fit a linear regression model to total annual rainfall and total annual groundwater recharge for comparison to modelled recharge we also attempted to estimate groundwater recharge empirically using the groundwater level fluctuation method as well as by residual of the water budget however due to too many missing components and uncertainties of the empirical data for instance groundwater levels influenced by pumping uncertainties of baseflow neither method could be applied successfully next we calculated the cumulative rainfall and cumulative modelled groundwater recharge throughout each year based on daily data and used this relationship to develop a groundwater recharge indicator here we calculated the 0 25 45 55 75 and 100 percentiles for each day of year based on the daily distribution of the 12 years of the modelling period for both cumulative rainfall and cumulative groundwater recharge based on the percentiles we determined five categories 0 to 25 25 to 45 45 to 55 55 to 75 and 75 100 to quantify how well groundwater recharge can be predicted based on cumulative rainfall throughout the wet season we calculated confusion matrices kuhn 2008 for each day of year for each of the five percentile categories confusion matrices 1 count the number of times that a predicted value matches the true value and 2 report the number of true positives false positives type i error false negatives type ii error and true negatives for each day of year we determined the percentile category into which the cumulative rainfall fell from this we predicted the percentile category into which the cumulative groundwater recharge would be expected to fall at the end of the year predicted category the percentile category of the cumulative groundwater recharge at the end of the year represented the true category we calculated a confusion matrix for each day of the year for each of the 12 years of our modelling period and extracted the overall accuracy we then used locally weighted smoothing wickham 2009 to show the pattern of the overall accuracy throughout the wet season and fit the curve through the origin after the first month of the wet season 3 results and discussion 3 1 water use water extractions from the potrero and caimital watersheds increased by 26 between 2005 and 2016 table 2 this was primarily driven by a fast growing population with annual population growth rates between 1 and 7 mean 4 while land use stayed relatively constant population is expected to continue to grow with a total growth of 23 by 2025 relative to the last census from 2011 for the province of guanacaste and specifically with a 13 increase for the district of nicoya and a 9 increase for the district of hojancha inec 2014a by 2050 a total increase in population by 33 is expected for all of costa rica relative to the 2011 census inec 2014b this indicates increasing pressures on water resources from anthropogenic extractions if water management practices are not adapted according to our study dominant water extractions from the potrero and caimital watersheds are for domestic purposes 94 4 of total extractions in 2016 whereas water extractions for agricultural irrigation 3 9 and cattle ranching 1 7 are lower due to both high land use coverage of forest 52 of total land and seasonal irrigation only during dry season further 69 of total domestic extractions in 2016 were for water transfers to the towns of nicoya and hojancha that are not located within the potrero and caimital watersheds current water use practices focus dominantly on groundwater pumping over surface water use and groundwater pumping has increased by 53 from 2005 to 2016 while surface water use has decreased significantly both in absolute terms as well as in terms of the fraction of total water use table 2 3 2 observed groundwater levels observed groundwater levels in the potrero caimital aquifer fluctuated seasonally as illustrated in the long term record 2005 2015 for well x29 fig 6 a see fig 3 for well location data obtained from senara groundwater levels rose in response to recharge during the wet season and declined during the dry season due to groundwater discharge to streams as baseflow and pumping with an overall range of annual variation of approximately 6 m fig 6 similar seasonal groundwater level fluctuations have been shown for the nimboyores aquifer an alluvial aquifer that is also located within the wet dry tropics of guanacaste garcía and arellano 2012 and these seasonal fluctuations may be a typical feature of alluvial aquifers in this region 3 3 simulated groundwater recharge over the modelled time period from 2005 to 2016 high seasonal rainfall resulted in high seasonal groundwater recharge with a range between 98 mm year and 252 mm year fig 7 a total annual rainfall measured and total groundwater recharge simulated had a significant linear relationship r 2 0 97 p 0 001 fig 7b the percentage of total annual groundwater recharge to total annual rainfall stayed relatively constant for both low and high total annual rainfalls at 7 to 8 in contrast the percentage of total annual streamflow to total annual rainfall increased from 34 to 50 from low to high annual rainfalls suggesting the increased generation of overland flow during high intensity rainfall events overland flow runoff was also evident by high sediment loading in rivers after intensive rainfall events as was observed in the field similar to other tropical aquifers jasechko and taylor 2015 mileham et al 2009 owor et al 2009 sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 taylor et al 2012 intensive seasonal rainfall is important for recharging the potrero caimital aquifer sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 showed the importance of the intensive rainfalls of the second wet season peak in september and october for groundwater recharge for aquifers in the wet dry tropics of costa rica pacific lowlands this is reflected in the increased groundwater recharge that we found for the potrero caimital aquifer in years of high annual rainfall in which monthly rainfall is typically highest during the fall months second peak of the wet season steyn et al 2016 similarly jasechko and taylor 2015 showed that intensive monthly rainfalls contributed disproportionately to groundwater recharge for 14 tropical aquifers across different continents while owor et al 2009 showed that the sum of daily rainfall events and groundwater recharge were linearly related for an aquifer in uganda with better coefficients of determination when only considering daily rainfall events larger than 10 mm a good linear correlation between rainfall and groundwater recharge is not always found studies from large aquifers in east africa mileham et al 2009 taylor et al 2012 found a non linear relation between rainfall and groundwater recharge where episodic recharge events resulting from abnormally high seasonal rainfall interrupted multiannual groundwater level declines taylor et al 2012 in contrast to the majority of the aquifers mentioned above the potrero caimital is a fairly small aquifer with a dominance of clayey loamy soils where flashy surface runoff is the dominant response to intensive rainfall events which helps to explain the good agreement found between annual rainfall and groundwater recharge it is important to remember that the groundwater recharge estimates carry some uncertainty due to modelling assumptions and available input data for instance the definition of the hrus and related simplifications regarding land use and soil may impact modelled diffuse recharge for example toohey et al 2018 showed that soil hydraulic conductivity and percolation was higher at a forest site than at a pasture site for a watershed in the wet tropics in costa rica also the simplified representation of surface water groundwater interactions in the model may have introduced some uncertainties genereux and jordan 2006 showed the importance of groundwater contributions to streams for lowland tropical rainforest watersheds in the wet tropics in costa rica in this case however driven by high interbasin groundwater flow 3 4 socio hydrological resilience increasing water use and seasonal fluctuations of groundwater levels have led to water shortages in the dominantly groundwater dependent communities of the studied region thus droughts and water conflicts often manifest themselves in dry seasons following wet seasons with lower than normal rainfall as occurs in relation to el niño events in western central america the current socio hydrological system is not resilient to these external impacts from reduced rainfall fig 8 left and communities and ecosystems experience socio hydrological drought as a consequence to move towards a more drought resilient system we must first define what socio hydrological resilience means in the context of seasonal droughts in this system conceptualized in fig 8 resilience or the capacity of a system to absorb disturbances without significant challenges to its functioning or structures is composed of absorptive adaptive and transformative capacities mao et al 2017 miller et al 2010 here absorptive capacities refer to system components that can help to lessen impacts of an external event such as reduced rainfall and reduce consequences for both social and hydrological sub systems adaptive capacities are the ability of system components to respond to a disturbance again with the goal of reduced impacts we recognize that what we are defining here as external impacts for this analysis i e rainfall variability is in fact not external to the socio hydrological system as human caused climate change magrin et al 2014 and land use change with related changes in evapotranspiration and precipitation recycling ellison et al 2012 influence the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall in the studied non resilient system reduced rainfall i e a meteorological drought leads to reduced groundwater recharge such that many wells become dry and groundwater extraction becomes insufficient to meet the needs of the rural communities the adaptive capacity of the social sub system is low as there is no direct response in the form of differential water management activities or restrictions due to reduced recharge groundwater pumping continues at high rates until groundwater levels drop below the depth of many wells and water shortages begin to impact rural communities as well as ecosystems absorptive capacities are also low as communities rely mostly on the single resource of groundwater and are not using other water supplies which could help to dampen the shock of reduced groundwater levels while annual renewal rates of the aquifer are relatively high mean of 13 for an estimated total aquifer storage of about 40 mm3 current borehole depths often do not reach lower groundwater levels leading to technical water shortages in contrast in a more resilient system fig 8 right communities would respond adaptively to reduced groundwater recharge during a wet season with reduced rainfall and decrease their groundwater pumping as one measure to lessen impacts on groundwater storage for the subsequent dry season the hydrological sub system one of the barriers to this is information i e that communities become aware of pending challenges early enough to adapt their behavior for wet dry tropical systems the main impacts from reduced rainfall in the wet season i e meteorological droughts often occur later in the following dry season this delay provides an opportunity to make the system more resilient to oncoming impacts an adaptive response and increased absorptive capacity of the system can help to make the socio hydrological system more resilient towards reduced rainfall and seasonal droughts for example once it becomes apparent that total recharge is likely to be lower than normal for a given wet season there is the potential to shift to other water sources such as rainwater harvesting or increased surface water use during the remaining wet season this also increases the absorptive capacity of communities by reducing reliance on groundwater further adaptive responses could include reducing water permits for irrigation of dry season crops after wet seasons with low recharge and improving agricultural soil and water management considering the relatively high total storage volume of the potrero caimital aquifer and groundwater reserves there may also be some buffer capacity for droughts deepening well screen depths of boreholes could reduce technical water shortages and increase resilience to drought however it is a more expensive approach that could lead to equity issues as drilling of deeper boreholes may be restricted to communities or individuals with more financial capacities additionally extracting deeper groundwater may lead to extractions above the sustainable yield of the aquifer i e above the withdrawal rate at which no adverse impacts on ecosystems land subsidence or other aspects of the hydrologic system occur healy 2010 and it could lead to a long term decrease in groundwater levels 3 5 groundwater recharge indicator the key for making the socio hydrological system more resilient to droughts is to increase both absorptive and adaptive capacities absorptive capacities can include more long term strategies such as diversifying water sources from pre dominantly groundwater use adaptive responses need to be made in time for them to be effective in the wet dry tropical climate where drought impacts often occur as a delayed response to the highly variable external driver of reduced rainfall for this adequate information is needed for local decision makers to both assess the situation in time and also to communicate to the general public the need for adaptive response such as water restrictions to address this need we developed an indicator based tool that allows local decision makers to assess the likely status of groundwater reserves in order to provide a framework to react adaptively before major impacts of drought hit one of the main challenges of groundwater is that it is often poorly monitored and inadequately managed as it is less visible than surface water famiglietti 2014 on the other hand rainfall is monitored at least sparingly in most countries of the wet dry tropics and most decision makers have access to rainfall data through their national meteorological institutes we used the strong relation between rainfall and groundwater recharge fig 7 to develop a groundwater recharge indicator fig 9 that represents a cumulative rainfall and b cumulative groundwater recharge over the wet season the 12 years of the modelling period represented a wide range of wet and dry conditions from 1310 mm to 3235 mm for total rainfall and from 98 mm to 252 mm for total groundwater recharge for each day of year we determined the daily distribution of cumulative rainfall and groundwater recharge which were then placed into five percentile categories of rainfall and groundwater recharge respectively very high dark blue high light blue medium yellow low orange very low red the trajectories of cumulative rainfall and groundwater recharge for each year showed that after some variability at the beginning of the wet season they tended to stay within one category for the remainder of the wet season to use this indicator tool one determines the cumulative rainfall to date e g august 1 in fig 9a and the corresponding percentile category this percentile category is then directly related to the projected groundwater recharge category for the same date to determine the projected cumulative recharge fig 9b to explore the validity of this indicator we assessed the overall accuracy of the projected end of year groundwater recharge category estimated from the day of year rainfall category using confusion matrices fig 10 by the end of may to the end of june the accuracy of the projection is high 75 accuracy in most cases in particular for drought projections for high light blue and very high dark blue categories overall accuracy lessens somewhat in july and august which coincides with the timing of the mid summer drought it is important to remember that any model is an abstract and simplified representation of reality beven 2012 and as such there are uncertainties associated with its predictions uncertainties within the modelling can be caused by uncertainties in field measurements such as streamflow and soil measurements in model assumptions and model procedures this should be kept in mind when using the groundwater recharge indicator we tried to limit uncertainties by using the five broad categories of the percentile classes instead of trying to project exact groundwater recharge numbers when using the groundwater recharge indicator it is important to assess cumulative groundwater recharge early on during the wet season i e while it is still raining and there is still water available and not to wait until the end of the wet season when adaptive responses are limited and negative impacts to groundwater storage may already have occurred should the groundwater recharge indicator point to low or very low groundwater recharge immediate actions should be initiated with the overall goal to bank groundwater for the next dry season when it is the only water supply available to this end overall water use can be reduced rainwater can be harvested during the wet season and since high percentages of rainfall leave the watersheds as streamflow during the wet season increased use of surface water during the wet season could reduce the overall impact on groundwater surface water cannot be used much during the dry season as baseflows are low and it would have negative impacts on ecosystems furthermore water managers need to be aware that net recharge at the end of the wet season is likely much lower than total recharge as groundwater pumping and groundwater contributions to baseflow continue throughout the wet season for instance for the modelling period from 2005 to 2016 total annual baseflow from the potrero caimital aquifer to the potrero and caimital rivers and tributaries ranged from 54 to 190 mm between 55 and 85 of annual recharge the groundwater recharge indicator can allow water managers to plan ahead and make informed decisions and importantly to communicate the need for adaptive responses to the public it should be used as a tool for a short term within a wet season adaptive response to rainfall and be integrated within a set of more long term water management strategies that account for increasing water extractions land use change and climate change long term strategies can also help to increase the absorptive capacities of the system and ease the adaptive response to low groundwater recharge predictions while rainfall and climate forecasts are available in the region so far limited translation to consequences on water supplies has been made even though many water managers farmers and general public members identified this as an important need babcock et al 2016 we presented the groundwater recharge indicator during stakeholder workshops in november 2017 in nicoya guanacaste costa rica where it was well received and we refined the tool through the feedback provided in these workshops the concept of the groundwater recharge indicator is potentially adaptable to many regions around the world though it is particularly relevant to regions that experience high rainfall seasonality where a temporal lag between water availability and water needs necessitates an early adaptive response during the wet season to prepare for the following dry season to adapt the groundwater recharge indicator concept to another aquifer groundwater recharge would need to be measured or modelled and the local relationship with cumulative rainfall determined importantly the length of the time series available will impact the robustness of the indictor 4 conclusions communities in regions with seasonal rainfall face a temporal lag between water availabilities and needs this often leads to water shortages and water scarcity during long dry seasons most seasonally dry regions depend on groundwater as their primary water source during the dry season however if not carefully managed groundwater recharge during the wet season may be insufficient to meet water demand during the subsequent dry season in this study we developed a groundwater recharge indicator for an aquifer in the wet dry tropics of costa rica in order to provide a tool that can help communities prepare in a timely manner for dry seasons following wet seasons with low rainfall the tool allows early prediction of the likely groundwater recharge at the end of the wet season based on accumulated seasonal rainfall to date this tool will allow water managers to assess the likely state of groundwater during the wet season when water is still available and implement adaptive responses to low groundwater recharge such as using rain and surface water supply management or water conservation demand management to bank groundwater for the dry season when it is the only water supply this idea can be applicable to other groundwater dependent communities in regions with seasonal rainfall regimes the tool provides a way to communicate scientific results to decision makers to support them in increasing the socio hydrological resilience of their communities to seasonal droughts acknowledgments we gratefully acknowledge financial support for this research through the canadian natural

7202,application of stable isotope methods to evaluate the contribution of different water sources to groundwater recharge relies on the knowledge about isotopic signatures of these sources the data collected at study sites in the canadian prairies show that snowpack isotopic signatures exhibit a high spatial variability over a small scale 100 m limiting the usefulness of point samples to estimate an average isotopic composition of snow over a large area isotopic signatures of snowmelt runoff can be different from those of pre melt snowpack further undermining the applicability of snow isotopic signature to characterisation of snowmelt driven hydrological processes accounting for the actual signature of snowmelt runoff has strong effects on its perceived role in recharging groundwater the data also show that diffuse and depression focussed components of groundwater recharge have different isotopic signatures where the latter closely resembles snowmelt runoff keywords stable isotopes snow snowmelt runoff groundwater recharge canadian prairies 1 introduction snowpack accumulation and depletion are important elements of the hydrologic cycle in many parts of the world lehning 2013 lundberg et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2015 and have long attracted scholarly attention stable isotopes of water have become a key tool for investigating the role of snow derived water in various hydrological processes tetzlaff et al 2015 however the application of isotopic techniques is complicated by a number of processes affecting isotopic signatures of snow and snowmelt water snowpack exposure to the atmosphere results in sublimation which causes an isotopic enrichment of the remaining snow gustafson et al 2010 additionally isotopic composition of meltwater changes during extended melt periods as the preferential release of lighter isotopes leads to a progressive isotopic enrichment of the residual snowpack taylor et al 2001 the resulting isotopic shift between the original snowfall and meltwater if unaccounted for can introduce biases into hydrological investigations earman et al 2006 laudon et al 2002 taylor et al 2002 this prompted studies examining environmental factors governing the isotopic composition of snowpack and meltwater such as slope aspect dahlke and lyon 2013 dietermann and weiler 2013 schmieder et al 2016 snow thickness unnikrishna et al 2002 freeze thaw cycles zhou et al 2008 and land cover koeniger et al 2008 as well as attempts to model the evolution of meltwater isotopic composition ala aho et al 2017 feng et al 2002 however previous studies were mostly conducted in mountainous and or humid areas where the snow water equivalent of snowpack reaches hundreds of mm the extent to which the aforementioned processes apply to low relief areas with thinner snowpacks remains unclear for example a thin snowpack can melt completely over just a few days thereby releasing water in a single short event in these circumstances preferential release of lighter isotopes is expected to have little effect on isotopic composition of the meltwater pulse furthermore snow cover depletion in flat terrains occurs simultaneously throughout most of the landscape thus smoothing out differences in meltwater generation between slopes of different aspects such uncertainty warrants further investigation of factors affecting isotopic composition of snow derived water in low relief regions with thin snowpacks the present study was motivated by the need to evaluate the role of snowmelt water in groundwater recharge in the canadian prairies a semi arid region with relatively thin snowpacks burn et al 2008 it has been long hypothesised that groundwater recharge in this region to a large extent depends on seasonal ponding of small depressions by snowmelt runoff see the study site section for a detailed description using seasonal isotopic signatures of precipitation in a binary mixing model maulé et al 1994 showed that winter precipitation contributed as much as 44 of groundwater recharge even though it accounted only for a 21 of total precipitation however aforementioned literature regarding the isotopic signature of snow derived water indicates potential problems in the direct use of precipitation signatures in mixing models the conceptual model of groundwater recharge in the canadian prairies includes two possible recharge pathways depression focussed recharge associated with surface ponding keller et al 1988 van der kamp and hayashi 1998 and diffuse recharge resulting from the percolation of water under both depressions and surrounding uplands zebarth and de jong 1989 fig 1 the depression focussed recharge pathway has several stages with a potential to affect the isotopic signature of water inputs pre melt snowpack exposure to the atmosphere snowmelt runoff generation ponded water exposure to the atmosphere and water percolation through the root zone under the depression therefore the application of binary mixing models requires information about isotopic shifts along the recharge pathway the primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the contribution of snow derived water to groundwater recharge in the western part of the canadian prairies using the end member analysis of stable isotopes of water achieving this goal requires identification of processes affecting the isotopic composition of snowpack and meltwater in cold semi arid settings 2 study sites the study was conducted near the western edge of the canadian prairies which is a part of a broader region known as northern prairies winter 1989 fig 2 this region has a dry and cold climate and glaciated terrains characterised by numerous small internally drained depressions known as potholes or sloughs annual potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation throughout the canadian prairies sauchyn et al 2002 thus greatly reducing the amount of water left for surface runoff and groundwater recharge however this effect is modulated by a complex interplay between the local topography and climate previous studies showed that frozen soil plays a crucial role in generating snowmelt runoff from the uplands surrounding individual depressions which leads to ponding of depressions daniel and staricka 2000 hayashi et al 1998 as a result of such ponding the water availability within depressions surpasses evaporative demands allowing the excess water to recharge groundwater through the process commonly referred to as depression focussed recharge fig 1 the climate in the study region varies from relatively humid in the west and northwest to dry in the south and southeast this climatic gradient is reflected in the vegetation cover resulting in varying ecoregions government of alberta 2005 proximity to the rocky mountains results in the regular occurrence of foehn events locally known as chinooks particularly in the western part of the study region nkemdirim 1996 in order to account for the effects of the climatic gradient on groundwater recharge processes the study was conducted at three sites located in the parkland and grassland ecoregions fig 2 the study sites have the common defining features of the northern prairies the landscape dominated by glacial landforms including numerous small depressions and the semi arid continental climate with a strong seasonality the stauffer and spyhill sites are located in the parkland ecoregion a transition zone between semi arid grassland and boreal forest and the triple g site is located in the more arid grassland ecoregion fig 2 all sites have cold winters and hot summers with mean annual temperature 1956 2005 of 3 1 3 8 and 4 2 c at neighboring long term weather stations in olds gleichen and calgary respectively precipitation has a high seasonal variability with monthly precipitation during summer months several times higher than in winter fig 3 a the isotopic composition of precipitation also has a pronounced seasonality fig 3b with summer δ18o values approaching 15 and winter values well below 25 at the stauffer site the study was primarily conducted in a catchment of a small depression referred to as se2 with additional investigation in a catchment referred to as se1 located 300 m east of se2 fig 4 a the surficial cover in this area is generally formed by glacial till fenton et al 2013 however drilling within the se2 catchment revealed that the bedrock in this location is overlain by a layer of sandy unconsolidated sediment whereas the bedrock under se1 catchment is overlain by clay rich glacial till these sediments are 7 12 m thick and overlay the paleocene paskapoo formation a fluvial system consisting of sandstone channels embedded within relatively impermeable mudstone grasby et al 2008 at the time of the study the stauffer site was used as a summer pasture for cattle with vegetation cover formed mostly by timothy phleum pratense and alfalfa medicago sativa at the spyhill site the study was conducted at a depression referred to as gp fig 4b located in an open grassland dominated by smooth brome bromus inermis mohammed et al 2013 which was previously used for cattle grazing but has not been grazed since 2006 the site is covered by clay rich glacial till with average thickness of 13 m overlaying a 19 m thick layer of mostly unsaturated gravel eba engineering consultants 2003 a previous study in a depression located 350 m north of gp found the perched water table within the till van dijk 2005 at the triple g site the study was conducted in catchments of two adjacent depressions referred to as w and e fig 4c focussing mainly on w the area is covered by glacial till fenton et al 2013 which is underlain by the cretaceous paleocene scollard formation prior et al 2013 at the time of the present study the entire site was used as a summer pasture for cattle with vegetation cover formed mostly by smooth brome bromus inermis due to the variation in the surficial sediments at the study sites all unconsolidated sediments are hereafter referred to as overburden similarly the underlying sedimentary rocks of the scollard and paskapoo formations are referred to as bedrock hydraulic heads within the overburden at the stauffer spyhill and triple g sites measured in early december 2016 during period with limited water inputs due to soil freezing highlight the differences in hydrogeological conditions among the three sites fig 5 depression se2 at stauffer site lacks strong horizontal and vertical gradients with roughly the same hydraulic heads under the depression and the adjacent upland in contrast both the spyhill and the triple g sites had strong downward gradients under the depressions as well as higher hydraulic heads under depressions than under the uplands despite the absence of surface ponding at the time of measurement this pattern persisted throughout the year at all three sites with addition of short term rises in hydraulic heads under the depressions in spring 3 methods to characterise changes in isotopic signatures along recharge pathways fig 1 water samples from each stage of surface and subsurface flow pathways were collected and analysed as described below 3 1 snowpack sampling and monitoring depth integrated snowpack samples were collected in sealed plastic bags at the study sites throughout the winters of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 table 1 using a meteorological service of canada msc snow sampler with an internal diameter of 70 mm dixon and boon 2012 the depth and weight of each sample was recorded during sampling in order to calculate density and snow water equivalent swe of each sample the samples were collected at the same locations at each study site during both winters during the winter of 2015 2016 only two to three samples were kept for analysis on each sampling date in the winter of 2016 2017 all samples were kept for analysis on each sampling date six samples were collected at the stauffer site three in the catchment of se1 and three in se2 fig 4a thirteen samples at the spyhill site nine in gp fig 4b and four in a catchment 600 m north of gp and five samples at the triple g site all in the catchment of w fig 4c additional samples were collected at the spyhill site during a midwinter snowmelt event in the gp depression catchment on january 17 five samples and 19 three samples 2017 snowpack conditions at the study sites were monitored throughout both winters using time lapse cameras wingscapes timelapsecam which took photos five times per day the photos were then manually classified to describe snowpack conditions within the field of view continuous snow cover no snow free patches observed discontinuous snow cover isolated snow free patches observed sporadic only isolated patch of snow cover remain and no snow no patches of snow cover remain 3 2 runoff ponded water and groundwater sampling snowmelt runoff samples were collected from runoff plots fig 4 consisting of aluminium panels protruding 5 10 cm above the ground and isolating the plot 9 m2 from the rest of the slope a gravel filled gutter at the downslope end of the runoff plot and an underground pipe connecting the gutter to a buried 180 l plastic barrel the runoff plot was designed to minimise possible changes in isotopic signatures of the collected snowmelt runoff for example the access pipe to the barrel was capped to reduce evaporation in addition a small amount of available energy and a large volume of runoff at least tens of litres reduced the effect of evaporative enrichment on the bulk isotopic composition the same factors also increased the thermal inertia which slowed freezing furthermore the barrel was straddling the lower boundary of the frost zone meaning that the surrounding soil temperature was not far below zero even during the coldest periods further reducing freezing rate and presenting an opportunity to pump out the collected water before it froze the barrels were pumped dry in november 2015 runoff samples were collected at the stauffer and triple sites in february march 2016 following the filling of the barrels after snowmelt table 1 after each sampling event the barrel was pumped dry to prevent dilution of subsequent inputs with runoff from earlier events three samples were collected from each runoff plot at the stauffer site on three different dates only two samples were taken from the runoff plot at the triple g site additionally ponded water samples were collected during the same period from ponded depressions se1 and se2 at the stauffer site and depressions w and e at the triple g site no runoff or ponded water samples were collected from the spyhill site as it generated negligible amount of runoff during the winter of 2015 2016 the sampling of runoff and ponded water was repeated during the winter of 2016 2017 table 1 storage barrels were pumped dry in september 2016 at the stauffer site and in october 2016 at the spyhill and triple g sites runoff samples were collected at the triple g site in february march 2017 at the stauffer site in march april 2017 and at spyhill site in march 2017 following snowmelt events the sampling of ponded water in the depressions started only in march 2017 as refreezing of ponded water prevented sampling in february at the stauffer and triple g sites the ponding of the depression at the spyhill site occurred only in march groundwater samples were collected at the stauffer and triple g sites in the summer of 2016 using previously installed piezometers fig 4 with screen depths ranging from 2 to 12 m below the bottom of depressions fig 5 at the stauffer site water samples were collected from piezometers screened in the overburden the piezometers were pumped dry on june 28 and left to recover for two days after which they were sampled using a peristaltic pump five additional groundwater samples were collected on june 28 from piezometers screened in the underlying paskapoo bedrock in this case a submersible pump was used to continuously pump three well volumes of water out of the piezometers prior to sample collection at the triple g site samples were collected on august 9 from three piezometers one at the upland and two at the depression screened in the overburden owing to much slower response of piezometers at triple g they were sampled using bailers without pumping them dry additionally a single sample was collected from the household well screened within bedrock which is located 3 km north of the triple g site using a submergible pump installed in the well the sampling of piezometers at the triple g site was repeated on april 28 2017 when the depression was still ponded at this time all three depression piezometers fig 5 were sampled using a peristaltic pump 3 3 snow and water samples storage and analysis snow samples were completely melted in a refrigerator filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filter and stored in 20 ml scintillation vials in the refrigerator until analysis runoff ponded water and groundwater samples were filtered and stored in scintillation vials in the refrigerator until analysis all samples were analysed at the university of calgary isotope science laboratory isl using an off axis integrated cavity laser spectroscopy isotope analyser losgatosresearch dlt 100 with a nominal accuracy of 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ 18o in addition to the groundwater samples listed above thirteen bedrock groundwater samples were collected from household pumping wells in the area surrounding the stauffer site the samples were filtered during sampling and stored in the refrigerator until they were submitted for analysis to the isl 3 4 pore water extraction and analysis overburden sediment samples were collected during drilling at the study sites in october november 2014 in two boreholes upland and depression at the gp catchment in the spyhill site fig 4b three boreholes two in upland and one in depression at the w catchment in the triple g site fig 4c two boreholes upland and depression at the se1 catchment in the stauffer site fig 4a and a single borehole at an upland located 650 m north west of se2 in the stauffer site not in fig 4a an additional set of samples was collected from two boreholes upland and depression at the se2 catchment in the stauffer site fig 4a in october 2015 the samples were collected using an auger wrap technique keller and van der kamp 1988 at 0 75 m intervals placed in sealed glass jars and weighed simultaneously duplicates for each sample were collected in plastic bags in order to estimate original gravimetric water content five sub samples weighing roughly 50 g each were taken from each duplicate sample shortly after sampling the subsamples were weighed oven dried at 110 c for 24 h and re weighed the calculated value of gravimetric water content was used to estimate the original amount of water in the samples stored in glass jars pore water from the sediment samples was analysed by the direct equilibration method koehler et al 2000 using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry cf irms the laboratory setup consisted of an on line gas preparation system thermo scientific finnigan ii gasbench coupled to a mass spectrometer thermo scientific delta v plus two small sub samples at least 4 mg each were taken from each glass jar and placed in 12 ml vials together with hokko beads platinum containing catalyst for hydrogen water equilibration and flushed with h2 for 2h analysis and with co2 for 18o analysis for approximately 10 min at a rate of 80 100 ml min following the flushing samples were left to equilibrate with h2 for 4 h and with co2 for 12 h respectively afterwards samples were put into the gas preparation system for analysis the accuracy of this method was assessed using a number of spiking tests which involved addition of the water standards with known isotopic composition to quartz sand and oven dried overburden samples collected from one meter depth in w depression at the triple g site the average deviation of measured values from the original water was 2 09 for δ2h and 0 26 for δ18o in case of quartz sand and as high as 10 47 for δ2h and 1 28 for δ18o in case of overburden samples in case of overburden samples the direction of the shift in measured isotopic signature relative to the standard varied between experiments negative shifts were observed when the isotopically heavy standard δ18o of 7 3 was used and positive shifts were observed when the isotopically light standard δ18o of 34 9 was used lennon 2016 the magnitude of errors uncovered in spiking tests is comparable with reported error values for the cryogenic extraction which is widely used for the determination of pore water isotopic signature orlowski et al 2016 owing to a long storage time up to a year in glass jars some samples experienced noticeable water loss as such those samples that lost more than 5 of the original water were omitted from the analysis the amount of water loss was inferred by comparing the weight of the jars immediately after sampling and prior to stable isotope analysis in three boreholes the majority of samples surpassed the loss threshold and were omitted both upland and depression boreholes at se1 depression at the stauffer site as well as one of upland boreholes at the triple g site 4 results 4 1 isotopic composition of surface water samples winter 2015 2016 isotopic compositions of snowpack samples from the study sites plot along the local meteoric water line lmwl in calgary peng et al 2004 for both winters fig 6 snowpack δ18o values in the samples collected in winter 2015 2016 n 37 had a mean of 23 3 with a standard deviation of 1 8 and those collected in winter 2016 2017 n 127 had a mean of 26 2 with a standard deviation of 3 5 in the winter 2015 2016 snowpack δ18o values at the stauffer site varied between 25 6 and 20 1 fig 7 a which is close to the precipitation weighted average of 23 7 for november april in calgary peng et al 2004 the snowpack isotopic composition showed some spatial variability with the range of δ18o values up to 3 on a same sampling date the swe of snowpack samples at this site increased over winter from 8 mm on december 1 to 48 mm on march 9 fig 7a following the partial snow cover depletion ending on february 19 runoff samples were collected from se1 depression and the two runoff plots these samples had δ18o values in the range of 20 6 to 19 7 and were noticeably more enriched than pre melt snow samples fig 7a later runoff events following the snow cover depletion on march 1 8 yielded δ18o values similar to those after the february event the δ18o values of ponded water in the two depressions in mid march were consistent with the isotopic composition of the water sampled from the runoff plots snowpack samples collected at the triple g site prior to snowmelt events on january 22 24 and 27 31 in winter 2015 2016 had δ18o values of 25 0 to 26 2 fig 7b the swe increased from the minimum of 6 mm on december 10 to the maximum of 187 mm on january 20 the high value on january 20 resulted from snowdrift formation at one of the sampling points as snowpack was present at this site only sporadically after the late january melt event no snow samples were collected in february and march runoff samples collected from the two ponded depressions and the runoff plot after the melt event had δ18o values of 22 2 to 21 0 and were more enriched than the antecedent snowpack fig 7b a similar δ18o value of 20 6 was obtained for the sample collected from the runoff plot after the complete snow cover depletion on march 1 ponded water samples collected on march 18 were isotopically heavier at 18 8 to 18 5 than ones collected earlier fig 7b samples collected from the two depressions on april 6 were enriched further with δ18o of 9 8 and 13 7 data not shown it is worth noting that both ponded depressions were reduced to puddles around 10 cm deep by this time 4 2 isotopic composition of surface water samples winter 2016 2017 in the winter of 2016 2017 up to the end of january snowpack isotopic compositions at the stauffer site remained similar to the one recorded in 2015 2016 with the mean δ18o value on each sampling date ranging between 25 5 and 23 1 fig 8 a the snowpack sampled on february 13 was isotopically lighter and outside of the range recorded in the 2015 2016 with a mean δ18o value of 27 4 the samples collected on march 3 had a mean δ18o value of 24 2 compared with 21 5 in 2015 2016 the samples of runoff collected on march 3 and april 4 had mean δ18o values of 25 4 and 23 2 respectively the ponded water sample collected from se2 depression on march 3 had δ18o value of 26 9 the ponded water samples from se1 depression had δ18o values of 24 3 on march 3 and 22 2 on april 4 the swe increased over the course of the season from 5 10 mm on december 7 to 17 52 mm february 13 following the melt event the swe of the samples dropped to 7 35 mm on march 3 fig 8a at the spyhill site changes in snowpack isotopic compositions over the winter of 2016 2017 followed the same pattern as at the stauffer site with mean values ranging from 26 4 to 22 5 up to the end of january fig 8b snowpack samples collected on february 10 and march 10 had mean δ18o values of 31 2 and 30 2 respectively the δ18o values of runoff and ponded water samples collected on march 15 were similar to ones recorded at the stauffer site at 26 0 and 24 8 respectively the ponded water sample collected on april 21 was isotopically much heavier at 17 0 the swe at the spyhill site followed an upward trend in december january with values closely resembling the stauffer site the swe increased from 5 9 mm on december 9 to 10 42 mm on january 6 fig 8b and ranged between 7 and 151 mm during the melt event on january 13 19 the increased swe for the samples collected during the melt event resulted from sampling of the closest snowdrifts after snow cover disappeared at some sampling points after the melt event swe was 20 32 mm on february 10 and 7 52 mm on march 10 at the triple g site mean δ18o values of snow samples on january 10 february 9 and february 28 were 26 5 30 7 and 26 0 respectively fig 8c the sample collected from the runoff plot had a δ18o value of 22 3 while samples collected later in the season were similar to ones from other two sites varying from 27 5 to 24 6 the δ18o values of ponded water in the two depressions remained close to each other with a mean of 26 4 on march 21 22 9 on april 4 and 15 5 on april 28 fig 8c the sample collected from depression e on may 16 was further enriched at 8 2 data not shown the swe at the triple g site decreased from 18 54 mm on january 10 to 4 14 mm on february 28 fig 8c the large number of snowpack samples collected in the winter of 2016 2017 highlighted the high spatial and temporal variability of δ18o values fig 8 at the stauffer site the range of δ18o values changed from 15 6 on december 21 to 2 4 on january 4 despite samples being collected at the same locations fig 8a similar changes were observed at the spyhill fig 8b and the triple g site fig 8c at all three sites the lowest variability of snowpack isotopic composition was observed on sampling dates shortly after snowfall january 4 at the stauffer december 9 and february 2 at the spyhill and february 9 and 28 at the triple g the highest variability was observed at the stauffer and spyhill sites on december 21 and 20 respectively during a snow cover depletion event however series of snow samples collected at the spyhill site between january 13 and 19 showed no increase in the variability of the isotopic composition of the remaining snow patches over the course of the snow cover depletion event fig 8b additionally no obvious correlation was observed between δ18o values of the snowpack samples and their swe or density data not shown time lapse photos indicate that none of snow cover depletion events in both winters were caused by rain on snow events instead snow cover depletion coincided with spikes in air temperature during foehn events 4 3 comparison of surface water and groundwater samples snowmelt runoff ponded water and overburden groundwater samples collected at the stauffer site plotted parallel to and slightly below the calgary lmwl fig 9 a runoff and ponded water were isotopically heavier than the long term mean of winter precipitation in 2015 2016 and lighter in 2016 2017 overburden groundwater samples exhibited strong variability with some samples matching the 2015 2016 runoff signature and others approaching annual average and winter precipitation values fig 9a at the triple g site runoff and ponded water followed the same pattern as the stauffer samples were isotopically heavier than the mean winter precipitation in 2015 2016 and lighter in 2016 2017 fig 9b however the ponded water signature evolved over time and deviated from the lmwl following a δ2h δ18o slope of 4 6 in 2015 2016 and 5 6 in 2016 2017 the steeper slope of the 2016 2017 trend line resulted in the convergence of isotopic signatures for samples collected late in spring in both years overburden groundwater samples clustered close to the intersection between the lmwl and the ponded water enrichment line for 2015 2016 the δ18o values of samples collected from overburden piezometers in april 2017 were within 0 1 of the samples collected from the same piezometers in august 2016 bedrock groundwater samples collected at and around the stauffer site and samples from the west nose creek watershed fig 2 located directly north of the spyhill site grieef 2006 as reported in hayashi and farrow 2014 formed distinct clusters on the δ2h δ18o by plot fig 10 a the samples collected in the area around the stauffer site were close to the calgary lmwl and isotopically lighter in contrast the values in the west nose creek watershed deviated further from the lmwl and were isotopically heavier fig 10b the single available sample collected in the vicinity of the triple g site plotted close to the calgary lmwl and was isotopically lighter than the stauffer area samples the trend line through bedrock groundwater samples had the δ2h δ18o slope of 4 67 and intersected lmwl at δ18o value of 20 0 fig 10a 4 4 isotopic composition of pore water extracts the δ18o values of pore water extracts were compared with those of groundwater collected from piezometers screened at the same depth for eight pairs of samples at the stauffer site and triple g sites the δ18o values of pore water extracts deviated from groundwater by 0 8 on average at the stauffer site and 1 4 at the triple g site with the maximum deviation of 1 2 and 1 9 respectively in all but one cases the pore water extracts were isotopically heavier than corresponding groundwater samples possible causes of the deviation and their implication on data interpretation are examined in the discussion section pore water extracts from se2 catchment at the stauffer site showed a strong contrast between upland and depression positions fig 11 a the upper part of the depression profile was isotopically lighter with measured δ18o values below 20 in contrast the upper part of the upland profile was isotopically heavier with δ18o values around 15 both profiles converged to similar values at the elevation corresponding to the water table under both positions see fig 5a for the water table depth groundwater samples collected at the upland and depression positions further showed that δ18o values in the saturated zone occupy the intermediate position between the unsaturated zones in the two positions the pore water δ18o profile under the upland located 650 m northwest of the se2 depression data not shown followed a pattern similar to one under the se2 upland isotopically heavier composition in the unsaturated zone δ18o values 15 7 to 16 8 with a sharp transition to 19 below the water table a different pattern was observed under the gp depression at the spyhill site fig 11b the upland δ18o values gradually increased from the surface down to the elevation of 3 m above depression bottom and remained stable below this level at just under 15 depression values dropped from 16 3 near the surface to nearly 20 at the elevation of 2 m and then increased to upland values over the next few metres and remained constant further down the profile it is important to note that unlike the stauffer se2 depression the elevation of the water table differs between the upland and the depression at spyhill the water table under the depression is close to the surface and higher than the water table under the upland fig 5b pore water extracts from sediments under the catchment of w depression at the triple g site had the narrowest range of δ18o values of the three study sites fig 11c all samples under the depression were in the 18 to 19 range while shallow upland pore water was isotopically heavier at nearly 15 it converged with depression values over the topmost few metres and stayed the same further down the profile as at the stauffer site groundwater samples had similar compositions under the upland and the depression at triple g all signatures for pore water extracts deviated from the calgary lmwl however the magnitude of the shift appears to be relatively constant throughout the study sites and topographical positions with values distributed parallel to the lmwl on the δ18o δ2h by plot data not shown the possible causes and implications of this observation are examined below 5 discussion 5 1 isotopic signatures of snowpack the large spatial variability of snowpack isotopic compositions within each site is evident in the winter 2016 2017 data set fig 8b in which a large number of samples were collected the largest variation was observed in the samples collected during snow cover depletion events e g spyhill site on december 20 and stauffer site on december 21 with some samples becoming noticeably isotopically heavier than both winter mean precipitation and the samples collected earlier at the same site several processes can explain observed changes in snowpack isotopic compositions previous laboratory studies have shown that sublimation leads to a strong enrichment of the topmost layers of the snowpack sokratov and golubev 2009 another possible mechanism is the isotopic fractionation between ice crystals and water within a snowpack during melt laboratory experiments taylor et al 2001 and field observations taylor et al 2002 revealed that the isotopic composition of meltwater discharged from the snowpack evolves markedly over the course of melt events due to preferential release of lighter isotopes similar differences in isotopic composition between ice crystals and water were observed within natural snowpacks zhou et al 2008 consequently meltwater is isotopically lighter than the original snowpack at early stages of melt thus leaving the remaining snowpack more enriched both sublimation and meltwater release affect the swe and the isotopic composition of the snowpack furthermore the same amount of melt sublimation removes a proportionally lower fraction of water from a snowpack with higher swe consequently samples with lower swe are expected to be more strongly affected by melt and or sublimation and as a result become isotopically heavier however no correlation between swe and isotopic composition was observed in this study blowing snow redistribution presents a possible explanation for lack of such correlation preferential erosion of the topmost snow layer isotopically enriched by sublimation during blowing snow can make the snowpack in the ablation zone isotopically lighter and reduce its swe at the same time the opposite may happen in the deposition zone where isotopically enriched snow accumulates combined effects of snow sublimation and redistribution can also explain the changes to the isotopic composition of the snowpack occurring shortly before and during snow cover depletion events simultaneous occurrence of sublimation and redistribution may be linked to blowing snow sublimation observed in the canadian prairies pomeroy and essery 1999 as well as to recurrent foehn events elsewhere foehns were shown to be connected with intensive snow sublimation in other cold regions for example in northern japan hayashi et al 2005 sublimation is associated with a much stronger degree of fractionation than snowmelt as the 18o fractionation factor for ice vapour is ca 1 015 at 0 c ellehoj et al 2013 compared to 1 003 for ice water taylor et al 2001 as a result the isotopic shift from 25 to 20 as observed at spyhill snowpack in december 2016 fig 8b requires a removal of roughly one third of snowpack through sublimation and as much as three quarters through melt according to the rayleigh equation kendall and caldwell 1998 the observed spatial and temporal variability of snowpack isotopic signatures complicates their use in hydrological studies the temporal variability of isotopic signals of meltwater released from a thick snowpack is well known however the effect of spatial variation remains uncertain tetzlaff et al 2015 the present study demonstrates that the range of snowpack δ18o values on a given date may exceed the magnitude of seasonal variation even for samples collected within a depression catchment less than 200 m across thus requiring a large number of samples to estimate mean isotopic composition of the snowpack on a catchment scale 5 2 isotopic signature of snowmelt runoff the data from the stauffer and the triple g sites highlighted the contrast in isotopic compositions between pre melt snowpack and snowmelt runoff the water ponding in the depressions and collected in runoff plots following snowmelt was isotopically heavier than the snowpack before the melt event figs 7 and 8 in case of the winter of 2015 2016 it was also isotopically heavier than the long term average of winter precipitation fig 9a these differences can be attributed to processes generating runoff and transferring it towards the depression data from triple g site indicated a shift in isotopic signatures between pre melt snowpack and runoff collected in runoff plots figs 7c 8c this effect can be partially attributed to a rapid enrichment of snowpack shortly before the runoff generation due to the snow sublimation nevertheless there are possible mechanisms for producing observed isotopic shift during runoff generation itself the first mechanism results from combined effects of snowmelt and infiltration as mentioned above snow melt is associated with the isotopic fractionation between remaining ice crystals and water within the snowpack however this process alone does not explain the observed enrichment of the snowmelt runoff as the mean isotopic composition of meltwater in the absence of other fractionation processes is expected to approach that of the original snowpack based on mass balance considerations the second necessary element for this enrichment mechanism is the preferential infiltration of early snowmelt water while the frozen top soil still has a capacity to accommodate some infiltration this leaves the remaining isotopically enriched snow to generate surface runoff once the frozen soil has no more infiltration capacity it is important to note that net enrichment of runoff is possible only if infiltration constitutes a significant fraction of pre melt snow water equivalent otherwise the bulk isotopic signature of the runoff would approach one of the snowpack this condition is met in the canadian prairies where both cumulative snowmelt infiltration and pre melt snow water equivalents are small typically less than 50 mm e g van der kamp et al 2003 the second possible mechanism for isotopic changes during snowmelt runoff is mixing with or displacement of isotopically heavier water stored in the soil since the warm season such mixing during snowmelt was demonstrated to occur on a hillslope scale in soils with a developed organic layer carey and quinton 2004 given the low swe at the study sites mixing with water stored at the topmost loose part of the soil profile may be sufficient to shift the runoff isotopic signature however apparent enrichment of runoff collected in 6 m long runoff plots requires this process to occur at a scale less than 10 m the aforementioned mechanisms of runoff enrichment as well as snow sublimation discussed earlier cause the enrichment of snowmelt runoff relative to pre melt snowpack composition these processes also share a common feature their effect is stronger in a snowpack with a lower swe for example the infiltration capacity of frozen ground has a finite upper limit likewise potential sublimation during short warm spells is limited by energy inputs as a result preferential removal of lighter isotopes through infiltration and sublimation cannot grow indefinitely with increasing thickness of the snowpack consequently the apparent effect of these processes on the bulk isotopic composition of snowpack will be reduced in thicker snowpacks in comparison with the thin snowpacks median sample swe of 19 mm in the present study similarly larger amounts of snowmelt runoff require mixing with a proportionally larger amount of pre winter soil water 5 3 isotopic signatures of diffuse and focussed recharge using the δ18o values of pore water extracts requires an examination of sources of uncertainty associated with this data the magnitude of observed deviation in δ18o values between pore water extracts and groundwater samples screened at the same depths see results section is similar to the magnitude of the methodological bias shown during spiking tests see methods section however the methodological bias may not be the sole source of these differences the first alternative is enrichment during evaporation which led to water losses during storage however the 5 loss threshold used in the analysis is expected to limit the impact of this process for water with an original δ18o value of 15 a loss of 5 of mass to evaporation would result in an isotopic shift of 0 5 according to the rayleigh equation kendall and caldwell 1998 which is well below the mean shift of 1 28 observed in the spiking experiments another possible mechanism concerns the fact that bulk isotopic composition of soil water differs from its mobile part participating in recharge brooks et al 2010 in this context groundwater samples may be representative of the mobile water while pore water extracts sample both mobile and immobile components however if this is the case the associated shift appears to be relatively constant at the study sites nevertheless this factor coupled with the methodological uncertainty means that absolute δ18o values of pore water extracts should be used with caution and that analysis should focus on relative differences in pore water isotopic compositions another consideration concerns the time scale of processes behind observed isotopic profiles previous studies using the isotopic compositions of soil profiles mostly examined propagation of seasonal isotopic signals maulé et al 1994 mueller et al 2014 stumpp and hendry 2012 in contrast deeper profiles used in this study represent the long term average isotopic signal of recharge fluxes at each site the lack of seasonal signals at this depth is demonstrated by the persistence of the groundwater isotopic composition at the triple g site the isotopic profiles of pore water obtained at the stauffer site highlighted the contrast in hydrological functions between different topographical positions fig 11a the δ18o values of pore water in the vadose zone underneath the depression are approximately 6 lower than in the vadose zone under the upland the magnitude of this shift is much higher than the observed differences between pore water extracts and corresponding piezometer samples or than the average deviation of the spiking tests this fact coupled with persistence of the shift implies that differences between topographical positions are real and consistent with a ponding of the depression predominantly by snowmelt runoff while upland signature may represent annual average inputs depression ponding increases the weight of isotopically lighter winter inputs in the total water input into depression as a result the depression signature becomes more depleted in contrast more enriched pore water under uplands reflects the fact that isotopically heavier summer precipitation plays a major role in total water inputs fig 3b the sharp transition towards intermediate signature below the water table implies that in this specific catchment lateral groundwater flow allows an effective mixing of vertical inputs of water with different isotopic compositions i e no distinct plume of groundwater originating from this depression persists below water table the situation was different in the triple g fig 11c and the spyhill fig 11b sites where the water table under the depressions is consistently higher than under uplands presence of the lateral hydraulic head gradient favours water cycling between topographic positions which promotes mixing of water infiltrating through different pathways fig 1 furthermore dry conditions at the triple g site located further from prairie boundary than other sites fig 2 imply very low if any net downward flux under uplands as a result the contrast in isotopic profiles between topographic positions is weaker at the triple g and the spyhill sites in comparison to the stauffer site nevertheless there was a common feature with the stauffer site profiles namely that the isotopic compositions of shallow upland pore water in both cases were shifted towards warm season precipitation even accounting for a possible bias in the extraction procedure this observation indicates that diffuse recharge at all three sites was characterised by a more enriched the summer like isotopic signature at the same time it remains unclear whether summer like isotopic signature represents a higher contribution of summer precipitation role to diffuse recharge or is a result of the soil processes altering isotopic composition such as evaporation satoh et al 2013 5 4 snowmelt contribution to the groundwater recharge at the study sites the application of stable isotope methods to determine recharge sources relies on the binary end member mixing analysis this technique is based on a simple mass balance equation 1 f c m c 2 c 1 c 2 where c m is measured concentration of a tracer c 1 is the tracer concentration in the end member 1 c2 is the concentration in the end member 2 and ƒ is the fractional contribution of the end member 1 previous studies in the study region hayashi and farrow 2014 maulé et al 1994 used this method to determine the relative contribution of snowmelt runoff by using mean isotopic compositions of winter and summer precipitations as end members the method assumes that mixing occurs along the lmwl between the end members on a δ18o δ2h by plot fig 12 a while any deviation from the lmwl is a result of the evaporative enrichment unrelated to mixing such deviation was observed in both ponded water fig 9b and groundwater fig 10 in order to compensate for this effect the contribution of either source is calculated for an intersection point between the lmwl and the trend line for groundwater maulé et al 1994 application of this method to the bedrock groundwater samples indicates roughly equal contributions of summer and winter precipitations fig 12a however the present study showed that the isotopic composition of snow undergoes a transformation between precipitation events and infiltration in contrast rainwater infiltrates immediately after a precipitation event consequently the end member corresponding to winter inputs becomes shifted towards the summer end member fig 12b the use of the actual input signatures as the winter end member has a strong effect on the perceived role of the different mechanisms of groundwater recharge table 2 the use of 2015 2016 runoff composition from the stauffer site in eq 1 c 1 20 0 c 2 16 2 c m 20 leads to the conclusion that the snowmelt driven focussed recharge is nearly the sole source input to many bedrock wells in the stauffer area and spyhill area the use 2016 2017 runoff composition from the same site c 1 25 6 c 2 16 2 c m 20 on the contrary diminishes the role of depression focussed recharge below the value obtained using seasonal precipitation averages nevertheless due to isotopic evolution of snowpack and snowmelt runoff one can expect that the long term mean of the snowmelt runoff is isotopically heavier than the long term mean of winter precipitation consequently the proportion of snow derived water in groundwater recharge to the bedrock wells is likely higher than the one calculated using seasonal precipitation averages the transformation of the isotopic signature of winter precipitation also has implications for hydrological processes unrelated to a depression focussed recharge as shown earlier accounting for the true composition of snowmelt runoff as opposed to using winter precipitation or pre melt snow pack can increase the apparent contribution of winter precipitation to groundwater recharge in the study area this effect resembles the sensitivity of streamflow separation techniques to assumed melt water compositions schmieder et al 2016 taylor et al 2002 using winter average precipitation or pre melt snowpack samples to represent snowmelt may lead to a bias in estimated end member contributions to stream flow additionally observed evolution of the snowpack affects studies using the amplitudes of seasonal fluctuations of δ18o values to determine the fraction of the young water in the streamflow e g jasechko et al 2016 as only winter precipitation is affected by this process the seasonal amplitude of actual water inputs decreases in comparison to the amplitude of precipitation itself consequently ignoring this effect can lead to an underestimation of the young water fraction 6 conclusions thin snowpacks present a distinct set of challenges in the application of stable isotopic methods as the isotopic signature of snowpack can change rapidly with an increase in its spatial variability this factor greatly complicates the estimation of catchment average snowpack signatures and undermines the use of a winter average precipitation values as their proxy furthermore the isotopic composition of snowmelt runoff generated by complete melting of thin snowpacks differed from pre melt snowpack composition consequently the application of isotopic methods in these conditions requires sampling at each stage of hydrologic pathways at the same time thin snowpack can completely melt within a few days or less allowing us to ignore temporal variability in snowmelt composition over the course of a melt event in contrast in thicker snowpacks the main concern is the evolution of snowmelt isotopic compositions during an extended melt period the use of measured isotopic compositions of snowmelt runoff filling the depressions increased the apparent contribution of depression focussed recharge in the study region in comparison with the estimates using the compositions of winter precipitation as proxies the isotopic composition of ponded snowmelt runoff evolved after ponding event and noticeably changed between years in contrast the groundwater composition beneath the depression remained stable representing the average of depression focussed recharge at the same time examination of pore waters showed distinct differences in isotopic signatures between diffuse and depression focussed recharge pathways overall this study has demonstrated the usefulness of stable isotope methods to quantify the relative contribution of winter precipitation to depression focussed groundwater recharge in the canadian prairies and demonstrated the importance of considering the isotopic shifts of snow derived water at each stage of recharge pathways these findings will be useful for hydrological

7202,application of stable isotope methods to evaluate the contribution of different water sources to groundwater recharge relies on the knowledge about isotopic signatures of these sources the data collected at study sites in the canadian prairies show that snowpack isotopic signatures exhibit a high spatial variability over a small scale 100 m limiting the usefulness of point samples to estimate an average isotopic composition of snow over a large area isotopic signatures of snowmelt runoff can be different from those of pre melt snowpack further undermining the applicability of snow isotopic signature to characterisation of snowmelt driven hydrological processes accounting for the actual signature of snowmelt runoff has strong effects on its perceived role in recharging groundwater the data also show that diffuse and depression focussed components of groundwater recharge have different isotopic signatures where the latter closely resembles snowmelt runoff keywords stable isotopes snow snowmelt runoff groundwater recharge canadian prairies 1 introduction snowpack accumulation and depletion are important elements of the hydrologic cycle in many parts of the world lehning 2013 lundberg et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2015 and have long attracted scholarly attention stable isotopes of water have become a key tool for investigating the role of snow derived water in various hydrological processes tetzlaff et al 2015 however the application of isotopic techniques is complicated by a number of processes affecting isotopic signatures of snow and snowmelt water snowpack exposure to the atmosphere results in sublimation which causes an isotopic enrichment of the remaining snow gustafson et al 2010 additionally isotopic composition of meltwater changes during extended melt periods as the preferential release of lighter isotopes leads to a progressive isotopic enrichment of the residual snowpack taylor et al 2001 the resulting isotopic shift between the original snowfall and meltwater if unaccounted for can introduce biases into hydrological investigations earman et al 2006 laudon et al 2002 taylor et al 2002 this prompted studies examining environmental factors governing the isotopic composition of snowpack and meltwater such as slope aspect dahlke and lyon 2013 dietermann and weiler 2013 schmieder et al 2016 snow thickness unnikrishna et al 2002 freeze thaw cycles zhou et al 2008 and land cover koeniger et al 2008 as well as attempts to model the evolution of meltwater isotopic composition ala aho et al 2017 feng et al 2002 however previous studies were mostly conducted in mountainous and or humid areas where the snow water equivalent of snowpack reaches hundreds of mm the extent to which the aforementioned processes apply to low relief areas with thinner snowpacks remains unclear for example a thin snowpack can melt completely over just a few days thereby releasing water in a single short event in these circumstances preferential release of lighter isotopes is expected to have little effect on isotopic composition of the meltwater pulse furthermore snow cover depletion in flat terrains occurs simultaneously throughout most of the landscape thus smoothing out differences in meltwater generation between slopes of different aspects such uncertainty warrants further investigation of factors affecting isotopic composition of snow derived water in low relief regions with thin snowpacks the present study was motivated by the need to evaluate the role of snowmelt water in groundwater recharge in the canadian prairies a semi arid region with relatively thin snowpacks burn et al 2008 it has been long hypothesised that groundwater recharge in this region to a large extent depends on seasonal ponding of small depressions by snowmelt runoff see the study site section for a detailed description using seasonal isotopic signatures of precipitation in a binary mixing model maulé et al 1994 showed that winter precipitation contributed as much as 44 of groundwater recharge even though it accounted only for a 21 of total precipitation however aforementioned literature regarding the isotopic signature of snow derived water indicates potential problems in the direct use of precipitation signatures in mixing models the conceptual model of groundwater recharge in the canadian prairies includes two possible recharge pathways depression focussed recharge associated with surface ponding keller et al 1988 van der kamp and hayashi 1998 and diffuse recharge resulting from the percolation of water under both depressions and surrounding uplands zebarth and de jong 1989 fig 1 the depression focussed recharge pathway has several stages with a potential to affect the isotopic signature of water inputs pre melt snowpack exposure to the atmosphere snowmelt runoff generation ponded water exposure to the atmosphere and water percolation through the root zone under the depression therefore the application of binary mixing models requires information about isotopic shifts along the recharge pathway the primary objective of the present study is to evaluate the contribution of snow derived water to groundwater recharge in the western part of the canadian prairies using the end member analysis of stable isotopes of water achieving this goal requires identification of processes affecting the isotopic composition of snowpack and meltwater in cold semi arid settings 2 study sites the study was conducted near the western edge of the canadian prairies which is a part of a broader region known as northern prairies winter 1989 fig 2 this region has a dry and cold climate and glaciated terrains characterised by numerous small internally drained depressions known as potholes or sloughs annual potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation throughout the canadian prairies sauchyn et al 2002 thus greatly reducing the amount of water left for surface runoff and groundwater recharge however this effect is modulated by a complex interplay between the local topography and climate previous studies showed that frozen soil plays a crucial role in generating snowmelt runoff from the uplands surrounding individual depressions which leads to ponding of depressions daniel and staricka 2000 hayashi et al 1998 as a result of such ponding the water availability within depressions surpasses evaporative demands allowing the excess water to recharge groundwater through the process commonly referred to as depression focussed recharge fig 1 the climate in the study region varies from relatively humid in the west and northwest to dry in the south and southeast this climatic gradient is reflected in the vegetation cover resulting in varying ecoregions government of alberta 2005 proximity to the rocky mountains results in the regular occurrence of foehn events locally known as chinooks particularly in the western part of the study region nkemdirim 1996 in order to account for the effects of the climatic gradient on groundwater recharge processes the study was conducted at three sites located in the parkland and grassland ecoregions fig 2 the study sites have the common defining features of the northern prairies the landscape dominated by glacial landforms including numerous small depressions and the semi arid continental climate with a strong seasonality the stauffer and spyhill sites are located in the parkland ecoregion a transition zone between semi arid grassland and boreal forest and the triple g site is located in the more arid grassland ecoregion fig 2 all sites have cold winters and hot summers with mean annual temperature 1956 2005 of 3 1 3 8 and 4 2 c at neighboring long term weather stations in olds gleichen and calgary respectively precipitation has a high seasonal variability with monthly precipitation during summer months several times higher than in winter fig 3 a the isotopic composition of precipitation also has a pronounced seasonality fig 3b with summer δ18o values approaching 15 and winter values well below 25 at the stauffer site the study was primarily conducted in a catchment of a small depression referred to as se2 with additional investigation in a catchment referred to as se1 located 300 m east of se2 fig 4 a the surficial cover in this area is generally formed by glacial till fenton et al 2013 however drilling within the se2 catchment revealed that the bedrock in this location is overlain by a layer of sandy unconsolidated sediment whereas the bedrock under se1 catchment is overlain by clay rich glacial till these sediments are 7 12 m thick and overlay the paleocene paskapoo formation a fluvial system consisting of sandstone channels embedded within relatively impermeable mudstone grasby et al 2008 at the time of the study the stauffer site was used as a summer pasture for cattle with vegetation cover formed mostly by timothy phleum pratense and alfalfa medicago sativa at the spyhill site the study was conducted at a depression referred to as gp fig 4b located in an open grassland dominated by smooth brome bromus inermis mohammed et al 2013 which was previously used for cattle grazing but has not been grazed since 2006 the site is covered by clay rich glacial till with average thickness of 13 m overlaying a 19 m thick layer of mostly unsaturated gravel eba engineering consultants 2003 a previous study in a depression located 350 m north of gp found the perched water table within the till van dijk 2005 at the triple g site the study was conducted in catchments of two adjacent depressions referred to as w and e fig 4c focussing mainly on w the area is covered by glacial till fenton et al 2013 which is underlain by the cretaceous paleocene scollard formation prior et al 2013 at the time of the present study the entire site was used as a summer pasture for cattle with vegetation cover formed mostly by smooth brome bromus inermis due to the variation in the surficial sediments at the study sites all unconsolidated sediments are hereafter referred to as overburden similarly the underlying sedimentary rocks of the scollard and paskapoo formations are referred to as bedrock hydraulic heads within the overburden at the stauffer spyhill and triple g sites measured in early december 2016 during period with limited water inputs due to soil freezing highlight the differences in hydrogeological conditions among the three sites fig 5 depression se2 at stauffer site lacks strong horizontal and vertical gradients with roughly the same hydraulic heads under the depression and the adjacent upland in contrast both the spyhill and the triple g sites had strong downward gradients under the depressions as well as higher hydraulic heads under depressions than under the uplands despite the absence of surface ponding at the time of measurement this pattern persisted throughout the year at all three sites with addition of short term rises in hydraulic heads under the depressions in spring 3 methods to characterise changes in isotopic signatures along recharge pathways fig 1 water samples from each stage of surface and subsurface flow pathways were collected and analysed as described below 3 1 snowpack sampling and monitoring depth integrated snowpack samples were collected in sealed plastic bags at the study sites throughout the winters of 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 table 1 using a meteorological service of canada msc snow sampler with an internal diameter of 70 mm dixon and boon 2012 the depth and weight of each sample was recorded during sampling in order to calculate density and snow water equivalent swe of each sample the samples were collected at the same locations at each study site during both winters during the winter of 2015 2016 only two to three samples were kept for analysis on each sampling date in the winter of 2016 2017 all samples were kept for analysis on each sampling date six samples were collected at the stauffer site three in the catchment of se1 and three in se2 fig 4a thirteen samples at the spyhill site nine in gp fig 4b and four in a catchment 600 m north of gp and five samples at the triple g site all in the catchment of w fig 4c additional samples were collected at the spyhill site during a midwinter snowmelt event in the gp depression catchment on january 17 five samples and 19 three samples 2017 snowpack conditions at the study sites were monitored throughout both winters using time lapse cameras wingscapes timelapsecam which took photos five times per day the photos were then manually classified to describe snowpack conditions within the field of view continuous snow cover no snow free patches observed discontinuous snow cover isolated snow free patches observed sporadic only isolated patch of snow cover remain and no snow no patches of snow cover remain 3 2 runoff ponded water and groundwater sampling snowmelt runoff samples were collected from runoff plots fig 4 consisting of aluminium panels protruding 5 10 cm above the ground and isolating the plot 9 m2 from the rest of the slope a gravel filled gutter at the downslope end of the runoff plot and an underground pipe connecting the gutter to a buried 180 l plastic barrel the runoff plot was designed to minimise possible changes in isotopic signatures of the collected snowmelt runoff for example the access pipe to the barrel was capped to reduce evaporation in addition a small amount of available energy and a large volume of runoff at least tens of litres reduced the effect of evaporative enrichment on the bulk isotopic composition the same factors also increased the thermal inertia which slowed freezing furthermore the barrel was straddling the lower boundary of the frost zone meaning that the surrounding soil temperature was not far below zero even during the coldest periods further reducing freezing rate and presenting an opportunity to pump out the collected water before it froze the barrels were pumped dry in november 2015 runoff samples were collected at the stauffer and triple sites in february march 2016 following the filling of the barrels after snowmelt table 1 after each sampling event the barrel was pumped dry to prevent dilution of subsequent inputs with runoff from earlier events three samples were collected from each runoff plot at the stauffer site on three different dates only two samples were taken from the runoff plot at the triple g site additionally ponded water samples were collected during the same period from ponded depressions se1 and se2 at the stauffer site and depressions w and e at the triple g site no runoff or ponded water samples were collected from the spyhill site as it generated negligible amount of runoff during the winter of 2015 2016 the sampling of runoff and ponded water was repeated during the winter of 2016 2017 table 1 storage barrels were pumped dry in september 2016 at the stauffer site and in october 2016 at the spyhill and triple g sites runoff samples were collected at the triple g site in february march 2017 at the stauffer site in march april 2017 and at spyhill site in march 2017 following snowmelt events the sampling of ponded water in the depressions started only in march 2017 as refreezing of ponded water prevented sampling in february at the stauffer and triple g sites the ponding of the depression at the spyhill site occurred only in march groundwater samples were collected at the stauffer and triple g sites in the summer of 2016 using previously installed piezometers fig 4 with screen depths ranging from 2 to 12 m below the bottom of depressions fig 5 at the stauffer site water samples were collected from piezometers screened in the overburden the piezometers were pumped dry on june 28 and left to recover for two days after which they were sampled using a peristaltic pump five additional groundwater samples were collected on june 28 from piezometers screened in the underlying paskapoo bedrock in this case a submersible pump was used to continuously pump three well volumes of water out of the piezometers prior to sample collection at the triple g site samples were collected on august 9 from three piezometers one at the upland and two at the depression screened in the overburden owing to much slower response of piezometers at triple g they were sampled using bailers without pumping them dry additionally a single sample was collected from the household well screened within bedrock which is located 3 km north of the triple g site using a submergible pump installed in the well the sampling of piezometers at the triple g site was repeated on april 28 2017 when the depression was still ponded at this time all three depression piezometers fig 5 were sampled using a peristaltic pump 3 3 snow and water samples storage and analysis snow samples were completely melted in a refrigerator filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filter and stored in 20 ml scintillation vials in the refrigerator until analysis runoff ponded water and groundwater samples were filtered and stored in scintillation vials in the refrigerator until analysis all samples were analysed at the university of calgary isotope science laboratory isl using an off axis integrated cavity laser spectroscopy isotope analyser losgatosresearch dlt 100 with a nominal accuracy of 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ 18o in addition to the groundwater samples listed above thirteen bedrock groundwater samples were collected from household pumping wells in the area surrounding the stauffer site the samples were filtered during sampling and stored in the refrigerator until they were submitted for analysis to the isl 3 4 pore water extraction and analysis overburden sediment samples were collected during drilling at the study sites in october november 2014 in two boreholes upland and depression at the gp catchment in the spyhill site fig 4b three boreholes two in upland and one in depression at the w catchment in the triple g site fig 4c two boreholes upland and depression at the se1 catchment in the stauffer site fig 4a and a single borehole at an upland located 650 m north west of se2 in the stauffer site not in fig 4a an additional set of samples was collected from two boreholes upland and depression at the se2 catchment in the stauffer site fig 4a in october 2015 the samples were collected using an auger wrap technique keller and van der kamp 1988 at 0 75 m intervals placed in sealed glass jars and weighed simultaneously duplicates for each sample were collected in plastic bags in order to estimate original gravimetric water content five sub samples weighing roughly 50 g each were taken from each duplicate sample shortly after sampling the subsamples were weighed oven dried at 110 c for 24 h and re weighed the calculated value of gravimetric water content was used to estimate the original amount of water in the samples stored in glass jars pore water from the sediment samples was analysed by the direct equilibration method koehler et al 2000 using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry cf irms the laboratory setup consisted of an on line gas preparation system thermo scientific finnigan ii gasbench coupled to a mass spectrometer thermo scientific delta v plus two small sub samples at least 4 mg each were taken from each glass jar and placed in 12 ml vials together with hokko beads platinum containing catalyst for hydrogen water equilibration and flushed with h2 for 2h analysis and with co2 for 18o analysis for approximately 10 min at a rate of 80 100 ml min following the flushing samples were left to equilibrate with h2 for 4 h and with co2 for 12 h respectively afterwards samples were put into the gas preparation system for analysis the accuracy of this method was assessed using a number of spiking tests which involved addition of the water standards with known isotopic composition to quartz sand and oven dried overburden samples collected from one meter depth in w depression at the triple g site the average deviation of measured values from the original water was 2 09 for δ2h and 0 26 for δ18o in case of quartz sand and as high as 10 47 for δ2h and 1 28 for δ18o in case of overburden samples in case of overburden samples the direction of the shift in measured isotopic signature relative to the standard varied between experiments negative shifts were observed when the isotopically heavy standard δ18o of 7 3 was used and positive shifts were observed when the isotopically light standard δ18o of 34 9 was used lennon 2016 the magnitude of errors uncovered in spiking tests is comparable with reported error values for the cryogenic extraction which is widely used for the determination of pore water isotopic signature orlowski et al 2016 owing to a long storage time up to a year in glass jars some samples experienced noticeable water loss as such those samples that lost more than 5 of the original water were omitted from the analysis the amount of water loss was inferred by comparing the weight of the jars immediately after sampling and prior to stable isotope analysis in three boreholes the majority of samples surpassed the loss threshold and were omitted both upland and depression boreholes at se1 depression at the stauffer site as well as one of upland boreholes at the triple g site 4 results 4 1 isotopic composition of surface water samples winter 2015 2016 isotopic compositions of snowpack samples from the study sites plot along the local meteoric water line lmwl in calgary peng et al 2004 for both winters fig 6 snowpack δ18o values in the samples collected in winter 2015 2016 n 37 had a mean of 23 3 with a standard deviation of 1 8 and those collected in winter 2016 2017 n 127 had a mean of 26 2 with a standard deviation of 3 5 in the winter 2015 2016 snowpack δ18o values at the stauffer site varied between 25 6 and 20 1 fig 7 a which is close to the precipitation weighted average of 23 7 for november april in calgary peng et al 2004 the snowpack isotopic composition showed some spatial variability with the range of δ18o values up to 3 on a same sampling date the swe of snowpack samples at this site increased over winter from 8 mm on december 1 to 48 mm on march 9 fig 7a following the partial snow cover depletion ending on february 19 runoff samples were collected from se1 depression and the two runoff plots these samples had δ18o values in the range of 20 6 to 19 7 and were noticeably more enriched than pre melt snow samples fig 7a later runoff events following the snow cover depletion on march 1 8 yielded δ18o values similar to those after the february event the δ18o values of ponded water in the two depressions in mid march were consistent with the isotopic composition of the water sampled from the runoff plots snowpack samples collected at the triple g site prior to snowmelt events on january 22 24 and 27 31 in winter 2015 2016 had δ18o values of 25 0 to 26 2 fig 7b the swe increased from the minimum of 6 mm on december 10 to the maximum of 187 mm on january 20 the high value on january 20 resulted from snowdrift formation at one of the sampling points as snowpack was present at this site only sporadically after the late january melt event no snow samples were collected in february and march runoff samples collected from the two ponded depressions and the runoff plot after the melt event had δ18o values of 22 2 to 21 0 and were more enriched than the antecedent snowpack fig 7b a similar δ18o value of 20 6 was obtained for the sample collected from the runoff plot after the complete snow cover depletion on march 1 ponded water samples collected on march 18 were isotopically heavier at 18 8 to 18 5 than ones collected earlier fig 7b samples collected from the two depressions on april 6 were enriched further with δ18o of 9 8 and 13 7 data not shown it is worth noting that both ponded depressions were reduced to puddles around 10 cm deep by this time 4 2 isotopic composition of surface water samples winter 2016 2017 in the winter of 2016 2017 up to the end of january snowpack isotopic compositions at the stauffer site remained similar to the one recorded in 2015 2016 with the mean δ18o value on each sampling date ranging between 25 5 and 23 1 fig 8 a the snowpack sampled on february 13 was isotopically lighter and outside of the range recorded in the 2015 2016 with a mean δ18o value of 27 4 the samples collected on march 3 had a mean δ18o value of 24 2 compared with 21 5 in 2015 2016 the samples of runoff collected on march 3 and april 4 had mean δ18o values of 25 4 and 23 2 respectively the ponded water sample collected from se2 depression on march 3 had δ18o value of 26 9 the ponded water samples from se1 depression had δ18o values of 24 3 on march 3 and 22 2 on april 4 the swe increased over the course of the season from 5 10 mm on december 7 to 17 52 mm february 13 following the melt event the swe of the samples dropped to 7 35 mm on march 3 fig 8a at the spyhill site changes in snowpack isotopic compositions over the winter of 2016 2017 followed the same pattern as at the stauffer site with mean values ranging from 26 4 to 22 5 up to the end of january fig 8b snowpack samples collected on february 10 and march 10 had mean δ18o values of 31 2 and 30 2 respectively the δ18o values of runoff and ponded water samples collected on march 15 were similar to ones recorded at the stauffer site at 26 0 and 24 8 respectively the ponded water sample collected on april 21 was isotopically much heavier at 17 0 the swe at the spyhill site followed an upward trend in december january with values closely resembling the stauffer site the swe increased from 5 9 mm on december 9 to 10 42 mm on january 6 fig 8b and ranged between 7 and 151 mm during the melt event on january 13 19 the increased swe for the samples collected during the melt event resulted from sampling of the closest snowdrifts after snow cover disappeared at some sampling points after the melt event swe was 20 32 mm on february 10 and 7 52 mm on march 10 at the triple g site mean δ18o values of snow samples on january 10 february 9 and february 28 were 26 5 30 7 and 26 0 respectively fig 8c the sample collected from the runoff plot had a δ18o value of 22 3 while samples collected later in the season were similar to ones from other two sites varying from 27 5 to 24 6 the δ18o values of ponded water in the two depressions remained close to each other with a mean of 26 4 on march 21 22 9 on april 4 and 15 5 on april 28 fig 8c the sample collected from depression e on may 16 was further enriched at 8 2 data not shown the swe at the triple g site decreased from 18 54 mm on january 10 to 4 14 mm on february 28 fig 8c the large number of snowpack samples collected in the winter of 2016 2017 highlighted the high spatial and temporal variability of δ18o values fig 8 at the stauffer site the range of δ18o values changed from 15 6 on december 21 to 2 4 on january 4 despite samples being collected at the same locations fig 8a similar changes were observed at the spyhill fig 8b and the triple g site fig 8c at all three sites the lowest variability of snowpack isotopic composition was observed on sampling dates shortly after snowfall january 4 at the stauffer december 9 and february 2 at the spyhill and february 9 and 28 at the triple g the highest variability was observed at the stauffer and spyhill sites on december 21 and 20 respectively during a snow cover depletion event however series of snow samples collected at the spyhill site between january 13 and 19 showed no increase in the variability of the isotopic composition of the remaining snow patches over the course of the snow cover depletion event fig 8b additionally no obvious correlation was observed between δ18o values of the snowpack samples and their swe or density data not shown time lapse photos indicate that none of snow cover depletion events in both winters were caused by rain on snow events instead snow cover depletion coincided with spikes in air temperature during foehn events 4 3 comparison of surface water and groundwater samples snowmelt runoff ponded water and overburden groundwater samples collected at the stauffer site plotted parallel to and slightly below the calgary lmwl fig 9 a runoff and ponded water were isotopically heavier than the long term mean of winter precipitation in 2015 2016 and lighter in 2016 2017 overburden groundwater samples exhibited strong variability with some samples matching the 2015 2016 runoff signature and others approaching annual average and winter precipitation values fig 9a at the triple g site runoff and ponded water followed the same pattern as the stauffer samples were isotopically heavier than the mean winter precipitation in 2015 2016 and lighter in 2016 2017 fig 9b however the ponded water signature evolved over time and deviated from the lmwl following a δ2h δ18o slope of 4 6 in 2015 2016 and 5 6 in 2016 2017 the steeper slope of the 2016 2017 trend line resulted in the convergence of isotopic signatures for samples collected late in spring in both years overburden groundwater samples clustered close to the intersection between the lmwl and the ponded water enrichment line for 2015 2016 the δ18o values of samples collected from overburden piezometers in april 2017 were within 0 1 of the samples collected from the same piezometers in august 2016 bedrock groundwater samples collected at and around the stauffer site and samples from the west nose creek watershed fig 2 located directly north of the spyhill site grieef 2006 as reported in hayashi and farrow 2014 formed distinct clusters on the δ2h δ18o by plot fig 10 a the samples collected in the area around the stauffer site were close to the calgary lmwl and isotopically lighter in contrast the values in the west nose creek watershed deviated further from the lmwl and were isotopically heavier fig 10b the single available sample collected in the vicinity of the triple g site plotted close to the calgary lmwl and was isotopically lighter than the stauffer area samples the trend line through bedrock groundwater samples had the δ2h δ18o slope of 4 67 and intersected lmwl at δ18o value of 20 0 fig 10a 4 4 isotopic composition of pore water extracts the δ18o values of pore water extracts were compared with those of groundwater collected from piezometers screened at the same depth for eight pairs of samples at the stauffer site and triple g sites the δ18o values of pore water extracts deviated from groundwater by 0 8 on average at the stauffer site and 1 4 at the triple g site with the maximum deviation of 1 2 and 1 9 respectively in all but one cases the pore water extracts were isotopically heavier than corresponding groundwater samples possible causes of the deviation and their implication on data interpretation are examined in the discussion section pore water extracts from se2 catchment at the stauffer site showed a strong contrast between upland and depression positions fig 11 a the upper part of the depression profile was isotopically lighter with measured δ18o values below 20 in contrast the upper part of the upland profile was isotopically heavier with δ18o values around 15 both profiles converged to similar values at the elevation corresponding to the water table under both positions see fig 5a for the water table depth groundwater samples collected at the upland and depression positions further showed that δ18o values in the saturated zone occupy the intermediate position between the unsaturated zones in the two positions the pore water δ18o profile under the upland located 650 m northwest of the se2 depression data not shown followed a pattern similar to one under the se2 upland isotopically heavier composition in the unsaturated zone δ18o values 15 7 to 16 8 with a sharp transition to 19 below the water table a different pattern was observed under the gp depression at the spyhill site fig 11b the upland δ18o values gradually increased from the surface down to the elevation of 3 m above depression bottom and remained stable below this level at just under 15 depression values dropped from 16 3 near the surface to nearly 20 at the elevation of 2 m and then increased to upland values over the next few metres and remained constant further down the profile it is important to note that unlike the stauffer se2 depression the elevation of the water table differs between the upland and the depression at spyhill the water table under the depression is close to the surface and higher than the water table under the upland fig 5b pore water extracts from sediments under the catchment of w depression at the triple g site had the narrowest range of δ18o values of the three study sites fig 11c all samples under the depression were in the 18 to 19 range while shallow upland pore water was isotopically heavier at nearly 15 it converged with depression values over the topmost few metres and stayed the same further down the profile as at the stauffer site groundwater samples had similar compositions under the upland and the depression at triple g all signatures for pore water extracts deviated from the calgary lmwl however the magnitude of the shift appears to be relatively constant throughout the study sites and topographical positions with values distributed parallel to the lmwl on the δ18o δ2h by plot data not shown the possible causes and implications of this observation are examined below 5 discussion 5 1 isotopic signatures of snowpack the large spatial variability of snowpack isotopic compositions within each site is evident in the winter 2016 2017 data set fig 8b in which a large number of samples were collected the largest variation was observed in the samples collected during snow cover depletion events e g spyhill site on december 20 and stauffer site on december 21 with some samples becoming noticeably isotopically heavier than both winter mean precipitation and the samples collected earlier at the same site several processes can explain observed changes in snowpack isotopic compositions previous laboratory studies have shown that sublimation leads to a strong enrichment of the topmost layers of the snowpack sokratov and golubev 2009 another possible mechanism is the isotopic fractionation between ice crystals and water within a snowpack during melt laboratory experiments taylor et al 2001 and field observations taylor et al 2002 revealed that the isotopic composition of meltwater discharged from the snowpack evolves markedly over the course of melt events due to preferential release of lighter isotopes similar differences in isotopic composition between ice crystals and water were observed within natural snowpacks zhou et al 2008 consequently meltwater is isotopically lighter than the original snowpack at early stages of melt thus leaving the remaining snowpack more enriched both sublimation and meltwater release affect the swe and the isotopic composition of the snowpack furthermore the same amount of melt sublimation removes a proportionally lower fraction of water from a snowpack with higher swe consequently samples with lower swe are expected to be more strongly affected by melt and or sublimation and as a result become isotopically heavier however no correlation between swe and isotopic composition was observed in this study blowing snow redistribution presents a possible explanation for lack of such correlation preferential erosion of the topmost snow layer isotopically enriched by sublimation during blowing snow can make the snowpack in the ablation zone isotopically lighter and reduce its swe at the same time the opposite may happen in the deposition zone where isotopically enriched snow accumulates combined effects of snow sublimation and redistribution can also explain the changes to the isotopic composition of the snowpack occurring shortly before and during snow cover depletion events simultaneous occurrence of sublimation and redistribution may be linked to blowing snow sublimation observed in the canadian prairies pomeroy and essery 1999 as well as to recurrent foehn events elsewhere foehns were shown to be connected with intensive snow sublimation in other cold regions for example in northern japan hayashi et al 2005 sublimation is associated with a much stronger degree of fractionation than snowmelt as the 18o fractionation factor for ice vapour is ca 1 015 at 0 c ellehoj et al 2013 compared to 1 003 for ice water taylor et al 2001 as a result the isotopic shift from 25 to 20 as observed at spyhill snowpack in december 2016 fig 8b requires a removal of roughly one third of snowpack through sublimation and as much as three quarters through melt according to the rayleigh equation kendall and caldwell 1998 the observed spatial and temporal variability of snowpack isotopic signatures complicates their use in hydrological studies the temporal variability of isotopic signals of meltwater released from a thick snowpack is well known however the effect of spatial variation remains uncertain tetzlaff et al 2015 the present study demonstrates that the range of snowpack δ18o values on a given date may exceed the magnitude of seasonal variation even for samples collected within a depression catchment less than 200 m across thus requiring a large number of samples to estimate mean isotopic composition of the snowpack on a catchment scale 5 2 isotopic signature of snowmelt runoff the data from the stauffer and the triple g sites highlighted the contrast in isotopic compositions between pre melt snowpack and snowmelt runoff the water ponding in the depressions and collected in runoff plots following snowmelt was isotopically heavier than the snowpack before the melt event figs 7 and 8 in case of the winter of 2015 2016 it was also isotopically heavier than the long term average of winter precipitation fig 9a these differences can be attributed to processes generating runoff and transferring it towards the depression data from triple g site indicated a shift in isotopic signatures between pre melt snowpack and runoff collected in runoff plots figs 7c 8c this effect can be partially attributed to a rapid enrichment of snowpack shortly before the runoff generation due to the snow sublimation nevertheless there are possible mechanisms for producing observed isotopic shift during runoff generation itself the first mechanism results from combined effects of snowmelt and infiltration as mentioned above snow melt is associated with the isotopic fractionation between remaining ice crystals and water within the snowpack however this process alone does not explain the observed enrichment of the snowmelt runoff as the mean isotopic composition of meltwater in the absence of other fractionation processes is expected to approach that of the original snowpack based on mass balance considerations the second necessary element for this enrichment mechanism is the preferential infiltration of early snowmelt water while the frozen top soil still has a capacity to accommodate some infiltration this leaves the remaining isotopically enriched snow to generate surface runoff once the frozen soil has no more infiltration capacity it is important to note that net enrichment of runoff is possible only if infiltration constitutes a significant fraction of pre melt snow water equivalent otherwise the bulk isotopic signature of the runoff would approach one of the snowpack this condition is met in the canadian prairies where both cumulative snowmelt infiltration and pre melt snow water equivalents are small typically less than 50 mm e g van der kamp et al 2003 the second possible mechanism for isotopic changes during snowmelt runoff is mixing with or displacement of isotopically heavier water stored in the soil since the warm season such mixing during snowmelt was demonstrated to occur on a hillslope scale in soils with a developed organic layer carey and quinton 2004 given the low swe at the study sites mixing with water stored at the topmost loose part of the soil profile may be sufficient to shift the runoff isotopic signature however apparent enrichment of runoff collected in 6 m long runoff plots requires this process to occur at a scale less than 10 m the aforementioned mechanisms of runoff enrichment as well as snow sublimation discussed earlier cause the enrichment of snowmelt runoff relative to pre melt snowpack composition these processes also share a common feature their effect is stronger in a snowpack with a lower swe for example the infiltration capacity of frozen ground has a finite upper limit likewise potential sublimation during short warm spells is limited by energy inputs as a result preferential removal of lighter isotopes through infiltration and sublimation cannot grow indefinitely with increasing thickness of the snowpack consequently the apparent effect of these processes on the bulk isotopic composition of snowpack will be reduced in thicker snowpacks in comparison with the thin snowpacks median sample swe of 19 mm in the present study similarly larger amounts of snowmelt runoff require mixing with a proportionally larger amount of pre winter soil water 5 3 isotopic signatures of diffuse and focussed recharge using the δ18o values of pore water extracts requires an examination of sources of uncertainty associated with this data the magnitude of observed deviation in δ18o values between pore water extracts and groundwater samples screened at the same depths see results section is similar to the magnitude of the methodological bias shown during spiking tests see methods section however the methodological bias may not be the sole source of these differences the first alternative is enrichment during evaporation which led to water losses during storage however the 5 loss threshold used in the analysis is expected to limit the impact of this process for water with an original δ18o value of 15 a loss of 5 of mass to evaporation would result in an isotopic shift of 0 5 according to the rayleigh equation kendall and caldwell 1998 which is well below the mean shift of 1 28 observed in the spiking experiments another possible mechanism concerns the fact that bulk isotopic composition of soil water differs from its mobile part participating in recharge brooks et al 2010 in this context groundwater samples may be representative of the mobile water while pore water extracts sample both mobile and immobile components however if this is the case the associated shift appears to be relatively constant at the study sites nevertheless this factor coupled with the methodological uncertainty means that absolute δ18o values of pore water extracts should be used with caution and that analysis should focus on relative differences in pore water isotopic compositions another consideration concerns the time scale of processes behind observed isotopic profiles previous studies using the isotopic compositions of soil profiles mostly examined propagation of seasonal isotopic signals maulé et al 1994 mueller et al 2014 stumpp and hendry 2012 in contrast deeper profiles used in this study represent the long term average isotopic signal of recharge fluxes at each site the lack of seasonal signals at this depth is demonstrated by the persistence of the groundwater isotopic composition at the triple g site the isotopic profiles of pore water obtained at the stauffer site highlighted the contrast in hydrological functions between different topographical positions fig 11a the δ18o values of pore water in the vadose zone underneath the depression are approximately 6 lower than in the vadose zone under the upland the magnitude of this shift is much higher than the observed differences between pore water extracts and corresponding piezometer samples or than the average deviation of the spiking tests this fact coupled with persistence of the shift implies that differences between topographical positions are real and consistent with a ponding of the depression predominantly by snowmelt runoff while upland signature may represent annual average inputs depression ponding increases the weight of isotopically lighter winter inputs in the total water input into depression as a result the depression signature becomes more depleted in contrast more enriched pore water under uplands reflects the fact that isotopically heavier summer precipitation plays a major role in total water inputs fig 3b the sharp transition towards intermediate signature below the water table implies that in this specific catchment lateral groundwater flow allows an effective mixing of vertical inputs of water with different isotopic compositions i e no distinct plume of groundwater originating from this depression persists below water table the situation was different in the triple g fig 11c and the spyhill fig 11b sites where the water table under the depressions is consistently higher than under uplands presence of the lateral hydraulic head gradient favours water cycling between topographic positions which promotes mixing of water infiltrating through different pathways fig 1 furthermore dry conditions at the triple g site located further from prairie boundary than other sites fig 2 imply very low if any net downward flux under uplands as a result the contrast in isotopic profiles between topographic positions is weaker at the triple g and the spyhill sites in comparison to the stauffer site nevertheless there was a common feature with the stauffer site profiles namely that the isotopic compositions of shallow upland pore water in both cases were shifted towards warm season precipitation even accounting for a possible bias in the extraction procedure this observation indicates that diffuse recharge at all three sites was characterised by a more enriched the summer like isotopic signature at the same time it remains unclear whether summer like isotopic signature represents a higher contribution of summer precipitation role to diffuse recharge or is a result of the soil processes altering isotopic composition such as evaporation satoh et al 2013 5 4 snowmelt contribution to the groundwater recharge at the study sites the application of stable isotope methods to determine recharge sources relies on the binary end member mixing analysis this technique is based on a simple mass balance equation 1 f c m c 2 c 1 c 2 where c m is measured concentration of a tracer c 1 is the tracer concentration in the end member 1 c2 is the concentration in the end member 2 and ƒ is the fractional contribution of the end member 1 previous studies in the study region hayashi and farrow 2014 maulé et al 1994 used this method to determine the relative contribution of snowmelt runoff by using mean isotopic compositions of winter and summer precipitations as end members the method assumes that mixing occurs along the lmwl between the end members on a δ18o δ2h by plot fig 12 a while any deviation from the lmwl is a result of the evaporative enrichment unrelated to mixing such deviation was observed in both ponded water fig 9b and groundwater fig 10 in order to compensate for this effect the contribution of either source is calculated for an intersection point between the lmwl and the trend line for groundwater maulé et al 1994 application of this method to the bedrock groundwater samples indicates roughly equal contributions of summer and winter precipitations fig 12a however the present study showed that the isotopic composition of snow undergoes a transformation between precipitation events and infiltration in contrast rainwater infiltrates immediately after a precipitation event consequently the end member corresponding to winter inputs becomes shifted towards the summer end member fig 12b the use of the actual input signatures as the winter end member has a strong effect on the perceived role of the different mechanisms of groundwater recharge table 2 the use of 2015 2016 runoff composition from the stauffer site in eq 1 c 1 20 0 c 2 16 2 c m 20 leads to the conclusion that the snowmelt driven focussed recharge is nearly the sole source input to many bedrock wells in the stauffer area and spyhill area the use 2016 2017 runoff composition from the same site c 1 25 6 c 2 16 2 c m 20 on the contrary diminishes the role of depression focussed recharge below the value obtained using seasonal precipitation averages nevertheless due to isotopic evolution of snowpack and snowmelt runoff one can expect that the long term mean of the snowmelt runoff is isotopically heavier than the long term mean of winter precipitation consequently the proportion of snow derived water in groundwater recharge to the bedrock wells is likely higher than the one calculated using seasonal precipitation averages the transformation of the isotopic signature of winter precipitation also has implications for hydrological processes unrelated to a depression focussed recharge as shown earlier accounting for the true composition of snowmelt runoff as opposed to using winter precipitation or pre melt snow pack can increase the apparent contribution of winter precipitation to groundwater recharge in the study area this effect resembles the sensitivity of streamflow separation techniques to assumed melt water compositions schmieder et al 2016 taylor et al 2002 using winter average precipitation or pre melt snowpack samples to represent snowmelt may lead to a bias in estimated end member contributions to stream flow additionally observed evolution of the snowpack affects studies using the amplitudes of seasonal fluctuations of δ18o values to determine the fraction of the young water in the streamflow e g jasechko et al 2016 as only winter precipitation is affected by this process the seasonal amplitude of actual water inputs decreases in comparison to the amplitude of precipitation itself consequently ignoring this effect can lead to an underestimation of the young water fraction 6 conclusions thin snowpacks present a distinct set of challenges in the application of stable isotopic methods as the isotopic signature of snowpack can change rapidly with an increase in its spatial variability this factor greatly complicates the estimation of catchment average snowpack signatures and undermines the use of a winter average precipitation values as their proxy furthermore the isotopic composition of snowmelt runoff generated by complete melting of thin snowpacks differed from pre melt snowpack composition consequently the application of isotopic methods in these conditions requires sampling at each stage of hydrologic pathways at the same time thin snowpack can completely melt within a few days or less allowing us to ignore temporal variability in snowmelt composition over the course of a melt event in contrast in thicker snowpacks the main concern is the evolution of snowmelt isotopic compositions during an extended melt period the use of measured isotopic compositions of snowmelt runoff filling the depressions increased the apparent contribution of depression focussed recharge in the study region in comparison with the estimates using the compositions of winter precipitation as proxies the isotopic composition of ponded snowmelt runoff evolved after ponding event and noticeably changed between years in contrast the groundwater composition beneath the depression remained stable representing the average of depression focussed recharge at the same time examination of pore waters showed distinct differences in isotopic signatures between diffuse and depression focussed recharge pathways overall this study has demonstrated the usefulness of stable isotope methods to quantify the relative contribution of winter precipitation to depression focussed groundwater recharge in the canadian prairies and demonstrated the importance of considering the isotopic shifts of snow derived water at each stage of recharge pathways these findings will be useful for hydrological

7203,despite the efficient removal of many contaminants including pathogens and trace organic chemicals torcs during managed aquifer recharge mar fate and transport of torcs in the subsurface might not always occur under conditions that favor effective biotransformation resulting in a contamination risk where water is recovered for drinking water production a promising technology that can lead to improved removal of torcs is the sequential mar technology smart which combines two infiltration steps with an intermediate aeration to establish more favorable oxic and carbon limited conditions resulting in enhanced torcs transformation the aim of this study was to test the performance of the smart concept under field conditions in comparison to a conventional mar using pond infiltration cmar operated in berlin germany although oxic conditions were obtained at both field sites considering infiltration depth to 200 cm redox conditions were more stable at the smart facility fed with bank filtrate in addition carbon limited conditions were solely observed during smart chemicals known to persist during mar including candesartan carbamazepine dihydroxydihydrocarbamazepine olmesartan oxypurinol phenylethylmalonamide primidone and tolyltriazole exhibited a refractory behavior at both field sites whereas valsartan acid metformin and gabapentin lactam were removed by more than 85 during 200 cm of infiltration 4 formylaminoantipyrine acesulfame benzotriazole and gabapentin exhibited a significantly enhanced transformation during smart compared to the cmar site these results

1 3 hydraulic conditions the groundwater level at the cmar site increased and reached steady state conditions after approximately two months as shown in fig 2 a a failure in the pumping devices resulted in a sudden depletion of water level in the basin and a decline of the infiltration rate for a few days after approximately threemonths as illustrated in fig 2a the groundwater level below the basin as well as the infiltration rate decreased with ongoing operation time resulting in the necessity to remove the clogging layer in the recharge basin after approximately 5 5 months these results are in line with greskowiak et al 2005 who proposed different hydraulic stages during conventional artificial recharge in the beginning the water saturation increases until the establishment of fully saturated conditions followed by a decreasing infiltration rate due to the formation of a clogging layer resulting in unsaturated conditions underneath the basin and a decline in the groundwater level at the final stage no additional recharge can occur which requires the removal of the clogging layer to restore infiltration in contrast to the cmar site clogging was not an issue at the smart site during the experimental period of approximately nine months the groundwater level underneath ow 1 2 and 3 and downstream of the basin teg 386 slightly increased during the first six months followed by a more dominant rise approximately seven months after initial operation the groundwater level at teg 386 remained at steady state until the end of the experimental period fig 2b also recharge volume to the basin at the smart site which was increased after approximately two months of operation to obtain a water level of at least 30 cm within the basin remained nearly constant afterwards fig 2b the reduced clogging compared to cmar may be the result of a much lower content of particles microorganisms and colloids in the lake bank filtrate which are major factors causing clogging hiscock and grischek 2002 however long term effects due to precipitated iron or particular organic matter from algae growth resulting in the formation of a clogging layer were not taken into account yet and need to be addressed in further studies 3 2 removal of bulk organic carbon measurements at the cmar site revealed a continuously improved doc removal during the start up period 6 weeks and constant concentrations in the shallow groundwater were achieved until the end of the sampling campaign fig 3 a after a travel time of 0 49 days 200 cm of infiltration an average of 2 1 0 5 mg l doc were removed the uva254 values showed a similar trend resulting in a constant suva value throughout the first 200 cm of infiltration 2 1 0 1 l mg m indicating an equal utilization of aromatic and aliphatic organic compounds fig s4 stable doc concentrations of 4 6 5 2 mg l were observed in the observation wells teg 367 368op and 369op whereas the uva254 values increased during longer travel time suggesting presence of a higher content of aromatic fractions within the organic matter in the deeper aquifer suva l mg m teg 367 teg 368op 2 3 0 1 teg 369op 2 6 0 1 it can be hypothesized that this increase originates from mixing with older groundwater however the sampling campaign took approximately five months and therefore the monitoring wells may not have been completely flashed with filtrate of the basin only 0 2 0 2mg l doc were removed during a travel time of 0 17days 200 cm of infiltration at the smart site confirming the refractory character of the doc in the bank filtrate of lake tegel fig 3b and s4 3 3 redox conditions at the cmar site the do concentration dropped faster with depth compared to the smart site which is likely due to the presence of a higher amount of easily degradable doc in the water of lake tegel fig 4 after a start up of approximately 6 weeks the infiltration zone to a depth of 100 cm bgs travel time 0 25days was characterized by predominantly oxic redox conditions do 2mg l whereas until a depth of 200 cm travel time 0 49days the do concentration continued to decrease do 1 4 2 3mg l nevertheless the do values were highly variable during the infiltration at the cmar site fig 4a this may also be caused by instable operation e g a pump failure resulted in decreased infiltration and oxygen intrusion into the subsurface suboxic redox conditions were observed in monitoring well teg 367 characterized by low do concentration 1mg l as well as a slight decrease of nitrate n of 0 31 0 03mg l fig s5 despite the low do concentrations at monitoring wells teg 368op and teg 369op no additional nitrate reduction occurred confirming the refractory character of the doc in the deeper aquifer however the nitrate concentration increased and exhibited the highest concentration in monitoring well teg 369op which again may have resulted from mixing of younger with older groundwater in the well fig s5 as illustrated in fig 4b the do concentrations at the smart site declined at infiltration depths of 50 100 and 200 cm after an adaptation time of approximately 8weeks whereas the do concentration measured in monitoring well teg 386 remained constant at 0 4 0 2mg l after 2 5months oxic redox conditions do 2 5mg l until a depth of 200 cm bgs travel time 0 17days were confirmed since no alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate iron or manganese were consumed however after a travel time of approximately 11days at monitoring well teg 386 suboxic redox conditions do 1mg l occurred fig s5 the presence of particular organic carbon poc in the deeper aquifer may have resulted in further oxygen depletion lower nitrate concentration at monitoring well teg 386 compared to the suction sampler at 200 cm depth δno3 n 0 15 0 08mg l fig s5 confirms prevailing suboxic conditions based on the definition of distinct redox conditions by regnery et al 2015 after travel to a depth of 50 cm bgs iron and manganese concentrations were mostly below the loq at both field sites due to oxidation to fe iii and mn iv during oxic infiltration followed by precipitation and filtration in the top layer of the basin to sum up oxic conditions during 200 cm bgs of infiltration were obtained at both field sites cmar travel time 0 49days and smart travel time 0 17days whereas the do concentrations at the smart site were more stable compared to the cmar site due to the relatively high content of easily degradable doc in the lake tegel water carbon limited conditions δ doc 1 0mg l solely prevailed at the smart site thus favorable oxic and carbon limited conditions for an enhanced torcs transformation were exclusively present at the smart site 3 4 transformation of trace organic chemicals 3 4 1 adaptation period out of the 22 analyzed compounds 15 torcs were constantly detected above their loq in both feed waters table s1 similar to the removal of bulk organic carbon and the observed depletion of do an adaptation phase resulting in steady improvement in removal of torc was observed in both systems the adaptation for biotransformation was highly compound specific with acesulfame and metformin exhibiting the longest period of 2 5 3months at the smart site time resolved measurements of individual compounds in the infiltration basin and corresponding suction samplers at 50 100 and 200 cm are shown in fig s6 for the cmar site and fig s7 for the smart site a vertical line in the graphs indicates the assumed start of stable torcs concentration without further adaptation of microbial transformation after a travel time of 0 49days at the cmar site and 0 17days at the smart site respectively following evaluation of removal rates is based on measurements after this date 3 4 2 first order removal rate constants for a quantitative assessment of torc removal and to enable comparison with previous studies first order rate constants ƛ d 1 and half lives were determined for the removal of individual torcs based on the estimated and determined travel times to a depth of 200 cm bgs at the cmar and smart sites table 2 figs s8 and s9 in addition the r2 value for the fit of the first order decay model as well as the percentage removal at a depth of 200 cm bgs are given in table 2 in accordance to regnery et al 2015 the first order decay model was considered acceptable for r2 values larger than 0 63 furthermore first order rate constants for compounds with 10 transformation were set to ƛ 0 01d 1 among the 15 compounds detected in feed waters six torcs i e candesartan carbamazepine dihydroxydihydrocarbamazepine olmesartan oxypurinol phenylethylmalonamide exhibited a persistent behavior at both field sites with observed removal of less than 10 ƛ 0 01d 1 after subsurface travel to a depth of 200 cm bgs in addition two compounds primidone tolyltriazole were poorly removed 50 at both the cmar or smart sites persistent behavior in groundwater recharge systems under different environmental conditions is well documented for carbamazepine primidone phenylethylmalonamide and oxypurinol drewes et al 2003 heberer et al 2004 massmann et al 2006 hass et al 2012 funke et al 2015 in this study primidone exhibited a removal up to 40 200 cm infiltration at the cmar site but initial concentrations close to the detection limit may also have caused some analytical inaccuracies the persistent behavior of candesartan and olmesartan confirms previous laboratory scale experiments mimicking a conventional bank filtration and smart conditions hellauer et al 2017 reemtsma et al 2010 reported inefficient removal of 4 methylbenzotriazole during bank filtration in berlin after a travel time of 120days whereas 5 methylbenzotriazole was sufficiently removed since both tolyltriazole isomers were not differentiated in this study the observed removal of approximately 10 at the smart site might be caused by specific transformation of the better degradable compound 5 methylbenzotriazole gabapentin lactam metformin and valsartan acid were transformed by more than 85 after travel to 200 cm bgs at both sites travel time cmar 0 49days smart 0 17days with removal of gabapentin lactam and metformin mostly below the loq gabapentin lactam 0 01µg l metformin 0 020µg l for all of these three compounds the first order rate constants were at least twice as high in smart compared to the conventional cmar indicating a more efficient removal under stable oxic and carbon limited conditions the enhanced removal of valsartan acid in the smart system confirms previous observations from laboratory scale soil column experiments hellauer et al 2017 poor removal of valsartan acid under anoxic conditions was also observed during full scale bank filtration nödler et al 2013 van baar 2015 however the fact that valsartan acid was also removed to concentrations close to the loq at the cmar site indicates better supply of do in cmar systems compared to conventionally operated bank filtration scheurer et al 2012 reported an efficient degradation of metformin at trace concentrations during riverbank filtration or surface spreading from three full scale waterworks in germany these results are in line with the efficient transformation of metformin below the loq in this study based on a student t test unpaired two sided the removal of 4 formylaminoantipyrine 4 faa α 0 031 acesulfame benzotriazole and gabapentin α 0 001 was significantly enhanced during smart compared to conventional cmar these results confirm data from preceding column experiments showing similar benefit of smart operation for the compounds 4 faa benzotriazole and gabapentin hellauer et al 2017 efficient removal of 4 faa was also observed in recharge systems using surface spreading massmann et al 2006 and bank filtration van baar 2015 the most pronounced effects linked to stable oxic and carbon limited conditions at the smart site ƛ 8d 1 were observed for the transformation of acesulfame and benzotriazole both showing persistent behavior during conventional cmar ƛ 0 01d 1 while our previous column studies confirm highly redox sensitive transformation of benzotriazole hellauer et al 2017 other studies also reported partial removal during bank filtration at lake tegel reemtsma et al 2010 the high persistence of the artificial sweetener acesulfame at the cmar site contradicts efficient degradation to concentrations below loq during initial mostly anoxic infiltration in column experiments hellauer et al 2017 these results however are in line with data from literature ranging from recalcitrant during soil aquifer treatment with a residence time of more than 1 5years scheurer et al 2009 to rapid degradation in oxic and anoxic denitrifying activated sludge systems castronovo et al 2017 to further elucidate the efficiency of the smart system regarding the transformation of moderately degradable torcs determined first order removal rate constants for acesulfame benzotriazole 4 faa and tolyltriazole were compared with literature data in fig 5 burke et al 2014 estimated first order removal rate constants in laboratory scale soil column experiments consisting of an undisturbed core from a riverbank filtration site at lake wannsee berlin germany at two different temperatures to simulate winter and summer conditions 6 5 c oxic penoxic 19 7 c oxic penoxic suboxic thereby penoxic conditions referred to nearly oxic conditions as previously defined by stuyfzand 1993 regnery et al 2015 determined first order removal rate constants for several torcs including acesulfame in controlled laboratory scale soil column experiments under oxic and carbon limited conditions removal rates reported by burke et al 2014 and regnery et al 2015 confirm the observed high persistence of acesulfame benzotriazole and tolyltriazole in conventional cmar fig 5 also removal rates for 4 faa well agree with literature data however data from burke et al 2014 indicate that improved removal of these substances is possible under specific conditions highest removal rates for all compounds except tolyltriazole however were observed with the smart concept at fully oxic and carbon limited conditions demonstrating the high potential of the sequential approach for biodegradation of moderately degradable torcs 3 4 3 torcs detected in groundwater monitoring wells concentrations of torcs in the groundwater monitoring wells are exemplarily shown for benzotriazole and metformin in fig 6 both compounds exhibited elevated concentrations in the monitoring wells compared to results from suction samplers also valsartan acid and primidone as well as the persistent torcs candesartan carbamazepine olmesartan oxypurinol and tolyltriazole were detected at higher concentrations in the observation wells at the cmar site since torcs concentrations in the lake were continuously decreasing in the last months prior to experiments mixing with older bank filtrate might have caused these effects 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrate the applicability of the smart concept to enhance removal of trace organic chemicals under field scale conditions re aeration and subsequent infiltration of bank filtrate resulted in the constant establishment of oxic and carbon limited conditions throughout 200 cm of infiltration in the shallow aquifer also infiltration of lake water during conventional mar using pond infiltration occurred at mainly oxic conditions but availability of do was less stable in addition availability of bdoc in the lake tegel water which was removed by 2 1 0 5mg l within 0 49days 200 cm bgs of infiltration did not allow for establishment of favored carbon limited conditions compared to conventional mar using pond infiltration the smart concept performed equal or better regarding the removal of all biodegradable torcs the compounds acesulfame and benzotriazole were removed by more than 80 at the smart site after 0 17days 200 cm bgs of infiltration whereas both compounds persisted in the conventional mar system in addition the first order removal rates of acesulfame benzotriazole and 4 faa at the smart site were higher compared to reported values from literature emphasizing the potential to improve the transformation of moderately degradable torcs by optimizing prevailing conditions in natural treatment processes however further research is needed to prove long term performance of trace organic chemical removal as well as infiltration rates at the smart site due to precipitated iron infiltration rates are expected to decrease over time accordingly frequencies of cleaning and removal of the clogging layer need to be properly managed acknowledgments we would like to thank the

7203,despite the efficient removal of many contaminants including pathogens and trace organic chemicals torcs during managed aquifer recharge mar fate and transport of torcs in the subsurface might not always occur under conditions that favor effective biotransformation resulting in a contamination risk where water is recovered for drinking water production a promising technology that can lead to improved removal of torcs is the sequential mar technology smart which combines two infiltration steps with an intermediate aeration to establish more favorable oxic and carbon limited conditions resulting in enhanced torcs transformation the aim of this study was to test the performance of the smart concept under field conditions in comparison to a conventional mar using pond infiltration cmar operated in berlin germany although oxic conditions were obtained at both field sites considering infiltration depth to 200 cm redox conditions were more stable at the smart facility fed with bank filtrate in addition carbon limited conditions were solely observed during smart chemicals known to persist during mar including candesartan carbamazepine dihydroxydihydrocarbamazepine olmesartan oxypurinol phenylethylmalonamide primidone and tolyltriazole exhibited a refractory behavior at both field sites whereas valsartan acid metformin and gabapentin lactam were removed by more than 85 during 200 cm of infiltration 4 formylaminoantipyrine acesulfame benzotriazole and gabapentin exhibited a significantly enhanced transformation during smart compared to the cmar site these results confirm that smart can result in controlled oxic and carbon depleted subsurface conditions during mar facilitating an improved transformation of moderately degradable torcs by natural treatment

hellauer et al 2017 the objective of this study was to establish validate and potentially improve the smart concept for berlin s drinking water production under field conditions smart was tested by modifying an existing infiltration basin of a recharge facility located on an island within lake tegel that was fed with bank filtrate from nearby drinking water production wells performance was

368op and 369op were estimated based on previous investigations at this field site massmann et al 2006 the smart concept was tested at the recharge facility baumwerder using half of an existing surface spreading basin of approximately 700 m2 fig 1 top right and fig s1 during the operation of the basin six bf production wells were constantly operated bank filtrate from wells 1 2 3 and 10 was pumped via a delivery pipe into the basin while wells 6 and 9 were operated to deliver water to the drinking water production facility re aeration of the lake bank filtered water was achieved by

tegel water smart field site aerated lake bank filtrate were recorded and are summarized in tables 1 and s1 respectively in addition the limit of quantification loq is given for all parameters the average do concentration in the water of lake tegel 10 6 1 7 mg l was higher compared to the re aerated bank filtrate feeding the recharge basin at the smart field site 6 5 1 1 mg l the doc concentration of 4 7 0 2 mg l in the bank filtered water confirmed previous results reporting a residual non degradable doc of 4 7mg l at field conditions during bank filtration as well as pond infiltration in berlin grünheid et al 2005 nitrate and ammonia concentrations were low in both waters iron and manganese were slightly elevated in the bank filtered water suggesting prevalence of reduced anoxic conditions in the aquifer table 1 3 1 2 tracer test based on the results of the tracer test performed at the smart field site travel times of 0 09 days for 50 cm 0 15 days for 100 cm and 0 17 days for 200 cm of infiltration were determined for suction samplers at mp1 a travel time of approximately 11 days was determined to observation well teg 386 no tracer was detected at observation wells teg 383 teg 384 and teg 385 in addition only very little bromide concentration was measured at mp 2 based on these results further discussions will be limited to results obtained from mp1 and well teg 386 a detailed description of the tracer test is provided in the supplementary information since no tracer test was performed at the cmar site the travel times to the suction samplers were estimated by the porosity of the soil within the basin 41 and the median of the infiltration rate 1 68 m d as approximately 0 12 0 25 and 0 49 days to depths of 50 100 and 200 cm respectively due to spatially variable infiltration across the basins at both field sites and variable infiltration rates during the course of the study the obtained residence times should be considered as approximate values travel times to the observation wells at the cmar site 3 days for teg 367 7 days for teg 368op 25 days for teg 369op were previously reported by massmann et al 2006 3 1 3 hydraulic conditions the groundwater level at the cmar site increased and reached steady state conditions after approximately two months as shown in fig 2 a a failure in the pumping devices resulted in a sudden depletion of water level in the basin and a decline of the infiltration rate for a few days after approximately threemonths as illustrated in fig 2a the groundwater level below the basin as well as the infiltration rate decreased with ongoing operation time resulting in the necessity to remove the clogging layer in the recharge basin after approximately 5 5 months these results are in line with greskowiak et al 2005 who proposed different hydraulic stages during conventional artificial recharge in the beginning the water saturation increases until the establishment of fully saturated conditions followed by a decreasing infiltration rate due to the formation of a clogging layer resulting in unsaturated conditions underneath the basin and a decline in the groundwater level at the final stage no additional recharge can occur which requires the removal of the clogging layer to restore infiltration in contrast to the cmar site clogging was not an issue at the smart site during the experimental period of approximately nine months the groundwater level underneath ow 1 2 and 3 and downstream of the basin teg 386 slightly increased during the first six months followed by a more dominant rise approximately seven months after initial operation the groundwater level at teg 386 remained at steady state until the end of the experimental period fig 2b also recharge volume to the basin at the smart site which was increased after approximately two months of operation to obtain a water level of at least 30 cm within the basin remained nearly constant afterwards fig 2b the reduced clogging compared to cmar may be the result of a much lower content of particles microorganisms and colloids in the lake bank filtrate which are major factors causing clogging hiscock and grischek 2002 however long term effects due to precipitated iron or particular organic matter from algae growth resulting in the formation of a clogging layer were not taken into account yet and need to be addressed in further studies 3 2 removal of bulk organic carbon measurements at the cmar site revealed a continuously improved doc removal during the start up period 6 weeks and constant concentrations in the shallow groundwater were achieved until the end of the sampling campaign fig 3 a after a travel time of 0 49 days 200 cm of infiltration an average of 2 1 0 5 mg l doc were removed the uva254 values showed a similar trend resulting in a constant suva value throughout the first 200 cm of infiltration 2 1 0 1 l mg m indicating an equal utilization of aromatic and aliphatic organic compounds fig s4 stable doc concentrations of 4 6 5 2 mg l were observed in the observation wells teg 367 368op and 369op whereas the uva254 values increased during longer travel time suggesting presence of a higher content of aromatic fractions within the organic matter in the deeper aquifer suva l mg m teg 367 teg 368op 2 3 0 1 teg 369op 2 6 0 1 it can be hypothesized that this increase originates from mixing with older groundwater however the sampling campaign took approximately five months and therefore the monitoring wells may not have been completely flashed with filtrate of the basin only 0 2 0 2mg l doc were removed during a travel time of 0 17days 200 cm of infiltration at the smart site confirming the refractory character of the doc in the bank filtrate of lake tegel fig 3b and s4 3 3 redox conditions at the cmar site the do concentration dropped faster with depth compared to the smart site which is likely due to the presence of a higher amount of easily degradable doc in the water of lake tegel fig 4 after a start up of approximately 6 weeks the infiltration zone to a depth of 100 cm bgs travel time 0 25days was characterized by predominantly oxic redox conditions do 2mg l whereas until a depth of 200 cm travel time 0 49days the do concentration continued to decrease do 1 4 2 3mg l nevertheless the do values were highly variable during the infiltration at the cmar site fig 4a this may also be caused by instable operation e g a pump failure resulted in decreased infiltration and oxygen intrusion into the subsurface suboxic redox conditions were observed in monitoring well teg 367 characterized by low do concentration 1mg l as well as a slight decrease of nitrate n of 0 31 0 03mg l fig s5 despite the low do concentrations at monitoring wells teg 368op and teg 369op no additional nitrate reduction occurred confirming the refractory character of the doc in the deeper aquifer however the nitrate concentration increased and exhibited the highest concentration in monitoring well teg 369op which again may have resulted from mixing of younger with older groundwater in the well fig s5 as illustrated in fig 4b the do concentrations at the smart site declined at infiltration depths of 50 100 and 200 cm after an adaptation time of approximately 8weeks whereas the do concentration measured in monitoring well teg 386 remained constant at 0 4 0 2mg l after 2 5months oxic redox conditions do 2 5mg l until a depth of 200 cm bgs travel time 0 17days were confirmed since no alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate iron or manganese were consumed however after a travel time of approximately 11days at monitoring well teg 386 suboxic redox conditions do 1mg l occurred fig s5 the presence of particular organic carbon poc in the deeper aquifer may have resulted in further oxygen depletion lower nitrate concentration at monitoring well teg 386 compared to the suction sampler at 200 cm depth δno3 n 0 15 0 08mg l fig s5 confirms prevailing suboxic conditions based on the definition of distinct redox conditions by regnery et al 2015 after travel to a depth of 50 cm bgs iron and manganese concentrations were mostly below the loq at both field sites due to oxidation to fe iii and mn iv during oxic infiltration followed by precipitation and filtration in the top layer of the basin to sum up oxic conditions during 200 cm bgs of infiltration were obtained at both field sites cmar travel time 0 49days and smart travel time 0 17days whereas the do concentrations at the smart site were more stable compared to the cmar site due to the relatively high content of easily degradable doc in the lake tegel water carbon limited conditions δ doc 1 0mg l solely prevailed at the smart site thus favorable oxic and carbon limited conditions for an enhanced torcs transformation were exclusively present at the smart site 3 4 transformation of trace organic chemicals 3 4 1 adaptation period out of the 22 analyzed compounds 15 torcs were constantly detected above their loq in both feed waters table s1 similar to the removal of bulk organic carbon and the observed depletion of do an adaptation phase resulting in steady improvement in removal of torc was observed in both systems the adaptation for biotransformation was highly compound specific with acesulfame and metformin exhibiting the longest period of 2 5 3months at the smart site time resolved measurements of individual compounds in the infiltration basin and corresponding suction samplers at 50 100 and 200 cm are shown in fig s6 for the cmar site and fig s7 for the smart site a vertical line in the graphs indicates the assumed start of stable torcs concentration without further adaptation of microbial transformation after a travel time of 0 49days at the cmar site and 0 17days at the smart site respectively following evaluation of removal rates is based on measurements after this date 3 4 2 first order removal rate constants for a quantitative assessment of torc removal and to enable comparison with previous studies first order rate constants ƛ d 1 and half lives were determined for the removal of individual torcs based on the estimated and determined travel times to a depth of 200 cm bgs at the cmar and smart sites table 2 figs s8 and s9 in addition the r2 value for the fit of the first order decay model as well as the percentage removal at a depth of 200 cm bgs are given in table 2 in accordance to regnery et al 2015 the first order decay model was considered acceptable for r2 values larger than 0 63 furthermore first order rate constants for compounds with 10 transformation were set to ƛ 0 01d 1 among the 15 compounds detected in feed waters six torcs i e candesartan carbamazepine dihydroxydihydrocarbamazepine olmesartan oxypurinol phenylethylmalonamide exhibited a persistent behavior at both field sites with observed removal of less than 10 ƛ 0 01d 1 after subsurface travel to a depth of 200 cm bgs in addition two compounds primidone tolyltriazole were poorly removed 50 at both the cmar or smart sites persistent behavior in groundwater recharge systems under different environmental conditions is well documented for carbamazepine primidone phenylethylmalonamide and oxypurinol drewes et al 2003 heberer et al 2004 massmann et al 2006 hass et al 2012 funke et al 2015 in this study primidone exhibited a removal up to 40 200 cm infiltration at the cmar site but initial concentrations close to the detection limit may also have caused some analytical inaccuracies the persistent behavior of candesartan and olmesartan confirms previous laboratory scale experiments mimicking a conventional bank filtration and smart conditions hellauer et al 2017 reemtsma et al 2010 reported inefficient removal of 4 methylbenzotriazole during bank filtration in berlin after a travel time of 120days whereas 5 methylbenzotriazole was sufficiently removed since both tolyltriazole isomers were not differentiated in this study the observed removal of approximately 10 at the smart site might be caused by specific transformation of the better degradable compound 5 methylbenzotriazole gabapentin lactam metformin and valsartan acid were transformed by more than 85 after travel to 200 cm bgs at both sites travel time cmar 0 49days smart 0 17days with removal of gabapentin lactam and metformin mostly below the loq gabapentin lactam 0 01µg l metformin 0 020µg l for all of these three compounds the first order rate constants were at least twice as high in smart compared to the conventional cmar indicating a more efficient removal under stable oxic and carbon limited conditions the enhanced removal of valsartan acid in the smart system confirms previous observations from laboratory scale soil column experiments hellauer et al 2017 poor removal of valsartan acid under anoxic conditions was also observed during full scale bank filtration nödler et al 2013 van baar 2015 however the fact that valsartan acid was also removed to concentrations close to the loq at the cmar site indicates better supply of do in cmar systems compared to conventionally operated bank filtration scheurer et al 2012 reported an efficient degradation of metformin at trace concentrations during riverbank filtration or surface spreading from three full scale waterworks in germany these results are in line with the efficient transformation of metformin below the loq in this study based on a student t test unpaired two sided the removal of 4 formylaminoantipyrine 4 faa α 0 031 acesulfame benzotriazole and gabapentin α 0 001 was significantly enhanced during smart compared to conventional cmar these results confirm data from preceding column experiments showing similar benefit of smart operation for the compounds 4 faa benzotriazole and gabapentin hellauer et al 2017 efficient removal of 4 faa was also observed in recharge systems using surface spreading massmann et al 2006 and bank filtration van baar 2015 the most pronounced effects linked to stable oxic and carbon limited conditions at the smart site ƛ 8d 1 were observed for the transformation of acesulfame and benzotriazole both showing persistent behavior during conventional cmar ƛ 0 01d 1 while our previous column studies confirm highly redox sensitive transformation of benzotriazole hellauer et al 2017 other studies also reported partial removal during bank filtration at lake tegel reemtsma et al 2010 the high persistence of the artificial sweetener acesulfame at the cmar site contradicts efficient degradation to concentrations below loq during initial mostly anoxic infiltration in column experiments hellauer et al 2017 these results however are in line with data from literature ranging from recalcitrant during soil aquifer treatment with a residence time of more than 1 5years scheurer et al 2009 to rapid degradation in oxic and anoxic denitrifying activated sludge systems castronovo et al 2017 to further elucidate the efficiency of the smart system regarding the transformation of moderately degradable torcs determined first order removal rate constants for acesulfame benzotriazole 4 faa and tolyltriazole were compared with literature data in fig 5 burke et al 2014 estimated first order removal rate constants in laboratory scale soil column experiments consisting of an undisturbed core from a riverbank filtration site at lake wannsee berlin germany at two different temperatures to simulate winter and summer conditions 6 5 c oxic penoxic 19 7 c oxic penoxic suboxic thereby penoxic conditions referred to nearly oxic conditions as previously defined by stuyfzand 1993 regnery et al 2015 determined first order removal rate constants for several torcs including acesulfame in controlled laboratory scale soil column experiments under oxic and carbon limited conditions removal rates reported by burke et al 2014 and regnery et al 2015 confirm the observed high persistence of acesulfame benzotriazole and tolyltriazole in conventional cmar fig 5 also removal rates for 4 faa well agree with literature data however data from burke et al 2014 indicate that improved removal of these substances is possible under specific conditions highest removal rates for all compounds except tolyltriazole however were observed with the smart concept at fully oxic and carbon limited conditions demonstrating the high potential of the sequential approach for biodegradation of moderately degradable torcs 3 4 3 torcs detected in groundwater monitoring wells concentrations of torcs in the groundwater monitoring wells are exemplarily shown for benzotriazole and metformin in fig 6 both compounds exhibited elevated concentrations in the monitoring wells compared to results from suction samplers also valsartan acid and primidone as well as the persistent torcs candesartan carbamazepine olmesartan oxypurinol and tolyltriazole were detected at higher concentrations in the observation wells at the cmar site since torcs concentrations in the lake were continuously decreasing in the last months prior to experiments mixing with older bank filtrate might have caused these effects 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrate the applicability of the smart concept to enhance removal of trace organic chemicals under field scale conditions re aeration and subsequent infiltration of bank filtrate resulted in the constant establishment of oxic and carbon limited conditions throughout 200 cm of infiltration in the shallow aquifer also infiltration of lake water during conventional mar using pond infiltration occurred at mainly oxic conditions but availability of do was less stable in addition availability of bdoc in the lake tegel water which was removed by 2 1 0 5mg l within 0 49days 200 cm bgs of infiltration did not allow for establishment of favored carbon limited conditions compared to conventional mar using pond infiltration the smart concept performed equal or better regarding the removal of all biodegradable torcs the compounds acesulfame and benzotriazole were removed by more than 80 at the smart site after 0 17days 200 cm bgs of infiltration whereas both compounds persisted in the conventional mar system in addition the first order removal rates of acesulfame benzotriazole and 4 faa at the smart site were higher compared to reported values from literature emphasizing the potential to improve the transformation of moderately degradable torcs by optimizing prevailing conditions in natural treatment processes however further research is needed to prove long term performance of trace organic chemical removal as well as infiltration rates at the smart site due to precipitated iron infiltration rates are expected to decrease over time accordingly frequencies of cleaning and removal of the clogging layer need to be properly managed acknowledgments we would like to thank the

7204,hydrological and non point source pollution h nps predictions in ungagged basins have become the key problem for watershed studies especially for those large scale catchments however few studies have explored the comprehensive impacts of rainfall data scarcity on h nps predictions this study focused on 1 the effects of rainfall spatial scarcity by removing 11 67 of stations based on their locations on the h nps results and 2 the impacts of rainfall temporal scarcity 10 60 data scarcity in time series and 3 the development of a new evaluation method that incorporates information entropy a case study was undertaken using the soil and water assessment tool swat in a typical watershed in china the results of this study highlighted the importance of critical site rainfall stations that often showed greater influences and cross tributary impacts on the h nps simulations higher missing rates above a certain threshold as well as missing locations during the wet periods resulted in poorer simulation results compared to traditional indicators information entropy could serve as a good substitute because it reflects the distribution of spatial variability and the development of temporal heterogeneity this paper reports important implications for the application of distributed hydrological models and semi distributed hydrological models as well as for the optimal design of rainfall gauges among large basins keywords information entropy non point source pollution rainfall data scarcity soil and water assessment tool three gorges reservoir region 1 introduction non point source nps pollution has been a key threat to water quality for decades and hydrological and non point source h nps models are the main tools used to quantify nps pollution andréassian et al 2001 bera and borah 2003 chaubey et al 1999 drecht et al 2003 typically h nps models can be divided into lumped hydrologic models lhms distributed hydrological models dhms and semi distributed hydrological model sdhms the lhms regard the watershed as a whole object and cannot reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the actual process inside the watershed hrachowitz and clark 2017 conversely dhms sdhms divide watersheds into smaller spatial units while pollutants are calculated from each separate unit and are then summed at the watershed outlet as one special kind of dhms the sdhms divided the entire basin into sub watersheds first and then into a number of hydrological response units hrus or other computational units depending on slope soil type and land use instead of rectangular grids with uniform size hrachowitz et al 2016 viviroli et al 2009 in this sense spatial variations in climate underlying surfaces and related hydrological elements could be considered and spatial data with higher accuracy that are typically derived via remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis technologies are required bieger et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the commonly used dhms sdhms include the soil and water assessment tool swat model the institute of hydrology distributed model ihdm and topmodel among these models the swat model has become one of the most widely used tools in describing temporal and spatial variations in h nps cycles especially for large scale watersheds due to their greater heterogeneities amatya et al 2011 rainfall data are regarded as the most important inputs for dhms sdhms because they act as the driving force of runoff generation and pollutant transportation lobligeois et al 2014 kashani et al 2016 sun et al 2017 typically rainfall data could be obtained using both rainfall station and radar product kashani et al 2016 pereiracardenal et al 2011 the application of the radar product has become more widespread as radar technique can reflect the spatial and temporal rainfall variability especially for those remote regions biggs and atkinson 2015 however the radar rainfall product is sometime questioned as its resolutions are generally based on quantitative rainfall estimates qpes from weather radar networks harrison et al 2009 several major disadvantages of qpes such as low spatial resolution low level forecast for torrential rain and rough prediction of spatial temporal structure of heavy rainfall make the radar data cannot meet the requirements of h nps models cluckie et al 2004 thus there is a growing need for combined synergic use of radar measurements along with the rainfall stations and the rain gauge is still the fundamental source used by dhms sdhms to determine rainfall variability previous studies have indicated that rainfall has irregular changes due to the varying natural conditions and shows strong spatial temporal heterogeneities among large scale watersheds which would impact simulated results of the dhms sdhms bardossy and plate 1992 shen et al 2012 long time series of rainfall data is often required for comprehensive h nps evaluations by covering high flow normal flow and low flow periods to the greatest extent kuangyao et al 2000 troin et al 2012 however automatic weather stations are susceptible because certain time series may be lost in part due to direct and indirect damage caused by lightning electromagnetic pulses electromagnetic interference and human operational errors are also destructive factors for automatic stations and can result in random and continuous absences of rainfall data as a result damage to automatic stations and other equipment errors due to various human and natural factors can cause losses in rainfall data series shen et al 2015a wambura et al 2017 on the other hand previous study has indicated spatial rainfall variability is an important source of nps simulation uncertainty thus users must focus on the optimal design of rainfall stations shen et al 2012 however accurate descriptions of spatial rainfall variability cannot be obtained due to the paucity of existing observation sites which is caused by economic and technique conditions i e terrain the spatial and temporal resolutions of rainfall data are constrained and interrelated and will affect the quantification of h nps meusburger et al 2012 michaelides et al 2009 thus rainfall data scarcity indeed exists and has become the key barrier to h nps prediction h nps predictions in ungauged basins pub have become a hot topic for hydrological researchers because data scarcity is still a worldwide problem the international association of hydrological sciences iahs began the pub programme as its first key research programme in the 21st century which is called as pub 2003 2012 shaping an exciting future for the hydrological sciences hrachowitz et al 2013 for those dhms sdhms scarce scenarios of rainfall data could be divided into two types spatial series and time series satellite remote sensing play an important role in the pub lakshmi 2004 but it cannot solve the problem of high spatial resolution and frequent time duplication lakshmi 2016 studies have also focused on the effect of different spatial interpolation methods and their combinations on rainfall estimation during different rainfall periods ali et al 2005 cheng et al 2017 swain and patra 2017 although these studies have shown that spatial rainfall variability could be obtained by interpolating rainfall data of each station by the methods such as thiessen polygons average method and centroid method cho et al 2009 there are few studies focused on their performances during data scarcity scenarios specifically weather generators have been developed for dhms sdhms to cope with data scarcity in time series but the impacts of data scarcity scenarios on their interpolation abilities are not clear yet chen et al 2017a ruan et al 2016 in that regard quantifying the impacts of the temporal and spatial scarcity of rainfall data is indeed crucial because those data provide the basic inputs for h nps models therefore we focused on the influences of rainfall data scarcity on total phosphorus tp prediction in a nps dominant catchment by running and comparing different rainfall scarcity scenarios the following tasks have been performed by 1 quantifying the effects of rainfall spatial scarcity station number and location on h tp simulations and 2 exploring the impacts of rainfall temporal scarcity data scarcity in time series on h tp predictions and 3 developing the information entropy as a new method to replace traditional indicators for data scarcity evaluation the study is carried out for daning watershed china 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area description and data collection 2 1 1 study area description the daning river watershed is located in wushan county and wuxi county the municipality of chongqing china as an important tributary in the three gorges reservoir area the drainage area of the daning river watershed is approximately 2422 km2 and consists of four major tributaries including the xixi river the houxi river the boyang river and the dongxi river the mean rainfall is 1030 1950 mm per year and the annual temperature of the watershed is approximately 18 4 c the elevation of the daning river watershed ranges from 200 m to 2605 m while the land use types in this area are primarily comprised of forest lands 61 85 croplands 24 90 and grasslands 12 48 this area also consists of seven major soil types yellow soils 46 05 yellow brown soils 25 79 limestone soils 18 19 brown soils 6 28 purple soils 1 98 paddy soil 1 52 and alluvial soils less than 0 2 the location of the watershed in the three gorges reservoir area and other information are shown in fig 1 based on historical record the daning river suffers serious nps pollution and phosphorus p is the limiting nutrient causing eutrophication in the three gorges reservoir region shen et al 2012 2015b in this area excessive use of phosphate fertilizer are used on slope cropland and the rainfall would cause p being carrying into the receiving body of water through rainfall erosion and runoff transport from non specific sites in form of nps pollution thus tp was selected as a representative of nps pollutants and water quality in this region 2 1 2 data collection for a comprehensive evaluation detailed data that are available in this region are collected and compiled as follows daily rainfall data at nine rainfall stations inside the watershed and four stations at sites approximately 30 km outside the watershed boundary from 1998 to 2008 were obtained from the meteorological bureau of wuxi county and china national meteorological administration other meteorological data from 2000 to 2008 such as daily maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunlight radiation were collected at the meteorological bureau of wuxi county the digital elevation model dem which had a resolution of 1 250 000 was digitized from raw data provided by the national fundamental geographic information center of china the land use map which had a resolution of 1 100 000 was obtained from the resources and environment science data center of the chinese sciences academy the soil type map which had a resolution of 1 50 000 was obtained from the agricultural science committee of wuxi city the soil physical properties including soil density saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity and field capacity were acquired from the institute of soil science in nanjing the soil chemical properties were obtained from the soil database of china the crop management measures were obtained from field investigations with local farmers the measured daily flow data and monthly water quality data are mainly obtained from the yangtze river basin water conservancy commission and the wuxi county environmental protection bureau 2 2 setup of the swat model 2 2 1 model description as a physical based and semi distributed model the swat is used for the h nps prediction in this study the swat represents spatial heterogeneities of land covers soil types and management practices and is therefore suitable for large scale and complex watershed studies douglas mankin et al 2010 the soil conservation service scs method 1972 and green ampt infiltration methods 1911 are the two alternative methods for surface runoff estimation while the penman monteith priestley taylor and hargreaves methods are used for the evapotranspiration estimation the simulation of subsurface flow reference from a kinematic storage method and the routing channel water is simulated by the muskingum method the modified universal soil loss equation musle is incorporated to simulate soil erosion and estimate sediment yield the swat can monitor organic p inorganic p and soluble p and simulates the p cycle in the water stream specifically the solubility of p is limited in most environments and this property of p makes it accumulate near the soil surface and migrate easily with surface runoff heathwaite and dils 2000 smil 2000 sharpley et al 2001 moreover the swat can simulate six p pools in the soil including three inorganic and three organic forms such as insoluble forms of mineral p and p in the soil solution etc 1 p surf 0 001 c orgp q sed a hru ε p sed where psurf is the amount of organic p in surface runoff and corgp is the concentration of organic p in the top 10 mm of soil and εp sed is the p enrichment ratio and ahru is the area of the hru and qsed is the sediment yield on a given day 2 q sed 11 8 q surf q peak a hru 0 56 k ulse c ulse p ulse l ulse f cfrg where qsed is the sediment yield on a given day qsurf is the surface runoff volume qpeak is the peak runoff rate ahru is the area of the hru kusle cusle pusle and lusle is the usle soil erodibility factor cover and management factor topographic factor and coarse fragment factor respectively 2 2 2 rainfall module of the swat to supplement incomplete meteorological data in temporal series the weather generator is incorporated as a module of the swat hartkamp et al 2003 wilks 2009 the weather generator could be used to interpolate the scarce data in temporal series and six meteorological variables are interpolated from the known high and low values including rainfall highest temperature lowest temperature daily average relative humidity daily radiation and daily average wind speed kilsby et al 2007 the daily rainfall data are simulated using a markov chain skewed distribution model richardson 1981 according to the skewed distribution function of the swat model the formula for calculating the rainfall in rainy days is 3 r day μ mon 2 σ mon snd day g mon 6 g mon 6 1 3 1 g mon where rday is the one day rainfall μmon is the average daily rainfall in one month σmon is the standard deviation of the average daily rainfall in one month sndday is the standard normal deviation of the calculated one day and gmon is the skewness coefficient of the average daily rainfall in one month the standard normal deviation for one day is 4 snd day cos 6 283 rnd 2 2 ln rnd 1 where rnd1 and rnd2 are random numbers between 0 and 1 0 to capture the spatial rainfall variability thiessen polygons are used for the swat simulation in the large watershed and the swat also uses elevation bands to account for orographic effects on rainfall and temperature the thiessen polygons depend on the overall average or data near the missing data and the elevation bands are used in conjunction with other methods to calculate rainfall and simulate runoff in the mountain location fontaine et al 2002 zhang et al 2008 2 2 3 model setup using the dem the daning river watershed was divided into 22 sub watersheds based on a threshold of the critical source area of 5000 ha the sub watersheds were then divided into hrus according to the different underlying surface features including land use soil type and slope the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 of the swat calibration and uncertainty programme was used for calibration and validation abbaspour et al 2007 according to the data obtained the calibration and verification in this paper are based on the monthly time step the hydrological and water quality data from 2004 to 2008 are selected as calibration periods because of its completeness hydrological and water quality data from 2000 to 2003 are selected as validation periods a one year warm up period 1999 was specified for both the calibration and validation periods traditional methods were used for model evaluation merz and blöschl 2004 including the correlation coefficient r2 legates and mccabe 1999 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient ens nash and sutcliffe 1970 the correlation coefficient r2 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o i 1 n p i p 2 2 where oi is the ith observed value pi is the ith simulated value is the average of the observed values n is the number of observed values or simulated values when the simulated values are equal to the measured values then r2 1 when r2 1 the smaller the value are the lower the degree of data fit the nash sutcliffe coefficient ens 6 ens 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 when the simulated values are equal to the measured values ens 1 then when ens 1 the smaller the value of a reflects the lower degree of data coincidence when ens is less than 0 it indicates that the model performance is poor in sum the r2 values were quantified as 0 79 and 0 95 for the simulated flows and tp respectively and the ens values were 0 74 and 0 93 respectively indicating that the swat model performed well in this study area for more information about this process please see our previous studies chen et al 2014 gong et al 2012 2 3 design of the rainfall data scarcity 2 3 1 spatial data scarcity in this study both spatial and temporal data scarcity are designed and the details of data scarcity scenario could be found in table 1 in the study of spatial data scarcity the daily rainfall data from 2000 to 2008 were obtained from 9 stations which are the xining changan xujiaba gaolou zhongliang jianlou wangu tangfang and wuxi rainfall station fig 1 the spatial rainfall variation was then generated for the 22 sub watersheds by regarding each station as a single unit and interpolating them using the thiessen polygon method therefore the baseline scenario is setup by using all complete datasets and the spatial data scarcity is then designed by reducing the number of rainfall stations and their spatial locations for data scarce scenarios the number of rainfall stations is often limited so the impacts of station number on nps tp load prediction was compared firstly to make more comprehensive results information entropy was used to evaluate the spatial model performances in addition to ens entropy theory which was introduced by shannon in the 1940s is widely used in the fields of hydrology and the environment bian and feng 2010 khosravi et al 2016 shannon notes that there is redundancy in any information and the size of the redundancy is related to the probability or uncertainty of each symbol number letter or word in the message the information entropy is the amount of information which is the average amount of information after excluding redundancy ilunga 2017 some studies have shown that the information entropy method has good results with less computational complexity to compute the fuzzy formal concepts shemshadi et al 2011 singh et al 2014 in this study entropy theory is used in the following forms to solve a variety of problems in terms of h nps model evaluation chen et al 2017b 7 h spatial x j i 1 n p x ij logp x ij 8 h temporal x i j 1 m p x ij logp x ij where hspatial xj is the information entropy of each sub watershed in the whole simulation period and htemporal xi is the information entropy of the whole watershed in monthly time step xij is sub watershed j for month ith and p xij is the ratio of the simulated flow or pollutants data at xij to the total output of the entire basin in monthly time step and n is the number of months during simulations and m is the number of sub watersheds in the whole watershed then indicator of δh is used as means that deviation in entropy values between baseline scenario and data scarcity scenario in this sense the impacts of each single rainfall station on h nps prediction could be reflected by the information theory then importance of each paired stations on the model simulation results could be ranked by δh value during each scenario this study employed six scenarios by gradually decreasing the total entropy of the rainfall stations that is station numbers and more details about six scenarios are shown in table 1 the scenarios included a complete scenario with 9 rainfall stations named s0 an 8 gauge scenario that lacked the xining station named s1 and a 7 gauge scenario that lacked the changan and xujiaba stations named s2 furthermore there were 5 gauge 4 gauge and 3 gauge scenarios wherein the number of rainfall stations was gradually reduced named s3 s4 and s5 respectively by comparing the simulated values those important stations which showed greater influences on the h nps simulations are defined as the critical site rainfall stations besides the importance of the rainfall stations in a watershed is related to the amount of information contained in the river basin the basin area is controlled by a single rainfall station and the locations of the rainfall stations specifically upstream p would transmit to its downstream reaches and affect a series of physicochemical processes of p in the downstream channel thus the impacts of scarcity data location at the upper reaches was further analysed based on a concept of influence sphere by comparing δh values of the simulated h tp data of several related downstream sub watersheds therefore this paper uses tributaries as confluence units to study the actual influence of every rainfall station on a series of downstream reaches and establish the importance of each station location by quantifying their downstream δh values to avoid the influence of time series scarcity on the simulation results seven rainfall stations gaolou jianlou tangfang wangu wuxi xining and zhongliang that had relatively complete data were chosen to analyse the influence sphere of the each station location these seven scenarios are named s6 s12 and more details about scenarios settings can be found in table 1 2 3 2 temporal series scarcity to reflect the actual data scarcity in the daning river watershed an additional four stations in addition to the above nine stations used for spatial data scarcity analysis were used to accurately analyse the actual scarcity situation daily rainfall data from 13 rainfall stations on the daning river from 1998 to 2008 are therefore used to represent the actual data scarcity in time series there were no daily rainfall data from 1998 to 2000 because the wangu and zhongliang stations were established after 2000 the longmen changan and shuangyang stations did not provide continuous rainfall data in 2003 and 2008 due to a state of disrepair the gaolou station has continuous time series data scarcity in 2003 and short time series scarcity in 2008 short durations of daily rainfall were missing from the wangu and xujiaba stations in 2007 the tangfang and jianlou stations yielded scarce data over 2003 in summary the rainfall data for the daning river is available at random times and is for the most part discontinuous and that some short time series are missing the actual situation of scarce rainfall data is shown in fig 2 to avoid spatial scarcity mentioned above the xining station which had complete data series was used for experiment design of temporal scarcity condition in this study different scarce data scenarios were designed according to the actual situation of the watershed to quantify the impacts of data scarcity the scarce data scenarios were divided into different missing rates and different missing positions lopez and seibert 2016 and the missing data distributions with different missing rates and different missing positions are shown in fig 2 a the different missing scenarios had random and continuous scarce data in time with missing short time series for this paper the six missing rates ranged from 10 to 60 the settings of six missing rates scarcity scenario named s13 to s18 are shown in fig 2 b and table 1 the minimum missing rate of 10 was used for the end of 2004 the beginning of 2005 and for most of 2007 a maximum missing rate of 60 was utilized for the beginning of 2000 the ends of 2001 and 2008 for some parts of 2004 and 2005 and for the entireties of 2002 2003 2006 and 2007 as the six missing rates increased the scarce time periods for the remaining missing rates increased in addition fig 2 c shows five different missing positions patterns 1 5 among them patterns 1 4 and 5 represent the data scarcity of 2000 2005 and 2007 which are the high flow years respectively pattern 2 represents the data scarcity of 2002 year which is the normal flow year pattern 3 was designed to represent the data scarcity of 2004 year which is the low flow year 3 results 3 1 impacts of spatial data scarcity 3 1 1 impacts of station number and location the h tp evaluations results during data spatial scarcity conditions are shown in table 2 specifically the information entropy of the gaolou zhongliang jianlou xining wuxi wangu tangfang xujiaba and changan station is quantified as 0 2002 0 0906 0 2756 0 3638 0 2410 0 0757 0 1656 0 3111 and 0 1909 and information entropy for s0 to s5 was 1 9145 1 5507 1 4125 1 2462 1 0460 and 0 8804 in turn while the ens of flow and tp were reduced from 0 7425 to 0 6023 and from 0 9299 to 0 742 respectively this indicates that the model performance gradually deteriorated if spatial rainfall scarcity exists in compare the 8 gauge scenario lacked the main site of the xining station which reduced the total set of information by approximately 25 indicating an obvious decrease of model performance during the 8 gauge scenario however the simulation results from the several scenarios that retained the rainfall station with the highest information entropy were satisfactory the resulting effects using the s1 and s2 scenarios were identical because although the changan and xujiaba stations were removed during the s2 scenario these two stations were not taken into account due to the interpolation using the thiessen polygons in swat the δhtemporal values for the simulated h tp are shown in fig 3 it could be observed that the fluctuations in δhtemporal were relatively stable during different scenarios by mainly concentrating in the average value and its vicinity compare to ens values that reflected model performance at the catchment outlet the δhtemporal could better reflect the simulation results and their responses to rainfall data scarcity as the information entropy decreased from 1 2462 to 0 8804 the maximum and minimum values of the fluctuations increased from 0 41 to 0 86 and from 0 11 to 0 52 respectively which reflected the gradual increase in fluctuation range of δhtemporal as the total information entropy decreased in addition the maximum and minimum fluctuations during s1 scenario which did not contain large information entropy were 0 89 and 0 33 respectively in other words the simulated h tp outputs changed dramatically from the perspective of the whole watershed the δhspatial values for each sub watershed are shown in fig 4 it can be seen the δhspatial for the 7th sub watershed and its other downstream sub watersheds such as 9th sub watershed increased during s1 scenario scarcity of the xining station at the same time as the total information entropy decreased the sub watersheds with greater δhspatial increased indicating information entropy could reflect changes in trends and processes compare to traditional evaluation methods employing ens and r2 in general the absence of rainfall stations had different impacts on the flow and tp load simulations while the xining station is identified as the key rainfall station in this region by comparing information entropy the lack of rainfall stations containing critical amounts of information had a more impact on the simulation results indicating the lack of critical sites was more important than the reduction in the total amount of information contained in each scenario 3 1 2 impacts on the downstream simulations in this section the change of entropy information of downstream reaches during different scenarios was further taken into account as mentioned above the model performances for the s0 and s2 scenarios were identical due to the interpolation using thiessen polygons seven stations were therefore chosen for this analysis and the δhspatial values of each sub watershed are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the effects of the different missing rainfall stations on h tp simulations were distinctly different the gaolou jianlou and xining stations had large influences on the simulated flow and there were large δhspatial in some sub watersheds if the data of gaolou station were missing the vast majority of the sub watersheds had changes in entropy exceeding 0 6 when the data from the jianlou station were missing the 12th sub watershed experienced a large change in entropy exceeding 1 0 in addition to impacts of the wuxi and tangfang stations the absence of other rainfall stations had greater impacts on the tp simulations in particular if the xining station were omitted almost all of the sub watersheds experienced changes in entropy exceeding 0 2 the attenuation of δhspatial in downstream processes could be used to explain the impacts of data scarcity on the downstream simulations as shown in fig 1 these listed stations were on the associated tributaries the gaolou and zhongliang stations on the xixi river the jianlou and wanguo stations on the houxi river the tangfang and wuxi stations on the baiyang river and the xining station on the dongxi river for this paper the four major tributaries were divided into eight small tributaries according to the different starting points the attenuation process of δh for flow and tp load in the tributary process are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a shows that although the trend was consistent the attenuation process of δh in the xixi river for the gaolou station greatly exceeded that for the zhongliang station that is in this tributary the gaolou station had a greater impact on the downstream simulations indicating the scarcity of the gaolou station was more likely to cause a larger deviation from the simulation results similarly when compared with the wangu station the omission of the jianlou station had a greater effect on the downstream simulated flows the attenuation of the δh for the tangfang and wuxi stations were consistent but as the wuxi station is closer to the export of the watershed the impact of wuxi station was still large on the end of the tributary compared with that for flow the attenuation process of δh for tp was relatively large but the overall trend remained consistent the gaolou jianlou wuxi and xining stations produced relatively large impacts on the simulations of each tributary due to the effects of information transmission across basins and because there are no corresponding rainfall stations in the sub watershed near the gaolou jianlou and xining stations in addition swat is based on the rainfall interpolation method using thiessen polygons so the rainfall data from those sites might be interpolated to other tributaries showing the cross tributary impacts in our previous study shen et al 2012 it was clearly noted that the application of thiessen polygons would cause uncertainties in rainfall spatial heterogeneities coincidentally dile and srinivasan 2015 and yu et al 2011 also gave the same conclusions this was confirmed in more detail in this paper by considering the downstream and cross tributary impacts thus critical rainfall locations could be found by quantifying their impacts on the up downstream simulations scarce data from key rainfall stations will cause simulation results to widely deviate from the actual situation 3 2 impacts of temporal data scarcity 3 2 1 impacts of missing rates in this section the xining station is used to quantify the impacts of different missing rates and different location scarcities due to its information entropy and impacts on downstream simulations as shown in table 3 the ens results showed a downward trend as the missing rate increased for missing rates exceeding 20 the ens were less than 0 6 and decreased continuously under the different missing rates the tp simulation results were consistent with the flow results for missing rates less than 60 the ens exceeded 0 8 indicating satisfactory tp simulations under these missing rates however ens dropped to 0 75 if a missing rate reached 60 primarily due to the small amount of tp monitoring data in this sense if 60 of the rainfall data are missing this would result in a poor point to point comparison between tp simulation and measured tp as this scarcity condition is a bit large and might cover most of the paired tp monitoring data as a whole these results showed that 60 is a critical threshold once this missing rate is exceeded the simulation results will immediately become poor the δhtemporal for the different missing rates are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that there were large differences in δhtemporal for the flows and tp simulations in different months in addition δhtemporal increased with increasing missing rates this indicates that a high missing rate of rainfall driven data is likely to have a large effect on the h tp simulations at the same missing rate the δhtemporal for flow and tp simulations were consistent with the change trend over the months but the δhtemporal in tp was larger than for flow that is when compared to the flow the simulation results of tp were more affected by the absence of rainfall data when the missing rate was gradually increased the information entropy and ens exhibited the same trends it can be seen from table 3 that when the rainfall driven data loss rate exceeded 50 the δh tended to be flat without further change this critical threshold is consistent with the value mentioned above because as the missing rate increases the mean rainfall data gradually approach the threshold the weather generator also reaches its interpolation limit at that time the simulation results will have larger deviations 3 2 2 impacts of scarcity location as shown in fig 8 and table 2 the simulation results of flow and tp were greatly influenced by data missing positions and different location scarcities caused large differences fig 8 a shows that the simulated values of the missing segments in patterns 1 4 and 5 had large deviations from the measured values it can also be seen from table 3 that the effects of the simulation on the flows for the three modes were worse than those for the other modes primarily because patterns 1 4 and 5 corresponded to 2000 2005 and 2007 which were high flow years this indicated missing data from high flow years can easily lead to large deviations in overall rainfall averages which can import greater errors on data generated by the weather generator and measured rainfall data thereby affecting overall simulation results by using ens values fig 8 b shows that the tp model performance was relatively good during different scarcity conditions the simulated effect of the tp load for pattern 4 was significantly inferior to those for the other missing modes primarily due to the absence of high values of tp data which resulted in reduced ens it can be seen from fig 8 that the flow and tp load simulations were not only affected by the positions with scarce data but also experienced certain impacts during the subsequent time period therefore to investigate the effects of the swat model on the simulation results in the follow up periods the simulation results for the missing segments were analysed separately from that for the complete data state the results show that there were significant differences in the model performances of flow for the different missing modes the simulation results for normal flow years and low flow years patterns 2 and 3 were generally better than those for the high flow years patterns 4 and 5 the simulation results of tp for the different missing modes were consistent with those for flow rate that is the model performances for normal flow years were better than for high flow years when compared to flow however the variation of the ens for tp was greater in addition different missing patterns had certain impacts on the simulations during subsequent periods for patterns 4 and 5 which represented data missing scenarios in high flow years whether for flow or tp the model performances of the missing segments had greater impacts on the follow up simulations the changes were larger and the levels during normal flow and low flow years were relatively flat the monthly δhtemporal for flow and tp under different missing positions are shown in fig 9 the δhtemporal increased if data in high flow years were missing and the model performance become poor which indicates that missing positions had greater impacts on the simulation results especially for missing positions in high flow years when simulating tp as shown in fig 9 b there was a significant fluctuation in the δhtemporal for tp simulation after the year with missing data at the same time the δhtemporal for tp was obviously greater than the δhtemporal for flow rate which shows that the absence of different data affected tp more than flow 4 discussion rainfall is one of the causes of nps pollution and is inevitable as an important error source of h nps simulation ning et al 2006 rathnayake and tanyimboh 2015 schreiber and mcdowell 1985 based on the results it could be concluded that rainfall data scarcity had a great impact on h nps simulation so it is necessary to consider the effects of data scarcity at the early stage of model setup especially for those dhms sdhms this paper provided some practical implications for h nps simulation as well as the optimal design of rainfall gauge due to limited financial and material resources it is impossible to set up rainfall stations at each sub watershed to capture actual rainfall spatial variability karimi hosseini et al 2011 lakshmi 2016 sombroek 2001 this paper indicated that rainfall data at key sites in the large watershed are very important and will affect model performances greatly when such stations were scarce therefore the importance of critical rainfall station is highlighted even exceeding the importance of the number of rainfall stations the critical site rainfall stations are those stations that have the greatest impacts on the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall ali et al 2005 cheng et al 2017 swain and patra 2017 and it can be identified by comparing the changes of entropy values of simulated h nps during different scarcity scenarios besides it should be noted that critical site stations might be different for flow and nps prediction because pollutants are influenced by more factors for the daning river watershed the xining station was identified as a key site as it is located the center of the catchment instead of the edge part such sites should be more easily to be focused on as their data might be interpolated into several sub watersheds that were adjacent to them moreover from the perspective from the downstream impacts the rainfall station that near the catchment outlet is more likely to become a key station and has a major impact on the end of this tributary besides the application of radar quantitative precipitation estimation to hydrology and water quality models can be preferred to interpolated rainfall point measurements because of the wide coverage that radars can provide together with a good spatio temporal resolutions so radar rainfall measurements have been improving over the years in those remote regions due to unsatisfactory spatial interpolation of scarce rainfall data bhowmik and costa 2015 the use of the multi sources of radar data and station data is further recommended for a more accurate description of rainfall spatial heterogeneity on the other hands it can be concluded from above temporal series analysis that i certain threshold values exist for missing rates model performance might be stable within this threshold value by using the weather generator but once that threshold value is reached model performance become worsen immediately this indicated that small amount of scarce data can be interpolated by the weather generator but the accuracy of the simulation changes rapidly when a scarcity threshold is exceeded in the study area 60 is a critical value for missing rates and data scarcity not exceed 60 of missing rate could ensure satisfactory model performances in reality the scarce data are inevitable due to a variety of human and natural factors wambura et al 2017 but determining the threshold of input data can be helpful in clarifying the robustness of simulations and in reducing unnecessary monitoring costs ii compared to normal flow or low flow years scarce rainfall data in high flow years will result in greater errors in the simulation results smith et al 2016 proposed that scarce data during spring freshets will introduce greater uncertainty to the flow simulation thus simulation results during those periods can be improved by explicitly indicating soil freezing as for this paper we recommend that rainfall data integrity in high flow periods should be ensured especially for nps prediction and in actual monitoring the monitor should try to ensure the integrity of rainfall data of the critical site rainfall stations in the high flow years another major task of this research is to introduce the information entropy method to evaluate the impacts of data scarcity on the h nps predictions as mentioned above the impacts of rainfall scarcity on the simulated h nps data should be considered not only at the catchment outlet traditional indicators but also theirs temporal spatial distributions among sub watersheds through entropy values as shown in fig 8 and table 2 the ens values and information entropy were reduced from 0 7425 to 0 6023 and from 1 9145 to 0 8804 respectively this indicated that although data scarcity might show little impact on traditional indicator δh would show a more sensitive response to the rainfall input and higher δh reflected more impacts of data scarcity on simulation results this is because the information entropy could reflect the impacts of data scarcity on the simulated data of each sub watershed so this indicator outperforms traditional indicators during data scarcity scenarios it can be seen from fig 9 that the total entropy for the tp load in different missing modes was nearly twice the total entropy of the flows indicating the rainfall data scarcity would show more impacts on nps tp simulation this may be due to a variety of factors affecting the p transport process such as underlying surface altitude and aspect sharpley and syers 1979 therefore the use of the combination of the information entropy method and ens is suggested to evaluate the h nps models when the data has scarcity besides it should be noted that the loss potentials of multiple pollutants are not evenly distributed on the same spatial and temporal scales so more studies should be conducted to provide more comprehensive conclusion 5 conclusions in this study the impacts of rainfall data scarcity on h nps simulations were quantified by running and comparing different spatial temporal data scarcity scenarios the results highlighted the importance of critical site rainfall stations xining station in this paper on the h nps simulations which showed influences on δh and have greater downstream and cross tributary impacts certain threshold value of data scarcity rate 60 in this paper did exist beyond which the model preformation would become very poor compared to traditional indicators information entropy could serve as a good substitute for the ens because it reflect information at the sub watershed scale and attention of impacts within river network this paper provides important implications for the application of dhms sdhms tools as well as for the optimal design of rainfall gauges especially in large basins however the results of this study should be extended to other catchments with caution for example besides rainfall inputs other parameters like fertilizer input would influence the h nps simulation while weather generator methodology which is used to construct some missing data in this study also varies from model to model further studies are needed by considering the integrated impact of temporal and spatial data scarcity in addition more studies should also take the synergism of satellite remote sensing climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr product and station data especially in an extreme hydrological event acknowledgements this research was funded by the national natural

7204,hydrological and non point source pollution h nps predictions in ungagged basins have become the key problem for watershed studies especially for those large scale catchments however few studies have explored the comprehensive impacts of rainfall data scarcity on h nps predictions this study focused on 1 the effects of rainfall spatial scarcity by removing 11 67 of stations based on their locations on the h nps results and 2 the impacts of rainfall temporal scarcity 10 60 data scarcity in time series and 3 the development of a new evaluation method that incorporates information entropy a case study was undertaken using the soil and water assessment tool swat in a typical watershed in china the results of this study highlighted the importance of critical site rainfall stations that often showed greater influences and cross tributary impacts on the h nps simulations higher missing rates above a certain threshold as well as missing locations during the wet periods resulted in poorer simulation results compared to traditional indicators information entropy could serve as a good substitute because it reflects the distribution of spatial variability and the development of temporal heterogeneity this paper reports important implications for the application of distributed hydrological models and semi distributed hydrological models as well as for the optimal design of rainfall gauges among large basins keywords information entropy non point source pollution rainfall data scarcity soil and water assessment tool three gorges reservoir region 1 introduction non point source nps pollution has been a key threat to water quality for decades and hydrological and non point source h nps models are the main tools used to quantify nps pollution andréassian et al 2001 bera and borah 2003 chaubey et al 1999 drecht et al 2003 typically h nps models can be divided into lumped hydrologic models lhms distributed hydrological models dhms and semi distributed hydrological model sdhms the lhms regard the watershed as a whole object and cannot reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the actual process inside the watershed hrachowitz and clark 2017 conversely dhms sdhms divide watersheds into smaller spatial units while pollutants are calculated from each separate unit and are then summed at the watershed outlet as one special kind of dhms the sdhms divided the entire basin into sub watersheds first and then into a number of hydrological response units hrus or other computational units depending on slope soil type and land use instead of rectangular grids with uniform size hrachowitz et al 2016 viviroli et al 2009 in this sense spatial variations in climate underlying surfaces and related hydrological elements could be considered and spatial data with higher accuracy that are typically derived via remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis technologies are required bieger et al 2014 wang et al 2016 the commonly used dhms sdhms include the soil and water assessment tool swat model the institute of hydrology distributed model ihdm and topmodel among these models the swat model has become one of the most widely used tools in describing temporal and spatial variations in h nps cycles especially for large scale watersheds due to their greater heterogeneities amatya et al 2011 rainfall data are regarded as the most important inputs for dhms sdhms because they act as the driving force of runoff generation and pollutant transportation lobligeois et al 2014 kashani et al 2016 sun et al 2017 typically rainfall data could be obtained using both rainfall station and radar product kashani et al 2016 pereiracardenal et al 2011 the application of the radar product has become more widespread as radar technique can reflect the spatial and temporal rainfall variability especially for those remote regions biggs and atkinson 2015 however the radar rainfall product is sometime questioned as its resolutions are generally based on quantitative rainfall estimates qpes from weather radar networks harrison et al 2009 several major disadvantages of qpes such as low spatial resolution low level forecast for torrential rain and rough prediction of spatial temporal structure of heavy rainfall make the radar data cannot meet the requirements of h nps models cluckie et al 2004 thus there is a growing need for combined synergic use of radar measurements along with the rainfall stations and the rain gauge is still the fundamental source used by dhms sdhms to determine rainfall variability previous studies have indicated that rainfall has irregular changes due to the varying natural conditions and shows strong spatial temporal heterogeneities among large scale watersheds which would impact simulated results of the dhms sdhms bardossy and plate 1992 shen et al 2012 long time series of rainfall data is often required for comprehensive h nps evaluations by covering high flow normal flow and low flow periods to the greatest extent kuangyao et al 2000 troin et al 2012 however automatic weather stations are susceptible because certain time series may be lost in part due to direct and indirect damage caused by lightning electromagnetic pulses electromagnetic interference and human operational errors are also destructive factors for automatic stations and can result in random and continuous absences of rainfall data as a result damage to automatic stations and other equipment errors due to various human and natural factors can cause losses in rainfall data series shen et al 2015a wambura et al 2017 on the other hand previous study has indicated spatial rainfall variability is an important source of nps simulation uncertainty thus users must focus on the optimal design of rainfall stations shen et al 2012 however accurate descriptions of spatial rainfall variability cannot be obtained due to the paucity of existing observation sites which is caused by economic and technique conditions i e terrain the spatial and temporal resolutions of rainfall data are constrained and interrelated and will affect the quantification of h nps meusburger et al 2012 michaelides et al 2009 thus rainfall data scarcity indeed exists and has become the key barrier to h nps prediction h nps predictions in ungauged basins pub have become a hot topic for hydrological researchers because data scarcity is still a worldwide problem the international association of hydrological sciences iahs began the pub programme as its first key research programme in the 21st century which is called as pub 2003 2012 shaping an exciting future for the hydrological sciences hrachowitz et al 2013 for those dhms sdhms scarce scenarios of rainfall data could be divided into two types spatial series and time series satellite remote sensing play an important role in the pub lakshmi 2004 but it cannot solve the problem of high spatial resolution and frequent time duplication lakshmi 2016 studies have also focused on the effect of different spatial interpolation methods and their combinations on rainfall estimation during different rainfall periods ali et al 2005 cheng et al 2017 swain and patra 2017 although these studies have shown that spatial rainfall variability could be obtained by interpolating rainfall data of each station by the methods such as thiessen polygons average method and centroid method cho et al 2009 there are few studies focused on their performances during data scarcity scenarios specifically weather generators have been developed for dhms sdhms to cope with data scarcity in time series but the impacts of data scarcity scenarios on their interpolation abilities are not clear yet chen et al 2017a ruan et al 2016 in that regard quantifying the impacts of the temporal and spatial scarcity of rainfall data is indeed crucial because those data provide the basic inputs for h nps models therefore we focused on the influences of rainfall data scarcity on total phosphorus tp prediction in a nps dominant catchment by running and comparing different rainfall scarcity scenarios the following tasks have been performed by 1 quantifying the effects of rainfall spatial scarcity station number and location on h tp simulations and 2 exploring the impacts of rainfall temporal scarcity data scarcity in time series on h tp predictions and 3 developing the information entropy as a new method to replace traditional indicators for data scarcity evaluation the study is carried out for daning watershed china 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area description and data collection 2 1 1 study area description the daning river watershed is located in wushan county and wuxi county the municipality of chongqing china as an important tributary in the three gorges reservoir area the drainage area of the daning river watershed is approximately 2422 km2 and consists of four major tributaries including the xixi river the houxi river the boyang river and the dongxi river the mean rainfall is 1030 1950 mm per year and the annual temperature of the watershed is approximately 18 4 c the elevation of the daning river watershed ranges from 200 m to 2605 m while the land use types in this area are primarily comprised of forest lands 61 85 croplands 24 90 and grasslands 12 48 this area also consists of seven major soil types yellow soils 46 05 yellow brown soils 25 79 limestone soils 18 19 brown soils 6 28 purple soils 1 98 paddy soil 1 52 and alluvial soils less than 0 2 the location of the watershed in the three gorges reservoir area and other information are shown in fig 1 based on historical record the daning river suffers serious nps pollution and phosphorus p is the limiting nutrient causing eutrophication in the three gorges reservoir region shen et al 2012 2015b in this area excessive use of phosphate fertilizer are used on slope cropland and the rainfall would cause p being carrying into the receiving body of water through rainfall erosion and runoff transport from non specific sites in form of nps pollution thus tp was selected as a representative of nps pollutants and water quality in this region 2 1 2 data collection for a comprehensive evaluation detailed data that are available in this region are collected and compiled as follows daily rainfall data at nine rainfall stations inside the watershed and four stations at sites approximately 30 km outside the watershed boundary from 1998 to 2008 were obtained from the meteorological bureau of wuxi county and china national meteorological administration other meteorological data from 2000 to 2008 such as daily maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and sunlight radiation were collected at the meteorological bureau of wuxi county the digital elevation model dem which had a resolution of 1 250 000 was digitized from raw data provided by the national fundamental geographic information center of china the land use map which had a resolution of 1 100 000 was obtained from the resources and environment science data center of the chinese sciences academy the soil type map which had a resolution of 1 50 000 was obtained from the agricultural science committee of wuxi city the soil physical properties including soil density saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity and field capacity were acquired from the institute of soil science in nanjing the soil chemical properties were obtained from the soil database of china the crop management measures were obtained from field investigations with local farmers the measured daily flow data and monthly water quality data are mainly obtained from the yangtze river basin water conservancy commission and the wuxi county environmental protection bureau 2 2 setup of the swat model 2 2 1 model description as a physical based and semi distributed model the swat is used for the h nps prediction in this study the swat represents spatial heterogeneities of land covers soil types and management practices and is therefore suitable for large scale and complex watershed studies douglas mankin et al 2010 the soil conservation service scs method 1972 and green ampt infiltration methods 1911 are the two alternative methods for surface runoff estimation while the penman monteith priestley taylor and hargreaves methods are used for the evapotranspiration estimation the simulation of subsurface flow reference from a kinematic storage method and the routing channel water is simulated by the muskingum method the modified universal soil loss equation musle is incorporated to simulate soil erosion and estimate sediment yield the swat can monitor organic p inorganic p and soluble p and simulates the p cycle in the water stream specifically the solubility of p is limited in most environments and this property of p makes it accumulate near the soil surface and migrate easily with surface runoff heathwaite and dils 2000 smil 2000 sharpley et al 2001 moreover the swat can simulate six p pools in the soil including three inorganic and three organic forms such as insoluble forms of mineral p and p in the soil solution etc 1 p surf 0 001 c orgp q sed a hru ε p sed where psurf is the amount of organic p in surface runoff and corgp is the concentration of organic p in the top 10 mm of soil and εp sed is the p enrichment ratio and ahru is the area of the hru and qsed is the sediment yield on a given day 2 q sed 11 8 q surf q peak a hru 0 56 k ulse c ulse p ulse l ulse f cfrg where qsed is the sediment yield on a given day qsurf is the surface runoff volume qpeak is the peak runoff rate ahru is the area of the hru kusle cusle pusle and lusle is the usle soil erodibility factor cover and management factor topographic factor and coarse fragment factor respectively 2 2 2 rainfall module of the swat to supplement incomplete meteorological data in temporal series the weather generator is incorporated as a module of the swat hartkamp et al 2003 wilks 2009 the weather generator could be used to interpolate the scarce data in temporal series and six meteorological variables are interpolated from the known high and low values including rainfall highest temperature lowest temperature daily average relative humidity daily radiation and daily average wind speed kilsby et al 2007 the daily rainfall data are simulated using a markov chain skewed distribution model richardson 1981 according to the skewed distribution function of the swat model the formula for calculating the rainfall in rainy days is 3 r day μ mon 2 σ mon snd day g mon 6 g mon 6 1 3 1 g mon where rday is the one day rainfall μmon is the average daily rainfall in one month σmon is the standard deviation of the average daily rainfall in one month sndday is the standard normal deviation of the calculated one day and gmon is the skewness coefficient of the average daily rainfall in one month the standard normal deviation for one day is 4 snd day cos 6 283 rnd 2 2 ln rnd 1 where rnd1 and rnd2 are random numbers between 0 and 1 0 to capture the spatial rainfall variability thiessen polygons are used for the swat simulation in the large watershed and the swat also uses elevation bands to account for orographic effects on rainfall and temperature the thiessen polygons depend on the overall average or data near the missing data and the elevation bands are used in conjunction with other methods to calculate rainfall and simulate runoff in the mountain location fontaine et al 2002 zhang et al 2008 2 2 3 model setup using the dem the daning river watershed was divided into 22 sub watersheds based on a threshold of the critical source area of 5000 ha the sub watersheds were then divided into hrus according to the different underlying surface features including land use soil type and slope the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 of the swat calibration and uncertainty programme was used for calibration and validation abbaspour et al 2007 according to the data obtained the calibration and verification in this paper are based on the monthly time step the hydrological and water quality data from 2004 to 2008 are selected as calibration periods because of its completeness hydrological and water quality data from 2000 to 2003 are selected as validation periods a one year warm up period 1999 was specified for both the calibration and validation periods traditional methods were used for model evaluation merz and blöschl 2004 including the correlation coefficient r2 legates and mccabe 1999 and the nash sutcliffe coefficient ens nash and sutcliffe 1970 the correlation coefficient r2 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o i 1 n p i p 2 2 where oi is the ith observed value pi is the ith simulated value is the average of the observed values n is the number of observed values or simulated values when the simulated values are equal to the measured values then r2 1 when r2 1 the smaller the value are the lower the degree of data fit the nash sutcliffe coefficient ens 6 ens 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 when the simulated values are equal to the measured values ens 1 then when ens 1 the smaller the value of a reflects the lower degree of data coincidence when ens is less than 0 it indicates that the model performance is poor in sum the r2 values were quantified as 0 79 and 0 95 for the simulated flows and tp respectively and the ens values were 0 74 and 0 93 respectively indicating that the swat model performed well in this study area for more information about this process please see our previous studies chen et al 2014 gong et al 2012 2 3 design of the rainfall data scarcity 2 3 1 spatial data scarcity in this study both spatial and temporal data scarcity are designed and the details of data scarcity scenario could be found in table 1 in the study of spatial data scarcity the daily rainfall data from 2000 to 2008 were obtained from 9 stations which are the xining changan xujiaba gaolou zhongliang jianlou wangu tangfang and wuxi rainfall station fig 1 the spatial rainfall variation was then generated for the 22 sub watersheds by regarding each station as a single unit and interpolating them using the thiessen polygon method therefore the baseline scenario is setup by using all complete datasets and the spatial data scarcity is then designed by reducing the number of rainfall stations and their spatial locations for data scarce scenarios the number of rainfall stations is often limited so the impacts of station number on nps tp load prediction was compared firstly to make more comprehensive results information entropy was used to evaluate the spatial model performances in addition to ens entropy theory which was introduced by shannon in the 1940s is widely used in the fields of hydrology and the environment bian and feng 2010 khosravi et al 2016 shannon notes that there is redundancy in any information and the size of the redundancy is related to the probability or uncertainty of each symbol number letter or word in the message the information entropy is the amount of information which is the average amount of information after excluding redundancy ilunga 2017 some studies have shown that the information entropy method has good results with less computational complexity to compute the fuzzy formal concepts shemshadi et al 2011 singh et al 2014 in this study entropy theory is used in the following forms to solve a variety of problems in terms of h nps model evaluation chen et al 2017b 7 h spatial x j i 1 n p x ij logp x ij 8 h temporal x i j 1 m p x ij logp x ij where hspatial xj is the information entropy of each sub watershed in the whole simulation period and htemporal xi is the information entropy of the whole watershed in monthly time step xij is sub watershed j for month ith and p xij is the ratio of the simulated flow or pollutants data at xij to the total output of the entire basin in monthly time step and n is the number of months during simulations and m is the number of sub watersheds in the whole watershed then indicator of δh is used as means that deviation in entropy values between baseline scenario and data scarcity scenario in this sense the impacts of each single rainfall station on h nps prediction could be reflected by the information theory then importance of each paired stations on the model simulation results could be ranked by δh value during each scenario this study employed six scenarios by gradually decreasing the total entropy of the rainfall stations that is station numbers and more details about six scenarios are shown in table 1 the scenarios included a complete scenario with 9 rainfall stations named s0 an 8 gauge scenario that lacked the xining station named s1 and a 7 gauge scenario that lacked the changan and xujiaba stations named s2 furthermore there were 5 gauge 4 gauge and 3 gauge scenarios wherein the number of rainfall stations was gradually reduced named s3 s4 and s5 respectively by comparing the simulated values those important stations which showed greater influences on the h nps simulations are defined as the critical site rainfall stations besides the importance of the rainfall stations in a watershed is related to the amount of information contained in the river basin the basin area is controlled by a single rainfall station and the locations of the rainfall stations specifically upstream p would transmit to its downstream reaches and affect a series of physicochemical processes of p in the downstream channel thus the impacts of scarcity data location at the upper reaches was further analysed based on a concept of influence sphere by comparing δh values of the simulated h tp data of several related downstream sub watersheds therefore this paper uses tributaries as confluence units to study the actual influence of every rainfall station on a series of downstream reaches and establish the importance of each station location by quantifying their downstream δh values to avoid the influence of time series scarcity on the simulation results seven rainfall stations gaolou jianlou tangfang wangu wuxi xining and zhongliang that had relatively complete data were chosen to analyse the influence sphere of the each station location these seven scenarios are named s6 s12 and more details about scenarios settings can be found in table 1 2 3 2 temporal series scarcity to reflect the actual data scarcity in the daning river watershed an additional four stations in addition to the above nine stations used for spatial data scarcity analysis were used to accurately analyse the actual scarcity situation daily rainfall data from 13 rainfall stations on the daning river from 1998 to 2008 are therefore used to represent the actual data scarcity in time series there were no daily rainfall data from 1998 to 2000 because the wangu and zhongliang stations were established after 2000 the longmen changan and shuangyang stations did not provide continuous rainfall data in 2003 and 2008 due to a state of disrepair the gaolou station has continuous time series data scarcity in 2003 and short time series scarcity in 2008 short durations of daily rainfall were missing from the wangu and xujiaba stations in 2007 the tangfang and jianlou stations yielded scarce data over 2003 in summary the rainfall data for the daning river is available at random times and is for the most part discontinuous and that some short time series are missing the actual situation of scarce rainfall data is shown in fig 2 to avoid spatial scarcity mentioned above the xining station which had complete data series was used for experiment design of temporal scarcity condition in this study different scarce data scenarios were designed according to the actual situation of the watershed to quantify the impacts of data scarcity the scarce data scenarios were divided into different missing rates and different missing positions lopez and seibert 2016 and the missing data distributions with different missing rates and different missing positions are shown in fig 2 a the different missing scenarios had random and continuous scarce data in time with missing short time series for this paper the six missing rates ranged from 10 to 60 the settings of six missing rates scarcity scenario named s13 to s18 are shown in fig 2 b and table 1 the minimum missing rate of 10 was used for the end of 2004 the beginning of 2005 and for most of 2007 a maximum missing rate of 60 was utilized for the beginning of 2000 the ends of 2001 and 2008 for some parts of 2004 and 2005 and for the entireties of 2002 2003 2006 and 2007 as the six missing rates increased the scarce time periods for the remaining missing rates increased in addition fig 2 c shows five different missing positions patterns 1 5 among them patterns 1 4 and 5 represent the data scarcity of 2000 2005 and 2007 which are the high flow years respectively pattern 2 represents the data scarcity of 2002 year which is the normal flow year pattern 3 was designed to represent the data scarcity of 2004 year which is the low flow year 3 results 3 1 impacts of spatial data scarcity 3 1 1 impacts of station number and location the h tp evaluations results during data spatial scarcity conditions are shown in table 2 specifically the information entropy of the gaolou zhongliang jianlou xining wuxi wangu tangfang xujiaba and changan station is quantified as 0 2002 0 0906 0 2756 0 3638 0 2410 0 0757 0 1656 0 3111 and 0 1909 and information entropy for s0 to s5 was 1 9145 1 5507 1 4125 1 2462 1 0460 and 0 8804 in turn while the ens of flow and tp were reduced from 0 7425 to 0 6023 and from 0 9299 to 0 742 respectively this indicates that the model performance gradually deteriorated if spatial rainfall scarcity exists in compare the 8 gauge scenario lacked the main site of the xining station which reduced the total set of information by approximately 25 indicating an obvious decrease of model performance during the 8 gauge scenario however the simulation results from the several scenarios that retained the rainfall station with the highest information entropy were satisfactory the resulting effects using the s1 and s2 scenarios were identical because although the changan and xujiaba stations were removed during the s2 scenario these two stations were not taken into account due to the interpolation using the thiessen polygons in swat the δhtemporal values for the simulated h tp are shown in fig 3 it could be observed that the fluctuations in δhtemporal were relatively stable during different scenarios by mainly concentrating in the average value and its vicinity compare to ens values that reflected model performance at the catchment outlet the δhtemporal could better reflect the simulation results and their responses to rainfall data scarcity as the information entropy decreased from 1 2462 to 0 8804 the maximum and minimum values of the fluctuations increased from 0 41 to 0 86 and from 0 11 to 0 52 respectively which reflected the gradual increase in fluctuation range of δhtemporal as the total information entropy decreased in addition the maximum and minimum fluctuations during s1 scenario which did not contain large information entropy were 0 89 and 0 33 respectively in other words the simulated h tp outputs changed dramatically from the perspective of the whole watershed the δhspatial values for each sub watershed are shown in fig 4 it can be seen the δhspatial for the 7th sub watershed and its other downstream sub watersheds such as 9th sub watershed increased during s1 scenario scarcity of the xining station at the same time as the total information entropy decreased the sub watersheds with greater δhspatial increased indicating information entropy could reflect changes in trends and processes compare to traditional evaluation methods employing ens and r2 in general the absence of rainfall stations had different impacts on the flow and tp load simulations while the xining station is identified as the key rainfall station in this region by comparing information entropy the lack of rainfall stations containing critical amounts of information had a more impact on the simulation results indicating the lack of critical sites was more important than the reduction in the total amount of information contained in each scenario 3 1 2 impacts on the downstream simulations in this section the change of entropy information of downstream reaches during different scenarios was further taken into account as mentioned above the model performances for the s0 and s2 scenarios were identical due to the interpolation using thiessen polygons seven stations were therefore chosen for this analysis and the δhspatial values of each sub watershed are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the effects of the different missing rainfall stations on h tp simulations were distinctly different the gaolou jianlou and xining stations had large influences on the simulated flow and there were large δhspatial in some sub watersheds if the data of gaolou station were missing the vast majority of the sub watersheds had changes in entropy exceeding 0 6 when the data from the jianlou station were missing the 12th sub watershed experienced a large change in entropy exceeding 1 0 in addition to impacts of the wuxi and tangfang stations the absence of other rainfall stations had greater impacts on the tp simulations in particular if the xining station were omitted almost all of the sub watersheds experienced changes in entropy exceeding 0 2 the attenuation of δhspatial in downstream processes could be used to explain the impacts of data scarcity on the downstream simulations as shown in fig 1 these listed stations were on the associated tributaries the gaolou and zhongliang stations on the xixi river the jianlou and wanguo stations on the houxi river the tangfang and wuxi stations on the baiyang river and the xining station on the dongxi river for this paper the four major tributaries were divided into eight small tributaries according to the different starting points the attenuation process of δh for flow and tp load in the tributary process are shown in fig 6 fig 6 a shows that although the trend was consistent the attenuation process of δh in the xixi river for the gaolou station greatly exceeded that for the zhongliang station that is in this tributary the gaolou station had a greater impact on the downstream simulations indicating the scarcity of the gaolou station was more likely to cause a larger deviation from the simulation results similarly when compared with the wangu station the omission of the jianlou station had a greater effect on the downstream simulated flows the attenuation of the δh for the tangfang and wuxi stations were consistent but as the wuxi station is closer to the export of the watershed the impact of wuxi station was still large on the end of the tributary compared with that for flow the attenuation process of δh for tp was relatively large but the overall trend remained consistent the gaolou jianlou wuxi and xining stations produced relatively large impacts on the simulations of each tributary due to the effects of information transmission across basins and because there are no corresponding rainfall stations in the sub watershed near the gaolou jianlou and xining stations in addition swat is based on the rainfall interpolation method using thiessen polygons so the rainfall data from those sites might be interpolated to other tributaries showing the cross tributary impacts in our previous study shen et al 2012 it was clearly noted that the application of thiessen polygons would cause uncertainties in rainfall spatial heterogeneities coincidentally dile and srinivasan 2015 and yu et al 2011 also gave the same conclusions this was confirmed in more detail in this paper by considering the downstream and cross tributary impacts thus critical rainfall locations could be found by quantifying their impacts on the up downstream simulations scarce data from key rainfall stations will cause simulation results to widely deviate from the actual situation 3 2 impacts of temporal data scarcity 3 2 1 impacts of missing rates in this section the xining station is used to quantify the impacts of different missing rates and different location scarcities due to its information entropy and impacts on downstream simulations as shown in table 3 the ens results showed a downward trend as the missing rate increased for missing rates exceeding 20 the ens were less than 0 6 and decreased continuously under the different missing rates the tp simulation results were consistent with the flow results for missing rates less than 60 the ens exceeded 0 8 indicating satisfactory tp simulations under these missing rates however ens dropped to 0 75 if a missing rate reached 60 primarily due to the small amount of tp monitoring data in this sense if 60 of the rainfall data are missing this would result in a poor point to point comparison between tp simulation and measured tp as this scarcity condition is a bit large and might cover most of the paired tp monitoring data as a whole these results showed that 60 is a critical threshold once this missing rate is exceeded the simulation results will immediately become poor the δhtemporal for the different missing rates are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that there were large differences in δhtemporal for the flows and tp simulations in different months in addition δhtemporal increased with increasing missing rates this indicates that a high missing rate of rainfall driven data is likely to have a large effect on the h tp simulations at the same missing rate the δhtemporal for flow and tp simulations were consistent with the change trend over the months but the δhtemporal in tp was larger than for flow that is when compared to the flow the simulation results of tp were more affected by the absence of rainfall data when the missing rate was gradually increased the information entropy and ens exhibited the same trends it can be seen from table 3 that when the rainfall driven data loss rate exceeded 50 the δh tended to be flat without further change this critical threshold is consistent with the value mentioned above because as the missing rate increases the mean rainfall data gradually approach the threshold the weather generator also reaches its interpolation limit at that time the simulation results will have larger deviations 3 2 2 impacts of scarcity location as shown in fig 8 and table 2 the simulation results of flow and tp were greatly influenced by data missing positions and different location scarcities caused large differences fig 8 a shows that the simulated values of the missing segments in patterns 1 4 and 5 had large deviations from the measured values it can also be seen from table 3 that the effects of the simulation on the flows for the three modes were worse than those for the other modes primarily because patterns 1 4 and 5 corresponded to 2000 2005 and 2007 which were high flow years this indicated missing data from high flow years can easily lead to large deviations in overall rainfall averages which can import greater errors on data generated by the weather generator and measured rainfall data thereby affecting overall simulation results by using ens values fig 8 b shows that the tp model performance was relatively good during different scarcity conditions the simulated effect of the tp load for pattern 4 was significantly inferior to those for the other missing modes primarily due to the absence of high values of tp data which resulted in reduced ens it can be seen from fig 8 that the flow and tp load simulations were not only affected by the positions with scarce data but also experienced certain impacts during the subsequent time period therefore to investigate the effects of the swat model on the simulation results in the follow up periods the simulation results for the missing segments were analysed separately from that for the complete data state the results show that there were significant differences in the model performances of flow for the different missing modes the simulation results for normal flow years and low flow years patterns 2 and 3 were generally better than those for the high flow years patterns 4 and 5 the simulation results of tp for the different missing modes were consistent with those for flow rate that is the model performances for normal flow years were better than for high flow years when compared to flow however the variation of the ens for tp was greater in addition different missing patterns had certain impacts on the simulations during subsequent periods for patterns 4 and 5 which represented data missing scenarios in high flow years whether for flow or tp the model performances of the missing segments had greater impacts on the follow up simulations the changes were larger and the levels during normal flow and low flow years were relatively flat the monthly δhtemporal for flow and tp under different missing positions are shown in fig 9 the δhtemporal increased if data in high flow years were missing and the model performance become poor which indicates that missing positions had greater impacts on the simulation results especially for missing positions in high flow years when simulating tp as shown in fig 9 b there was a significant fluctuation in the δhtemporal for tp simulation after the year with missing data at the same time the δhtemporal for tp was obviously greater than the δhtemporal for flow rate which shows that the absence of different data affected tp more than flow 4 discussion rainfall is one of the causes of nps pollution and is inevitable as an important error source of h nps simulation ning et al 2006 rathnayake and tanyimboh 2015 schreiber and mcdowell 1985 based on the results it could be concluded that rainfall data scarcity had a great impact on h nps simulation so it is necessary to consider the effects of data scarcity at the early stage of model setup especially for those dhms sdhms this paper provided some practical implications for h nps simulation as well as the optimal design of rainfall gauge due to limited financial and material resources it is impossible to set up rainfall stations at each sub watershed to capture actual rainfall spatial variability karimi hosseini et al 2011 lakshmi 2016 sombroek 2001 this paper indicated that rainfall data at key sites in the large watershed are very important and will affect model performances greatly when such stations were scarce therefore the importance of critical rainfall station is highlighted even exceeding the importance of the number of rainfall stations the critical site rainfall stations are those stations that have the greatest impacts on the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall ali et al 2005 cheng et al 2017 swain and patra 2017 and it can be identified by comparing the changes of entropy values of simulated h nps during different scarcity scenarios besides it should be noted that critical site stations might be different for flow and nps prediction because pollutants are influenced by more factors for the daning river watershed the xining station was identified as a key site as it is located the center of the catchment instead of the edge part such sites should be more easily to be focused on as their data might be interpolated into several sub watersheds that were adjacent to them moreover from the perspective from the downstream impacts the rainfall station that near the catchment outlet is more likely to become a key station and has a major impact on the end of this tributary besides the application of radar quantitative precipitation estimation to hydrology and water quality models can be preferred to interpolated rainfall point measurements because of the wide coverage that radars can provide together with a good spatio temporal resolutions so radar rainfall measurements have been improving over the years in those remote regions due to unsatisfactory spatial interpolation of scarce rainfall data bhowmik and costa 2015 the use of the multi sources of radar data and station data is further recommended for a more accurate description of rainfall spatial heterogeneity on the other hands it can be concluded from above temporal series analysis that i certain threshold values exist for missing rates model performance might be stable within this threshold value by using the weather generator but once that threshold value is reached model performance become worsen immediately this indicated that small amount of scarce data can be interpolated by the weather generator but the accuracy of the simulation changes rapidly when a scarcity threshold is exceeded in the study area 60 is a critical value for missing rates and data scarcity not exceed 60 of missing rate could ensure satisfactory model performances in reality the scarce data are inevitable due to a variety of human and natural factors wambura et al 2017 but determining the threshold of input data can be helpful in clarifying the robustness of simulations and in reducing unnecessary monitoring costs ii compared to normal flow or low flow years scarce rainfall data in high flow years will result in greater errors in the simulation results smith et al 2016 proposed that scarce data during spring freshets will introduce greater uncertainty to the flow simulation thus simulation results during those periods can be improved by explicitly indicating soil freezing as for this paper we recommend that rainfall data integrity in high flow periods should be ensured especially for nps prediction and in actual monitoring the monitor should try to ensure the integrity of rainfall data of the critical site rainfall stations in the high flow years another major task of this research is to introduce the information entropy method to evaluate the impacts of data scarcity on the h nps predictions as mentioned above the impacts of rainfall scarcity on the simulated h nps data should be considered not only at the catchment outlet traditional indicators but also theirs temporal spatial distributions among sub watersheds through entropy values as shown in fig 8 and table 2 the ens values and information entropy were reduced from 0 7425 to 0 6023 and from 1 9145 to 0 8804 respectively this indicated that although data scarcity might show little impact on traditional indicator δh would show a more sensitive response to the rainfall input and higher δh reflected more impacts of data scarcity on simulation results this is because the information entropy could reflect the impacts of data scarcity on the simulated data of each sub watershed so this indicator outperforms traditional indicators during data scarcity scenarios it can be seen from fig 9 that the total entropy for the tp load in different missing modes was nearly twice the total entropy of the flows indicating the rainfall data scarcity would show more impacts on nps tp simulation this may be due to a variety of factors affecting the p transport process such as underlying surface altitude and aspect sharpley and syers 1979 therefore the use of the combination of the information entropy method and ens is suggested to evaluate the h nps models when the data has scarcity besides it should be noted that the loss potentials of multiple pollutants are not evenly distributed on the same spatial and temporal scales so more studies should be conducted to provide more comprehensive conclusion 5 conclusions in this study the impacts of rainfall data scarcity on h nps simulations were quantified by running and comparing different spatial temporal data scarcity scenarios the results highlighted the importance of critical site rainfall stations xining station in this paper on the h nps simulations which showed influences on δh and have greater downstream and cross tributary impacts certain threshold value of data scarcity rate 60 in this paper did exist beyond which the model preformation would become very poor compared to traditional indicators information entropy could serve as a good substitute for the ens because it reflect information at the sub watershed scale and attention of impacts within river network this paper provides important implications for the application of dhms sdhms tools as well as for the optimal design of rainfall gauges especially in large basins however the results of this study should be extended to other catchments with caution for example besides rainfall inputs other parameters like fertilizer input would influence the h nps simulation while weather generator methodology which is used to construct some missing data in this study also varies from model to model further studies are needed by considering the integrated impact of temporal and spatial data scarcity in addition more studies should also take the synergism of satellite remote sensing climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr product and station data especially in an extreme hydrological event acknowledgements this research was funded by the national natural
