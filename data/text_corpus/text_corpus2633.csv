the vial was inserted into a heating block at 110 c mixing was done once during the 1 h heating period the reaction product and was cooled to room temperature the resulting resins were washed with water and centrifuged 3 and then dried in a desiccator under high vacuum 2 5 determination of u vi chelation efficacy a stock solution of u vi 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of uo2 no3 26h2o analytical grade in deionized water aqueous solution of 100 mg l u vi was prepared by diluting the stock solution to appropriate volume df 10 the ph of these solutions was adjusted to ph 5 0 with 1 m naoh before the experiment a suspension of 100 mg mf cyclen resin mf aspdota mf glydota mf propdota in 10 ml of u vi solution at ph 5 0 was stirred for 18 h at 25 c following this period the filtrate solutions were collected the volume was adjusted to 10 ml in a calibrated flask and the u vi concentration of this solution was determined by icp oes the static distribution ratio kds at ph 5 was calculated as follows kd s c 0 c c v m c0 stands for the initial uranyl concentration g ml 1 c stands for the uranyl concentration of the solution after contacting with the resin sample g ml 1 v stands for the volume of solution ml and m is the weight of mf cyclen resin sample g 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of mf cyclen resins functionalized mf resins were synthesized in a single step thermal acidic polymerization from melamine formaldehyde and a ligand containing carboxylic acid moieties the first cyclen derivative we attempted to bind to the matrix was commercial dota tetraacetic acid cyclen the synthesis of mf dota was not successful as evident by solid state 13c nmr and ftir atr numerous experiments were carried out to test synthetic conditions including temperature concentration order of addition etc but the desired product was not obtained we were however successful in repeating the synthesis of mf dtpa resin reported by baraka et al 16 it was therefore postulated that the failure to bind dota to mf was either due to lower number of carboxylic moieties per ligand molecule as compared to dtpa or due to the proximity of the carboxylic groups to the cyclen core causing steric hindrance to test both these hypotheses three cyclen based ligands were prepared with varying carboxylic acid loading and or distance from cyclen core these were based on aspartic acid glycine and propionic acid aspartic acid and glycine cyclen derivatives aspdota and glydota respectively were synthesized by a 3 step route fig 4 first a brominated linker was attached to the amine of the amino acid ethyl ester followed by conjugation to the amines of the cyclen and subsequent hydrolysis of the ester groups in the case of aspdota the ligand both contained a higher number of carboxylic acids eight and due to the linker these were located further from the cyclen core in order to differentiate between the effect of multiple carboxylic acids and that of their distance from the cyclen core a similar synthetic route was employed to afford glydota in this case only four carboxylic acids were present the same as for dota but attaching through the same linker resulted in a larger distance between these and the cyclen core in order to further test the hypothesis that the acid distance from the cyclen core was a major factor in the ability to attach to mf a third ligand was prepared propdota by simply attaching propionic acids to the cyclen fig 5 thus achieving the smallest distance change as compared to dota all three ligands were prepared in high yields by modifications of literature procedures 22 3 1 1 characterization of the mf cyclen dota chelating resins several spectroscopic methods were used in order to confirm the formation of cyclen derivative containing mf resins the resins were not soluble hence solution nmr or ftir were not applicable atr ftir was found to be not sufficiently sensitive most likely due to its low penetration depth although a weak signal at 1627 cm 1 was observed which may be attributed to an amide bond between the ligand and the mf 13c solid state mas nmr was found to be a reliable tool to verify successful binding of the ligand to mf a comparison between unmodified mf and mf dtpa is presented in table 1 and fig 6 peaks marked with are side bands new peak detected at 159 ppm may be attributed to amide formation an increase in the relative intensity of ch2n 45 65 ppm was also observed while the relative amount of ch2o groups 70 ppm in the resin decreased as can be seen by the diminishing intensity of the peaks this is due to added ch2n functionalities from the ligand and subsequent relative decrease in the amount of ch2o moieties linkage between ligand and melamine also results in less positions for formaldehyde linking also contributing to diminished ch2o signal moreover while in mf all signals belong to the polymer backbone and have similar relaxation rates in nmr in the case of mf dtpa the backbone ch2n signals were found to have different relaxation rates than ligand ch2n signals which also effects their relative intensities polymer backbone exhibited lower and broader signals compared to signals due to the cyclen ligands fig 7 shows the solid state mas 13c nmr spectra of the series of resins prepared the spectrum of the resin obtained in the attempt to prepare mf dota is similar to that of non functionalized mf whereas a clear difference is seen for the resins prepared with the new dota derivatives the signal due to carboxyl groups in the mf aspdota was much more pronounced than in the mf glydota and mf propdota due to the larger number of carboxylic acids in aspdota a resin containing 50 aspdota was also prepared in order to normalize the overall number of acid groups in the resin for the sake of comparison with glydota and propdota table 2 gives the nmr data for the novel resins the facile preparation of mf propdota confirms our hypothesis that the steric hindrance resulting from the proximity of carboxylic acids to the cyclen core in dota did not allow for its binding to mf polymer a small change of just one methylene group enabled the binding of the propionic macrocyclic ligand to mf 3 2 efficiency of mf cyclen resins towards u vi ions the three new mf cyclen resins were tested for their efficiency as u vi uo2 2 ions adsorbents which was evaluated by determining the static distribution coefficient kds from a uranyl nitrate solution at ph 5 it should be noted that kds represents the combined affinity of mf cyclen resins mf aspdota mf glydota mf propdota towards uo2 2 kds results for the novel mf cyclen resins as well as for unmodified mf and mf dtpa resins are reported in table 3 the functionalized mf cyclen resins exhibit higher extraction efficiency values compared to the non functionalized mf resin kds 22 ml g mf dtpa and mf aspdota resins exhibit high kds values and the highest efficiency of uranyl removal 92 1233 ml g and 95 1808 ml g respectively compared to all other tested resins mf glydota exhibited moderate results 64 176 ml g and mf propdota resin exhibits the poorest extracting efficiency and kds values 44 78 ml g the main differences in kds values obtained may be related either to the length of the linker between the polymeric backbone and core ligand steric hindrance or the number of carboxylic acids pka which play a major role in u vi extraction 3 2 1 ph effect from the known pka s of glycine pka 2 34 23 aspartic acid pka 1 88 and 3 65 24 and propionic acid pka 4 88 25 it is expected that at ph 5 the terminal acid groups of aspdota and glydota are fully deprotonated and therefore have similar contribution to metal ion chelation the terminal carboxylic acids in propdota are mostly but not fully deprotonated which is probably the reason for poor uranyl ion binding wang et al 26 have shown that the chelation of metal ions by an aspartic acid pyridine adduct occurs via multidentate binding by both carboxylic acids the aspartic acid amine group an adjacent pyridine amine and water molecules 26 the complexation mechanism of u vi ion with the aspartic acid moiety in the mf aspdota system can occur via similar chelation certainly in an n rich environment afforded by mf fig 8a b and mf glydota and mf propdota systems can chelate u vi ion in a manner similar to dota ligand 27 fig 9a 3 2 2 linker length effect linker length was found to have a vital role in these systems as shown a very small linker was the reason for unsuccessful binding of dota to mf minor elongation acetyl to propionyl allowed the successful preparation of mf propdota linker length has another effect relating to the efficacy of u vi binding when the carboxylic moieties are located further from the cyclen core as in aspdota and glydota ligands they cannot directly participate in the chelation within the macrocycle in these systems the linker contains an amide moiety adjacent to the cyclen core and the amide carbonyls can interact with the metal cation partially compensating for the inability of the carboxylic acids to take part in the macrocycle chelation fig 9b c for mf propdota the carboxylic acids are close enough to create a direct dota like chelation however the participation of the carboxylic acids is governed by the ph since the linker with the amide carbonyls in the same for mf aspdota and mf glydota the differences in u vi chelation cannot be attributed to this factor it is suggested that the high efficiency of mf aspdota 1808 ml g results from a dual chelating mechanism the uranyl ion is complexed by the macrocycle which is assisted by the amide groups in the aspdota linker as well as a second mode of chelation through pairs of terminal dicarboxylic acids hence we postulate that mf aspdota binds more u vi stoichiometrically fig 8 4 conclusions dota ligands which are cyclen derivatives represent a class of macrocycles well known for their affinity towards transition and non transition metallic cations grafting such chelating agents onto a hydrophobic support is an appealing method for the chelation of uranyl ions from wastewater as it is expected to prevent the loss of the ligand in solution during extraction although it was not possible to directly prepare dota grafted mf resin three dota derivatives were synthesized characterized and successfully grafted onto mf we propose that the close proximity of the carboxylic acid group to the macrocycle in dota was the limiting factor for mf dota binding a mere elongation of the side chain by one methylene group sufficed to overcome this limitation as shown by successful mf propdota preparation during this work we identified mf aspdota as a novel resin with a high affinity towards u vi ions it can remove 95 of u vi ions at ph 5 we suggest that the high efficiency of mf aspdota at ph 5 results from a dual chelating mechanism complexation of the uranyl ion both by the macrocycle assisted by the amide groups in the aspdota linker as well as by the terminal dicarboxylic moieties in this work we focused on the design synthesis and characterization of novel ligands and respective mf based polymers we evaluated their efficacy in binding uranyl ions and mf aspdota was found to be the most suitable resin for uranyl ion removal from aqueous solution we are set to further investigate mf aspdota system in the aspects of ion selectivity and regeneration for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

vortexed until full dissolution melamine 5 10 3 mol 3 equivalents was added and the vial content was mixed manually to afford an emulsion aqueous solution of formaldehyde 1 ml 37 was then added and the vial was inserted into a heating block at 110 c mixing was done once during the 1 h heating period the reaction product and was cooled to room temperature the resulting resins were washed with water and centrifuged 3 and then dried in a desiccator under high vacuum 2 5 determination of u vi chelation efficacy a stock solution of u vi 1000 mg l was prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of uo2 no3 26h2o analytical grade in deionized water aqueous solution of 100 mg l u vi was prepared by diluting the stock solution to appropriate volume df 10 the ph of these solutions was adjusted to ph 5 0 with 1 m naoh before the experiment a suspension of 100 mg mf cyclen resin mf aspdota mf glydota mf propdota in 10 ml of u vi solution at ph 5 0 was stirred for 18 h at 25 c following this period the filtrate solutions were collected the volume was adjusted to 10 ml in a calibrated flask and the u vi concentration of this solution was determined by icp oes the static distribution ratio kds at ph 5 was calculated as follows kd s c 0 c c v m c0 stands for the initial uranyl concentration g ml 1 c stands for the uranyl concentration of the solution after contacting with the resin sample g ml 1 v stands for the volume of solution ml and m is the weight of mf cyclen resin sample g 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis of mf cyclen resins functionalized mf resins were synthesized in a single step thermal acidic polymerization from melamine formaldehyde and a ligand containing carboxylic acid moieties the first cyclen derivative we attempted to bind to the matrix was commercial dota tetraacetic acid cyclen the synthesis of mf dota was not successful as evident by solid state 13c nmr and ftir atr numerous experiments were carried out to test synthetic conditions including temperature concentration order of addition etc but the desired product was not obtained we were however successful in repeating the synthesis of mf dtpa resin reported by baraka et al 16 it was therefore postulated that the failure to bind dota to mf was either due to lower number of carboxylic moieties per ligand molecule as compared to dtpa or due to the proximity of the carboxylic groups to the cyclen core causing steric hindrance to test both these hypotheses three cyclen based ligands were prepared with varying carboxylic acid loading and or distance from cyclen core these were based on aspartic acid glycine and propionic acid aspartic acid and glycine cyclen derivatives aspdota and glydota respectively were synthesized by a 3 step route fig 4 first a brominated linker was attached to the amine of the amino acid ethyl ester followed by conjugation to the amines of the cyclen and subsequent hydrolysis of the ester groups in the case of aspdota the ligand both contained a higher number of carboxylic acids eight and due to the linker these were located further from the cyclen core in order to differentiate between the effect of multiple carboxylic acids and that of their distance from the cyclen core a similar synthetic route was employed to afford glydota in this case only four carboxylic acids were present the same as for dota but attaching through the same linker resulted in a larger distance between these and the cyclen core in order to further test the hypothesis that the acid distance from the cyclen core was a major factor in the ability to attach to mf a third ligand was prepared propdota by simply attaching propionic acids to the cyclen fig 5 thus achieving the smallest distance change as compared to dota all three ligands were prepared in high yields by modifications of literature procedures 22 3 1 1 characterization of the mf cyclen dota chelating resins several spectroscopic methods were used in order to confirm the formation of cyclen derivative containing mf resins the resins were not soluble hence solution nmr or ftir were not applicable atr ftir was found to be not sufficiently sensitive most likely due to its low penetration depth although a weak signal at 1627 cm 1 was observed which may be attributed to an amide bond between the ligand and the mf 13c solid state mas nmr was found to be a reliable tool to verify successful binding of the ligand to mf a comparison between unmodified mf and mf dtpa is presented in table 1 and fig 6 peaks marked with are side bands new peak detected at 159 ppm may be attributed to amide formation an increase in the relative intensity of ch2n 45 65 ppm was also observed while the relative amount of ch2o groups 70 ppm in the resin decreased as can be seen by the diminishing intensity of the peaks this is due to added ch2n functionalities from the ligand and subsequent relative decrease in the amount of ch2o moieties linkage between ligand and melamine also results in less positions for formaldehyde linking also contributing to diminished ch2o signal moreover while in mf all signals belong to the polymer backbone and have similar relaxation rates in nmr in the case of mf dtpa the backbone ch2n signals were found to have different relaxation rates than ligand ch2n signals which also effects their relative intensities polymer backbone exhibited lower and broader signals compared to signals due to the cyclen ligands fig 7 shows the solid state mas 13c nmr spectra of the series of resins prepared the spectrum of the resin obtained in the attempt to prepare mf dota is similar to that of non functionalized mf whereas a clear difference is seen for the resins prepared with the new dota derivatives the signal due to carboxyl groups in the mf aspdota was much more pronounced than in the mf glydota and mf propdota due to the larger number of carboxylic acids in aspdota a resin containing 50 aspdota was also prepared in order to normalize the overall number of acid groups in the resin for the sake of comparison with glydota and propdota table 2 gives the nmr data for the novel resins the facile preparation of mf propdota confirms our hypothesis that the steric hindrance resulting from the proximity of carboxylic acids to the cyclen core in dota did not allow for its binding to mf polymer a small change of just one methylene group enabled the binding of the propionic macrocyclic ligand to mf 3 2 efficiency of mf cyclen resins towards u vi ions the three new mf cyclen resins were tested for their efficiency as u vi uo2 2 ions adsorbents which was evaluated by determining the static distribution coefficient kds from a uranyl nitrate solution at ph 5 it should be noted that kds represents the combined affinity of mf cyclen resins mf aspdota mf glydota mf propdota towards uo2 2 kds results for the novel mf cyclen resins as well as for unmodified mf and mf dtpa resins are reported in table 3 the functionalized mf cyclen resins exhibit higher extraction efficiency values compared to the non functionalized mf resin kds 22 ml g mf dtpa and mf aspdota resins exhibit high kds values and the highest efficiency of uranyl removal 92 1233 ml g and 95 1808 ml g respectively compared to all other tested resins mf glydota exhibited moderate results 64 176 ml g and mf propdota resin exhibits the poorest extracting efficiency and kds values 44 78 ml g the main differences in kds values obtained may be related either to the length of the linker between the polymeric backbone and core ligand steric hindrance or the number of carboxylic acids pka which play a major role in u vi extraction 3 2 1 ph effect from the known pka s of glycine pka 2 34 23 aspartic acid pka 1 88 and 3 65 24 and propionic acid pka 4 88 25 it is expected that at ph 5 the terminal acid groups of aspdota and glydota are fully deprotonated and therefore have similar contribution to metal ion chelation the terminal carboxylic acids in propdota are mostly but not fully deprotonated which is probably the reason for poor uranyl ion binding wang et al 26 have shown that the chelation of metal ions by an aspartic acid pyridine adduct occurs via multidentate binding by both carboxylic acids the aspartic acid amine group an adjacent pyridine amine and water molecules 26 the complexation mechanism of u vi ion with the aspartic acid moiety in the mf aspdota system can occur via similar chelation certainly in an n rich environment afforded by mf fig 8a b and mf glydota and mf propdota systems can chelate u vi ion in a manner similar to dota ligand 27 fig 9a 3 2 2 linker length effect linker length was found to have a vital role in these systems as shown a very small linker was the reason for unsuccessful binding of dota to mf minor elongation acetyl to propionyl allowed the successful preparation of mf propdota linker length has another effect relating to the efficacy of u vi binding when the carboxylic moieties are located further from the cyclen core as in aspdota and glydota ligands they cannot directly participate in the chelation within the macrocycle in these systems the linker contains an amide moiety adjacent to the cyclen core and the amide carbonyls can interact with the metal cation partially compensating for the inability of the carboxylic acids to take part in the macrocycle chelation fig 9b c for mf propdota the carboxylic acids are close enough to create a direct dota like chelation however the participation of the carboxylic acids is governed by the ph since the linker with the amide carbonyls in the same for mf aspdota and mf glydota the differences in u vi chelation cannot be attributed to this factor it is suggested that the high efficiency of mf aspdota 1808 ml g results from a dual chelating mechanism the uranyl ion is complexed by the macrocycle which is assisted by the amide groups in the aspdota linker as well as a second mode of chelation through pairs of terminal dicarboxylic acids hence we postulate that mf aspdota binds more u vi stoichiometrically fig 8 4 conclusions dota ligands which are cyclen derivatives represent a class of macrocycles well known for their affinity towards transition and non transition metallic cations grafting such chelating agents onto a hydrophobic support is an appealing method for the chelation of uranyl ions from wastewater as it is expected to prevent the loss of the ligand in solution during extraction although it was not possible to directly prepare dota grafted mf resin three dota derivatives were synthesized characterized and successfully grafted onto mf we propose that the close proximity of the carboxylic acid group to the macrocycle in dota was the limiting factor for mf dota binding a mere elongation of the side chain by one methylene group sufficed to overcome this limitation as shown by successful mf propdota preparation during this work we identified mf aspdota as a novel resin with a high affinity towards u vi ions it can remove 95 of u vi ions at ph 5 we suggest that the high efficiency of mf aspdota at ph 5 results from a dual chelating mechanism complexation of the uranyl ion both by the macrocycle assisted by the amide groups in the aspdota linker as well as by the terminal dicarboxylic moieties in this work we focused on the design synthesis and characterization of novel ligands and respective mf based polymers we evaluated their efficacy in binding uranyl ions and mf aspdota was found to be the most suitable resin for uranyl ion removal from aqueous solution we are set to further investigate mf aspdota system in the aspects of ion selectivity and regeneration for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

treatment plant biological nutrient removal biowin process modification sensitivity analysis 1 introduction the treated water from a sewage treatment plant stp is generally discharged into a nearby flowing surface water body wherein the water improves its quality through natural processes before it is picked up by another city downstream for its usage 1 3 urbanization has led to the growth of cities thereby reducing the distance the treated water travels between adjacent cities this in turn demands that the stps treat the water to higher standards authorities have continuously revised water discharge standards of stps making it more stringent every decade requiring the stps to be constantly upgraded during their typical life of about 25 30 years to meet the new standards table s1 of supplementary material tabulates how the treated water quality standards have been made more stringent over the years in india the up gradation can be achieved either by process modifications or retrofitting with modern machinery however retrofitting an existing stp can be an expensive proposition both in terms of time and resources thus it is usually preferred to modify the treatment process to meet the new standards without compromising the stp capacity mathematical models are useful tools for process modifications and optimization of stps among the various mathematical models activated sludge models asm are widely used for plant process optimization 4 6 biowin software 7 with built in asms such as asm1 asm2d and asm3 is used for such process modeling this study discusses process modifications using biowin and its implementation on an existing operational stp to meet the new discharge standard as revised standards demanded stringent biological nutrient removal bnr this study has focused on the same the use of biowin asm models for biological nutrient removal bnr in wastewater treatment has been studied by several researchers 8 13 dynamic biowin asm models have been used in literature to optimize conventional activated sludge cas processes wherein they have recommended either increasing the mean cell residence time mcrt to 40 50 days or including ammonia stripping 14 bizukojc et al have identified kinetic and stoichiometric parameters required for modeling 15 16 and have validated their models with literature data even though several studies have focused on developing biowin based models for process optimization few studies have implemented the model recommendations and observed real time bnr removal in full scale stps also these studies focus only on a specific type of process modifications e g introducing anoxic zones improving the aeration capacity of blowers in activated sludge tanks and varying the return activated sludge ratio r however a comprehensive study investigating the combined effect of several process modifications on improving the treatment and economic efficiency with minimal interventions is lacking in the literature in this work it is hypothesized that creation of virtual anoxic zones in the bioreactor coupled with appropriate modifications of the operating parameters such as hydraulic retention time hrt dissolved oxygen do levels and r ratio in the bioreactor would result in sndn and ebpr a biowin asm model was developed for the 55 million litres per day mld stp and was validated this validated model was used to identify the optimum conditions for process modifications to achieve bnr several sensitivity studies were also conducted to assess the combined effect of various operating conditions including do concentrations mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentrations hrt and r ratio on the bnr process process economics and the potential advantages of following a similar approach on many existing old stps are briefly discussed 1 1 biological nutrient removal bnr theory and mechanism biological nitrogen removal is a two step simultaneous nitrification denitrification sndn process 17 during nitrification the influent ammonia nh3 is oxidized into nitrite no2 by the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the main reactions describing this conversion of nh3 to no2 are given in eqs 1 and 2 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 nh3 is converted into intermediate hydroxylamine nh 2 oh and is further converted to no2 1 n h 3 o 2 2 e n h 2 oh h 2 o 2 n h 2 oh h 2 o n o 2 4 h 4 e the no2 thus formed is further oxidized into nitrate no3 by the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob the reaction describing the conversion of no2 to no3 is given in eq 3 3 n o 2 0 5 o 2 n o 3 denitrification includes the biochemical reduction of nitrate nitrogen no3 n into dinitrogen gas under anoxic conditions by the heterotrophic bacteria in the presence of an organic carbon source cod eq 4 shows the complete redox reaction of denitrification 4 2 n o 3 10 e 12 h n 2 6 h 2 o thus one can achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification sndn in a bioreactor under appropriate process conditions removal of total phosphorous tp in stps is achieved either by the addition of phosphorus reacting chemicals or by enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr process 19 in the ebpr process a group of specialized bacteria known as the luxury phosphorous accumulating organisms pao removes phosphorous in two stages 20 in the first stage paos uptake volatile fatty acids vfa in the wastewater under anaerobic conditions and store them as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha they also release phosphorus orthophosphate in this stage to provide the energy for the uptake of the vfas under aerobic conditions the stored pha is metabolized to provide energy for cell growth in the second stage simultaneously the soluble orthophosphates are consumed and stored resulting in a net phosphorous removal from the wastewater 20 the nmr spectroscopy method is the most commonly used method to quantify these polyphosphates released and consumed in ebpr process the quantification using spectroscopy involves six steps pre centrifugation of sludge pre extraction using edta naoh solution centrifugation and separation of sludge pellet primary extraction concentration by rotary evaporation and measurement using nmr spectroscopy 22 a dominant factor in the ebpr by the paos is the amount of readily biodegradable cod and the vfas present in the influent 20 some typical operating conditions affecting ebpr are given in detail in the supplementary section s3 several studies have examined the possibilities of modifying the conventional activated sludge cas process to improve bnr i e removal of nitrogen and phosphorus n and p biologically 1 19 20 24 25 the approach of retrofitting existing stps to reduce n and p by controlling the aeration and non aeration periods was investigated by hanhan et al and habermeyer et al 26 27 they identified that operating stps with optimum dissolved oxygen do levels between 1 5 and 1 7 mg l coupled with intermittent aeration i e 180 min of aeration followed by 160 min of no aeration resulted in maximum n and cod reduction there have been only a few studies that focus solely on ebpr since it requires strict anaerobic conditions bernard et al 2017 has observed that it was possible to achieve ebpr by creating deep anaerobic zones using slow speed top entry mixers of 2 w m3 capacities in aeration tanks they have maintained do 0 5 mg l and have achieved ebpr 19 khiewwijit et al 2015 have inferred from their numerical studies that 80 of p recovery and 35 reduction in co2 emission in cas was possible by including bio flocculation and partial nitrification conditions 29 in the present study a biowin asm based model is used to optimize bnr in the 55 mld plant 2 model development and theory 2 1 biowin model theory the biowin uses a general activated sludge anaerobic digestion asdm model for all the process simulations the general asdm model has fifty state variables and eighty process expressions for the growth and decay of microorganisms the basic expression in the asdm model for the time rate of change of microbial biomass x is based on monod kinetic equation and mass balance is given as 17 5 dx dt microbial growth microbial decay 6 dx dt μ max x 0 s s k s η μ max x 0 s s k s b x 0 where x 0 is the microbial biomass concentration at time t 0 μ max is the maximum growth rate of this microorganism s is the concentration of the limiting substrate for growth ks is the half saturation coefficient η is the correction factor for anoxic growth and b is the decay coefficient for the biomass the first term in the r h s of eq 6 represents the microbial growth under aerobic condition the second term represents the microbial growth under anoxic condition and the third term represents the microbial decay eq 6 can be modified depending on the type of microbial mass the substrate that is being utilized and the environmental conditions ph do etc that limits its growth the substrate s utilization rate by the microbes is given as 17 7 ds dt μ max x 0 y s s k s where y is the yield coefficient the substrate concentration with time also varies with hydrolysis ammonification and denitrification processes to include these additional terms are added to eq 7 the processes that are included in the asdm model for the growth decay of microorganisms and the substrate synthesis in an activated sludge as system are given in table s2 there are several more processes that are incorporated in biowin but for the present study for the proposed modification with aeration and anoxic zones the processes listed in table s2 were employed more detailed explanation of the process theory is available in the biowin help manual 18 the mass transfer of air and gases to the liquid phase is modeled in biowin using the fundamental theory of surface renewal a few assumptions are made in the biowin mass transfer model including the assumption of completely mixed gas and liquid phases with uniform concentration and a constant gas holdup throughout the control volume being modeled the mass balance for the liquid and gas phase using the mass transfer theory is given respectively as 18 8 d m jt dt q in c jt in q c jt αf k l a l j c j c un j v l r x j 9 d m j dt q in c jt in q c jt αf k l a l j c j c un j v l where m j t is the mass of component j in the liquid phase q in and q is the liquid flow into and out of the control volume respectively c jt in and c jt is the influent and effluent concentration of component j respectively k l a l j is the overall liqid mass transfer coefficient for component j α is the ratio of diffuser for process water to clean water f is the ratio of diffuser for process water to given time of diffuser to process water c j is the saturated concentration of component j at the gas liquid interface c un j is the bulk liquid concentration of unionized component j v l is the volume of the liquid phase and rx j is the net production of component j by reaction for eq 9 m j is the mass of component j in the gas phase q in and q is the gas flow into and out of the control volume respectively c jt in and c jt is the influent and effluent concentration of gas component j respectively eqs 8 and 9 are simultaneously solved to include the mass balance and mass transfer of liquid and gas phases the biowin simulator has two numerical modules for solving namely the steady state and dynamic interactive modules steady state module is applied for analysing systems based on constant influent loading and operating parameters the steady state solver uses a combination of newton raphson nr second order method and decoupled linear search dls method for the solution 18 the second module is the dynamic interactive module which is specifically suitable for time varying inputs and time varying operating conditions the convergence of dynamic simulations is determined by the allowable minimum relative error biowin also has an option for providing concentration limits for parameters default value 0 001 mg l the lower the set concentration limits the higher is accuracy of simulation 18 for the present study all simulations were carried out using the dynamic interactive module since all the influent and operating conditions were varying with time fifty nine differential process equations were solved to find the time rate change of substrate and biomass using the biowin model the flow balance in the biowin model is based on the fundamental principles of continuity momentum and energy conservation the hrt of each unit aeration anoxic tanks is calculated by dividing the volume v of the tank m3 by the amount of discharge q m3 h coming to the unit the initial conditions that are to be provided for the model includes the quantity of water treated per day mld the

and stoichiometric parameters and wastage ratio w the assumptions while using the biowin asdm model and the differences from the field condition were 18 the bioreactor was well mixed and the concentration of all components including do in aeration and reaeration zone was uniform throughout the reactor in actual field conditions the bioreactor was well mixed in aeration and reaeration zones due to the aeration mixing provided by the surface blowers all scenarios in the study were modeled at a constant temperature of 26 c while the average field temperature during sampling pre and post modification was 26 3 c the model was simulated for the maximum flow of 55 mld however in the field conditions due to variation in the quantity of the incoming sewage the actual flow was 53 2 mld for modeling purposes the microbial growth and decay were assumed to follow a first order kinetics for modeling purposes the microbial growth and substrate utilization were assumed to follow monod kinetics the oxygen transfer from air to liquid wastewater was modeled using simple surface renewal theory 2 2 wastewater treatment plant process description the koramangala and challaghatta k c valley wastewater treatment plant which was commissioned in 1979 and located in the bangalore urban district in karnataka india was chosen as the study stp this k c valley plant has three cas stps 30 mld 60 mld and 218 mld with a total design capacity of 318 mld the secondary treated water from the k c valley plant is pumped into a network of run off channels which eventually fill up 134 tanks rejuvenating by indirectly recharging the depleted groundwater aquifers in the parched districts of kolar and chikkaballapur districts in karnataka in the 218 mld stp of the k c valley unit after the primary treatment coarse screens fine screens and grit chambers the incoming wastewater is divided into 5 streams three 36 mld streams and two 55 mld streams the present study focuses on one of the 55

details of the individual treatment processes of the 55 mld unit the dimensions and the operating conditions are given in table 1 the raw sewage primary settled sewage and treated water parameter values for the 55 mld unit is given in table 3 2 3 description of biowin model and model calibration biowin 5 3 7 was used to create a plant wide asm model for the 55 mld unit the existing conditions before process modifications were modeled as the baseline scenario for the baseline scenario the model included the primary clarifier the aeration tank and the two secondary clarifiers of the 55 mld unit as shown in fig 1 the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters were calibrated against the baseline scenario according to stowa protocol 19 as shown in table 4 the total cod in wastewater was divided into biodegradable bcod and non biodegradable nbcod cod the biodegradable fraction was further divided into readily biodegradable rbcod and slowly biodegradable sbcod cod the non biodegradable fraction consisted of non biodegradable soluble cod nbscod and non biodegradable particulate cod nbpcod using respirometric tests of the endogenous activated sludge and influent sample the bcod mg l and rbcod mg l was determined as 20 10 bcod co 1 y h 11 rbcod c o s 1 y h where co and cos were the consumed oxygen of sample and consumed oxygen in soluble filtered sample sample mg l respectively and yh was the heterotrophic yield coefficient g cell cod formed g cod oxidized 1 the value of heterotrophic yield coefficient yh was assumed as 0 72 g cell cod formed g cod oxidized 1 at 26o c as specified in the asm 1 model theory 21 12 nbscod co d s rbcod 13 nbpcod cod bcod nbscod where cod and cod s were total and soluble filtered sample cod mg l respectively the non biodegradable soluble

calculated as 22 14 nbstkn ftkn n h 4 where ftkn was the effluent filtered tkn mg n l and nh 4 was the effluent ammonia mg n l the pcod vss ratio was calculated by dividing particulate cod pcod mg l which was the residual cod after filtration through a 0 45 μm filter by the volatile suspended solids vss mg l fraction 22 for the present study the biowin model was first run with default kinetic and stoichiometric values then the most sensitive wastewater characteristic fractions in the model were identified 19 and were adjusted to match the measured treated water values specifically for tkn nh4 n no3 n and tn values the final adjusted values and their references are shown in table 4 the sludge retention time value was calculated based on the biowin model prediction values the calibrated model was validated for the baseline scenario and the results of the model validation are discussed in section 3 1 the do concentration mlss concentrations and the r ratio in the aeration tank were maintained at 2 5 mg l 2800 mg l and 0 69 1600 m3 h of ras respectively the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters as shown in table 4 were used for simulation the stowa protocol recommends using data that is clearly different from the one used in calibration and the same was followed in the present study 3 methods 3 1 process modification and sensitivity studies using validated biowin model to achieve bnr removal a few modifications in the treatment process were conceived and simulated first on the validated biowin model the modification was to provide a virtual anoxic zone between two aerobic zones to improve the sndn and bpr process by selectively switching off the surface aerators present in this section of the bioreactor the presence of aeration zones followed by anoxic zones is known to assist the nitrification denitrification process for nitrogen removal 23 also it is hypothesized that due to the width of the tank 47 2 m inside the anoxic zone there are pockets of anaerobic regions which act as the anaerobic selector for paos a few literatures have explored the growth of paos under anaerobic conditions inside anoxic tanks 24 25 the aim was to achieve the modifications without taking up any civil works in the stp this was implemented in the validated biowin model by dividing the aeration tank into three compartments aeration zone anoxic zone and re aeration zone as shown in fig 1 b the total phosphorous tp is the sum of total particulate phosphorous tpp and total dissolved phosphorus tdp as po4 a major percentage 65 70 of phosphorus that gets accumulated in natural water bodies through effluent discharge and cause eutrophication is the tdp as po4 26 generally tpp is removed through sedimentation process primary and secondary as sludge while tdp as po4 removal requires either chemical or biological phosphorous removal methods hence for the present study the tdp as po4 removal efficiency of the 55 mld plant was considered and hence reported to perform sensitivity analysis several scenarios were simulated using the modified plant model as shown in table 2 the first scenario was to vary the do concentration in the aeration and re aeration zones the do concentrations were varied between 3 and 4 5 mg l insteps of 0 5 mg l the change in the wastewater characteristics as predicted by the model was studied the second scenario included varying the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration between 3000 and 4500 mg l in the aeration zone and the re aeration zone the third scenario was to optimize the hydraulic retention time hrt of wastewater in the three zones finally in the fourth scenario the return activated sludge r ratio defined as the ratio of activated sludge recycle flow rate to the flow rate of inlet sewage to the aerator was varied from 0 03 to 0 69 3 2 implementation of the model suggested modifications on the 55 mld stp the optimum process modifications as suggested by the validated biowin model were implemented on the 55 mld k c valley cas process the aeration tank operating conditions were modified to achieve aeration zone anoxic zone and re aeration zone by controlling the operation of surface aerators the central anoxic zone was created by switching off the surface aerators the do levels in the aeration and re aeration zone were controlled by controlling the speeds of the surface aerators the required hrt in each zone was achieved by properly selecting the surface aerator s locations and the mlss concentrations were controlled by adjusting the recycle flow rate post modifications the wastewater characteristics were monitored for a period of 6 months the flow diagram for the development validation and implementation of biowin model before and after the process modification is shown in fig s3 a paired t test was conducted to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the mean difference between pre and post modification values is significantly different from zero the details of the paired t test is given in supplementary section s4 3 3 wastewater characterization wastewater sample from different locations of the 55 mld k c valley stp were collected and analyzed the samples collected were s1 at the inlet of the plant raw sewage s2 at the primary clarifier outlet s3 at aeration tank outlet s4 at the final outlet treated water after secondary clarification as shown in figs 1 2 and s31 at the outlet of aeration zone s32 at the outlet of the anoxic zone s33 at the outlet of the re aeration zone in fig 1 all wastewater samples were collected between 9 am and 12 noon and samplings were carried out for one week both pre modification and post modification the weather was favourable during the sampling procedure and the plant operated at dry weather conditions at an average air temperature of 26 3 c the do concentrations at each point of treatment were measured on the field using an optical do probe lovibond 740800 luminophore covered membrane and a few samples were analyzed in the laboratory using the modified winkler do titration procedure 27 to cross check the probe readings the ph readings at each point of treatment were also determined using a probe hach 5475020 the bod of the samples was determined using the standard 5 day bod test 27 and the cod was determined using the closed reflux titrimetric method with 0 1 m ferrous ammonium sulphate fas as the titrant 27 for the nitrogen components the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn in the samples was determined in the lab using the macro kjeldahl method 27 which involves the digestion and distillation of samples to nh4 n the nh4 n in the samples were then pre distilled and determined using the standard sulfuric acid titration method 27 the no3 n in the samples were analyzed using uv spectroscopy as the difference in sample absorbances at 220 and 275 nm 27 the no2 n was also analyzed using uv spectroscopy at 543 nm absorbance the total phosphorous tp in the treated water was analyzed using the vanadomolybdo phosphoric acid method 27 the phosphorous in the treated water was first converted into orthophosphates using the sulfuric acid nitric acid digestion method then determined colorimetrically using a spectrophotometer at 880 nm absorbance 27 the ts tss tds and vss in the wastewater samples were determined using gravimetric analysis following oven drying 27 the detailed procedure for determining all these parameters is given in the apha manual of standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 27 3 4 microbiological analysis the type of microbial biomass is a crucial factor in sndn and ebpr efficiency in the treatment unit the bacterial community structure and diversity of the aeration and the anoxic zones were analyzed to achieve this the samples aerobic and anoxic for the microbiological analysis were collected from the plant and stored in a deep freezer at 40 c the samples were then sent to eurofins scientific co ltd bangalore india for dna extraction pcr amplification and cluster generation and sequencing the metagenomic dna was isolated from the samples using the nucelospin kit bioke netherlands and the quality of the isolated metagenomic dna samples was analyzed using nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa the amplicon libraries were prepared using the nextera xt index kit illumia inc as per the 16s metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol part 15044223 rev b the primers used in the study were synthesized at eurofins genomics 16s rrna f gcctacgggnggcwgcag and 16s rrna r actachvgggtatctaatcc the amplicon library was purified by ampure xp beads and quantified using a qubit fluorometer the data analysis was conducted using the qiime software platform provided by eurofins scientific co ltd bangalore india for understanding bacterial diversity the rarefaction curve was analyzed the rarefaction curves allow the calculation of species richness for a given number of samples the rarefaction curve for the present samples is shown in fig 2 as seen from fig 2 the steep slope in the beginning indicates the presence of large diversity in bacterial species in the given samples 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation for the baseline scenario to develop a validated model the as is existing operating conditions of the 55 mld stp as shown in table 1 was used for simulations fig 3 shows the comparison of experimental and biowin simulation values at different stages of treatment for this baseline scenario before modification the biowin model for this baseline scenario consists of a primary clarifier aeration zone and two secondary clarifiers as shown in fig s3 the inlet bod to the model is 193 mg l and after primary clarification the bod is reduced to 55 mg l the water after aeration zone passes through a secondary clarifier and the water quality at the outlet of the secondary clarifier is shown as treated water as can be seen from fig 3 the simulation values matched very closely with that of experimentally measured values for all the locations i e primary clarifier outlet aeration tank outlet and treated water in order to quantify the accuracy of the model the relative error between the simulation and experimental values were computed specifically for the treated water 30 the relative error between the simulation value and experimental value was 4 9 5 6 2 0 6 0 5 0 6 1 and 2 5 for cod bod do tn nh4 n no3 n and tdp as po4 respectively the maximum relative error observed was 6 1 for no3 n readings and was the acceptable deviation of 10 31 this was deemed acceptable considering the error in analytical measurements and the fluctuating operating conditions during sampling thus the developed biowin model was considered validated for the baseline scenario and this validated model was used for all other process simulations the bod and cod at the primary clarifier outlet aeration tank outlet and treated water were measured following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 27 the total bod is measured using 5 day bod test and the total cod is measured using the titrimetric method 27 the standard method used for determination of all the parameters is given in table s1 as shown in fig 3 though the cod and bod5 concentrations were within the treated water discharge limits shown in table 2 28 the tn and tdp as po4 concentration of treated water was 20 mg l and 3 6 mg l respectively both tn and tdp as po4 concentrations were above the discharge limit of 10 mg l and 2 mg l respectively 28 efforts were made to reduce the tn and tdp as po4 concentrations in the treated water which are discussed in the following sections 4 2 identification of process modifications through sensitivity analysis as seen from the experimental observations shown in table 4 the tn and tdp as po4 values were higher the permissible discharge limits to improve these parameters bnr was considered a variable process modification hence to achieve bnr via sndn and tdp as po4 removal by ebpr the biological reactor was divided virtually into aeration zone anoxic zone and re aeration zones and simulations were run by varying different parameters one at a time the model layout used is as shown in fig 1 b 4 2 1 scenario 1 effect of do concentration in aeration zones the do concentration in the aeration and re aeration zone was varied from the baseline value of 3 0 mg l up to 4 5 mg l in steps of 0 5 mg l for all these cases the mlss concentration was kept constant at 4000 mg l and the hrt was maintained as 2 5 h in aeration zone 1 5 h in anoxic zone followed by 2 h in re aeration zone the simulation values of tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and organic n concentrations after each treatment stage and at different do concentration is shown in fig 4 also shown in fig 4 are the stage wise percentage reduction pr calculated between each stage of treatment calculation given in section s3 of tn nh4 n and no3 n values as can be seen from fig 4 simulation results shows that when the operating do levels in the aeration and reaeration zone was increased from 3 0 mg l the tn and tdp as po4 of the treated water reduced this improvement was seen both at do levels of 3 5 and 4 0 mg l however operating at 4 5 mg l this benefit of higher do levels was not seen as shown in fig 4 when the do level was increased from 3 0 to 4 0 mg l the pr of tn in the first aeration zone increased from 52 at do of 3 0 mg l to 57 when do was at 4 0 mg l with an increase in do level from 3 0 to 4 0 mg l there was an improvement in the tn removal due to the improvement in nitrification reactions by autotrophs in the aeration zone which is indicated by the reduction in nh4 n concentration and increase in no3 n concentration at the outlet of the aeration zone a similar trend of drop in nh4 n concentration and increase in no3 n concentration was observed in the last re aeration zone when do was increased from 3 0 mg l to 4 0 mg l however when the do increased from 4 0 to 4 5 mg l the pr of tn instead of further increasing reversed its trend and reduced to 52 as shown in fig 4 this was attributed to inadequate hrt in the anoxic zone to denitrify the higher no3 n formed which would remain in the treated water fig 5a shows the overall percentage reduction pro from raw sewage to treated water calculation given in section s2 of tn and tdp as po4 with do as shown in figs 4 and 5a the pro in tn concentration increased until do of 4 mg l and this was attributed to the improved sndn by the autotrophs and the heterotrophs however as shown in figs 3 and 6a at higher do of 4 5 mg l the pr of tn decreased and this was attributed to inadequate hrt in the anoxic zone to denitrify the higher no3 n formed which remains in the treated water as shown in fig 5a the tdp as po4 also followed a similar trend as that of tn with do i e with an increase in do the pro of tdp as po4 increased until do of 4 mg l and operating at higher do levels 4 0 mg l the pro of tdp as po4 decreased 4 the synthesis of tdp as po4 by paos can occur under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the simulation results showed that the orthophosphate po4 p was consumed in the aerobic tank while po4 p was released in the anoxic anaerobic tank in the anoxic anaerobic zone the do should be maintained at a very low concentration almost zero for effective ebpr the biowin model was developed with a zero do concentration in the anoxic anaerobic zone the optimum do maintained in the aeration zone was 4 mg l the recirculating aeration sludge might have increased do levels however the hrt maintained in the aeration 2 5 h and anoxic anaerobic 1 5 h zone was observed to be sufficient enough so that the do of wastewater in the anoxic anaerobic zone was significantly less less than 0 5 mg l however at higher do levels aerobic conditions the efficiency of tdp as po4 synthesis by paos is lower since high do reduces the uptake of po4 p 4 this is also known to potentially leave lower bod for anaerobic processing this was considered as the reason for higher tdp as po4 retained at do of 4 5 mg l from all these observations the optimum do concentration in the aeration zone and re aeration zone was identified as 4 mg l this value was used for further simulation studies operating the plant at higher do levels means higher air flow rates the air demand increased from 10 051 m3 h for the baseline scenario with 2 5 mg l do to 13 500 m3 h for case 4 with 4 5 mg l this increase in the aeration demand increases the air blower operating cost by 15 from the baseline scenario for the optimum do concentration of 4 mg l the aeration demand was 13 050 m3 h and the increase in the air blower operating cost from the base line scenario was 8 the air demand was calculated using the aeration model in biowin 32 the simulation results of all other parameters at different do concentrations are shown in table s3 the model predicted improved water quality with increase in do levels as shown in table s3 the cod and bod concentration reduced from 43 to 35 mg l and 6 5 to 3 6 mg l as do increased from 3 to 4 5 mg l respectively this was attributed to the higher biological degradation of soluble substrate cod by the heterotrophs in aeration and reaeration zones at higher do levels 4 4 2 2 scenario 2 effect of mlss concentration in aeration zone in this scenario different mlss concentrations of 3000 mg l 3500 4000 and 4500 mg l were simulated in the aeration zone for these simulations the do concentrations in the aeration and re aeration zone were held constant at 4 0 mg l the hrt of 2 5 h in aeration zone 1 5 h in anoxic zone and 2 h in reaeration zone was simulated for all the cases for all the cases simulated the values of tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and organic n concentrations after each treatment stage and the stage wise pr of tn nh4 n and no3 n values are shown in fig 6 the total nitrogen concentration and its fractions are organic n nh4 n no3 n and no2 n are given in tables s4 s6 the nitrogen balance after process modification is given in supplementary section s5 and table s9 several factors affect sndn including ph temperature do concentration and type of biomass generally it is observed that the optimum ph for nitrification ranges between 8 0 and 9 0 42 and the nitrification activities by the ammonia oxidizing bacteria reduce after a ph of 9 6 42 while the denitrification rates are depressed at ph below 6 0 and above 8 0 and the highest rate of denitrification occurs at a range of 7 0 to 7 5 42 the optimum temperature for both nitrification and denitrification are observed between 5 and 35 c with a maximum nitrification rate observed at 30 c 42 the nitrification rates also increase with do concentration it has been reported that a do concentration above 4 0 mg l is required to achieve maximum nitrification rates while other investigators have found that only 0 5 to 3 0 mg l is required 43 another crucial factor is the type of biomass the presence of ammonia oxidizing bacteria improves nitrification and the presence of denitrifiers improves denitrification a detailed microbiological analysis of the aeration and anoxic samples is given in the supplementary section 4 3 as seen from fig 6 for all the cases there was an improvement in the tn concentration with each stage of treatment with an increase in the mlss concentration from 3000 mg l to 4000 mg l case 1 to case 3 the tn in the treated water reduced from 7 8 to 6 9 mg l the reduction in tn was due to the reduction in nh4 n concentration this result was attributed to optimum ph 8 0 to 9 0 temperature 26 3 c do concentration 4 mg l and higher microbial count nitrifiers available at higher mlss with do availability the higher mlss would result in an increased rate of microbial activity ammonia oxidizing bacteria leading to a higher rate of sndn 34 when mlss was increased from 3000 mg l to 4000 mg l case 1 vs case 2 and 3 in the aeration zone the observed reduction in tn was 57 however this effect was reduced slightly 2 reduction in tn conversion in aeration zone when mlss was further increased to 4500 mg l this small drop was attributed to increase in nh4 n and organic n from 0 35 to 0 45 mg l and 1 7 to 2 1 mg l respectively even though the particulate organic n gets assimilated and removed through sludge it is believed that the soluble organic n increases with mlss and remains in the treated water 33 34 which is justified by the higher organic n concentration at mlss of 4500 mg l also it is observed in several studies that around 15 85 of soluble organic n remains in treated water 44 the tdp as po4 concentration followed a similar pattern shown in table s4 between case 1 to case 3 the tdp as po4 concentration reduced in treated water however simulations under case 4 conditions with an mlss of 4500 mg l the tdp as po4 concentration for treated water was higher as compared to previous cases one of the requirements for paos for ebpr in anaerobic conditions is to have a minimum bod5 to tdp as po4 ratio of 20 1 35 the typical operating conditions affecting ebpr are given in detail in the supplementary section s3 however this ratio was 18 1 due to lower bod5 concentration in case 4 table s4 thereby reducing the efficiency of p removal this explained the higher tdp as po4 concentration observed for case 4 the pro of tn and tdp as po4 at different mlss concentrations is shown in fig 5b as seen from the fig 5b the maximum pro for tn and tdp as po4 was observed at mlss of 4000 mg l hence the optimum mlss concentration which resulted in minimum tn and tdp as po4 concentrations in treated water was identified as 4000 mg l and was used for further studies the simulation results of all other parameters are given in table s4 the model predicted improved water quality with increase in mlss concentrations as shown in table s4 the cod and bod concentration reduced from 43 to 35 mg l and 4 5 to 3 5 mg l as mlss increased from 3000 to 4500 mg l this improvement in water quality was attributed to increased microbial activity at higher mlss concentrations 4 2 3 scenario 3 effect of varying the hydraulic retention time hrt in the three zones with do and mlss fixed at 4 0 mg l optimum value and 4000 mg l optimum value respectively the hrt of wastewater in the aeration zone anoxic zone and reaeration zone were varied for all the cases simulated the values of tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and organic n concentrations after each treatment stage and the stage wise pr of tn nh4 n and no3 n values are shown in fig 7 the simulation results for all other parameters are given in table s5 as shown in fig 7 for case 1 the hrt was chosen so that the water would have equal hrt of 2 h in all three virtual zones i e 2 h each in aeration anoxic and re aeration zone the tn and nh4 n concentration in the treated water were 7 2 mg l and 1 2 mg l respectively fig 7 and table s5 and the no3 n concentration in the treated water was 4 mg l which accounted to be 55 of the tn indicating inadequate hrt for sndn specifically in the aeration zone to increase sndn in aeration zone higher hrt case i e case 2 was simulated for case 2 the hrt was 2 5 in the aeration zone 1 h in the anoxic zone and hrt in re aeration zone was kept same as that of case 1 i e 2 h as can be seen from fig 7 when hrt in aeration zone was increased from 2 0 to 2 5 h case 1 vs case 2 the pr in tn increased from 55 to 57 primarily due to increased sndn in aeration zone which is evident from higher nh4 n reduction from 80 to 83 however the reduction in the hrt of 0 5 h in the anoxic zone only showed a marginal drop of 1 in pr of tn between case 1 and case 2 this result showed that even 1 5 hrt in anoxic zone was still adequate to achieve denitrification in anoxic zone however the nh4 n at the anoxic zone outlet was still high and to address this the case 3 which had higher hrt in the re aeration zone was simulated case 3 with hrt of 2 h of aeration in followed by 1 h of anoxic conditions and 3 h of reaeration was simulated as seen from fig 7 when the hrt in the reaeration zone was increased from 2 0 h to 3 h case 2 vs case 3 the pr of tn and nh4 n in the re aeration zone increased from 23 to 32 and from 90 to 92 showing increased sndn in re aeration zone also case 3 showed lowest tn value of 6 7 mg l in treated water relative to all other cases as shown in table s5 and this was attributed to the adequate reaction times for both nitrification and denitrification in the three zones the intermittent anaerobic and aerobic condition with optimum hrt is known to improve the nitrification denitrification efficiency 23 the tdp as po4 was minimum in case 3 table s5 it is well understood that treating wastewater under anaerobic conditions followed by prolonged aerobic conditions acts a selector and favours the growth of paos a selector is a zone in a biological treatment process with specific environmental conditions that promote the growth of a specific group of microorganisms 35 37 it is hypothesized that the virtual anoxic zone acted as a selector for the paos and gave them a selective advantage over other microorganisms in the system 35 37 this explained the minimum tdp as po4 in case 3 also the cod and bod concentrations reduced from 42 to 34 mg l and 5 to 2 9 mg l respectively from case 1 to case 3 hence from all these observations case 3 was identified as the optimum case in scenario 3 4 2 4 scenario 4 effect of return activated sludge r ratio to further optimize the process the r ratio was varied between 0 03 and 0 69 the optimum do concentration of 4 mg l was considered for simulation in the aeration and re aeration zones the optimum hrt of 2 h in aeration zone 1 h in anoxic zone and 3 h in re aeration zone was simulated the variation of mlss in the aeration and re aeration zone the aeration requirement and the treated water cod with r ratio is shown in fig 8 as seen from fig 8 with increase in r ratio from 0 03 to 0 69 the mlss in the aeration and re aeration zone increased from 1052 to 6451 mg l respectively similarly as shown in fig 8 the air requirement to maintain a fixed do concentration of 4 mg l in aeration and re aeration zones also increased with r ratio this increase in air requirement was attributed to higher microbial count at higher r ratio since at higher r ratio the microorganism count will be higher the amount of air to be provided to maintain a fixed do concentration will also be higher analysing the treated water cod variation with r ratio as shown in fig 8 and table s6 case 1 to case 5 it was observed that cod levels decreased until r ratio of 0 21 and then it increased with r ratio this increase was attributed to the decrease in food to microorganism ratio f m with increasing r which leads to starvation and decay of the microorganisms increasing the dissolved organic matter and thereby the total cod this result was in agreement with the observations reported by 38 the increase in the energy cost with increase in air requirement and r ratio is shown in fig s4 the variation of tn with r ratio for treated water is shown in fig 9 the tn concentration reduced until r ratio of 0 21 and then increased steadily with r the nh4 n also showed a similar trend this showed that at r ratios above 0 21 the hrt provided was inadequate to drive the nitrification reaction leading to increased nh4 n in the system the no3 n and no2 n concentration in the treated water reduced rapidly with increase in the r ratio till 0 21 indicating a higher denitrification process however above 0 21 this reduction tends to saturate several researchers have observed similar results indicating an increase in denitrification with increase in r ratio for fixed do concentration provided that the availability of organic matter cod is not limited 38 39 with an increase in the r ratio the concentration of microbial mass recycled into the process increases to identify the specific type of microbial mass molecular biological techniques are necessary johnston et al 40 has monitored microbial community in three full scale stps and observed the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria without any seasonal fluctuations wiginton et al 41 have also identified the abundance of amoa ammonia oxidizing 45 and nosz denitrifiers 25 in an activated sludge system using 16srna sequencing some potential abundant denitrifiers have also been identified by using culture independent methods in wastewater by thomson et al 42 they observed that denitrifiers constitute 20 30 of the total bacterial composition in an activated sludge system but irrespective of the type of microbial mass the organic n composed of protein urea amino acids and humic substances increases with biomass concentration this explained the higher organic n concentration in the treated water with increasing r ratio organic carbon content is also an essential factor in accomplishing effective denitrification since it is an energy source for bacteria 43 a c n ratio of 3 5 4 5 g cod g n is considered as optimum for effective sndn 44 the c n ratio of each zone for all the scenarios is given in the modified supplementary material table s7 as seen from table s7 the c n ratio for all the cases in the scenario was observed to be within the acceptable range indicating effective denitrification efficiency the tdp as po4 concentration decreased with r ratio until 0 21 and then increased table s6 it is observed in several studies that p removal efficiency in the anoxic zones increased with r ratio specifically due to nitrate recycling 45 46 s but one of the limiting factors for ebpr is the availability of organic content or the bod p ratio cod p ratio of minimum 20 1 but for r ratio beyond 0 21 for cases 4 and 5 the bod p ratio was less than 20 1 thereby reducing the efficiency of p removal hence it was inferred that the optimum r ratio of 0 21 produces minimum tn and tdp as po4 concentrations for the fixed do of 4 mg l 4 3 microbiological analysis results the wastewater samples from the aeration and anoxic zones were analyzed to identify the microbial community the composition of the bacterial community and the similarity and differences between the two samples were investigated a total of 12 phyla were observed in the two samples proteobacteria was the most abundant community 30 40 which is consistent with the samples from activated sludge systems 47 48 bacteroidetes 12 15 planctomycetes 10 12 chlorofexi 9 12 actinobacteria 7 8 2 and nitrospirae 4 5 were the other important groups the dominant class of bacteria and its percentage composition in the aeration and anoxic tanks are given in fig 10 as seen from fig 10 in the aeration tank samples the ammonia oxidizing bacterial classes observed were nitrosovibrio 6 99 nitrosomonas 5 52 nitrosolobus 5 03 and nitrosospira 4 87 these ammonium oxidizing bacteria belong to the beta subdivision of the proteobacteria 49 nitrobacter 9 19 nitrospira 4 87 and pseudomonas 3 5 were the nitrite oxidizing bacterial classes found abundant in the aeration samples the nitrite oxidizing bacteria usually belong to the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the proteobacteria 50 the denitrifying bacteria shown in fig s6 observed in the anoxic samples were achromobacter 6 07 proteus 5 5 alcaligenes 5 25 pseudomonas 4 32 and spirillum 3 91 all belonging to the beta and gamma subdivisions of proteobacteria other denitrifying bacterial species were micrococcus 3 5 belonging to the actinobacteria phylum and bacillus 3 27 belonging to the firmicutes phylum 22 as seen from the microbiological analysis results there was a clear difference in the bacterial community in the aeration and anoxic samples the aeration samples were abundant in ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria whereas the anoxic samples were rich in denitrifying bacterial classes the classes observed in both the samples were pseudomonas proteobacteria and nitrospira nitrospirae these are the bacterial classes that survive in both aerobic and anoxic conditions 48 also as seen from fig 10 paos including pseudomonas 4 32 and amaricoccus 4 1 belonging to the proteobacteria phylum brevibacterium 3 91 and tetrasphaera 3 5 belonging to the actinobacteria phylum and anaerolineae 2 51 belonging to the chloroflexi phylum were identified in the anoxic samples the presence of these anaerobic paos confirms the hypothesis that the proposed modification has been successful in ebpr 4 4 plant performance after process modifications based on the sensitivity analysis results only the optimized process modifications were implemented in the 55 mld stp at the k c valley stp and compared with the experimental results to implement the process modification of converting the existing aeration tank into three virtual zones namely aeration anoxic and reaeration changes in the plant s operating conditions were necessary some selective surface aerators were operated in a switch on switch off mode to create a virtual anoxic zone such that anoxic conditions and do levels less than 0 5 mg l was achieved in these sections of the bioreactor the return activated sludge saturated with do could negatively affect the denitrification process in the virtual anoxic zone 1 to prevent this the do levels in the anoxic zone were frequently monitored using do sensors and it was observed that the do concentration was less than 0 5 mg l at all times while to implement do of 4 mg l in the aeration and reaeration zones the air flow rate was maintained at 13 050 m3 h diffuse air blowers were repositioned into these zones to maintain this airflow rate the optimized hrt of 2 h of aeration followed by 1 h of anoxic condition and 3 h of reaeration was also implemented the optimum r ratio was identified as 0 21 with an mlss of 5000 mg l from the simulation results however the original plant r ratio of 0 69 and the corresponding mlss of 6451 mg l were not modified due to site conditions this optimum r ratio is planned to be implemented in the second phase of process modification in the 55 mld unit it is assumed that implementing the optimum r ratio will bring down the recycling pump cost by 15 the plant was run for 6 months continuously based on the optimized parameters and the process conditions were stabilized over this period the sludge based parameters including mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss the tp concentration of sludge and the sludge volume index svi after the process modification is given in table s9 fig 11 shows the comparison of biowin simulation and experimental values at different stages of treatment after the process modification by implementing the optimized operating conditions case 5 scenario 4 as can be seen from fig 11 the simulation results matched very closely with that of the experimental values for all the water sample locations i e aeration zone outlet anoxic zone outlet re aeration zone outlet and treated water the higher bod at the aeration zone outlet is due to the high return activated sludge flow of 38 mld r ratio 0 69 back into the aeration zone the relative error between the simulation and experimental values were computed for the treated water values to quantify the accuracy of the model 31 the relative error for treated water values was 6 1 4 9 4 1 2 5 3 2 6 7 and 5 5 for cod bod do tn nh4 n no3 n and tdp as po4 respectively and was lower than the acceptable upper limit of 10 31 the treated water cod concentration was 29 mg l which was within the treated water discharge limit of 50 mg l similarly bod5 of the treated water was 5 5 mg l which was also within the upper limit of 10 mg l for the treated water the tn value of treated water was 8 8 mg l which was within the upper limit of 10 mg l this validated that the introduction of nitrification denitrification zones aeration anoxic reaeration with optimized operating conditions was successful to meet the recently revised discharge standards the tp concentration in the treated water after the modification was observed to be 4 25 0 5 mg p l which was within the effluent discharge limit of 4 5 mg p l as laid down by the cpheoo 51 the tdp as po4 value of the treated water as per simulation was 2 9 mg l however tdp as po4 of the treated water measured in the stp was 1 mg l this reduction in the tdp as po4 may be because of several reasons the modestly improved phosphorus reduction observed in stp was a result of improvement in the bnr specifically due to the presence of low nitrate concentrations in anaerobic zones 1 and can be the first cause secondly the anaerobic mass fraction of luxury paos was high 18 as given in section 4 3 which is justifiable for the hrt in anoxic zone and r ratio 52 of 0 69 the third reason for reduction in tdp as po4 could be the creation of deep anaerobic conditions achieved by switching off the surface aerators this is known to reduce the entry of oxygen through the liquid surface thereby creating a pseudo fermentation zone that assists the growth of the paos another major contributing factor for the tdp as po4 reduction can be the accumulation of phosphorous in the biomass by luxury paos in the form of polyphosphates under endogenous conditions which is the final phase of growth of activated sludge culture under starvation f m ratio 1 mulbarger mc et al 1971 and needs to be experimentally confirmed 4 5 economic comparison the process modifications in the 55 mld unit stp was shown to be successful in improving the bnr removal and treated water quality to meet emerging standards the modifications were implemented in the plant with a minimum process intervention resource investment and without shutting down the plant the time for the implementation and the stabilization of the proposed modification was 8 months with the optimization of process modification using the biowin asdm model the cost for implementation of the modification was only us 0 4 million as against an initial estimate of us 6 million which also involved shutting down of the plant operation constructing new reactors and making significant changes to plant operating conditions a significant improvement in the treated water quality was achieved in a short period of time with minimum capital costs the treated water quality can be further improved by implementing the optimized r ratio of 0 21 as observed in the simulation results a lower r ratio of 0 21 can also reduce the recycle pump operating cost by 40 and the air pump cost to maintain do of 4 mg l by 29 which leads to a reduction in the total energy cost of the treatment plant by 35 hence this modification of r ratio is proposed to be implemented to further improve the efficiency of the plant the details of estimated cost actual cost and savings for the implementation of the proposed modification is given in table 5 for developing countries it is important to modify existing sewage treatment plants without major interventions to improve the quality of treated water using mathematical models and simulating several scenarios adaptable onsite modifications with minimal capital cost as proposed modeled and validated in this work can serve as a solution for improving the treatment efficiency of several stps in india and in other developing countries 5 conclusions in this work a plant wide biowin asm model was developed for the 55 mld treatment unit in the k c valley sewage treatment plant to make the plant compliant with the revised discharge standards the as is conditions of the stp were simulated and the model kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were calibrated the existing bioreactor was divided virtually into aeration anoxic and re aeration zones modeling efforts identified the optimum do level to be 4 mg l and mlss concentration to be 4000 mg l modeling also suggested maintaining a hydraulic residence time in the virtually created aeration anoxic and re aeration zones as 2 h 1 h and 3 h respectively the water quality results after process modification showed drastic improvements the total nitrogen and total dissolved phosphorous concentrations were reduced from 20 mg l to 8 mg l and 3 5 mg l to 0 9 mg l before and after the process modification the cod and bod5 concentrations were also reduced to 33 and 5 5 mg l respectively the treated water from stp thus met the revised standards these efforts resulted in a capital cost saving of us 5 6 million and avoided other operational disturbances of plant shutdown this study shows that using mathematical modeling tools such as biowin is highly beneficial to achieve process modifications in old operating stps process modifications using biowin and its implementation on existing operational stps to meet the new discharge standard is an economical alternative for improving the treatment efficiency of stps in india and other developing countries declaration of competing interest the

treatment plant biological nutrient removal biowin process modification sensitivity analysis 1 introduction the treated water from a sewage treatment plant stp is generally discharged into a nearby flowing surface water body wherein the water improves its quality through natural processes before it is picked up by another city downstream for its usage 1 3 urbanization has led to the growth of cities thereby reducing the distance the treated water travels between adjacent cities this in turn demands that the stps treat the water to higher standards authorities have continuously revised water discharge standards of stps making it more stringent every decade requiring the stps to be constantly upgraded during their typical life of about 25 30 years to meet the new standards table s1 of supplementary material tabulates how the treated water quality standards have been made more stringent over the years in india the up gradation can be achieved either by process modifications or retrofitting with modern machinery however retrofitting an existing stp can be an expensive proposition both in terms of time and resources thus it is usually preferred to modify the treatment process to meet the new standards without compromising the stp capacity mathematical models are useful tools for process modifications and optimization of stps among the various mathematical models activated sludge models asm are widely used for plant process optimization 4 6 biowin software 7 with built in asms such as asm1 asm2d and asm3 is used for such process modeling this study discusses process modifications using biowin and its implementation on an existing operational stp to meet the new discharge standard as revised standards demanded stringent biological nutrient removal bnr this study has focused on the same the use of biowin asm models for biological nutrient removal bnr in wastewater treatment has been studied by several researchers 8 13 dynamic biowin asm models have been used in literature to optimize conventional activated sludge cas processes wherein they have recommended either increasing the mean cell residence time mcrt to 40 50 days or including ammonia stripping 14 bizukojc et al have identified kinetic and stoichiometric parameters required for modeling 15 16 and have validated their models with literature data even though several studies have focused on developing biowin based models for process optimization few studies have implemented the model recommendations and observed real time bnr removal in full scale stps also these studies focus only on a specific type of process modifications e g introducing anoxic zones improving the aeration capacity of blowers in activated sludge tanks and varying the return activated sludge ratio r however a comprehensive study investigating the combined effect of several process modifications on improving the treatment and economic efficiency with minimal interventions is lacking in the literature in this work it is hypothesized that creation of virtual anoxic zones in the bioreactor coupled with appropriate modifications of the operating parameters such as hydraulic retention time hrt dissolved oxygen do levels and r ratio in the bioreactor would result in sndn and ebpr a biowin asm model was developed for the 55 million litres per day mld stp and was validated this validated model was used to identify the optimum conditions for process modifications to achieve bnr several sensitivity studies were also conducted to assess the combined effect of various operating conditions including do concentrations mixed liquor suspended solid mlss concentrations hrt and r ratio on the bnr process process economics and the potential advantages of following a similar approach on many existing old stps are briefly discussed 1 1 biological nutrient removal bnr theory and mechanism biological nitrogen removal is a two step simultaneous nitrification denitrification sndn process 17 during nitrification the influent ammonia nh3 is oxidized into nitrite no2 by the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the main reactions describing this conversion of nh3 to no2 are given in eqs 1 and 2 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 nh3 is converted into intermediate hydroxylamine nh 2 oh and is further converted to no2 1 n h 3 o 2 2 e n h 2 oh h 2 o 2 n h 2 oh h 2 o n o 2 4 h 4 e the no2 thus formed is further oxidized into nitrate no3 by the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob the reaction describing the conversion of no2 to no3 is given in eq 3 3 n o 2 0 5 o 2 n o 3 denitrification includes the biochemical reduction of nitrate nitrogen no3 n into dinitrogen gas under anoxic conditions by the heterotrophic bacteria in the presence of an organic carbon source cod eq 4 shows the complete redox reaction of denitrification 4 2 n o 3 10 e 12 h n 2 6 h 2 o thus one can achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification sndn in a bioreactor under appropriate process conditions removal of total phosphorous tp in stps is achieved either by the addition of phosphorus reacting chemicals or by enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr process 19 in the ebpr process a group of specialized bacteria known as the luxury phosphorous accumulating organisms pao removes phosphorous in two stages 20 in the first stage paos uptake volatile fatty acids vfa in the wastewater under anaerobic conditions and store them as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha they also release phosphorus orthophosphate in this stage to provide the energy for the uptake of the vfas under aerobic conditions the stored pha is metabolized to provide energy for cell growth in the second stage simultaneously the soluble orthophosphates are consumed and stored resulting in a net phosphorous removal from the wastewater 20 the nmr spectroscopy method is the most commonly used method to quantify these polyphosphates released and consumed in ebpr process the quantification using spectroscopy involves six steps pre centrifugation of sludge pre extraction using edta naoh solution centrifugation and separation of sludge pellet primary extraction concentration by rotary evaporation and measurement using nmr spectroscopy 22 a dominant factor in the ebpr by the paos is the amount of readily biodegradable cod and the vfas present in the influent 20 some typical operating conditions affecting ebpr are given in detail in the supplementary section s3 several studies have examined the possibilities of modifying the conventional activated sludge cas process to improve bnr i e removal of nitrogen and phosphorus n and p biologically 1 19 20 24 25 the approach of retrofitting existing stps to reduce n and p by controlling the aeration and non aeration periods was investigated by hanhan et al and habermeyer et al 26 27 they identified that operating stps with optimum dissolved oxygen do levels between 1 5 and 1 7 mg l coupled with intermittent aeration i e 180 min of aeration followed by 160 min of no aeration resulted in maximum n and cod reduction there have been only a few studies that focus solely on ebpr since it requires strict anaerobic conditions bernard et al 2017 has observed that it was possible to achieve ebpr by creating deep anaerobic zones using slow speed top entry mixers of 2 w m3 capacities in aeration tanks they have maintained do 0 5 mg l and have achieved ebpr 19 khiewwijit et al 2015 have inferred from their numerical studies that 80 of p recovery and 35 reduction in co2 emission in cas was possible by including bio flocculation and partial nitrification conditions 29 in the present study a biowin asm based model is used to optimize bnr in the 55 mld plant 2 model development and theory 2 1 biowin model theory the biowin uses a general activated sludge anaerobic digestion asdm model for all the process simulations the general asdm model has fifty state variables and eighty process expressions for the growth and decay of microorganisms the basic expression in the asdm model for the time rate of change of microbial biomass x is based on monod kinetic equation and mass balance is given as 17 5 dx dt microbial growth microbial decay 6 dx dt μ max x 0 s s k s η μ max x 0 s s k s b x 0 where x 0 is the microbial biomass concentration at time t 0 μ max is the maximum growth rate of this microorganism s is the concentration of the limiting substrate for growth ks is the half saturation coefficient η is the correction factor for anoxic growth and b is the decay coefficient for the biomass the first term in the r h s of eq 6 represents the microbial growth under aerobic condition the second term represents the microbial growth under anoxic condition and the third term represents the microbial decay eq 6 can be modified depending on the type of microbial mass the substrate that is being utilized and the environmental conditions ph do etc that limits its growth the substrate s utilization rate by the microbes is given as 17 7 ds dt μ max x 0 y s s k s where y is the yield coefficient the substrate concentration with time also varies with hydrolysis ammonification and denitrification processes to include these additional terms are added to eq 7 the processes that are included in the asdm model for the growth decay of microorganisms and the substrate synthesis in an activated sludge as system are given in table s2 there are several more processes that are incorporated in biowin but for the present study for the proposed modification with aeration and anoxic zones the processes listed in table s2 were employed more detailed explanation of the process theory is available in the biowin help manual 18 the mass transfer of air and gases to the liquid phase is modeled in biowin using the fundamental theory of surface renewal a few assumptions are made in the biowin mass transfer model including the assumption of completely mixed gas and liquid phases with uniform concentration and a constant gas holdup throughout the control volume being modeled the mass balance for the liquid and gas phase using the mass transfer theory is given respectively as 18 8 d m jt dt q in c jt in q c jt αf k l a l j c j c un j v l r x j 9 d m j dt q in c jt in q c jt αf k l a l j c j c un j v l where m j t is the mass of component j in the liquid phase q in and q is the liquid flow into and out of the control volume respectively c jt in and c jt is the influent and effluent concentration of component j respectively k l a l j is the overall liqid mass transfer coefficient for component j α is the ratio of diffuser for process water to clean water f is the ratio of diffuser for process water to given time of diffuser to process water c j is the saturated concentration of component j at the gas liquid interface c un j is the bulk liquid concentration of unionized component j v l is the volume of the liquid phase and rx j is the net production of component j by reaction for eq 9 m j is the mass of component j in the gas phase q in and q is the gas flow into and out of the control volume respectively c jt in and c jt is the influent and effluent concentration of gas component j respectively eqs 8 and 9 are simultaneously solved to include the mass balance and mass transfer of liquid and gas phases the biowin simulator has two numerical modules for solving namely the steady state and dynamic interactive modules steady state module is applied for analysing systems based on constant influent loading and operating parameters the steady state solver uses a combination of newton raphson nr second order method and decoupled linear search dls method for the solution 18 the second module is the dynamic interactive module which is specifically suitable for time varying inputs and time varying operating conditions the convergence of dynamic simulations is determined by the allowable minimum relative error biowin also has an option for providing concentration limits for parameters default value 0 001 mg l the lower the set concentration limits the higher is accuracy of simulation 18 for the present study all simulations were carried out using the dynamic interactive module since all the influent and operating conditions were varying with time fifty nine differential process equations were solved to find the time rate change of substrate and biomass using the biowin model the flow balance in the biowin model is based on the fundamental principles of continuity momentum and energy conservation the hrt of each unit aeration anoxic tanks is calculated by dividing the volume v of the tank m3 by the amount of discharge q m3 h coming to the unit the initial conditions that are to be provided for the model includes the quantity of water treated per day mld the volume of each unit of the stp m3 the inlet raw sewage quality cod bod tn nh4 n no3 n tdp as po4 and ph do and mlss concentration in aeration zones return activated r sludge ratio calibrated kinetic and stoichiometric parameters and wastage ratio w the assumptions while using the biowin asdm model and the differences from the field condition were 18 the bioreactor was well mixed and the concentration of all components including do in aeration and reaeration zone was uniform throughout the reactor in actual field conditions the bioreactor was well mixed in aeration and reaeration zones due to the aeration mixing provided by the surface blowers all scenarios in the study were modeled at a constant temperature of 26 c while the average field temperature during sampling pre and post modification was 26 3 c the model was simulated for the maximum flow of 55 mld however in the field conditions due to variation in the quantity of the incoming sewage the actual flow was 53 2 mld for modeling purposes the microbial growth and decay were assumed to follow a first order kinetics for modeling purposes the microbial growth and substrate utilization were assumed to follow monod kinetics the oxygen transfer from air to liquid wastewater was modeled using simple surface renewal theory 2 2 wastewater treatment plant process description the koramangala and challaghatta k c valley wastewater treatment plant which was commissioned in 1979 and located in the bangalore urban district in karnataka india was chosen as the study stp this k c valley plant has three cas stps 30 mld 60 mld and 218 mld with a total design capacity of 318 mld the secondary treated water from the k c valley plant is pumped into a network of run off channels which eventually fill up 134 tanks rejuvenating by indirectly recharging the depleted groundwater aquifers in the parched districts of kolar and chikkaballapur districts in karnataka in the 218 mld stp of the k c valley unit after the primary treatment coarse screens fine screens and grit chambers the incoming wastewater is divided into 5 streams three 36 mld streams and two 55 mld streams the present study focuses on one of the 55 mld wastewater stream the 55 mld treatment unit consists of a primary clarifier an aeration tank equipped with equally spaced surface aerators and two secondary clarifiers as shown in fig 1 a the details of the individual treatment processes of the 55 mld unit the dimensions and the operating conditions are given in table 1 the raw sewage primary settled sewage and treated water parameter values for the 55 mld unit is given in table 3 2 3 description of biowin model and model calibration biowin 5 3 7 was used to create a plant wide asm model for the 55 mld unit the existing conditions before process modifications were modeled as the baseline scenario for the baseline scenario the model included the primary clarifier the aeration tank and the two secondary clarifiers of the 55 mld unit as shown in fig 1 the stoichiometric and kinetic parameters were calibrated against the baseline scenario according to stowa protocol 19 as shown in table 4 the total cod in wastewater was divided into biodegradable bcod and non biodegradable nbcod cod the biodegradable fraction was further divided into readily biodegradable rbcod and slowly biodegradable sbcod cod the non biodegradable fraction consisted of non biodegradable soluble cod nbscod and non biodegradable particulate cod nbpcod using respirometric tests of the endogenous activated sludge and influent sample the bcod mg l and rbcod mg l was determined as 20 10 bcod co 1 y h 11 rbcod c o s 1 y h where co and cos were the consumed oxygen of sample and consumed oxygen in soluble filtered sample sample mg l respectively and yh was the heterotrophic yield coefficient g cell cod formed g cod oxidized 1 the value of heterotrophic yield coefficient yh was assumed as 0 72 g cell cod formed g cod oxidized 1 at 26o c as specified in the asm 1 model theory 21 12 nbscod co d s rbcod 13 nbpcod cod bcod nbscod where cod and cod s were total and soluble filtered sample cod mg l respectively the non biodegradable soluble tkn nbstkn typically passes through the treatment system untouched assuming that the soluble biodegradable organic nitrogen gets degraded completely within the treatment process nbstkn mg n l was calculated as 22 14 nbstkn ftkn n h 4 where ftkn was the effluent filtered tkn mg n l and nh 4 was the effluent ammonia mg n l the pcod vss ratio was calculated by dividing particulate cod pcod mg l which was the residual cod after filtration through a 0 45 μm filter by the volatile suspended solids vss mg l fraction 22 for the present study the biowin model was first run with default kinetic and stoichiometric values then the most sensitive wastewater characteristic fractions in the model were identified 19 and were adjusted to match the measured treated water values specifically for tkn nh4 n no3 n and tn values the final adjusted values and their references are shown in table 4 the sludge retention time value was calculated based on the biowin model prediction values the calibrated model was validated for the baseline scenario and the results of the model validation are discussed in section 3 1 the do concentration mlss concentrations and the r ratio in the aeration tank were maintained at 2 5 mg l 2800 mg l and 0 69 1600 m3 h of ras respectively the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters as shown in table 4 were used for simulation the stowa protocol recommends using data that is clearly different from the one used in calibration and the same was followed in the present study 3 methods 3 1 process modification and sensitivity studies using validated biowin model to achieve bnr removal a few modifications in the treatment process were conceived and simulated first on the validated biowin model the modification was to provide a virtual anoxic zone between two aerobic zones to improve the sndn and bpr process by selectively switching off the surface aerators present in this section of the bioreactor the presence of aeration zones followed by anoxic zones is known to assist the nitrification denitrification process for nitrogen removal 23 also it is hypothesized that due to the width of the tank 47 2 m inside the anoxic zone there are pockets of anaerobic regions which act as the anaerobic selector for paos a few literatures have explored the growth of paos under anaerobic conditions inside anoxic tanks 24 25 the aim was to achieve the modifications without taking up any civil works in the stp this was implemented in the validated biowin model by dividing the aeration tank into three compartments aeration zone anoxic zone and re aeration zone as shown in fig 1 b the total phosphorous tp is the sum of total particulate phosphorous tpp and total dissolved phosphorus tdp as po4 a major percentage 65 70 of phosphorus that gets accumulated in natural water bodies through effluent discharge and cause eutrophication is the tdp as po4 26 generally tpp is removed through sedimentation process primary and secondary as sludge while tdp as po4 removal requires either chemical or biological phosphorous removal methods hence for the present study the tdp as po4 removal efficiency of the 55 mld plant was considered and hence reported to perform sensitivity analysis several scenarios were simulated using the modified plant model as shown in table 2 the first scenario was to vary the do concentration in the aeration and re aeration zones the do concentrations were varied between 3 and 4 5 mg l insteps of 0 5 mg l the change in the wastewater characteristics as predicted by the model was studied the second scenario included varying the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration between 3000 and 4500 mg l in the aeration zone and the re aeration zone the third scenario was to optimize the hydraulic retention time hrt of wastewater in the three zones finally in the fourth scenario the return activated sludge r ratio defined as the ratio of activated sludge recycle flow rate to the flow rate of inlet sewage to the aerator was varied from 0 03 to 0 69 3 2 implementation of the model suggested modifications on the 55 mld stp the optimum process modifications as suggested by the validated biowin model were implemented on the 55 mld k c valley cas process the aeration tank operating conditions were modified to achieve aeration zone anoxic zone and re aeration zone by controlling the operation of surface aerators the central anoxic zone was created by switching off the surface aerators the do levels in the aeration and re aeration zone were controlled by controlling the speeds of the surface aerators the required hrt in each zone was achieved by properly selecting the surface aerator s locations and the mlss concentrations were controlled by adjusting the recycle flow rate post modifications the wastewater characteristics were monitored for a period of 6 months the flow diagram for the development validation and implementation of biowin model before and after the process modification is shown in fig s3 a paired t test was conducted to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the mean difference between pre and post modification values is significantly different from zero the details of the paired t test is given in supplementary section s4 3 3 wastewater characterization wastewater sample from different locations of the 55 mld k c valley stp were collected and analyzed the samples collected were s1 at the inlet of the plant raw sewage s2 at the primary clarifier outlet s3 at aeration tank outlet s4 at the final outlet treated water after secondary clarification as shown in figs 1 2 and s31 at the outlet of aeration zone s32 at the outlet of the anoxic zone s33 at the outlet of the re aeration zone in fig 1 all wastewater samples were collected between 9 am and 12 noon and samplings were carried out for one week both pre modification and post modification the weather was favourable during the sampling procedure and the plant operated at dry weather conditions at an average air temperature of 26 3 c the do concentrations at each point of treatment were measured on the field using an optical do probe lovibond 740800 luminophore covered membrane and a few samples were analyzed in the laboratory using the modified winkler do titration procedure 27 to cross check the probe readings the ph readings at each point of treatment were also determined using a probe hach 5475020 the bod of the samples was determined using the standard 5 day bod test 27 and the cod was determined using the closed reflux titrimetric method with 0 1 m ferrous ammonium sulphate fas as the titrant 27 for the nitrogen components the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn in the samples was determined in the lab using the macro kjeldahl method 27 which involves the digestion and distillation of samples to nh4 n the nh4 n in the samples were then pre distilled and determined using the standard sulfuric acid titration method 27 the no3 n in the samples were analyzed using uv spectroscopy as the difference in sample absorbances at 220 and 275 nm 27 the no2 n was also analyzed using uv spectroscopy at 543 nm absorbance the total phosphorous tp in the treated water was analyzed using the vanadomolybdo phosphoric acid method 27 the phosphorous in the treated water was first converted into orthophosphates using the sulfuric acid nitric acid digestion method then determined colorimetrically using a spectrophotometer at 880 nm absorbance 27 the ts tss tds and vss in the wastewater samples were determined using gravimetric analysis following oven drying 27 the detailed procedure for determining all these parameters is given in the apha manual of standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 27 3 4 microbiological analysis the type of microbial biomass is a crucial factor in sndn and ebpr efficiency in the treatment unit the bacterial community structure and diversity of the aeration and the anoxic zones were analyzed to achieve this the samples aerobic and anoxic for the microbiological analysis were collected from the plant and stored in a deep freezer at 40 c the samples were then sent to eurofins scientific co ltd bangalore india for dna extraction pcr amplification and cluster generation and sequencing the metagenomic dna was isolated from the samples using the nucelospin kit bioke netherlands and the quality of the isolated metagenomic dna samples was analyzed using nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa the amplicon libraries were prepared using the nextera xt index kit illumia inc as per the 16s metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol part 15044223 rev b the primers used in the study were synthesized at eurofins genomics 16s rrna f gcctacgggnggcwgcag and 16s rrna r actachvgggtatctaatcc the amplicon library was purified by ampure xp beads and quantified using a qubit fluorometer the data analysis was conducted using the qiime software platform provided by eurofins scientific co ltd bangalore india for understanding bacterial diversity the rarefaction curve was analyzed the rarefaction curves allow the calculation of species richness for a given number of samples the rarefaction curve for the present samples is shown in fig 2 as seen from fig 2 the steep slope in the beginning indicates the presence of large diversity in bacterial species in the given samples 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation for the baseline scenario to develop a validated model the as is existing operating conditions of the 55 mld stp as shown in table 1 was used for simulations fig 3 shows the comparison of experimental and biowin simulation values at different stages of treatment for this baseline scenario before modification the biowin model for this baseline scenario consists of a primary clarifier aeration zone and two secondary clarifiers as shown in fig s3 the inlet bod to the model is 193 mg l and after primary clarification the bod is reduced to 55 mg l the water after aeration zone passes through a secondary clarifier and the water quality at the outlet of the secondary clarifier is shown as treated water as can be seen from fig 3 the simulation values matched very closely with that of experimentally measured values for all the locations i e primary clarifier outlet aeration tank outlet and treated water in order to quantify the accuracy of the model the relative error between the simulation and experimental values were computed specifically for the treated water 30 the relative error between the simulation value and experimental value was 4 9 5 6 2 0 6 0 5 0 6 1 and 2 5 for cod bod do tn nh4 n no3 n and tdp as po4 respectively the maximum relative error observed was 6 1 for no3 n readings and was the acceptable deviation of 10 31 this was deemed acceptable considering the error in analytical measurements and the fluctuating operating conditions during sampling thus the developed biowin model was considered validated for the baseline scenario and this validated model was used for all other process simulations the bod and cod at the primary clarifier outlet aeration tank outlet and treated water were measured following the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 27 the total bod is measured using 5 day bod test and the total cod is measured using the titrimetric method 27 the standard method used for determination of all the parameters is given in table s1 as shown in fig 3 though the cod and bod5 concentrations were within the treated water discharge limits shown in table 2 28 the tn and tdp as po4 concentration of treated water was 20 mg l and 3 6 mg l respectively both tn and tdp as po4 concentrations were above the discharge limit of 10 mg l and 2 mg l respectively 28 efforts were made to reduce the tn and tdp as po4 concentrations in the treated water which are discussed in the following sections 4 2 identification of process modifications through sensitivity analysis as seen from the experimental observations shown in table 4 the tn and tdp as po4 values were higher the permissible discharge limits to improve these parameters bnr was considered a variable process modification hence to achieve bnr via sndn and tdp as po4 removal by ebpr the biological reactor was divided virtually into aeration zone anoxic zone and re aeration zones and simulations were run by varying different parameters one at a time the model layout used is as shown in fig 1 b 4 2 1 scenario 1 effect of do concentration in aeration zones the do concentration in the aeration and re aeration zone was varied from the baseline value of 3 0 mg l up to 4 5 mg l in steps of 0 5 mg l for all these cases the mlss concentration was kept constant at 4000 mg l and the hrt was maintained as 2 5 h in aeration zone 1 5 h in anoxic zone followed by 2 h in re aeration zone the simulation values of tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and organic n concentrations after each treatment stage and at different do concentration is shown in fig 4 also shown in fig 4 are the stage wise percentage reduction pr calculated between each stage of treatment calculation given in section s3 of tn nh4 n and no3 n values as can be seen from fig 4 simulation results shows that when the operating do levels in the aeration and reaeration zone was increased from 3 0 mg l the tn and tdp as po4 of the treated water reduced this improvement was seen both at do levels of 3 5 and 4 0 mg l however operating at 4 5 mg l this benefit of higher do levels was not seen as shown in fig 4 when the do level was increased from 3 0 to 4 0 mg l the pr of tn in the first aeration zone increased from 52 at do of 3 0 mg l to 57 when do was at 4 0 mg l with an increase in do level from 3 0 to 4 0 mg l there was an improvement in the tn removal due to the improvement in nitrification reactions by autotrophs in the aeration zone which is indicated by the reduction in nh4 n concentration and increase in no3 n concentration at the outlet of the aeration zone a similar trend of drop in nh4 n concentration and increase in no3 n concentration was observed in the last re aeration zone when do was increased from 3 0 mg l to 4 0 mg l however when the do increased from 4 0 to 4 5 mg l the pr of tn instead of further increasing reversed its trend and reduced to 52 as shown in fig 4 this was attributed to inadequate hrt in the anoxic zone to denitrify the higher no3 n formed which would remain in the treated water fig 5a shows the overall percentage reduction pro from raw sewage to treated water calculation given in section s2 of tn and tdp as po4 with do as shown in figs 4 and 5a the pro in tn concentration increased until do of 4 mg l and this was attributed to the improved sndn by the autotrophs and the heterotrophs however as shown in figs 3 and 6a at higher do of 4 5 mg l the pr of tn decreased and this was attributed to inadequate hrt in the anoxic zone to denitrify the higher no3 n formed which remains in the treated water as shown in fig 5a the tdp as po4 also followed a similar trend as that of tn with do i e with an increase in do the pro of tdp as po4 increased until do of 4 mg l and operating at higher do levels 4 0 mg l the pro of tdp as po4 decreased 4 the synthesis of tdp as po4 by paos can occur under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the simulation results showed that the orthophosphate po4 p was consumed in the aerobic tank while po4 p was released in the anoxic anaerobic tank in the anoxic anaerobic zone the do should be maintained at a very low concentration almost zero for effective ebpr the biowin model was developed with a zero do concentration in the anoxic anaerobic zone the optimum do maintained in the aeration zone was 4 mg l the recirculating aeration sludge might have increased do levels however the hrt maintained in the aeration 2 5 h and anoxic anaerobic 1 5 h zone was observed to be sufficient enough so that the do of wastewater in the anoxic anaerobic zone was significantly less less than 0 5 mg l however at higher do levels aerobic conditions the efficiency of tdp as po4 synthesis by paos is lower since high do reduces the uptake of po4 p 4 this is also known to potentially leave lower bod for anaerobic processing this was considered as the reason for higher tdp as po4 retained at do of 4 5 mg l from all these observations the optimum do concentration in the aeration zone and re aeration zone was identified as 4 mg l this value was used for further simulation studies operating the plant at higher do levels means higher air flow rates the air demand increased from 10 051 m3 h for the baseline scenario with 2 5 mg l do to 13 500 m3 h for case 4 with 4 5 mg l this increase in the aeration demand increases the air blower operating cost by 15 from the baseline scenario for the optimum do concentration of 4 mg l the aeration demand was 13 050 m3 h and the increase in the air blower operating cost from the base line scenario was 8 the air demand was calculated using the aeration model in biowin 32 the simulation results of all other parameters at different do concentrations are shown in table s3 the model predicted improved water quality with increase in do levels as shown in table s3 the cod and bod concentration reduced from 43 to 35 mg l and 6 5 to 3 6 mg l as do increased from 3 to 4 5 mg l respectively this was attributed to the higher biological degradation of soluble substrate cod by the heterotrophs in aeration and reaeration zones at higher do levels 4 4 2 2 scenario 2 effect of mlss concentration in aeration zone in this scenario different mlss concentrations of 3000 mg l 3500 4000 and 4500 mg l were simulated in the aeration zone for these simulations the do concentrations in the aeration and re aeration zone were held constant at 4 0 mg l the hrt of 2 5 h in aeration zone 1 5 h in anoxic zone and 2 h in reaeration zone was simulated for all the cases for all the cases simulated the values of tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and organic n concentrations after each treatment stage and the stage wise pr of tn nh4 n and no3 n values are shown in fig 6 the total nitrogen concentration and its fractions are organic n nh4 n no3 n and no2 n are given in tables s4 s6 the nitrogen balance after process modification is given in supplementary section s5 and table s9 several factors affect sndn including ph temperature do concentration and type of biomass generally it is observed that the optimum ph for nitrification ranges between 8 0 and 9 0 42 and the nitrification activities by the ammonia oxidizing bacteria reduce after a ph of 9 6 42 while the denitrification rates are depressed at ph below 6 0 and above 8 0 and the highest rate of denitrification occurs at a range of 7 0 to 7 5 42 the optimum temperature for both nitrification and denitrification are observed between 5 and 35 c with a maximum nitrification rate observed at 30 c 42 the nitrification rates also increase with do concentration it has been reported that a do concentration above 4 0 mg l is required to achieve maximum nitrification rates while other investigators have found that only 0 5 to 3 0 mg l is required 43 another crucial factor is the type of biomass the presence of ammonia oxidizing bacteria improves nitrification and the presence of denitrifiers improves denitrification a detailed microbiological analysis of the aeration and anoxic samples is given in the supplementary section 4 3 as seen from fig 6 for all the cases there was an improvement in the tn concentration with each stage of treatment with an increase in the mlss concentration from 3000 mg l to 4000 mg l case 1 to case 3 the tn in the treated water reduced from 7 8 to 6 9 mg l the reduction in tn was due to the reduction in nh4 n concentration this result was attributed to optimum ph 8 0 to 9 0 temperature 26 3 c do concentration 4 mg l and higher microbial count nitrifiers available at higher mlss with do availability the higher mlss would result in an increased rate of microbial activity ammonia oxidizing bacteria leading to a higher rate of sndn 34 when mlss was increased from 3000 mg l to 4000 mg l case 1 vs case 2 and 3 in the aeration zone the observed reduction in tn was 57 however this effect was reduced slightly 2 reduction in tn conversion in aeration zone when mlss was further increased to 4500 mg l this small drop was attributed to increase in nh4 n and organic n from 0 35 to 0 45 mg l and 1 7 to 2 1 mg l respectively even though the particulate organic n gets assimilated and removed through sludge it is believed that the soluble organic n increases with mlss and remains in the treated water 33 34 which is justified by the higher organic n concentration at mlss of 4500 mg l also it is observed in several studies that around 15 85 of soluble organic n remains in treated water 44 the tdp as po4 concentration followed a similar pattern shown in table s4 between case 1 to case 3 the tdp as po4 concentration reduced in treated water however simulations under case 4 conditions with an mlss of 4500 mg l the tdp as po4 concentration for treated water was higher as compared to previous cases one of the requirements for paos for ebpr in anaerobic conditions is to have a minimum bod5 to tdp as po4 ratio of 20 1 35 the typical operating conditions affecting ebpr are given in detail in the supplementary section s3 however this ratio was 18 1 due to lower bod5 concentration in case 4 table s4 thereby reducing the efficiency of p removal this explained the higher tdp as po4 concentration observed for case 4 the pro of tn and tdp as po4 at different mlss concentrations is shown in fig 5b as seen from the fig 5b the maximum pro for tn and tdp as po4 was observed at mlss of 4000 mg l hence the optimum mlss concentration which resulted in minimum tn and tdp as po4 concentrations in treated water was identified as 4000 mg l and was used for further studies the simulation results of all other parameters are given in table s4 the model predicted improved water quality with increase in mlss concentrations as shown in table s4 the cod and bod concentration reduced from 43 to 35 mg l and 4 5 to 3 5 mg l as mlss increased from 3000 to 4500 mg l this improvement in water quality was attributed to increased microbial activity at higher mlss concentrations 4 2 3 scenario 3 effect of varying the hydraulic retention time hrt in the three zones with do and mlss fixed at 4 0 mg l optimum value and 4000 mg l optimum value respectively the hrt of wastewater in the aeration zone anoxic zone and reaeration zone were varied for all the cases simulated the values of tn nh4 n no3 n no2 n and organic n concentrations after each treatment stage and the stage wise pr of tn nh4 n and no3 n values are shown in fig 7 the simulation results for all other parameters are given in table s5 as shown in fig 7 for case 1 the hrt was chosen so that the water would have equal hrt of 2 h in all three virtual zones i e 2 h each in aeration anoxic and re aeration zone the tn and nh4 n concentration in the treated water were 7 2 mg l and 1 2 mg l respectively fig 7 and table s5 and the no3 n concentration in the treated water was 4 mg l which accounted to be 55 of the tn indicating inadequate hrt for sndn specifically in the aeration zone to increase sndn in aeration zone higher hrt case i e case 2 was simulated for case 2 the hrt was 2 5 in the aeration zone 1 h in the anoxic zone and hrt in re aeration zone was kept same as that of case 1 i e 2 h as can be seen from fig 7 when hrt in aeration zone was increased from 2 0 to 2 5 h case 1 vs case 2 the pr in tn increased from 55 to 57 primarily due to increased sndn in aeration zone which is evident from higher nh4 n reduction from 80 to 83 however the reduction in the hrt of 0 5 h in the anoxic zone only showed a marginal drop of 1 in pr of tn between case 1 and case 2 this result showed that even 1 5 hrt in anoxic zone was still adequate to achieve denitrification in anoxic zone however the nh4 n at the anoxic zone outlet was still high and to address this the case 3 which had higher hrt in the re aeration zone was simulated case 3 with hrt of 2 h of aeration in followed by 1 h of anoxic conditions and 3 h of reaeration was simulated as seen from fig 7 when the hrt in the reaeration zone was increased from 2 0 h to 3 h case 2 vs case 3 the pr of tn and nh4 n in the re aeration zone increased from 23 to 32 and from 90 to 92 showing increased sndn in re aeration zone also case 3 showed lowest tn value of 6 7 mg l in treated water relative to all other cases as shown in table s5 and this was attributed to the adequate reaction times for both nitrification and denitrification in the three zones the intermittent anaerobic and aerobic condition with optimum hrt is known to improve the nitrification denitrification efficiency 23 the tdp as po4 was minimum in case 3 table s5 it is well understood that treating wastewater under anaerobic conditions followed by prolonged aerobic conditions acts a selector and favours the growth of paos a selector is a zone in a biological treatment process with specific environmental conditions that promote the growth of a specific group of microorganisms 35 37 it is hypothesized that the virtual anoxic zone acted as a selector for the paos and gave them a selective advantage over other microorganisms in the system 35 37 this explained the minimum tdp as po4 in case 3 also the cod and bod concentrations reduced from 42 to 34 mg l and 5 to 2 9 mg l respectively from case 1 to case 3 hence from all these observations case 3 was identified as the optimum case in scenario 3 4 2 4 scenario 4 effect of return activated sludge r ratio to further optimize the process the r ratio was varied between 0 03 and 0 69 the optimum do concentration of 4 mg l was considered for simulation in the aeration and re aeration zones the optimum hrt of 2 h in aeration zone 1 h in anoxic zone and 3 h in re aeration zone was simulated the variation of mlss in the aeration and re aeration zone the aeration requirement and the treated water cod with r ratio is shown in fig 8 as seen from fig 8 with increase in r ratio from 0 03 to 0 69 the mlss in the aeration and re aeration zone increased from 1052 to 6451 mg l respectively similarly as shown in fig 8 the air requirement to maintain a fixed do concentration of 4 mg l in aeration and re aeration zones also increased with r ratio this increase in air requirement was attributed to higher microbial count at higher r ratio since at higher r ratio the microorganism count will be higher the amount of air to be provided to maintain a fixed do concentration will also be higher analysing the treated water cod variation with r ratio as shown in fig 8 and table s6 case 1 to case 5 it was observed that cod levels decreased until r ratio of 0 21 and then it increased with r ratio this increase was attributed to the decrease in food to microorganism ratio f m with increasing r which leads to starvation and decay of the microorganisms increasing the dissolved organic matter and thereby the total cod this result was in agreement with the observations reported by 38 the increase in the energy cost with increase in air requirement and r ratio is shown in fig s4 the variation of tn with r ratio for treated water is shown in fig 9 the tn concentration reduced until r ratio of 0 21 and then increased steadily with r the nh4 n also showed a similar trend this showed that at r ratios above 0 21 the hrt provided was inadequate to drive the nitrification reaction leading to increased nh4 n in the system the no3 n and no2 n concentration in the treated water reduced rapidly with increase in the r ratio till 0 21 indicating a higher denitrification process however above 0 21 this reduction tends to saturate several researchers have observed similar results indicating an increase in denitrification with increase in r ratio for fixed do concentration provided that the availability of organic matter cod is not limited 38 39 with an increase in the r ratio the concentration of microbial mass recycled into the process increases to identify the specific type of microbial mass molecular biological techniques are necessary johnston et al 40 has monitored microbial community in three full scale stps and observed the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria without any seasonal fluctuations wiginton et al 41 have also identified the abundance of amoa ammonia oxidizing 45 and nosz denitrifiers 25 in an activated sludge system using 16srna sequencing some potential abundant denitrifiers have also been identified by using culture independent methods in wastewater by thomson et al 42 they observed that denitrifiers constitute 20 30 of the total bacterial composition in an activated sludge system but irrespective of the type of microbial mass the organic n composed of protein urea amino acids and humic substances increases with biomass concentration this explained the higher organic n concentration in the treated water with increasing r ratio organic carbon content is also an essential factor in accomplishing effective denitrification since it is an energy source for bacteria 43 a c n ratio of 3 5 4 5 g cod g n is considered as optimum for effective sndn 44 the c n ratio of each zone for all the scenarios is given in the modified supplementary material table s7 as seen from table s7 the c n ratio for all the cases in the scenario was observed to be within the acceptable range indicating effective denitrification efficiency the tdp as po4 concentration decreased with r ratio until 0 21 and then increased table s6 it is observed in several studies that p removal efficiency in the anoxic zones increased with r ratio specifically due to nitrate recycling 45 46 s but one of the limiting factors for ebpr is the availability of organic content or the bod p ratio cod p ratio of minimum 20 1 but for r ratio beyond 0 21 for cases 4 and 5 the bod p ratio was less than 20 1 thereby reducing the efficiency of p removal hence it was inferred that the optimum r ratio of 0 21 produces minimum tn and tdp as po4 concentrations for the fixed do of 4 mg l 4 3 microbiological analysis results the wastewater samples from the aeration and anoxic zones were analyzed to identify the microbial community the composition of the bacterial community and the similarity and differences between the two samples were investigated a total of 12 phyla were observed in the two samples proteobacteria was the most abundant community 30 40 which is consistent with the samples from activated sludge systems 47 48 bacteroidetes 12 15 planctomycetes 10 12 chlorofexi 9 12 actinobacteria 7 8 2 and nitrospirae 4 5 were the other important groups the dominant class of bacteria and its percentage composition in the aeration and anoxic tanks are given in fig 10 as seen from fig 10 in the aeration tank samples the ammonia oxidizing bacterial classes observed were nitrosovibrio 6 99 nitrosomonas 5 52 nitrosolobus 5 03 and nitrosospira 4 87 these ammonium oxidizing bacteria belong to the beta subdivision of the proteobacteria 49 nitrobacter 9 19 nitrospira 4 87 and pseudomonas 3 5 were the nitrite oxidizing bacterial classes found abundant in the aeration samples the nitrite oxidizing bacteria usually belong to the alpha and gamma subdivisions of the proteobacteria 50 the denitrifying bacteria shown in fig s6 observed in the anoxic samples were achromobacter 6 07 proteus 5 5 alcaligenes 5 25 pseudomonas 4 32 and spirillum 3 91 all belonging to the beta and gamma subdivisions of proteobacteria other denitrifying bacterial species were micrococcus 3 5 belonging to the actinobacteria phylum and bacillus 3 27 belonging to the firmicutes phylum 22 as seen from the microbiological analysis results there was a clear difference in the bacterial community in the aeration and anoxic samples the aeration samples were abundant in ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria whereas the anoxic samples were rich in denitrifying bacterial classes the classes observed in both the samples were pseudomonas proteobacteria and nitrospira nitrospirae these are the bacterial classes that survive in both aerobic and anoxic conditions 48 also as seen from fig 10 paos including pseudomonas 4 32 and amaricoccus 4 1 belonging to the proteobacteria phylum brevibacterium 3 91 and tetrasphaera 3 5 belonging to the actinobacteria phylum and anaerolineae 2 51 belonging to the chloroflexi phylum were identified in the anoxic samples the presence of these anaerobic paos confirms the hypothesis that the proposed modification has been successful in ebpr 4 4 plant performance after process modifications based on the sensitivity analysis results only the optimized process modifications were implemented in the 55 mld stp at the k c valley stp and compared with the experimental results to implement the process modification of converting the existing aeration tank into three virtual zones namely aeration anoxic and reaeration changes in the plant s operating conditions were necessary some selective surface aerators were operated in a switch on switch off mode to create a virtual anoxic zone such that anoxic conditions and do levels less than 0 5 mg l was achieved in these sections of the bioreactor the return activated sludge saturated with do could negatively affect the denitrification process in the virtual anoxic zone 1 to prevent this the do levels in the anoxic zone were frequently monitored using do sensors and it was observed that the do concentration was less than 0 5 mg l at all times while to implement do of 4 mg l in the aeration and reaeration zones the air flow rate was maintained at 13 050 m3 h diffuse air blowers were repositioned into these zones to maintain this airflow rate the optimized hrt of 2 h of aeration followed by 1 h of anoxic condition and 3 h of reaeration was also implemented the optimum r ratio was identified as 0 21 with an mlss of 5000 mg l from the simulation results however the original plant r ratio of 0 69 and the corresponding mlss of 6451 mg l were not modified due to site conditions this optimum r ratio is planned to be implemented in the second phase of process modification in the 55 mld unit it is assumed that implementing the optimum r ratio will bring down the recycling pump cost by 15 the plant was run for 6 months continuously based on the optimized parameters and the process conditions were stabilized over this period the sludge based parameters including mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss the tp concentration of sludge and the sludge volume index svi after the process modification is given in table s9 fig 11 shows the comparison of biowin simulation and experimental values at different stages of treatment after the process modification by implementing the optimized operating conditions case 5 scenario 4 as can be seen from fig 11 the simulation results matched very closely with that of the experimental values for all the water sample locations i e aeration zone outlet anoxic zone outlet re aeration zone outlet and treated water the higher bod at the aeration zone outlet is due to the high return activated sludge flow of 38 mld r ratio 0 69 back into the aeration zone the relative error between the simulation and experimental values were computed for the treated water values to quantify the accuracy of the model 31 the relative error for treated water values was 6 1 4 9 4 1 2 5 3 2 6 7 and 5 5 for cod bod do tn nh4 n no3 n and tdp as po4 respectively and was lower than the acceptable upper limit of 10 31 the treated water cod concentration was 29 mg l which was within the treated water discharge limit of 50 mg l similarly bod5 of the treated water was 5 5 mg l which was also within the upper limit of 10 mg l for the treated water the tn value of treated water was 8 8 mg l which was within the upper limit of 10 mg l this validated that the introduction of nitrification denitrification zones aeration anoxic reaeration with optimized operating conditions was successful to meet the recently revised discharge standards the tp concentration in the treated water after the modification was observed to be 4 25 0 5 mg p l which was within the effluent discharge limit of 4 5 mg p l as laid down by the cpheoo 51 the tdp as po4 value of the treated water as per simulation was 2 9 mg l however tdp as po4 of the treated water measured in the stp was 1 mg l this reduction in the tdp as po4 may be because of several reasons the modestly improved phosphorus reduction observed in stp was a result of improvement in the bnr specifically due to the presence of low nitrate concentrations in anaerobic zones 1 and can be the first cause secondly the anaerobic mass fraction of luxury paos was high 18 as given in section 4 3 which is justifiable for the hrt in anoxic zone and r ratio 52 of 0 69 the third reason for reduction in tdp as po4 could be the creation of deep anaerobic conditions achieved by switching off the surface aerators this is known to reduce the entry of oxygen through the liquid surface thereby creating a pseudo fermentation zone that assists the growth of the paos another major contributing factor for the tdp as po4 reduction can be the accumulation of phosphorous in the biomass by luxury paos in the form of polyphosphates under endogenous conditions which is the final phase of growth of activated sludge culture under starvation f m ratio 1 mulbarger mc et al 1971 and needs to be experimentally confirmed 4 5 economic comparison the process modifications in the 55 mld unit stp was shown to be successful in improving the bnr removal and treated water quality to meet emerging standards the modifications were implemented in the plant with a minimum process intervention resource investment and without shutting down the plant the time for the implementation and the stabilization of the proposed modification was 8 months with the optimization of process modification using the biowin asdm model the cost for implementation of the modification was only us 0 4 million as against an initial estimate of us 6 million which also involved shutting down of the plant operation constructing new reactors and making significant changes to plant operating conditions a significant improvement in the treated water quality was achieved in a short period of time with minimum capital costs the treated water quality can be further improved by implementing the optimized r ratio of 0 21 as observed in the simulation results a lower r ratio of 0 21 can also reduce the recycle pump operating cost by 40 and the air pump cost to maintain do of 4 mg l by 29 which leads to a reduction in the total energy cost of the treatment plant by 35 hence this modification of r ratio is proposed to be implemented to further improve the efficiency of the plant the details of estimated cost actual cost and savings for the implementation of the proposed modification is given in table 5 for developing countries it is important to modify existing sewage treatment plants without major interventions to improve the quality of treated water using mathematical models and simulating several scenarios adaptable onsite modifications with minimal capital cost as proposed modeled and validated in this work can serve as a solution for improving the treatment efficiency of several stps in india and in other developing countries 5 conclusions in this work a plant wide biowin asm model was developed for the 55 mld treatment unit in the k c valley sewage treatment plant to make the plant compliant with the revised discharge standards the as is conditions of the stp were simulated and the model kinetic and stoichiometric parameters were calibrated the existing bioreactor was divided virtually into aeration anoxic and re aeration zones modeling efforts identified the optimum do level to be 4 mg l and mlss concentration to be 4000 mg l modeling also suggested maintaining a hydraulic residence time in the virtually created aeration anoxic and re aeration zones as 2 h 1 h and 3 h respectively the water quality results after process modification showed drastic improvements the total nitrogen and total dissolved phosphorous concentrations were reduced from 20 mg l to 8 mg l and 3 5 mg l to 0 9 mg l before and after the process modification the cod and bod5 concentrations were also reduced to 33 and 5 5 mg l respectively the treated water from stp thus met the revised standards these efforts resulted in a capital cost saving of us 5 6 million and avoided other operational disturbances of plant shutdown this study shows that using mathematical modeling tools such as biowin is highly beneficial to achieve process modifications in old operating stps process modifications using biowin and its implementation on existing operational stps to meet the new discharge standard is an economical alternative for improving the treatment efficiency of stps in india and other developing countries declaration of competing interest the

13167,it is of great significance to develop an adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and excellent resistance to anion and cation interference toward the removal of u vi herein a novel polyamine modified polyacrylonitrile based fiber panpa has been synthesized through hydrothermal method which can validly remove u vi from solution combined with mesoscopic spectral characterization and simulation method the removal behavior and mechanism of u vi from high fluorine uranium containing wastewater by panpa are systematically investigated the results show that based on the strong coordination principle of polyamine group and uo2 2 panpa can selectively remove u vi from wastewater in addition the q max of 459 27 mg g 1 was more than that of many other adsorbent materials more importantly panpa is not affected by high concentration of f and exhibits higher distribution coefficient 559 900 ml g 1 and removal efficiency 99 5 to u vi than other coexisting ions in real wastewater furthermore the column experiment was also implemented to remove u vi the results indicate that panpa is a promising material to effectively remove u vi from real wastewater produced during the fabrication of nuclear fuel elements graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords uranium removal polyacrylonitrile fiber real uranium wastewater 1 introduction there is growing international consensus that nuclear power is a clean energy option which can meet up with the increase of worldwide energy demand 1 based on the guidelines of world health organization who and united states the acceptable uranium contaminant level is lower than 30 μg l 1 2 it is inevitably to product large quantities of u vi containing wastewater during the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle process which includes the uranium mining the milling and refining the conversion of u3o8 to uf6 the enrichment and the fuel fabrication such as uo2 powder therefore the separation and removal of u vi from contaminated water is one of the most important tasks for environment protection and the recovery of uranium resource because the uo2 powder can be directly prepared from uf6 by the dry defluorination processes in a flame reactor and hf was another main reaction product when the offgas was preferentially treated before release it would bring a lot of low level wastewater which also contains f in great quantity 3 4 generally efficient decontamination of u vi from the low level liquid waste would not only require a complicated treatment processes precipitation with h2o2 and cao for recovery of uranium and f respectively but also further increase the quantity of the secondary waste 5 in order to tackle this challenge the adsorption method with its own distinct advantages of easy to be operated high adsorption capacity diversity low cost and high selectivity is considered as the most promising method for the removal of u vi nowadays numerous adsorbents have been reported for treatment of waste water for example layered double hydroxides ldh 6 modified fibers 7 8 hydrous titanium dioxide 9 and ordered silica 10 however the low adsorption capacity and selectivity and the adsorption capacity of adsorbing materials for u vi is also easily affected by the competition of coexisting f ion 11 hence it is desire to fabricate a novel effective uranium adsorbent with outstanding adsorption performance polyacrylonitrile fiber pan is a class of fiber material which mainly possess a lot of cyano groups this material has its own unique characteristics including controlled functionalization cost effective good mechanical strength and stability and feasibility for industrialization on a large scale 12 liu et al have chosen pan as the support to prepare pan hydrous titanium dioxide composite and researched the adsorption behavior of u vi in a u vi phosphate carbonate coexisting systems 13 besides the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity was 256 4 mg g 1 ph 8 0 additionally several n based and p containing binding agents were introduced onto pan and the u vi adsorption performance were compared it has found that the complexation by amidoxime moieties could make the product suitable for across all ph values 14 nevertheless the current reported pan based adsorbents can be problematic when used for u vi removal under concentrated f condition ladeira and morais reported that the fluoride even low concentrations of fluoride 2 5 g l 1 would inhibit uranium uptake by the resins ira 402 purolite a860 s and ira 910 u 15 to discovery of novel materials with outstanding adsorption properties is necessary in this regard the amino containing adsorbents were proven its availability in u vi containing wastewater remediation 16 for example polyamine pa and amidoxime ao groups modified pan have been utilized for u vi capture with the q max of 200 1 mg g 1 ph 5 0 and the distribution coefficient of u vi 1778 7 ml g 1 in a real uranium mine wastewater was reported in our previous literature 17 otherwise it was found that the functionalized with amino solved the problem of less adsorption capacity of mesoporous silica sba 15 162 mg g 1 with the adsorption capacity that can reach 588 mg g 1 ph 6 0 18 but there still remains a lack of highly efficient uranium adsorbent with high adsorption capacity high selectivity and high f tolerance herein a one step hydrothermal strategy was proposed to prepare a novel polyamine modified pan material panpa and further explored the adsorption behavior of this material for u vi the main targets of this work were to 1 prepare panpa by a simple approach 2 evaluate and optimize its adsorption ability for u vi uptake under diversified experimental conditions ph f concentration contact time initial u vi concentration temperature 3 elucidate its adsorption mechanism via different techniques kinetics equilibrium thermodynamics theoretical calculations and spectroscopic

following pan 1 0 g eda 40 ml eg 10 ml and deionized water 10 ml were mixed under ultrasonication for 10 min this mixture was transferred into a 100 ml ptfe lined high pressure reactor and put into an oven at a specific temperature for a specific time after cooling the fibers were washed with ultra pure water until the filtrate was neutral and then dried in an oven at 60 c for 10 h the adsorption capacity of panpa was optimized by reaction temperature and reaction time the removal amount and removal rate of panpa to u vi as well as fiber grafting degree gd are often used as the judgment criteria the gd of pa group was evaluated by the following eq 1 19 1 gd w f w i w i where w i is the weight of pan and w f g is the weight of panpa in this work we adjust the gd conveniently by varying the grafting time and temperature 2 3 characterization and analysis a scan electron microscope sem zeiss germany equipped with energy dispersive x ray eds analysis system was used to observe the surface morphologies and elemental content of pan and panpa the chemical composition of the surface was analysised by a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir perkinelmer spectrum one usa in the wavenumber range from 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 and an xps thermo escalab 250 electron spectrometer using al k irradiation the crystal structure of the fibers was tested by the x ray diffraction xrd rigaku ultima iv 40 kv 40 ma cu kα λ 1 54051 å the thermal stability of pan and panpa was tested by a thermogravimetric analytical instrument tga netzsch tg 209f1 libra germany the condition is from 25 c to 800 c at a rate of 10 c min 1 with a nitrogen rate of 50 ml min 1 the chemical structure of fibers was simulated by gaussion software gaussview 6 0 using density functional theory in the process of optimization we used b3lyp tzvp to do the theoretical method and basis set the electrostastic potential esp of fiber surface was studied by multiwfn and vmd software for water sample analysis the concentration of u vi was detected by the trace u vi analyzer wgj iii china while the concentration of f was measured by a spectrophotometer hach dr3900 2 4 adsorption experiments of simulated wastewater 2 4 1 batch adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments of u vi 50 mg l 1 were conducted in a vibration chamber with a constant velocity the effects of ph 2 11 f concentration 1 6 g l 1 contact time 5 180 min and temperatures 20 30 and 40 c on adsorption capacity of panpa were investigated the distributions of u vi and f in the solution were simulated by visual mineql 3 0 the adsorption capacity q e mg g 1 removal rate r and distribution coefficient k d ml g 1 of the fibers for u vi are calculated by the following eqs 2 4 12 20 2 q e mg g 1 c 0 c e v m 3 r c 0 c e c 0 100 4 k d ml g 1 c 0 c e c e v m where c 0 mg l 1 is the original u vi concentration and c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium u vi concentration v l is corresponded to the volume of the solution and m is the weight of the sorbent 2 4 2 column experiments during the experiment this work used a column with length of 100 mm and inside diameter of 17 mm which filled with 4 30 g panpa a peristaltic pump was used to pump u vi solution ph 7 through the column at a certain flow rate of 12 ml min 1 the effluent was collected in a recipient and the concentration of u vi was measured by icp oes 2 5 adsorption experiment in real u vi wastewater during the experiment 0 02 g panpa was put in contact with 50 ml real fluorine contained low level radioactive wastewater in a constant temperature vibration chamber for 1 h at 25 c and adjust the ph of wastewater to 7 with na2co3 solution the concentration of all of ions in solution was measured by icp oes the real wastewater was obtained from a nuclear fuel components company the wastewater is highly acidic and contains a high concentration of f 3 result and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization of samples according to the synthesis routine of panpa as shown in fig 1 the cyanide groups on pan fibers were converted into pa polyamine group through eda for hydrothermal reaction to increase the content of n on the fiber and strengthen the affinity of the fiber to metal atoms ren et al grafted pa groups onto pan in the same way 21 through ftir and xps test methods it is proved that the fiber modification is indeed such a process after modification it is found that panpa has obvious color change and has a good adsorption capacity in order to increase the grafting degree of pa groups on the fibers as well as the adsorption ability to such as temperature time reagent ratio and so on based on the previous study of our group this research further explored the temperature and time during the process of graft fig 2a shows gd of pa groups at different reaction temperature the gd are 0 93 1 35 5 54 19 96 and 40 72 respectively the evidence reveals that gd of pa groups increases with the temperature the strength of the fibers at 125 c decreased significantly compared to 115 c this maybe attributed the strong alkalinity of eda and pan was poor in alkali resistance further increment of temperature above 125 c would cause the fibers to be melt making adsorption experiments impossible to carry out fig 2b describes the adsorption performance of panpa for u vi it increases with the gd and it can reach 95 8 mg g 1 at 115 c the desirable adsorption capacity may be due to the fact that pa groups providing more active sites therefore 115 c was selected as the optimal temperature for grafting fiber fig 2c is the gd of pa groups at different reaction time it was observed during the experimental process that the strength of the fibers decreases with the length of grafting time as shown in fig 2d it illustrates the optimal grafting condition of pa groups at 115 c and 4 h the surface morphology and chemical composition of the fibers are researched by sem and eds the images are shown in fig 3 as seen in fig 3a the surface of pan is slightly grooved and white after the modification fig 3b depicts a coarse and light yellow surface of panpa this is due to the chemical effect of eda on pan it makes pan have more cracks and thus a larger surface area as well as increase the number of active sites obvious flake solids appeared on panpa fibers after adsorption of u vi fig 3c moreover after measuring the diameter of pan and panpa the images roughly prove that the diameter of panpa increased by 1 7 times due to the swell of pan as shown in fig 3d the eds image of pan shows that it is consist of c n and a small amount of o on the contrary it is found that the content of n in panpa increases by 6 47 fig 3e moreover after interacting with u vi the u vi peak arises fig 3f the results mentioned above indicate that pa groups are grafted successfully and panpa has a good adsorption capacity for u vi ftir can further explain the changes of function groups in the fibers before and after modification fig 4 depicts the ftir spectrum of pan panpa and panpa u in the ftir spectrum the absorption band at 2240 cm 1 is considered as the cn stretching vibration which is the characteristic band of pan 22 the strong peaks from 1487 to 944 cm 1 are attributed to ch2 ch3 stretching vibration which also confirmed as the presence of polypropylene skeleton 23 after grafting the absorption band of panpa from 3669 to 3012 cm 1 corresponds is the nh2 stretching vibration which considered as the existence of the polyamine active sites 24 the vibration peak of 2241 cm 1 is corresponded to cn band it is weaken but still exists in the modified fiber indicating that only a part of cn of pan is involved in the grafting process meanwhile a new peak arises at 1602 cm 1 is attributed to nh2 band which further illustrates the successful grafting of pa groups these evidences imply that the pa groups were successfully grafted onto pan and are consistent with the results of eds spectrum after interaction of u vi the new peak at 881 cm 1 is due to uo band as the combination of u vi and function group of fibers the results above indicate panpa has a certain adsorption capacity for u vi the tga curves of pan and panpa are shown in fig 5a the weight of pan remained unchanged while the weight of panpa decreased slightly at 0 270 c this is attributed to decomposition of pa groups on the fiber in detail pan and panpa clearly display weight loss from 270 c to 425 c furthermore considered as the disintegration of pan skeleton the weight of pan and panpa is dropping dramatically at 270 425 c 25 the data once again validate the successful grafting of pa group xrd was used to test the crystallinity of pan panpa and panpa u fig 5b the xrd pattern of pan shows that the high diffraction peak at 17 and the weak diffraction peak at 29 5 corresponding to the 100 and 110 crystallographic planes of the hexagonal lattice of pan 26 the spectrum of panpa is basically the same as that of pan but the intensity of peak is slightly decreased this indicated that the internal crystal structure of panpa was not changed significantly after being modified in addition the spectrum of panpa u has almost unchanged compared with that of the original panpa the results above are in good agreement with the sem and ftir which proves that panpa has a good integrity and can satisfy the demands of application 3 2 effect of ph on u vi adsorption since the real wastewater is too acidic it is necessary to explore the influence of ph to investigate the optimal ph for panpa the effect was researched for the ph range from 2 0 to 11 0 by using the solution of 50 mg l 1 initial u vi concentration and 2 g l 1 initial f concentration and the data is displayed in fig 6a as the ph increases from 2 0 to 7 0 the q e of panpa increases from 21 26 to 98 32 mg g 1 this phenomenon can be explained as the conversion of the species of u vi in solution from cation to anion in fig 6c the determination of the zero point charge phzpc was used to study the surface charge and acid base properties of the adsorbent 0 1 mol l 1 kno3 solution was prepared and its initial ph was adjusted in the range of 2 11 by naoh and hcl then 10 ml kno3 and 0 10 g adsorbent were interacted in test tubes the samples were kept at 25 c for 24 h and the final ph of solutions was measured by a ph meter the value of ph is calculated by the following formula ph phfinal phinitial panpa is alkaline and negatively charged and the protonation degree decreases with the increase of ph in the low ph region the weak adsorption capacity of panpa is mainly due to panpa is positively charged at this time and has a high affinity for f which preempts part of the active sites when the ph 7 the adsorption capacity of panpa reaches the best which is due to the interaction between progressively deprotonated functional groups and uo2 2 when the ph increases from 8 0 to 11 0 the adsorption capacity decreased gradually even better the adsorption capacity of panpa was significantly higher than that of ph 2 however in the high ph region the decreased q e of panpa could be ascribed to the electrostatic repulsion of the surface between the negatively charged u vi carbonate complex and the negatively charged panpa 3 3 effect of f on u vi adsorption the coexistence of ion is also a vital factor in the adsorption process in the production process of a nuclear fuel element u vi containing wastewater containing high concentrations of fluorine as shown in fig 7 when the concentration of f is 1 g l 1 the r of panpa to u vi can reach 85 2 indicating that panpa has strong adsorption and high selectivity to u vi as the fluorine concentration increases to 6 g l 1 the adsorption capacity is only reduced by 20 97 the results show that panpa has a certain adsorption capacity for f and the removal efficiency is about 30 which is advanced to the preliminary separation and recovery of fluorine u vi 3 4 adsorption kinetics on panpa the speed of removing u vi from wastewater is not only a matter of material quality but also a test of whether it can be used to reduce costs in the real application fig 8a depicts that the influence of contact time on adsorption capacity of panpa at different temperatures the adsorption performance of panpa increases significantly with the increasing of temperature indicating that appropriately increasing the adsorption temperature is salutary to boost the adsorption performance of panpa the experimental data show that the contact time of 80 min is sufficient to ensure the equilibrium of the reaction kinetic models are usually used to further explain the relationship between the contact time and the adsorption capacity the data of adsorption kinetics model of panpa was calculated by using the pseudo first order kinetics model pseudo second order kinetics model and intraparticle diffusion model the kinetics models of the adsorption process give expression to following eqs 5 7 27 29 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 7 q e k 3 t 0 5 c where qe is the adsorption equilibrium capacity and qt mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity at different time min of panpa for u vi k1 min 1 k2 mg g 1 min 1 and k3 mg g 1 min 0 5 are the rate constants of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models respectively fig 8b d describe the data of adsorption kinetics and the parameters of the kinetic models are listed in table 1 for r2 value the pseudo second order kinetics model is better than pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models indicating that it could better depict the adsorption process the pseudo second order kinetic model is established based on a hypothesis that the adsorption rate might be determined by chemisorption facilitated by the formation of covalent bonds it is observed that the reaction of panpa for u vi is chemisorption 3 5 adsorption isotherms on panpa the adsorption capacity of the material is generally considered to be affected by the initial concentration fig 9a describe the effect of initial concentration on the adsorption capacity of panpa at 20 30 and 40 c the results depict that the adsorption capacity of panpa increases with the increasing of initial concentration and qmax reaches 459 27 mg g 1 the adsorption capacity of different materials for u vi is compared in table 2 the qmax of panpa is higher than other fibers secondly with the increase of temperature the adsorption capacity of panpa also shows a significant increase indicating that a suitable high temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process the adsorption isotherm not only reveal the maximum adsorption capacity but also imply the adsorption mechanism the data of adsorption isotherm were simulated by using langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the models are calculated as following eqs 8 and 9 30 31 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 9 q e k f c e 1 n where q m is the theoretical saturation adsorption capacity mg g 1 k l l mg 1 is the equilibrium constant of langmuir isotherm model k f mg g 1 is the equilibrium constant of freundlich isotherm model and n is a constant delegating the intensity of adsorption the calculated curves of adsorption isotherms at 20 30 and 40 c are depicted in fig 9b and c the simulation data are compared in table 3 compared with the r2 values langmuir isotherm model can depict the adsorption process better than freundlich isotherm model moreover the theoretical calculation value q e of langmuir isotherm model is more on the verge of the experimental value q e therefore the adsorption process conforms to langmuir isotherm model indicating that the adsorption process is monolayer adsorption on surface of panpa 0 20 m na2co3 solution was used to desorb u vi of panpa and the adsorption desorption process is repeated for five times the desorption efficiency of panpa u is still higher than 88 as the regeneration cycles repeating for five times indicating that the fiber has a good reusability 3 6 thermodynamic analysis the thermodynamic analysis is based on isotherm data at different temperatures the standard gibbs free energy change g kj mol 1 the standard enthalpy of adsorption h kj mol 1 and the standard change in entropy s j mol 1 k 1 the data is calculated as the following eqs 10 and 11 39 10 g rtln k 11 ln g s r h rt where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the temperature the values of s r and h r are obtained from a plot of ln kd versus 1 t negative values of δg 11 92 kj mol 1 at 40 c and positive values of δs 0 1342 kj mol 1 k 1 testify that the adsorption of panpa for u vi is a spontaneous process δh 30 08 kj mol 1 imply that the adsorption process is an endothermic property hence fitful higher temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process of panpa and the reaction is a spontaneous process 3 7 calculation model in order to better explain how panpa can be combined with u vi the gaussian model was used to simulate the modified panpa and panpa u fig 10 the bond angle between the modified group of panpa and the pan skeleton is greater than 120 but the bond angle decreases to 107 42 after the remove of u vi fig 10b indicating that it binds closely with u vi and chelates with u vi the bond length between uo2 2 and the amino group connected to u vi is 2 31 å fig 10c which is a short bond indicating that it is tightly bound with u vi the results show that uo2 2 is more likely to combine with nitrogen atoms which explains why panpa has high adsorption capacity for u vi 3 8 xps analysis xps was used to further reveal the adsorption mechanism of panpa in fig 11 panpa and panpa u both have the elements of c n o as shown by u 4f xps spectrum in fig 11b the peaks at 392 8 and 381 9 ev are due to u 4f5 2 and u 4f7 2 40 respectively the c 1s spectrum of panpa can be resolved to four peaks at 287 8 286 7 285 5 284 6 ev that identified as co cc cn cc fig 11c 41 42 after interaction with u vi the peaks of function groups were changed the result may on account of the complexation of u vi with nitrogen containing function groups n 1 s xps spectrum was shown in fig 10e it can be resolved into three peaks occurring at 400 6 399 8 and 398 7 ev which were belong to cn nh and n groups in the structure of panpa respectively 7 43 44 the shift of these groups indicated that the n containing function groups played a prominent role in the u vi adsorption of panpa for u vi there are three kinds of oxygen atoms for panpa including oh 533 2 ev co 532 2 ev and co 531 2 ev fig 11g 45 after reaction with u vi the normalized tension of the co and oh exhibits decreased furthermore the binding energies of o 1 s shift to lower values compared with panpa which was probably due to the decrease of electron cloud density around oxygen 46 all above results further verify that the panpa was successfully fabricated and panpa has an excellent adsorption capacity to u vi 3 9 column experiments the column experiment can better verify the engineering application of the material during the experiment this work used a column with length of 100 mm and inside diameter of 17 mm which filled with 4 30 g panpa a peristaltic pump was used to pump u vi solution ph 7 through the column at a certain flow rate of 12 ml min 1 fig 12a shows the breakthrough curve of a u vi containing solution through the continuous process in the first 9 4 l the effluent u vi concentration was below 50 μg l 1 which was equivalent to 414 1 bed volumes moreover the effluent u vi concentration can reach 0 8 μg l 1 at bv 179 9 fig 12b is the breakthrough curve of a u vi containing solution with f added through the continuous process the effluent u vi concentration is the same as initial u vi concentration after 38 3 l continuous inflow and the effluent u vi concentration of 4 6 l can be kept below 50 μg l 1 however the differences of the breakthrough curves between these two solutions can be correlated to the presence of 2 g l 1 f which limits the adsorption capacity of panpa for u vi to a certain extent the negative effect of f on u vi adsorption experiment had also been evidenced by liu et al 11 the results show that panpa is little affected by high concentration of fluoride ions and it is expected to be further used in real wastewater 3 10 removal performance in real u vi water to asses applicability of panpa the fibers are applied to the removal of u vi from the real u vi water during the experiment 0 02 g panpa was put in contact with 50 ml real fluorine contained low level radioactive wastewater in a constant temperature vibration chamber for 1 h at 25 c and adjust the ph of wastewater to 7 with na2co3 solution table 4 is the adsorption capacity of panpa for the real low level radioactive wastewater the results show that r of panpa for u vi is better than that of coexisting ions it can treat u vi up to 4 5 μg l 1 even at low initial concentration of u vi at the same time removal rate of f of panpa in the solution also reached 78 6 from fig 13b panpa exhibits the highest k d values 559 900 ml g 1 for u vi compared with the coexisting ions the k d value of panpa for u vi implies that pa groups modified fibers has an excellent selectivity to u vi the column experiments applied to the real wastewater can not be carried out due to the small amount of the real wastewater the column experiments will be carried out in the spot to further verify the applicability of the fibers 4 conclusions to sum up a one step hydrothermal reaction was used to immobilize pa groups onto pan and panpa had a desirable adsorption capacity moreover the adsorption process is in good fitness with langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacity for u vi can reach 459 27 mg g 1 compared with pan panpa shows significantly enhanced capacity to u vi due to pa groups providing more active sites furthermore presents high k d for u vi in addition panpa can decrease u vi from 50 mg l 1 to 0 8 μg l 1 in a continuous flow process the investigation of real u vi wastewater produced during the fabrication of nuclear fuel elements indicates that panpa can treat u vi up to 4 5 μg l 1 even at low concentration of u vi in a word panpa is a promising material for separation u vi from real u vi wastewater produced during the fabrication of the nuclear fuel elements declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13167,it is of great significance to develop an adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and excellent resistance to anion and cation interference toward the removal of u vi herein a novel polyamine modified polyacrylonitrile based fiber panpa has been synthesized through hydrothermal method which can validly remove u vi from solution combined with mesoscopic spectral characterization and simulation method the removal behavior and mechanism of u vi from high fluorine uranium containing wastewater by panpa are systematically investigated the results show that based on the strong coordination principle of polyamine group and uo2 2 panpa can selectively remove u vi from wastewater in addition the q max of 459 27 mg g 1 was more than that of many other adsorbent materials more importantly panpa is not affected by high concentration of f and exhibits higher distribution coefficient 559 900 ml g 1 and removal efficiency 99 5 to u vi than other coexisting ions in real wastewater furthermore the column experiment was also implemented to remove u vi the results indicate that panpa is a promising material to effectively remove u vi from real wastewater produced during the fabrication of nuclear fuel elements graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords uranium removal polyacrylonitrile fiber real uranium wastewater 1 introduction there is growing international consensus that nuclear power is a clean energy option which can meet up with the increase of worldwide energy demand 1 based on the guidelines of world health organization who and united states the acceptable uranium contaminant level is lower than 30 μg l 1 2 it is inevitably to product large quantities of u vi containing wastewater during the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle process which includes the uranium mining the milling and refining the conversion of u3o8 to uf6 the enrichment and the fuel fabrication such as uo2 powder therefore the separation and removal of u vi from contaminated water is one of the most important tasks for environment protection and the recovery of uranium resource because the uo2 powder can be directly prepared from uf6 by the dry defluorination processes in a flame reactor and hf was another main reaction product when the offgas was preferentially treated before release it would bring a lot of low level wastewater which also contains f in great quantity 3 4 generally efficient decontamination of u vi from the low level liquid waste would not only require a complicated treatment processes precipitation with h2o2 and cao for recovery of uranium and f respectively but also further increase the quantity of the secondary waste 5 in order to tackle this challenge the adsorption method with its own distinct advantages of easy to be operated high adsorption capacity diversity low cost and high selectivity is considered as the most promising method for the removal of u vi nowadays numerous adsorbents have been reported for treatment of waste water for example layered double hydroxides ldh 6 modified fibers 7 8 hydrous titanium dioxide 9 and ordered silica 10 however the low adsorption capacity and selectivity and the adsorption capacity of adsorbing materials for u vi is also easily affected by the competition of coexisting f ion 11 hence it is desire to fabricate a novel effective uranium adsorbent with outstanding adsorption performance polyacrylonitrile fiber pan is a class of fiber material which mainly possess a lot of cyano groups this material has its own unique characteristics including controlled functionalization cost effective good mechanical strength and stability and feasibility for industrialization on a large scale 12 liu et al have chosen pan as the support to prepare pan hydrous titanium dioxide composite and researched the adsorption behavior of u vi in a u vi phosphate carbonate coexisting systems 13 besides the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity was 256 4 mg g 1 ph 8 0 additionally several n based and p containing binding agents were introduced onto pan and the u vi adsorption performance were compared it has found that the complexation by amidoxime moieties could make the product suitable for across all ph values 14 nevertheless the current reported pan based adsorbents can be problematic when used for u vi removal under concentrated f condition ladeira and morais reported that the fluoride even low concentrations of fluoride 2 5 g l 1 would inhibit uranium uptake by the resins ira 402 purolite a860 s and ira 910 u 15 to discovery of novel materials with outstanding adsorption properties is necessary in this regard the amino containing adsorbents were proven its availability in u vi containing wastewater remediation 16 for example polyamine pa and amidoxime ao groups modified pan have been utilized for u vi capture with the q max of 200 1 mg g 1 ph 5 0 and the distribution coefficient of u vi 1778 7 ml g 1 in a real uranium mine wastewater was reported in our previous literature 17 otherwise it was found that the functionalized with amino solved the problem of less adsorption capacity of mesoporous silica sba 15 162 mg g 1 with the adsorption capacity that can reach 588 mg g 1 ph 6 0 18 but there still remains a lack of highly efficient uranium adsorbent with high adsorption capacity high selectivity and high f tolerance herein a one step hydrothermal strategy was proposed to prepare a novel polyamine modified pan material panpa and further explored the adsorption behavior of this material for u vi the main targets of this work were to 1 prepare panpa by a simple approach 2 evaluate and optimize its adsorption ability for u vi uptake under diversified experimental conditions ph f concentration contact time initial u vi concentration temperature 3 elucidate its adsorption mechanism via different techniques kinetics equilibrium thermodynamics theoretical calculations and spectroscopic characterization and 4 verify its potential application by means of the column test and in the real fluorine contained low level radioactive wastewater 2 experiments 2 1 materials and reagents pan

to the synthesis routine of panpa as shown in fig 1 the cyanide groups on pan fibers were converted into pa polyamine group through eda for hydrothermal reaction to increase the content of n on the fiber and strengthen the affinity of the fiber to metal atoms ren et al grafted pa groups onto pan in the same way 21 through ftir and xps test methods it is proved that the fiber modification is indeed such a process after modification it is found that panpa has obvious color change and has a good adsorption capacity in order to increase the grafting degree of pa groups on the fibers as well as the adsorption ability to such as temperature time reagent ratio and so on based on the previous study of our group this research further explored the temperature and time during the process of graft fig 2a shows gd of pa groups at different reaction temperature the gd are 0 93 1 35 5 54 19 96 and 40 72 respectively the evidence reveals that gd of pa groups increases with the temperature the strength of the fibers at 125 c decreased significantly compared to 115 c this maybe attributed the strong alkalinity of eda and pan was poor in alkali resistance further increment of temperature above 125 c would cause the fibers to be melt making adsorption experiments impossible to carry out fig 2b describes the adsorption performance of panpa for u vi it increases with the gd and it can reach 95 8 mg g 1 at 115 c the desirable adsorption capacity may be due to the fact that pa groups providing more active sites therefore 115 c was selected as the optimal temperature for grafting fiber fig 2c is the gd of pa groups at different reaction time it was observed during the experimental process that the strength of the fibers decreases with the length of grafting time as shown in fig 2d it illustrates the optimal grafting condition of pa groups at 115 c and 4 h the surface morphology and chemical composition of the fibers are researched by sem and eds the images are shown in fig 3 as seen in fig 3a the surface of pan is slightly grooved and white after the modification fig 3b depicts a coarse and light yellow surface of panpa this is due to the chemical effect of eda on pan it makes pan have more cracks and thus a larger surface area as well as increase the number of active sites obvious flake solids appeared on panpa fibers after adsorption of u vi fig 3c moreover after measuring the diameter of pan and panpa the images roughly prove that the diameter of panpa increased by 1 7 times due to the swell of pan as shown in fig 3d the eds image of pan shows that it is consist of c n and a small amount of o on the contrary it is found that the content of n in panpa increases by 6 47 fig 3e moreover after interacting with u vi the u vi peak arises fig 3f the results mentioned above indicate that pa groups are grafted successfully and panpa has a good adsorption capacity for u vi ftir can further explain the changes of function groups in the fibers before and after modification fig 4 depicts the ftir spectrum of pan panpa and panpa u in the ftir spectrum the absorption band at 2240 cm 1 is considered as the cn stretching vibration which is the characteristic band of pan 22 the strong peaks from 1487 to 944 cm 1 are attributed to ch2 ch3 stretching vibration which also confirmed as the presence of polypropylene skeleton 23 after grafting the absorption band of panpa from 3669 to 3012 cm 1 corresponds is the nh2 stretching vibration which considered as the existence of the polyamine active sites 24 the vibration peak of 2241 cm 1 is corresponded to cn band it is weaken but still exists in the modified fiber indicating that only a part of cn of pan is involved in the grafting process meanwhile a new peak arises at 1602 cm 1 is attributed to nh2 band which further illustrates the successful grafting of pa groups these evidences imply that the pa groups were successfully grafted onto pan and are consistent with the results of eds spectrum after interaction of u vi the new peak at 881 cm 1 is due to uo band as the combination of u vi and function group of fibers the results above indicate panpa has a certain adsorption capacity for u vi the tga curves of pan and panpa are shown in fig 5a the weight of pan remained unchanged while the weight of panpa decreased slightly at 0 270 c this is attributed to decomposition of pa groups on the fiber in detail pan and panpa clearly display weight loss from 270 c to 425 c furthermore considered as the disintegration of pan skeleton the weight of pan and panpa is dropping dramatically at 270 425 c 25 the data once again validate the successful grafting of pa group xrd was used to test the crystallinity of pan panpa and panpa u fig 5b the xrd pattern of pan shows that the high diffraction peak at 17 and the weak diffraction peak at 29 5 corresponding to the 100 and 110 crystallographic planes of the hexagonal lattice of pan 26 the spectrum of panpa is basically the same as that of pan but the intensity of peak is slightly decreased this indicated that the internal crystal structure of panpa was not changed significantly after being modified in addition the spectrum of panpa u has almost unchanged compared with that of the original panpa the results above are in good agreement with the sem and ftir which proves that panpa has a good integrity and can satisfy the demands of application 3 2 effect of ph on u vi adsorption since the real wastewater is too acidic it is necessary to explore the influence of ph to investigate the optimal ph for panpa the effect was researched for the ph range from 2 0 to 11 0 by using the solution of 50 mg l 1 initial u vi concentration and 2 g l 1 initial f concentration and the data is displayed in fig 6a as the ph increases from 2 0 to 7 0 the q e of panpa increases from 21 26 to 98 32 mg g 1 this phenomenon can be explained as the conversion of the species of u vi in solution from cation to anion in fig 6c the determination of the zero point charge phzpc was used to study the surface charge and acid base properties of the adsorbent 0 1 mol l 1 kno3 solution was prepared and its initial ph was adjusted in the range of 2 11 by naoh and hcl then 10 ml kno3 and 0 10 g adsorbent were interacted in test tubes the samples were kept at 25 c for 24 h and the final ph of solutions was measured by a ph meter the value of ph is calculated by the following formula ph phfinal phinitial panpa is alkaline and negatively charged and the protonation degree decreases with the increase of ph in the low ph region the weak adsorption capacity of panpa is mainly due to panpa is positively charged at this time and has a high affinity for f which preempts part of the active sites when the ph 7 the adsorption capacity of panpa reaches the best which is due to the interaction between progressively deprotonated functional groups and uo2 2 when the ph increases from 8 0 to 11 0 the adsorption capacity decreased gradually even better the adsorption capacity of panpa was significantly higher than that of ph 2 however in the high ph region the decreased q e of panpa could be ascribed to the electrostatic repulsion of the surface between the negatively charged u vi carbonate complex and the negatively charged panpa 3 3 effect of f on u vi adsorption the coexistence of ion is also a vital factor in the adsorption process in the production process of a nuclear fuel element u vi containing wastewater containing high concentrations of fluorine as shown in fig 7 when the concentration of f is 1 g l 1 the r of panpa to u vi can reach 85 2 indicating that panpa has strong adsorption and high selectivity to u vi as the fluorine concentration increases to 6 g l 1 the adsorption capacity is only reduced by 20 97 the results show that panpa has a certain adsorption capacity for f and the removal efficiency is about 30 which is advanced to the preliminary separation and recovery of fluorine u vi 3 4 adsorption kinetics on panpa the speed of removing u vi from wastewater is not only a matter of material quality but also a test of whether it can be used to reduce costs in the real application fig 8a depicts that the influence of contact time on adsorption capacity of panpa at different temperatures the adsorption performance of panpa increases significantly with the increasing of temperature indicating that appropriately increasing the adsorption temperature is salutary to boost the adsorption performance of panpa the experimental data show that the contact time of 80 min is sufficient to ensure the equilibrium of the reaction kinetic models are usually used to further explain the relationship between the contact time and the adsorption capacity the data of adsorption kinetics model of panpa was calculated by using the pseudo first order kinetics model pseudo second order kinetics model and intraparticle diffusion model the kinetics models of the adsorption process give expression to following eqs 5 7 27 29 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 7 q e k 3 t 0 5 c where qe is the adsorption equilibrium capacity and qt mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity at different time min of panpa for u vi k1 min 1 k2 mg g 1 min 1 and k3 mg g 1 min 0 5 are the rate constants of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models respectively fig 8b d describe the data of adsorption kinetics and the parameters of the kinetic models are listed in table 1 for r2 value the pseudo second order kinetics model is better than pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion kinetics models indicating that it could better depict the adsorption process the pseudo second order kinetic model is established based on a hypothesis that the adsorption rate might be determined by chemisorption facilitated by the formation of covalent bonds it is observed that the reaction of panpa for u vi is chemisorption 3 5 adsorption isotherms on panpa the adsorption capacity of the material is generally considered to be affected by the initial concentration fig 9a describe the effect of initial concentration on the adsorption capacity of panpa at 20 30 and 40 c the results depict that the adsorption capacity of panpa increases with the increasing of initial concentration and qmax reaches 459 27 mg g 1 the adsorption capacity of different materials for u vi is compared in table 2 the qmax of panpa is higher than other fibers secondly with the increase of temperature the adsorption capacity of panpa also shows a significant increase indicating that a suitable high temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process the adsorption isotherm not only reveal the maximum adsorption capacity but also imply the adsorption mechanism the data of adsorption isotherm were simulated by using langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the models are calculated as following eqs 8 and 9 30 31 8 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 9 q e k f c e 1 n where q m is the theoretical saturation adsorption capacity mg g 1 k l l mg 1 is the equilibrium constant of langmuir isotherm model k f mg g 1 is the equilibrium constant of freundlich isotherm model and n is a constant delegating the intensity of adsorption the calculated curves of adsorption isotherms at 20 30 and 40 c are depicted in fig 9b and c the simulation data are compared in table 3 compared with the r2 values langmuir isotherm model can depict the adsorption process better than freundlich isotherm model moreover the theoretical calculation value q e of langmuir isotherm model is more on the verge of the experimental value q e therefore the adsorption process conforms to langmuir isotherm model indicating that the adsorption process is monolayer adsorption on surface of panpa 0 20 m na2co3 solution was used to desorb u vi of panpa and the adsorption desorption process is repeated for five times the desorption efficiency of panpa u is still higher than 88 as the regeneration cycles repeating for five times indicating that the fiber has a good reusability 3 6 thermodynamic analysis the thermodynamic analysis is based on isotherm data at different temperatures the standard gibbs free energy change g kj mol 1 the standard enthalpy of adsorption h kj mol 1 and the standard change in entropy s j mol 1 k 1 the data is calculated as the following eqs 10 and 11 39 10 g rtln k 11 ln g s r h rt where r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the temperature the values of s r and h r are obtained from a plot of ln kd versus 1 t negative values of δg 11 92 kj mol 1 at 40 c and positive values of δs 0 1342 kj mol 1 k 1 testify that the adsorption of panpa for u vi is a spontaneous process δh 30 08 kj mol 1 imply that the adsorption process is an endothermic property hence fitful higher temperature is beneficial to the adsorption process of panpa and the reaction is a spontaneous process 3 7 calculation model in order to better explain how panpa can be combined with u vi the gaussian model was used to simulate the modified panpa and panpa u fig 10 the bond angle between the modified group of panpa and the pan skeleton is greater than 120 but the bond angle decreases to 107 42 after the remove of u vi fig 10b indicating that it binds closely with u vi and chelates with u vi the bond length between uo2 2 and the amino group connected to u vi is 2 31 å fig 10c which is a short bond indicating that it is tightly bound with u vi the results show that uo2 2 is more likely to combine with nitrogen atoms which explains why panpa has high adsorption capacity for u vi 3 8 xps analysis xps was used to further reveal the adsorption mechanism of panpa in fig 11 panpa and panpa u both have the elements of c n o as shown by u 4f xps spectrum in fig 11b the peaks at 392 8 and 381 9 ev are due to u 4f5 2 and u 4f7 2 40 respectively the c 1s spectrum of panpa can be resolved to four peaks at 287 8 286 7 285 5 284 6 ev that identified as co cc cn cc fig 11c 41 42 after interaction with u vi the peaks of function groups were changed the result may on account of the complexation of u vi with nitrogen containing function groups n 1 s xps spectrum was shown in fig 10e it can be resolved into three peaks occurring at 400 6 399 8 and 398 7 ev which were belong to cn nh and n groups in the structure of panpa respectively 7 43 44 the shift of these groups indicated that the n containing function groups played a prominent role in the u vi adsorption of panpa for u vi there are three kinds of oxygen atoms for panpa including oh 533 2 ev co 532 2 ev and co 531 2 ev fig 11g 45 after reaction with u vi the normalized tension of the co and oh exhibits decreased furthermore the binding energies of o 1 s shift to lower values compared with panpa which was probably due to the decrease of electron cloud density around oxygen 46 all above results further verify that the panpa was successfully fabricated and panpa has an excellent adsorption capacity to u vi 3 9 column experiments the column experiment can better verify the engineering application of the material during the experiment this work used a column with length of 100 mm and inside diameter of 17 mm which filled with 4 30 g panpa a peristaltic pump was used to pump u vi solution ph 7 through the column at a certain flow rate of 12 ml min 1 fig 12a shows the breakthrough curve of a u vi containing solution through the continuous process in the first 9 4 l the effluent u vi concentration was below 50 μg l 1 which was equivalent to 414 1 bed volumes moreover the effluent u vi concentration can reach 0 8 μg l 1 at bv 179 9 fig 12b is the breakthrough curve of a u vi containing solution with f added through the continuous process the effluent u vi concentration is the same as initial u vi concentration after 38 3 l continuous inflow and the effluent u vi concentration of 4 6 l can be kept below 50 μg l 1 however the differences of the breakthrough curves between these two solutions can be correlated to the presence of 2 g l 1 f which limits the adsorption capacity of panpa for u vi to a certain extent the negative effect of f on u vi adsorption experiment had also been evidenced by liu et al 11 the results show that panpa is little affected by high concentration of fluoride ions and it is expected to be further used in real wastewater 3 10 removal performance in real u vi water to asses applicability of panpa the fibers are applied to the removal of u vi from the real u vi water during the experiment 0 02 g panpa was put in contact with 50 ml real fluorine contained low level radioactive wastewater in a constant temperature vibration chamber for 1 h at 25 c and adjust the ph of wastewater to 7 with na2co3 solution table 4 is the adsorption capacity of panpa for the real low level radioactive wastewater the results show that r of panpa for u vi is better than that of coexisting ions it can treat u vi up to 4 5 μg l 1 even at low initial concentration of u vi at the same time removal rate of f of panpa in the solution also reached 78 6 from fig 13b panpa exhibits the highest k d values 559 900 ml g 1 for u vi compared with the coexisting ions the k d value of panpa for u vi implies that pa groups modified fibers has an excellent selectivity to u vi the column experiments applied to the real wastewater can not be carried out due to the small amount of the real wastewater the column experiments will be carried out in the spot to further verify the applicability of the fibers 4 conclusions to sum up a one step hydrothermal reaction was used to immobilize pa groups onto pan and panpa had a desirable adsorption capacity moreover the adsorption process is in good fitness with langmuir model and the maximum adsorption capacity for u vi can reach 459 27 mg g 1 compared with pan panpa shows significantly enhanced capacity to u vi due to pa groups providing more active sites furthermore presents high k d for u vi in addition panpa can decrease u vi from 50 mg l 1 to 0 8 μg l 1 in a continuous flow process the investigation of real u vi wastewater produced during the fabrication of nuclear fuel elements indicates that panpa can treat u vi up to 4 5 μg l 1 even at low concentration of u vi in a word panpa is a promising material for separation u vi from real u vi wastewater produced during the fabrication of the nuclear fuel elements declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13168,various industries generate a considerable volume of wastewater containing toxic contaminants arsenic dyes heavy metals perchlorate oil from multiple sectors among several polymeric materials low cost polyvinyl chloride pvc has attracted significant consideration as a membrane material due to its excellent properties such as good thermal stability good stiffness high mechanical strength high resistance to chlorine bases and acids compared to other polymers however fouling of hydrophobic pvc based membranes due to adsorption or deposition of particles macromolecules and biomolecules e g polysaccharides proteins salts colloids on the surface and pores of the membrane is a major hindrance thus to advance the performance of hydrophobic pvc based membranes the hydrophilicity i e wettability and fouling resistance properties of the membranes should be improved despite current trends it remains challenging to fabricate membranes with high flux and fouling resistance properties high mechanical strength with longer membrane life when subjected to wastewater treatments this review provides an overview of the current trends research and developments in pvc membranes and the

first followed by the fabrication techniques of pvc based membrane we also highlight the parametric effects on pvc based membrane performance following that various approaches for enhancing the anti

wastewater treatment 1 introduction a growing population misuse of freshwater resources and water supply pollution contribute to water shortages population rich countries including india china middle east north africa are expected to experience water scarcity in the coming years 1 therefore wastewater treatment may partially fill the gap for fresh water in the upcoming years thus finding effective and economic separation techniques or improvements in the existing one enable the world to solve water scarcity and pollution concerns in this regard membrane technology has proven its potential and gained more attention among other available techniques 2 8 several significant milestones have been reached in the progress of membrane technologies since the invention of the first commercial membrane via phase inversion methodology in the 1960s today membrane technologies are used in almost every field including the energy biotechnological environment chemical and electronic sectors 9 14 however reducing permeate flux results from membrane fouling during the wastewater separation is one of the main limitations during the membrane separation process 15 wastewater separation demands membrane with increased permeability and rejection with fouling resistance properties to achieve the cost effectiveness and highest degree of energy efficiency the current generation of membranes is undergoing much development especially in antifouling properties mechanical strength and chemical resistance 11 16 17 nowadays polymer based membrane separation techniques are the most trustworthy technology used for wastewater treatment due to the smaller footprints required for installation its straightforward pore forming mechanism and relatively low costs compared to the inorganic membrane 18 19 most wastewater consists of complex components including polysaccharides proteins dissolved organic matter cations and dissolved solids 20 in the case of hydrophobic membranes these components tend to cause severe fouling fouling reduces the water flow and makes backwashing more frequent reducing membrane life besides severely decreasing the efficiency of the membranes this also increases the cost of the membranes hydrophilic membranes that have low cost are therefore required for wastewater treatment in addition they should be capable of high permeate with good separation efficiency in this regard low cost polyvinyl chloride pvc has to gain significant consideration as a membrane material for the synthesis of microfiltration mf 21 22 ultrafiltration uf 23 24 and nanofiltration nf 25 26 membranes due to its excellent properties such as good stiffness high resistance to chlorine bases and acids compared to other base polymers 27 29 compared to mf uf and nf membranes a few works are reported in the literature for pvc based reverse osmosis and forward osmosis membranes due to the low pressure resistance of the membrane material caused by the flexible polymer chains 26 moreover pvc membranes can maintain a long membrane life despite being repeatedly cleaned with various chemical agents 30 pvc membranes have been extensively used for the separation of toxic contaminants 31 arsenic 32 dyes 33 heavy metals 34 35 perchlorate 36 and oily wastewater 23 from industrial effluents in addition pvc membranes are currently being studied as possible candidates for membrane distillation and contactor applications 37 39 pvc membranes have been studied extensively since the 1980s and several studies have reported on their applications and development for the separation of wastewater 24 29 40 42 the fabrication of pvc membrane with high performance has made remarkable progress in recent years including its use in membrane distillation membrane contactors and wastewater treatment it is however challenging to synthesize high performance pvc membranes for the separation of wastewater in the literature numerous articles discuss the application of membranes for wastewater treatment in this regard a detailed review of the use of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf based membranes was conducted by otitoju et al 43 and liu et al 44 more recently fabrication techniques of pvc based membranes have been discussed by safarpour et al 45 the review article was focusing the appropriate method and processing conditions to fabricate the membranes with desired morphology and performance other than fabrication techniques several aspects also affect the performance of pvc based membranes performance hence in detail the present review article addresses the application of pvc based membrane particularly for wastewater treatment thus the present article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the progress production and challenges of pvc membranes for wastewater treatment 2 pvc as a membrane material a wide variety of polymers with relatively high costs have been studied for wastewater treatment such as pvdf 46 polyethersulfone pes 47 polysulfone psf 48 polyvinyl alcohol pval 49 cellulose acetate ca 50 polyacrylonitrile pan 51 and the details have been reviewed by zahid et al 52 pvc is relatively more hydrophobic compared to other base polymers such as psf pes and pan the hydrophobicity of polymer is often associated with their surface tensions the critical surface tensions of frequently used polymer to fabricate membrane are listed in table 1 44 hence due to its high hydrophobic nature membranes synthesized using pvc as base polymer are more prone to fouling therefore it is challenging to fabricate pvc based membranes with high flux and fouling resistance properties to separate wastewater in addition a significant part of the membrane price is due to the cost of polymer which is a deciding factor for their extensive use especially in developing nations a combination of excellent physical and chemical properties with a low price makes pvc an excellent membrane material for the treatment of wastewater today 28 53 56 the cost of pvc polymer is less than 10 cost of pvdf polymer and the price list of common polymers used for membrane synthesis is listed in table 2 further pvc dissolves easily in common solvents resulting in forming a porous pvc membrane via the non solvent induced phase separation nips method in addition as membrane material pvc is also an attractive option because of its excellent thermal stability and high mechanical strength ahmad et al 57 investigated the various mechanical properties i e tensile strength young s modulus and elongation at break of pvc membrane and found to be 10 01 mpa 218 08 mpa and 44 04 respectively it was also revealed that pvc membranes were successfully used for practical application and the long term run 57 a similar observation for pvc based membrane was also reported in another study by ahmad et al 30 comparable mechanical properties were also reported by various researchers using different base polymers like psf 58 59 ca 60 pes 61 and pan 62 on the other hand a reduced mechanical property was observed for pvc based membranes compared to other commonly used base polymers like pvdf 44 however it is also noted that the mechanical properties of pvc based membrane was further enhanced by adding inorganic additive in the casting solution cs 57 and changing coagulation bath cb composition 30 the above mention properties of pvc make it suitable for the treatment of wastewater in this regard several researchers developed pvc membranes in different configurations such as hollow fiber 28 63 64 and flat sheet 30 65 66 in contrast to other polymers pvc can be blended with other hydrophilic polymers e g pan ca glycerol carboxylated polyvinylchloride cpvc polystyrene psr polyvinyl formal pvf polycarbonate pc over a wide variety of compositions 35 54 67 70 combining pvc with the other hydrophilic polymer can produce a new material with diverse properties and economic benefits further it is possible to chemically modify the pvc membrane surface to increase hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties 71 74 pvc based membranes have been subject to a comprehensive study in the past few years to improve their performance by i controlling the membrane precipitation rate ii enhancing membrane morphology iii improving membrane hydrophilicity for enhanced anti fouling properties and iv controlling average pore size and pore density publications on wastewater treatment using pvc based membrane increased exponentially in the past two decades and shown in fig 1 where the data are obtained based on screening and searching using the keywords polyvinyl chloride or poly vinyl chloride or pvc and wastewater and membrane in the database of web of science on 25 october 2021 3 preparation of pvc based membranes numerous methods such as sintering stretching track etching coating electrospinning and phase separation are used to fabricate the pvc based membranes 75 77 the phase separation technique is frequently used over other membrane fabrication techniques to fabricate pvc membranes due to advantages like easiness and flexible production scales which reduce its production cost 15 researches have focused much attention on the phase separation method it has also been considered the primary method for membranes synthesis 30 68 75 78 79 based on the mechanism used to separation also known as precipitation or demixing homogeneous dope solution phase separation is classified as evaporation induced phase separation eips thermally induced phase separation tips vapor induced phase separation vips and immersion precipitation or non solvent induced phase separation nips 52 in eips a polymer is dissolved in the mixture of non solvent and solvent where the non solvent is less volatile than the solvent polymer precipitation starts due to shifting of composition during evaporation to a higher nonsolvent and polymer content in the tips technique phase separation of the system has been achieved by cooling polymer solution in the vips method the casted polymeric solution is placed in a vapour atmosphere and a high solvent concentration in the vapor phase prevents solvent evaporation from the casted membrane membrane precipitation occurs because of the diffusion of non solvent into the cast membrane film the precipitation of the cast membrane occurs when different concentrations of solvent and non solvent are exchanged in the cb 52 whereas in the nips method solidification of the cast membrane occurs when different concentrations of solvent and non solvent are exchanged in the cb the mechanism involved in the separation is listed in table 3 among the various phase separation techniques the nips method developed by loeb and sourirajan 80 is the first to be commercially explored and frequently used to fabricate membrane due to the effortless fabrication technique and the only restraint to the solubility of the polymer in the solvent 81 82 since pvc dissolves easily in various common solvents like dimethylacetamide dmac 23 27 tetrahydrofuran thf 83 84 n n dimethylformamide dmf 85 and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 30 86 most pvc membranes are synthesized by nips methods zahid et al 52 discussed the mechanisms involved in the synthesis of the membrane using the nips method in detail the process of synthesizing a membrane by nips is illustrated in fig 2 hirose and co workers investigate the relationship between the phase separation process and membrane structure 87 several researchers have also actively pursued research and development of pvc membranes prepared via the nips method including examining the effects of different preparation conditions on membrane separation efficiency and morphology 24 27 28 78 88 89 4 parameters effacing pvc based membrane performance it is possible to create membranes with diverse pore sizes and morphology using the nips method a variety of parameters such as nature of the solvent type of additives and their relative concentration in the cs prior evaporation time nature of non solvent coagulation bath and its temperature membrane thickness affect the expected morphology and performance of the pvc based membranes during synthesis the effect of some of the parameters such as polymer loading membrane thickness prior evaporation time may be the same for all the polymers still some parameters such as type of solvent the composition of coagulation bath are not the same for all other polymers like psf pe pes pan etc due to differences in interaction hanson solubility parameter between base polymer i e pvc solvent and non solvent hence in this study quantitative analysis of the effect of various parameters on the performance of pvc based membrane was studied 4 1 pvc concentration and temperature of the cs membrane performance is affected by pvc concentration in the cs and typically varies from 12 to 25 wt 90 with an increase in pvc concentration the viscosity of cs increases which reduces the demixing rate of non solvent and solvent subsequently a membrane with low porosity and sponge structure is obtained 42 57 furthermore polymer concentration in the interface of non solvent increases at high pvc concentration and a low porous membrane is obtained numerous studies have explored the effects of pvc concentration on the morphology of the membrane 42 57 91 93 xie et al 42 found that increasing pvc concentration from 6 g 10 g in the cs membrane structure became denser with a reduced pore size 27 to 21 nm pore density 4 8 1013 to 3 1 1013 m 2 and porosity 88 6 to 86 4 and shown in fig 3 the surface roughness of the membrane fabricated using high loading of pvc in the cs reduces due to low pore density on the membrane surface concurrently wettability of the pvc based membrane also reduces at a high concentration of pvc in the cs as wettability is usually correlated with surface roughness the same effect of pvc concentration on the membrane morphology is also reported by other researchers using various solvents such as thf 91 nmp 57 94 and dmac 92 ahmad et al 92 synthesized pvc dmac bentonite membrane to separate oily wastewater and found that increasing pvc loading in the cs reduces membrane flux from 191 l m 2 h 1 to 159 l m 2 h 1 due to sponge membrane structure in contrast oil rejection increases at higher pvc concentration and found to be 92 due to small pore size moreover a similar observation was also stated in another work by ahmad et al 57 pure water flux of pvc based membrane decreases from 405 l m 2 h 1 to 320 l m 2 h 1 when pvc loading increase from 10 g to 18 g namdar et al revealed that increasing pvc loading from 13 to 20 in the cs significantly reduces water flux 400 to 235 kg m 2 h 1 however the hydrophilicity of the membranes samples are almost constant fig 4 the reduction in water flux was mainly attributed to the sponge membrane structure 94 a reduced humic substance rejection was reported by sidabutar et al 95 at high pvc loading the temperature of the cs is a key parameter to affect the kinetics of the phase inversion by reducing the viscosity of the cs which affects the structure and performance of resultant membranes 96 the viscosity of the cs alter the exchange rate between non solvent and solvent that further affect the membrane formation kinetics consequently change in the membrane morphology mei et al 97 observed that viscosity of the pvc dmac dope solution decreases in the entire range of temperature i e 30 80 c and found that more water was required for the precipitation of pvc at high temperature consequently alter the morphology and structure of the resultant membranes during the phase inversion process 4 2 effect of solvents on membrane performance as far as the overall properties and performance of a membrane are concerned the solvent is critical on the one hand pvc and solvents must be soluble whereas non solvents must be miscible with solvents numerous solvents such as dimethylacetamide dmac 23 27 tetrahydrofuran thf 83 84 n n dimethylformamide dmf 85 and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 30 86 are highly compatible and frequently used to fabricate pvc based membranes high chain mobility of polymer can be maintained by choosing the appropriate solvent 44 in addition the final morphology of the membrane fabricated in different solvents is governed by the kinetic parameter i e demixing rate of solvent nonsolvent pairs as well thermodynamic property i e interaction between solvent nonsolvent and solvent polymer pairs when the difference in solubility parameter is low solvents and polymers are compatible and pvc molecules easily dissolve in the solvent in contrast incompatible solvent i e high solubility differences between pvc and solvent results in the aggregation of pvc in addition the solubility difference of solvent and non solvent also determines the interaction of solvent and non solvent morphology of membrane is highly influenced by the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent a fast demixing rate was obtained during membrane precipitation for low solubility difference i e high mutual affinity solvent nonsolvent pairs resulting in a more porous finger like structure in contrast a slow demixing rate was observed for high solubility difference i e low mutual affinity solvent nonsolvent pairs resulting in the sponge like structure 15 84 the solubility parameter of various pvc compatible solvents is listed in table 4 numerous researches have been conducted to understand the effect of solvent type on the performance of pvc membrane 40 41 91 98 among the pvc compatible solvents mentioned above dmac and nmp are frequently used as non solvent to synthesize pvc based membranes in their different studies ahmad et al 23 24 30 92 fabricate flat sheet pvc based membrane using dmac and nmp as non solvent and found that both solvents can produce high performing defect free pvc membranes for the separation of oily wastewater alsalhy et al 99 investigated the effects of dmac solvent concentration in the internal coagulant on the membrane pvc based hollow fiber membranes they found that membrane morphology changed from finger like macro voids to fully sponge like structures in the presence of dmac as an internal coagulant roy et al 40 explored the effects of two different solvents i e dmac and nmp on pvc based membrane performance compared to dmac improved interaction between nmp and pvc was observed and membrane synthesis using nmp induced cs delivers enhanced thermal stability mechanical strength and antifouling properties it is also noted that dmac has a high affinity with water compared to nmp on the other hand it has a weak interaction with pvc an enhanced pure water flux i e 236 8 l m 2 h 1 was obtained for dmac solvent compared to nmp solvent i e 155 2 l m 2 h 1 hence it may be concluded that more substantial solvent power i e better compatibility resulted in a faster precipitation rate consequently a membrane with a porous and finger like structure was found and able to deliver high flux thf is also used as a main non solvent or co solvent in the presence of other solvents such as nmp or dmac thf has high volatility compared to other common solvents for pvc like dmac and nmp table 4 membrane fabricated using thf solvent possess dense top layer with suppressed microvoids results in reduced pure water flux 27 07 l m 2 h 1 compared to dmac system 41 07 l m 2 h 1 84 kawai et al 100 studied the effect of thf and dmf solvent on membrane formation using a phase diagram a continuous structure with non circular pores was obtained for pvc thf water system on the other hand a porous membrane appeared due to the absorption of water by dmf during the evaporation of dmf maghsoud et al 98 fabricated pvc membrane using two different solvents i e dmf and thf in the water coagulation bath wcb using immersion precipitation they studied the effect of solvents on membrane formation using a phase diagram thf has a low mutual affinity i e low tendency to mix with water whereas dmf water mixtures have high mutual affinity a sponge morphology with isolated pores was obtained for pvc thf water system due to delayed demixing in contrast a porous membrane appeared for pvc dmf water due to instantaneous demixing characteristics and shown in fig 5 as discussed earlier membrane morphology relies on the mutual affinity between solvent nonsolvent pairs therefore using a mixture of two different solvents with different affinities towards the non solvent may be a potential method to obtain the desired membrane morphology 29 84 91 98 101 okuno et al 91 prepared pvc membranes using thf and alcohols as a solvent and a more porous membrane was obtained due to decreased viscosity of cs it is also noted that a similar morphology was also obtained with reduced pvc molar mass therefore it may conclude that kinetic rather than thermodynamic factors primarily determine the morphology of pvc membranes maghsoud et al reported that membrane with variable morphology could be obtained using a mixture of thf and dmf the membrane morphology changes from sponge to macro void by increasing dmf concentration in the mixed solvent composition it may also conclude that the overall behavior of the system may be predicted using a ternary phase diagram still it is not easy to predict the changes in membrane morphology by considering the thermodynamic properties of the polymer solution alone 98 bagheripour et al 84 investigate the effect of solvents ratio thf dmac on the membrane performance and a reduced flux and enhanced rejection are obtained at high thf concentration wu et al 41 synthesized pvc graft poly ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate pvc pvc g pegma blended pvc membrane using dmac solvent they observed a large macro voids structure on the membrane however these macro voids structures are suppressed with increasing thf amount in the cs 29 wu et al 29 also investigated the consequence of solvent on the performance and morphology of pvc based membrane they found a low porous membrane with narrow pore size at increased thf to nmp ratio it is also noticed that the roughness of the membrane significantly reduces in the presence of thf in the cs liu et al 102 reported a membrane with enhanced mechanical property obtained using dmac dioctyl phthalate as the mixed solvents it is also noted that a membrane with a dense structure and big pore is observed when fabricated in the mixed solvent all of above mention pvc compatible traditional solvents are toxic explosive hazardous and slowly biodegradable hence using these conventional solvents is risky for the environment health and safety ehs numerous researchers use green solvents for various base polymers such as pvdf 103 104 ca 105 pes 105 pan 106 psf 105 and polyimide p84 107 in place of traditional solvents to reduce the risky for ehs however the application of green solvents for pvc based membranes is limited due to the lack of information as well as it is costly compared to convention solvents in addition little research has been carried out to understand the performance of membrane fabricated using green solvents in this regard xie et al 42 establish the viability of using a green solvent to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of membrane processes pvc pvc g pegma membrane is synthesized using green solvent methyl 5 dimethylamino 2 methyl 5 oxopentanoate i e rhodiasolv polarclean and showed an improved water permeability i e 5000 l m 2 h 1 and sodium alginate sa rejection i e 98 however it is interesting to note that thermodynamic stability of the system reduces in the presence of rhodiasolv polarclean solvent compared to dmac due to high solubility parameter between pvc rhodiasolv polarclean compared to pvc dmac resulting in small pore sizes with narrow pore distribution on the membrane surface xie et al 42 observed that membrane synthesis using traditional dmac had larger pore sizes i e 41 0 nm with a wider pore distribution range than polarclean induced membrane with pore size 31 0 nm dimethyl sulfoxide dmso green solvent has been successfully used by xie et al 101 to substitute the toxic solvents partly and enhance the performance of the membrane the usage of dmso as a solvent during pvc based membrane synthesis is not common as pvc is insoluble in dmso hence xie et al use a mixture of dmso and traditional solvents e g nmp and dmac to reduce the risk for ehs 101 it is also be noted that a better membrane morphology with enhanced performance was observed in the presence of a mixture of dmso nmp dmac solvent compared to membrane fabricated by xie et al 42 using rhodiasolv polarclean solvent xie et al 101 also observed that average pore sizes of the membrane decreases in mixed solvent and were found to be 23 nm compared to nmp i e 27 nm 4 3 effect of evaporation time the evaporation time before membrane precipitation influences the membrane morphology and performance mainly when amphiphilic copolymer blended membrane is synthesized using the nips method 108 109 wu et al 29 investigate the effect of evaporation time during casting of pvc pvc g pegma membrane it is observed that membrane hydrophilicity increases with solvent evaporation time due to the enrichment of hydrophilic pegma segments on the pvc based membrane surface membrane with a suppressed macro voids structure is observed at long evaporation time due to fast evaporation of thf before immersion in cb as a result a tight active layer is developed on the membrane surface the water flux of pvc based membrane fabricated in thf and dmac solvent decreases from 60 l m 2 h 1 to 40 l m 2 h 1 with increased evaporation time before membrane precipitation from 0 s to 80s 110 an increase in evaporation time increases the phase inversion time in the cb in other words the pvc concentration on the top layer of the membrane film rises due to the loss of volatile thf which slows down the diffusion of water in membrane film during the phase separation process due to the high viscosity of the top layer of the membrane film hence membranes with a dense top layer with suppressed microvoids are formed and flux reduces effect of evaporation time on mechanical properties was also carried out and found that tensile strength increased dramatically with increasing evaporation time for fabricated membranes it is also noticed that the thickness of the final membrane reduces after the phase inversion process with more evaporation time due to the change of the porous layer into a dense layer 4 4 effect of pvc membrane thickness as far as the membrane performance i e flux and rejection is concerned pvc membrane thickness plays an important role increasing membrane thickness makes more resistance for water to pass through the membranes consequently reducing the water flux while phase inversion time increases with the increases in membrane thickness due to more pvc in the cs contacting with non solvent and a denser membrane with a thick skin layer is obtained which helps to increase the rejection of solute several studies have been conducted to examine the effect of pvc membrane thickness on the performance of membranes 92 110 ahmad et al 92 investigated the impact of varying membrane thickness i e 100 to 300 μm on the performance of pvc based membranes they reported that increasing membrane thickness reduces water flux from 225 l m 2 h 1 to 140 l m 2 h 1 whereas the oil rejection improves at relatively high membrane thickness the same effect of membrane thickness on the flux is also observed by other researchers 110 fig 6a shows the variation of water flux with varying membrane thicknesses of 100 to 300 μm and observed a clear trend towards lower water flux as the membrane thickness increases due to more resistance for water to pass through the membranes 110 in addition phase inversion time increases with increasing membrane thickness due to more pvc in the cs contacting with non solvent resulting increasing phase inversion time fig 6b mechanical properties of pvc based membranes were also influenced by their thickness and membrane with improved mechanical strength was obtained with increased membrane thickness 4 5 effect of coagulation bath medium and its temperature adding additives in the cs decreases the thermodynamic stability of the cs leading to fast diffusion of solvent from casting film into the non solvent and a porous membrane with macro voids is observed on the other hand adding additives in the cs increases its viscosity resulting in the precipitation rate and a sponge like membrane is expected hence the final morphology of pvc based membrane will depend on the dominance of thermodynamic and kinetic properties in this regard controlling the demixing rate by changing non solvent cb is a potential way to improve membrane morphology and performance porous structures of membranes are strongly influenced by the nature of non solvent used in the cb polymer affinity and solvent miscibility with non solvent influenced demixing rate as a result the membrane precipitation path changes 15 111 in the cb distilled water is usually employed as a non solvent to prepare membranes 27 42 98 110 by altering the non solvent composition in the cb one can adjust the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent in this regard ethanol 112 inorganic salts like kcl nacl nh4cl mgcl2 and cacl2 30 53 57 78 92 sodium hydroxide 51 113 and potassium hydroxide 30 are also used as non solvent in the cb to improve the demixing process to advance the pvc based membrane morphology fang et al 112 fabricate pmmag peg blended pvc membranes in different cb like water and ethanol and evaluate the effect of nano solvent on the performance of the membrane the result demonstrates that the flory huggins interaction parameter of pvc ethanol is very low compared to pvc water due to the comparable value of solubility parameter of ethanol i e 26 6 mpa1 2 and pvc 19 5 mpa1 2 consequently promoting a fast demixing hence membrane prepared in water cb has high flux and rejection to bovine serum albumin bsa due to smoother surfaces with higher porosity than those formed in ethanol it is also observed that pvc pmmag peg membrane involving water cb shows 100 reversible fouling several researchers use inorganic salts in the cb to improve the performance of the pvc based membranes by controlling the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent 30 53 57 78 92 according to zhang et al cb with the almost saturated solution of nacl enhanced the performance of pvc pluronic f127 nmp membrane with a notable flux of 1405 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 53 nacl addition in the cb results in a higher demixing rate between non solvent and solvent due to a shift in the binary curve towards the pvc nmp axis i e membrane precipitates with the small amounts of non solvent consequently more porous and finger like was obtained it is also observed that the effect of nacl in the cb has dominating effect in the presence of amphipathic pluronic f127 in comparison to peg the effect of salt coagulation bath in the presence of pluronic f127 is shown in fig 7 a similar effect of different inorganic salts e g nacl kcl nh4cl cacl2 and mgcl2 in the cs on the morphology of pvc bentonite and pvc bentonite pluronic f127 based membrane in the presence of nmp and dmac solvents is also observed by ahmad et al 30 57 78 92 ahmad et al 92 enhanced pvc based membranes performance by using a salt coagulation bath to treat oil water emulsion and achieved a remarkably enhanced flux of 467 49 l m 2 h 1 in the kcl coagulation bath which is equivalent to 79 01 enhancement in pure water flux over with wcb ahmad et al 92 also observed that the surface roughness of the membrane enhanced in the presence of salt in the coagulation bath compared to wcb it is also revealed that a membrane with narrow pore size distribution is observed when salt is used in the coagulation bath based on the wenzel theory 114 water droplets are efficiently trapped on the rough membrane surface due to the capillary effect on a nanostructure membrane surface higher surface roughness with narrow pore size distribution usually induces an additional suction pressure which reduces the contact angle consequently reduces the fouling tendency of the membrane surface fig 8 shows the effect of water and an aqueous solution of kcl as non solvent on the morphology of the pvc bentonite membrane 92 ahmad et al conducted cloud point experiments and obtained a binodal curve in the ternary phase diagram that has shifted to the pvc solvent axis in the presence of bentonite additive 92 the binodal curve using salt coagulation baths is closer to the polymer solvent axis than the water coagulation bath fig 9 with a salt content in the coagulation bath a lesser amount of non solvent is necessary to cause phase separation i e pvc flocculation due to a decrease in thermodynamic stability of the system however it is noted that in the presence of bentonite and pluronic f127 the best performing membrane was obtained in kcl cb irrespective of the solvent type this result suggests that salt solutions are stronger non solvents than water in both solvents the thickness of the membrane increases in all salt induced cb and membrane with maximum thickness is obtained in cacl2 cb in order words swelling of the membrane is enhanced with salt solubility and follows the following order cacl2 mgcl2 nh4cl kcl nacl 92 alkali based cb was also used to improve the performance of pan blended pvc membranes 30 51 113 in an alkali environment the nitrile group of pan can be transformed into the hydrophilic amide or carboxyl group using alkaline hydrolysis and the membrane surface becomes hydrophilic consequently a membrane with improved performance and antifouling properties was observed a detailed change in dynamic water contact angle of the synthesized membranes using wcb salt coagulation bath scb alkali induced water coagulation bath aiwcb and alkali induced salt coagulation bath aiscb are shown in fig 10 it is also noted that the membrane morphology does not change in the presence of an alkali coagulation bath 51 the effect of coagulation bath temperature also plays an important role in controlling the membrane morphology and surface pore size 96 in this regard farahani et al 93 examine the consequence of varying coagulation bath temperature on the morphology and performance of pvc based membranes farahani et al revealed that increasing the coagulation bath temperature from 5 to 45 c results in membrane with increased surface pores size in addition the morphology of the membrane changes from macro voids to fully developed finger like pores with an increase in coagulation bath temperature and achieved a remarkably enhanced flux of 165 l m 2 h 1 at 45 c which is equivalent to 35 enhancement in pure water flux at 5 c coagulation bath temperature wenjuan et al 115 synthesized pvc copolymer membrane in varying coagulation bath temperatures i e 5 to 25 c they found that pure water flux of membrane increased from 77 8 to 103 8 ml cm 2 h 1 with an increase in coagulation bath temperature due to improved membrane morphology 4 6 relative humidity the relative humidity is also an important synthesis parameter to influence the membrane performance 96 wenjuan et al 115 investigated the effect of relative humidity on pvc copolymer membrane performance and found that pure water flux of membrane increase from 70 7 to 154 1 ml cm 2 h 1 with an increase in relative humidity from 30 to 70 due to a more porous membrane structure it was also noted that there is no significant change in the retention of bsa solution varied from 91 9 to 90 7 due to low variation in the membrane pore size 105 to 107 nm 4 7 bore solutions flow rate bore solutions flow rate is also an important parameter to control the membrane morphology for hollow fiber membranes alobaidy et al 116 investigate the effect of various flow rates i e 2 6 3 6 4 5 7 9 11 and 13 ml min 1 on the morphology and performance of pvc dmac hollow fiber membrane they observed that the height of the nodules is reduced with increasing bore flow rate due to a decrease in the pore size at the inner surface the mean pore size of the hollow fibers is reduced from 146 27 to 104 7 nm when the bore flow rate changes from 2 6 to 13 ml min 1 4 8 air gap lengths air gap length can profoundly affect the ultimate performances of hollow fiber membranes membrane with suppressed macro voids structure can be obtained with shorter air gap length due to a faster stretching of the nascent hollow fiber 117 khayet et al 118 fabricated pvc peg hollow fiber membranes dry wet and wet wet spinning techniques and examined the effect of different air gap lengths on the performance and structure of the membrane they found that both the diameters outer and inner of the pvc peg hollow fiber membranes decrease with an increase in the air gap distance due to the gravitational force effect it was also observed that the pore size of the synthesized membrane increases with an increase in air gap lengths consequently enhancing the pure water flux on the other hand a reduced separation efficiency was observed at increased air gap lengths due to large pore size 4 9 casting speed morphology of the fabricated pvc based membrane may also be controlled by regulating the casting speed the exposure time of casting film before contact to non solvent in the coagulation bath was changed by changing casting machine speed and membrane with dense layer was obtained 119 ahmad et al 23 synthesized pvc dmac bentonite membrane to enhance the pvc based ufm performance for oily wastewater treatment the viscoelastic properties of cs were used to determine the optimal casting speed and were 0 71 cm s 1 it was also revealed that the casting speed also helps to control the special orientation of bentonite platelets in the membrane and enhances the membrane performance pure water flux 186 l m 2 h 1 and oil rejection 97 due to the uniform dispersion of bentonite in the membrane matrix 4 10 type of additives membrane synthesis using the cs having polymeric and inorganic additives has significantly better performance sections 5 2 and 5 3 provide detailed explanations of how different additives affect membrane performance 5 hydrophilic modification of pvc membrane the fouling of pvc membranes is the primary barrier to the broader application of pvc based membranes researchers have found that membranes can be made more foul resistant by increasing their hydrophilicity 20 24 to overcome polymer membrane fouling increasing membrane hydrophilicity might be an appropriate strategy in this regard various methods like surface grafting 71 120 surface coating 72 73 and blending 30 110 121 have been adopted to advance the membrane hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties 5 1 surface modification of pvc membrane the surface of pvc membrane can be modified effectively to enhance their performance for wastewater treatment using several surface modification techniques 71 74 furthermore the pvc membrane also provided some fouling resistance properties because of a layer of hydrophilic material forming on its surface which prevented foulant present in wastewater from interacting with the membrane surface it is possible to modify the surface of the pvc membrane using physical and chemical modification in a physical surface modification hydrophilic modifiers exist on the surface of pvc membrane interacted via physical interaction without changing the chemical composition of pvc membrane two ways can accomplish it i membrane surfaces are directly coated or deposited with hydrophilic organic materials further treatment is required occasionally and ii initially a solution containing chemically active monomers is soaked or coated onto the pvc membrane a crosslinking or polymerization reaction immobilizes the monomers onto the membrane surface without the participation of the pvc membrane however the application of surface modification technique for pvc based membranes is limited 5 1 1 surface coating coating the pvc membrane surface with a hydrophilic thin layer is the simplest way to improve its surface hydrophilicity in this regard chapman et al 73 cheng et al 122 and hosseini et al 72 123 modified pvc based membrane by surface coating and reported enhanced membrane performance with improved surface hydrophilicity by using solvent nonsolvent coating without the use of low surface energy compounds li et al developed a new simple method to achieve a super hydrophobic pvc membrane surface with a water contact angle of 4 8 124 when exposed to acid alkali and salt solutions the pvc film is nearly or still retaining its superhydrophobicity the hydrophobic pvc surfaces showed a lotus like structure with nano and micro papillae as compared to smooth pvc surfaces cheng et al 122 modify pvc based uf membranes using silica sol in the cb during the nips process pvc membrane structure changed from a cavity like shape to a finger like shape as silica sol concentration increased in cb in addition hydrophilicity and permeability of modified pvc membrane are also enhanced however membrane pores become blocked and the coating layer is easily washed out over time additionally the surface coating requires an extra step to modify the surface of the membrane increasing membrane manufacturing costs the coated layer could be eluted during filtration and cleaning operation due to the comparatively weak between coated layer and pvc membrane 5 1 2 surface grafting as discussed earlier the use of hydrophilic polymers for surface coating successfully improved the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane the disadvantage of this approach is that there is an increase in permeate resistance and membrane pores become blocked as a result causing a reduction in water flux especially if the pvc membranes have smaller pores a hydrophilic coating on the modified membrane may delaminate in the long term process due to relatively weak interaction between the pvc membrane and surface coated layer leading to the loss of hydrophilicity some researchers have also focused their attention on chemically modifying pvc membranes 84 88 92 to overcome these problems the pvc membrane surface is chemically modified with hydrophilic additives through covalent bonding interaction in the procedure pvc chains are first activated with a chemical reaction or high energy radiation and then hydrophilic additives are grafted on the pvc surface hence membrane surface characteristics tend to improve in this situation while membrane bulk is not significantly affected furthermore covalent attachments offer long term chemical stability of membranes compared to physical surface coating 125 by controlling the grafting reaction the characteristics of the pvc membrane can be altered even a small number of hydrophilic groups such as cooh oh is sufficient to improve their hydrophilicity and performance if they were situated on the walls of the pores in spite of the fact that grafting reduces membrane fouling grafting requires extra steps to modify the surface of the prepared membranes in this regard pegma and zwitterionic monomers 2 methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine mpc and 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl dimethyl 3 sulfopropyl ammonium hydroxide medsah were studied as grafting chains on pvc membrane surfaces to enhance the membrane antifouling property when pegma was grafted on the membrane surface fouling was reduced more effectively than when zwitterionic were grafted 71 vigo et al 126 improved membrane hydrophilicity and performance by glow discharge grafting of poly acrylic acid on the pvc membrane surface babu and gaikar observed a slight reduction in fouling characteristics of pvc membranes that had been grafted with acrylic acid 127 despite this liu et al found that acrylic acid grafted pvc membranes had higher water permeability i e 187 l m 2 h 1 and antifouling characteristics than pvc membranes i e 107 9 l m 2 h 1 120 the performance of pvc membrane was also improved by grafting n vinyl 2 pyrrolidinone using uv aided graft polymerization on the membrane surface resulting surface with increased surface hydrophilicity and reduced absorption fouling 128 they observed a sharp decrease in the grafted pvc membrane fouling combined with cross pulsing and membrane surface modification ahn et al use one step atrp method to modify pvc with acrylated oligopolyethylene glycol 129 in another study by using atom transfer radical polymerization pvc membranes were hydrophilically modified with poly oxyethylenemethacrylate poem 130 fahmy et al 74 grafted polystyrene on the pvc membrane surface to achieve a super hydrophilic membrane surface the chemical treatment of pvc membrane using plasma o2 treatment followed by sulfonation and amination processes are shown in fig 11 the contact angle of the atmospheric o2 plasma treated pvc membrane was reduced to 10 whereas the contact angle of untreated pristine pvc was found to be 54 however the main disadvantage of surface grafting is that it requires an extra step to modify the surface of the prepared membrane increasing membrane manufacturing costs 5 2 blending modification of pvc membrane the effectiveness of grafting hydrophilic monomers on membrane surfaces by chemical modification e g grafting hydrophilic monomers on the surface of the membrane has been tested many times still as a whole the results have not been satisfactory for those attempting to reduce membrane fouling blending modification advances have extended the range of applications for membrane technologies to treat water and wastewater more efficiently numerous research communities have recently reported the beneficial effects of blending modification of membranes on reducing membrane fouling 23 84 the most common and cheapest method of improving fouling resistance is to blend hydrophilic polymer or inorganic additives in pvc induced cs it is a one step process as additives and membranes are not treated prior to or after blending modification as required for grafting and surface coating techniques in blending modification of pvc membrane antifouling properties and membrane performance enhance due to enhanced hydrophilicity of membrane surface and internal pores reduced thermodynamic stability is observed for the additive blended cs system which increases the exchange of non solvent and solvent and a porous and finger like structure membrane is obtained 131 on the other hand adding additives in the cs increases its viscosity which results in the precipitation rate and a sponge like membrane is expected 131 as a result developing a better trade off between kinetics and thermodynamics of membrane synthesis can manipulate membrane morphology however leaching out of blending additives from the membrane during membrane synthesis and filtration operation reduces the membrane performance 5 2 1 hydrophilic polymer hydrophilic polymer additives e g polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 28 56 132 and polyethylene glycol peg 40 110 121 are frequently used to blend with pvc to enhance the membrane performance moreover these additives can control the thermodynamics and kinetics property during membrane precipitation to control the morphology pore size and distribution 110 adding additives in the cs decreases the thermodynamic stability of the cs leading to fast diffusion of solvent from casting film into the non solvent and a porous membrane with macro voids is observed 133 furthermore polymer additives in the cs also enhance the hydrophilicity porosity and flux of the pvc membrane 40 110 however the mechanical strength of the membrane decreases from 4 27 mpa to 3 25 mpa due to an increase in membrane porosity 40 anti fouling properties of the membrane consisting of polymer additives also increase due to reduced adsorption of solutes present in the water onto the surface of the membrane consequently enhanced and more uniform flux i e 433 96 l m 2 h 1 is obtained compare to bare pvc membrane i e 119 67 l m 2 h 1 40 due to their water soluble properties pvp or peg play more of a pore forming role in pvc membranes modification and preparation process than their hydrophilic properties because they can be washed out during filtration operation of the membrane 48 134 a reduction in hydrophilicity and fouling resistance is expected due to leaching out of hydrophilic polymers from pvc membrane and mainly relies on the molecular weight of the polymeric additive and its affinity with the nonsolvent a significant focus has been placed on the use of peg among the above mentioned polymer additives as peg is a better pore forming agent for example bagheripour et al 110 examine the performance of pvc based membranes with varying peg concentrations 0 4 it is observed that membrane flux with 4 peg increases significantly compared to pristine membranes which is equivalent to 45 2 enhancement in pure water flux due to the formation of a membrane with macro voids structure a similar macro voids structure at high peg loading is also reported by farahani et al 93 with enhanced pure water flux of 35 compared to pristine pvc membranes roy et al found that the pore size of pvc membranes increases at high concentrations of peg in the cs 121 in addition the prepared pvc dmac peg membrane has an excellent water flux good thermostability and good mechanical strength farahani et al 93 examine the consequence of varying peg concentration 0 0 6 0 on the morphology and performance of pvc based membranes the best performing membrane was found at 4 peg and 13 pvc concentration with enhanced pure water flux due to the enhanced porosity hydrophilicity finger like structure and broad pore size distribution more addition of peg concentration i e 6 reduces membrane performance roy et al 121 reported that the addition of peg in the pvc based cs promotes a finger like structure in the membrane whereas a spongy membrane structure was observed at high peg concentration xu and xu 28 investigated the blending effect of pvp and peg with pvc and found that both the additives can improve the porosity and flux of hollow fiber pvc membranes by altering the morphology of the membrane a defect free smooth and porous pvc based membrane with excellent mechanical behavior was reported by bhran et al using pvp additive 135 these pvc pvp hybrid membranes are hydrophilic and are less prone to fouling by the adsorption of proteins 56 it is interesting to note that the addition of pvp to pvc increases the difference in their heats of fusion and melting temperatures δh suggesting more crystalline polymer blend in the presence of pvp fig 12 56 furthermore pvp acts as an antifouling agent by increasing surface hydrophilicity preventing biofouling on the surface fang et al 136 blended a novel phosphate based zwitterionic polymer methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine co poly propylene glycol methacrylate mpc ppgma with pvc to synthesize high performing membranes and found that mpc ppgma is compatible with pvc the zwitterionic segments of the mpc ppgma doped in the cs can exert good hydration properties thereby improving surface hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties of the pvc blend membranes excellent biofouling and organic fouling were also observed in the presence of mpc ppgma in the pvc membrane matrix the molecular weight of the polymer additives also has a significant impact on membrane performance and morphology cs with higher viscosity was obtained when polymeric additives with high molecular weights were added results in a dense membrane morphology with fewer macro voids in the sub layer due to slow demixing between non solvent and solvent 40 137 two ways delay demixing and influences membrane morphology firstly skin thickness and total membrane thickness increase due to delayed precipitation of the membrane secondly the pore size of the membrane reduces due to a spongy membrane 40 numerous studies have been conducted on the effect of molecular weight of polymeric additives on membrane structure and transport characteristics 40 according to roy et al 40 a rise in the molecular weight of peg would cause an increase in membrane porosity with a denser structure hence peg and pvp can be considered effective polymeric additives to improve the hydrophilicity morphology and fouling resistivity properties of the pvc based membranes however these polymeric additives tend to leached out from the polymer matrix during filtration operation and do not have any significant contribution to the improvement in the thermal chemical and mechanical properties of the membrane 138 an overview of polymer blending for membrane modification based on pvc is provided in table 5 5 2 2 amphiphilic copolymers most hydrophilic polymers are incompatible with pvc making blending modification very challenging however this problem may be solved by blending a copolymer that has amphiphilic properties in addition amphiphilic copolymer also reduces the leaching out effect from the membrane during membrane synthesis and filtration operation as experienced in blending the hydrophilic polymer 53 as amphiphilic polymers possess both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components they are much effective than hydrophilic copolymers to improve membrane performance during the membrane precipitation in the cb at the polymer water interface the hydrophilic components of amphiphilic polymers segregate without leaching out of the membrane matrix due to the interfacial energy and then build up a hydrophilic fouling resistant layer on the surface of the membrane as well as inside the pores after the membrane materials solidify in one step amphiphilic copolymer blending both of these objectives can be achieved firstly phase inversion allows hydrophobic copolymers to be entrapped in the membrane matrix to reduce membrane fouling and leaching tendency secondly hydrophilic copolymers are to be accumulated on the surface of the membrane to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface 139 pvc membranes made of amphiphilic copolymer have the unique advantage of self organization modification and phase inversion fabrication polymerization of two or more monomers results in the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers a general radical polymerization atom transfer radical polymerization atrp thermal graft copolymerization and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization raft 29 41 140 can usually be employed to synthesize amphiphilic copolymers amphiphilic copolymers of different structures i e comb like triblock or hyperbranched star have been received great consideration in recent years to synthesize hydrophilic pvc membranes including pluronic f 127 27 53 pvc g pegma 29 41 42 101 poly vinyl chloride co poly ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate poly vc co pegma copolymer 134 141 pes g pegma 20 pmma g peg 112 pvc g poly 3 sulfopropyl methacrylate 142 and poly methyl methacrylate b methacrylic acid p mma b maa 143 an overview of amphiphilic copolymer blending for membrane modification based on pvc is provided in table 5 superior antifouling properties with enhanced performance of pvc based membrane can be achieved by using commercial pluronic f127 27 53 54 sulfonated polysulfone spsf 76 and pvc poly vc co pegma 134 141 in the cs due to their ability to form a hydration layer an amphiphilic copolymer containing peg chains exhibits improved hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties in the preparation of pvc based antifouling membranes pluronic f127 has excellent potential as a new additive due to its low cost a triblock copolymer of pluronic f127 comprises a hydrophobic block of polypropylene oxide ppo at the center and two hydrophilic blocks of polyethylene oxide peo on either side liu et al 27 determined the consequence of varying amounts of pluronic f127 i e 0 10 wt on the membrane performance and found that hydrophilicity of membrane surface continuously increases up to10 wt due to an upsurge in oxygen content on the membrane surface however the optimal concentration of pluronic f127 was 8 0 wt up to which flux pore size and the pore density increase however further addition of pluronic f127 led to a decrease in the flux due to reduced pore size and the pore density it is noted that the performance of the pluronic f127 composite membrane was significantly enhanced by changing coagulation bath composition 53 57 78 zhang et al 53 determined the effect of salt cb on pluronic f127 blended pvc based membrane a remarkably enhanced water flux i e 1405 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was obtained due to enhance membrane hydrophilicity and pore density a similar observation is also reported by ahmad et al 57 78 it is also noted that mechanical properties of pluronic f127 blended pvc based membrane deteriorate due to an increase in microvoids and inherent reduced mechanical properties of pf127 57 zhou et al 134 synthesize pvc poly vc co pegma membranes having varying pegma amounts the outcome of change in the pegma percentage on membrane antifouling properties was studied and found that almost fouling free membrane can be produced with 9 8 pegma in poly vc co pegma however fouling free membrane possess very poor mechanical strengths making it not suitable for practical applications in another study zhou et al 141 improved membrane mechanical strength by varying pvc and poly vc co pegma with a pegma of 9 8 blend ratios in addition to commercial amphiphilic copolymers various lab synthesized amphiphilic polymers are also used to advance the performance of pvc based membranes pmma g peg copolymer comb like structure is obtained from poly ethylene glycol methacrylate and methyl methacrylate the pvc pmma g pegma blend system is stable because pmma and pvc have outstanding compatibility during the preparation and use of doping solutions fang et al 112 fabricate pmmag peg blended pvc membranes in different cb like water and ethanol and determine the effect of nano solvent on the membrane performance the result demonstrates that hydrophilicity of pvc membrane increased significantly in the presence of pmmag peg and 100 reversible fouling was achieved wu et al 41 fabricate pvc based membrane by blending amphiphilic pvc g pegma and found that increasing pvc g pegma in the cs increases hydrophilicity and pure water flux whereas pore density and pore size of membrane surface decreased an enhanced sa rejection i e 90 and flux recovery ratio i e frr 89 than the pure pvc membrane was obtained in the presence of pvc g pegma in the membrane matrix moreover a similar observation was also reported in wu et al 29 and xie et al 42 101 pvc pes g pegma blend membranes fabricated by jiang et al exhibits stronger hydrophilicity high flux and more antifouling properties than pure pvc membranes 20 it is also observed that synthesized pes g pegma is more compatible with pvc than pvc pes blending system pvc based copolymers are another amphiphilic copolymer made when pvc is used directly as the macroinitiator 140 according to fig 13 there are only two steps in the pvc g pmaa synthesis procedure a tert butyl methacrylate tbma graft is first applied to pvc via the atrp process and then the pvc g ptbma is hydrolyzed pmaa chains were found to be segregated towards the surface of membranes and they possessed negative charges improved membrane hydrophilicity and performance with good resistance to bsa have been reported in the presence of pvc g pmaa moreover pvc p mma b maa membranes 143 with good resistance to protein have been reported 5 2 3 inorganic nanoparticles a polymeric additive has certain limitations including limited mechanical chemical and thermal resistance and is prone to leaching out 138 as the 1980s progressed a new idea of hybrid membranes appeared that contained inorganic additives in the membrane matrix 148 149 various nanoparticles like alumina al2o3 84 150 silver ag 151 hydrous manganese oxide hmo 35 152 anatase titania ant 35 halloysite nanotubes hnts 132 titanium dioxide tio2 83 151 153 iron oxide fe3o4 88 145 zinc oxide zno 144 154 155 silica sio2 147 156 157 bentonite 19 92 graphene oxide go 158 159 are reported in the literature to improve the fouling resistance properties of pvc based membranes the addition of inorganic nanoparticles also enhances thermal stability which also contributes to strengthening the mechanical properties of the membrane 83 150 the viscosity of the cs increases with increasing inorganic nanoparticles concentration which reduces the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent consequently a membrane with low porosity and sponge structure is obtained 42 57 the effect of inorganic nanoparticles concentration on the viscosity of cs dominates in the presence of sio2 compared to other metal oxides such as al2o3 zno and tio2 as shown in fig 14 160 however the agglomeration of inorganic nanoparticles at high concentrations hinders membranes limiting their application table 6 summarizes the inorganic nanoparticles blending for the modification of pvc based membrane alumina based nanoparticles have been one of the most stable inorganic additives used in pvc membrane fabrication for increasing membrane performance the properties of alumina based nanoparticles are similar to those of other metal oxide nanoparticles and might enhance the performance of membranes fabricated with them the hydrophilicity of membrane increases due to presence of oh groups on the surface of hydrophilic alumina based nanoparticles 150 161 the interactions between alumina blended pvc membrane surface and hydrophobic foulant decreases which increases membrane antifouling properties and rejection aside from its affordability it is also nontoxic highly abrasive and highly resistant 165 alumina nanoparticles should be added carefully to pvc membranes since too much addition could lead to a loss of membrane strength and performance due to the aggregation of nanoparticles 84 150 in this regard bagheripour et al 84 fabricate pvc based membranes via the phase separation method using sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and aluminum oxide al2o3 as an additive and determine the effect of additives on the physicochemical properties of the pvc based membranes the presence of sds forms a dense top layer on the membrane surface that results in an enhanced rejection thus a reduced flux on the other hand more porous with big pore size is obtained in the presence of al2o3 in the cs which leads to enhancement in flux and maximum flux of 79 61 l m 2 h 1 with reduced rejection al2o3 nanoparticles display high hydrophilicity and surface area also leading to increased pure water and permeability flux etemadi and qazvini 150 enhance pvc based uf membrane performance by increasing membrane hydrophilicity using al2o3 it is also observed that the addition of al2o3 in the membrane matrix significantly enhances its porosity and antifouling properties however a membrane with a reduced tensile strength was observed in the presence of al2o3 due to an increase in porosity a similar effect of al2o3 on the membrane morphology and performance for the separation of activated sludge 161 it is interesting to note that the addition of al2o3 increases the mechanical properties like tensile strength and elongation at break of al2o3 blended pvc membrane up to 3 wt which contradicts other researchers observations 150 however it is also reported that further addition of al2o3 leads to a reduction in mechanical strength of the membrane due to the agglomeration of al2o3 at high loading farjami et al 163 increased the performance of the pvc based membrane with the mixing of boehmite particles boehmite is a particle of aluminum oxide hydroxide γ alooh including hydroxyl groups on its surface the boehmite nanoparticles have an orthorhombic structure with extra hydroxyl groups on their surfaces nanoparticles of boehmite consist of two sheets of octahedral chains with aluminum ions at their centers 166 it is reported that using 0 75 wt boehmite incorporated membrane increase in water flux from 422 6 to 7014 l m 2 h 1 with bsa rejection 98 due to their stable porous structure with uniform pore size silica can provide high surface area and porosity to mixed matrix membranes improving the membrane s permeability silica nanoparticles have been studied extensively and proven an effective inorganic additive due to their chemical and thermal stability large surface areas fine suspension in aqueous solution and environmental inertness 156 157 pvc membrane with sio2 nanoparticles also showed superior antifouling performance and removal efficiency using municipal wastewater than bare membranes due to enhanced membrane hydrophilicity 157 it is also reported that cs with a nano sio2 3 wt increased viscosities a negative degassed effect and poor film forming performance 157 saberi et al 167 investigate the effect of varying sio2 loading on the performance of pvc sio2 hollow fiber membranes it is reported the sio2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the membrane matrix and enhanced hydrophilicity of the membrane surface tio2 has been emerging as a leading additive for the production of nano composites pvc based membranes due to the hydrophilic nature and photocatalytic of tio2 nanomaterials rabiee et al 153 found that tio2 incorporated into the polymer matrix boosted water flux hydrophilicity and fouling resistance of emulsion pvc membranes an sem image reveals that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles resulted in macro voids instead of finger like structures and membrane structure returned to elongated finger like pores at tio2 concentration 1 wt fig 15a and b with tio2 addition surface hydrophilicity of pvc based membrane improved dramatically enhancing water flux and flux recovery remarkably the effect of tio2 membrane structure pure water flux and rejection are shown in fig 15 according to behboudi et al 83 increased tio2 nanoparticles in pvc membrane resulted in lower fouling ratios increasing water flux due to increased membrane hydrophilicity it is also noted that the thermal stability and mechanical strength of pvc based membranes improved in the existence of tio2 the modification of porous membranes using silver ag has also been a significant area of research in the last several decades due to its excellent chemical stability anti pollution capacity and antibacterial property aside from its useful properties one of the challenges of silver nanoparticles is their leaching tendency from membrane surfaces the leaching of silver nanoparticles reduces the membrane performance in addition drinking water obtained from wastewater treatment desalination processes can be polluted by the leaching of silver nanoparticles and pose a threat to marine life and human beings 168 a nanocomposite blend of silver and other nanoparticles is developed to address this issue immobilizing silver nanoparticles on membrane surfaces and improving antibacterial properties behboudi et al 162 modified silver nanoparticles using silica by stöber method and synthesized pvc based membrane by blending modified silver nanoparticles using the wet spinning method and determine the consequence of unmodified and modified silver nanoparticles on the properties and performance of pvc based membranes it is reported that membrane properties and performance significantly improve in the presence of modified silver nanoparticles compared to unmodified silver nanoparticles it was found that both unmodified and modified silver nanoparticles improved the tensile strength of the membrane due to the reinforcement effect of silver nanoparticles in the membrane matrix however the result is dominating in the presence of modified silver nanoparticles haghighat et al 151 synthesized pvc based membrane via co precipitation process using ag and tio2 as a nanoparticle resulting in nanohybrid membrane with enhanced membrane performance it is also reported that the leaching tendency of silver from the membrane matrix was insignificant it could be decided that the nanoparticle was stable after thirty days since the leaching rate remained constant after twenty days and no further leaching occurred after thirty days the results also revealed that biofouling resistance and antibacterial activity of pvc ag tio2 membranes increases by using iron oxide nanoparticles foulant adsorption and attachment on the membrane surface or inner structure can be reduced consequently the fouling resistance property of the membrane increases gholami et al 145 reported that the addition of fe3o4 increases the porosity and fouling resistance properties of pvc based membranes however water flux reached its maximum at 0 1 wt loading of fe3o4 and further addition of fe3o4 causes channel blockage due to agglomeration leads to a reduction in flux a fe3o4 nanocomposite membrane was significantly better at salt rejection than a bare membrane with a rejection rate of 46 4 at 0 1 wt 228 5 higher than bare pvc membranes a pvc based membrane with 1 0 wt fe3o4 had 52 lower salt rejection than a membrane with 0 1 wt fe3o4 at high fe3o4 concentration the lower salt rejection was attributed to an increased effective surface area associated with the accumulation and agglomeration of fe3o4 nanoparticles in another study fe2o3 nanoparticles incorporated pvc based membranes displayed decreased roughness and improved hydrophilicity as indicated by a 22 reduction of the water contact angle at 1 0 wt compared to the bare membrane 88 in addition the mechanical strength of fe2o3 blended pvc membranes also increases zinc oxide nanoparticles possess a similar antimicrobial function as titanium oxide nanoparticles however they are less expensive and more stable zno nanoparticles are gaining popularity in membrane technology due to their anti corrosive antifungal and antimicrobial properties various studies have demonstrated enhanced antifouling properties hydrophilicity porosity and high permeability with zno in pvc based membranes 144 154 155 rabiee et al 155 improve pvc membrane performance by blending zno nanoparticles based on the results of this study the pure water flux of pvc zno membranes increased with a zno addition up to 3 wt which was the optimal concentration of zno nanoparticles furthermore the frr of nanocomposite membranes improved from 69 to above 90 when zno was added at 3 0 wt and further addition of zno reduces the membrane performance due to aggregation of zno nanoparticles another study found that zno nanoparticles added at a concentration of 2 wt resulted in particles agglomerating 95 the addition of 0 1 g of zno nanoparticles remarkably improved the pure water flux and the mean roughness by 315 and 140 respectively resulting in smaller mean pore size with narrower pore distribution 144 it was also observed that cake layer thickness on the pvc based membrane surface was reduced from 52 8 to 10 42 μm with increasing zinc oxide content up to 0 3 g due to the anti biofouling effect of zinc oxide consequently an average 500 long term improved membranes life was observed compared to the neat pvc membranes fig 16 144 due to their high surfaces and structural characteristics hydrous metal oxides such as ferric oxide magnesium oxide and manganese oxide are also gaining attention as an additive to increase membrane performance hydrous manganese oxide hmo nanoparticles among the various types of hydrous metal oxides that have been studied hmo showed the best decontamination efficiency for toxic heavy metals because of their high adsorption capacities 35 carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes cnts or graphene have recently received considerable attention as a promising additive for membrane modification for instance hybrid membranes incorporating cnts and organic materials have a higher water flux than pristine membranes 164 169 hosseini 170 studied the effect of multiwall carbon nanotube mwcnt nanocomposite concentration on membrane electrochemical characteristics it was revealed that selectivity of pvc mwcnt membranes was enhanced slightly in bi valent ionic up to 8 wt mwcnt concentration and further addition of mwcnt reduce the selectivity of the membrane an increased pore density i e number of pores on the surface of membranes with reduced pore size was observed in the presence of mwcnt by masoumi et al 171 the hydrophilicity tensile strength pure water flux and humic acid rejection of the pvc mwcnt membrane increased with increasing the content of mwcnt up to 0 3 wt from 88 60 to 70 20 4 30 to 6 17 mpa 244 8 to 484 7 l m 2 h 1 and 62 40 to 96 88 respectively and then decreased due to the agglomeration of nanotubes 171 the increased range of optimal dosage of the cnt increases membrane production cost and as a result it raises serious concerns for its membrane modification practices graphene derivatives are popular for wastewater separation due to their extraordinary chemical stability excellent physical characteristics and unique two dimensional structure graphene oxide go is a derivative sp2 hybridized of graphene intercalated with different oxygen rich functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy groups 172 graphene oxide has amphiphilic properties due to oxygen functional groups at the edges and basal plane as a result of the hydrophilicity imparted by these functional groups go sheets have a high surface area and are highly effective as additives in pvc based membranes several novel methods for preparing go at low cost have been developed making it more competitive and accessible than cnt 159 173 currently minimal literature is available that discusses the modification of pvc based membranes by blending go zhao et al 159 modify pvc membrane with go via phase inversion method to improve its hydrophilicity and mechanical properties it was reported that the pvc go hybrid membranes exhibit improved hydrophilicity water flux and mechanical properties the pure water flux of the pvc go membrane increased from 232 6 to 430 0 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the tensile strength increased from 231 3 to 305 3 cn in the presence of 0 1 wt go jhaveri et al 158 blended go tio2 nanosheets in the cs to enhance the performance of pvc membrane in terms of permeability solute rejection and anti fouling behavior it was reported that pure water flux of pvc go tio2 membrane increased from 70 to 250 l m 2 h 1 bar with increased humic acid rejection from 98 to 99 5 due to enhanced membrane hydrophilicity and porosity the enhancement in the properties of the go hybrid pvc membranes is mainly attributed to the strong hydrophilicity of functional groups on the go surface demonstrating that go has a promising candidate for modification of pvc ultrafiltration membranes in wastewater treatment the metal oxide nanoparticles referred to above are promising candidates for enhancing the performance of pvc membrane but their expense has encouraged researchers to explore other approaches the low cost bentonite nanoclay widely used for drilling fluid has a high cation exchange capacity making it a potential additive for the performance enhancement of pvc membranes an enhanced flux and rejection results from the uniform dispersion of bentonite in the cs 23 membrane with finger like structure enhanced membrane porosity hydrophilicity and pore density was observed in the presence of bentonite additive in the pvc based membrane matrix 23 57 92 it is also reported that a more sponge structure membrane was obtained at higher bentonite loading due to a rise in the viscosity of the cs which slowed down the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent as shown in fig 17 48 table 7 lists the intrinsic properties and structural effects of inorganic nanoparticles used to fabric pvc based membranes the hydrophilicity and properties such as mechanical chemical and thermal resistance of the membrane may be enhanced in the presence of inorganic nanoparticles in the cs however a critical loading and homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles are essential to avoid agglomeration which reduces membrane performance by reducing the effective surface area to flow 174 5 3 second polymer component blending of a second polymer like pan 30 67 ca 35 145 176 177 glycerol 35 cpvc 54 56 psr 68 pvf 70 pc 69 86 with pvc is a very interesting way of improving the performance of pvc based membranes and detail are shown in table 8 combining pvc with the second polymer can produce a new material with diverse properties and economic benefits by using a polymer blend system membrane hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity can be modified as well and polymer blended pvc based membranes perform better than unblended membranes the main restriction in polymer blending is that most polymer pairs are somewhat incompatible i e immiscible polymers miscible with pvc must be chemically very similar they should have low entropy of mixing δhm and heat of mixing specific interactions contribute to the miscibility of many of the most common and practical miscible polymers e g electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding of blended polymers for instance a weak hydrogen bond is suggested between oxygen and halogen containing polymers 56 in this regard excellent properties of pan include hydrophilicity repellency of oil fat and grease resistance to oxidation and hydrolysis with good thermal and mechanical stability make it suitable to be used as an additive for the development in pvc based membranes however the blended second polymer must be compatible with pvc to achieve a homogeneous cs the solubility parameter is one of the standard methods used to determine the compatibility of blend polymers using the entropy of mixing δhm and minimum δhm indicates better compatibility of the two polymers 67 a higher δhm value of pvc pan blend indicates partly incompatible systems however pvc pan should be miscible in a common polar solvent because both are polar polymers 67 mei et al 113 determined the miscibility of pvc pan blend using viscosity measurements and found blends are immiscible for pan contents 20 wt or 80 wt 113 researchers reported that pvc psr 68 and pvc ca 176 are not completely compatible rabiee et al 178 investigated the performance of pan blended pvc membrane fabricate in water coagulation bath and found a pure water flux of 54 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with a blending ratio of 70 30 pvc pan pakbaz and maghsoud 75 fabricate pvc pan blend membranes with various pan contents and membrane with increased porosity and hydrophilicity was obtained at higher pan loading fig 18 it is reported that the contact angle of pure pvc membrane was 71 9 and reduced to 64 4 by adding 20 wt of pan similarly the porosity of 20 wt of pan has maximum porosity of 63 7 a similar effect of pan blending with pvc is reported by several researchers 67 146 179 180 it is interesting to note that the nitrile group cn of pan can be changed into the hydrophilic amide group conh2 or carboxyl cooh using alkaline hydrolysis fig 19 51 113 in this regard mei et al 113 uses sodium hydroxide naoh solution in the cb and determine the consequence of naoh on the performance of pan blended pvc membranes it found that membrane properties i e hydrophilicity and porosity and performance i e flux protein filtration and anti fouling enhance due to hydrolysis of pan in the presence of naoh it is also observed that mechanical properties like elongation at break and tensile strength reduce in the presence of naoh due to hydrolysis of pan details of properties and performance of pvc pan sio2 membrane in the presence of varying naoh concentrations are shown in fig 20 pakbaz and maghsoud 75 used naoh solution in the cb to synthesize pvc pan membrane and found improved pure water flux of 75 6 7 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 1 4 times higher than membrane fabricates in the water coagulation bath more recently ahmad et al 30 synthesized pvc pan pluronic f127 bentonite blended super wetting membrane in aqueous koh solution to separate oilfield produced water and accomplished unusually enhanced flux of 1760 55 l m 2 h 1 permeate flux of 790 12 with oil rejection 97 0 membrane with super wetting surface and the improved mechanical property was attained due to the hydrolysis of cn functional groups of pan into coo na in the presence of koh induced cb it is also concluded that the performance of pan blended pvc membrane synergized in the presence of koh cb compared to water cb hence the performance of pvc based membrane can be enhanced by blending pan alkali cb medium in addition to pan various other second polymer components are also blended with pvc to enhance their performance in another study the antifouling properties and performance of pvc chlorinated polyvinyl chloride cpvc membrane were further enhanced by liu et al 54 it is noted that membrane water permeability further enhances after the addition of the cpvc also complete flux recovery was achieved using bsa bovine serum albumin solution 1000 ppm after washing the poly vinyl butyral pvb was introduced by peng and sui 55 as an additional polymer component with pvc to enhance membrane hydrophilicity and performance compared to pvb and pvc membranes the blended membranes showed much better water flux and hydrophilicity but protein rejection decreased slightly peng et al 55 studied the miscibilities of pvc and pvb in dmac and found that the system is partially miscible elastic properties of pvc membrane were improved by introducing co poly butadiene acrylonitrile as the second polymer by islam et al 181 pvc psr membrane exhibits improved structural morphology and mechanical properties 68 the rejection of pvc psr membrane increases from 76 2 to 98 53 with a marginal decrease in pure water permeation at 2 0 wt psr concentration in cs pc is extensively used in various applications due to its excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability when blended pvc and pc a double bond oxygen atom in the pc chains leads to a hydrophilic membrane with improved antifouling properties 69 6 optimal synthesis and operation of pvc membranes membrane design factors e g pvc to additive ration type of solvent and non solvent membrane thickness type of additive and process operating variables e g feed composition and temperature trans membrane pressure play a significant role in the separation of wastewater 42 53 160 however it is difficult and costly to study the effect of membrane performance as a function of design and operating parameters by varying one parameter at a time because many experiments are involved as well there are complex interactions between the membrane variables which cannot be determined by varying them individually in this regard optimum design of experiments may be a potential tool to establish the relationship between operating variables and or response variables with membrane performance i e permeate flux rejection and fouling resistance properties it is a quick and straightforward method as a minimum number of experiments are required to determine the individual and interaction effect of various design and operating factors however the application of experimental design tools to optimize the pvc based membrane performance is limited and very little work is reported in the literature 30 57 92 183 in this regard ahmad et al 92 employed five factor i e pvc and bentonite concentration membrane thickness feed ph and tmp response surface method rsm studies based on central composite design ccd to minimize the number of experiments for optimal performance of the pvc based membrane it is observed that maximum permeability i e 425 5 l m 2 h 1 was achieved at relatively low pvc loading and membrane thickness and high bentonite loading tmp and ph on the other hand rejection of i e 99 7 increases at low tmp and ph and higher membrane thickness and pvc loading the above results suggest a contradictory relation between flux and rejection as shown in fig 21a hence a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm is used to determine the optimal relation between flux and rejection fig 21a a decision maker may choose the suitable flux from fig 21a and b shows the value of the corresponding optimal variable a similar rsm approach is also adopted by ahmad et al 30 57 in their another study to maximize the membrane performance by considering design and operative variables like pvc loading pluronic f127 loading bentonite loading feed ph feed temperature and pan loading pluronic f127 loading bentonite loading respectively 7 commercial pvc membranes the global membrane treatment market size was estimated at 19 6 billion usd in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12 2 from 2020 to 2028 184 in this regard commercially available membranes are primarily prepared from polymeric materials like pes pan pvdf and psf whereas the application of pvc is limited compared to other polymers 185 189 however hollow fiber configuration commercially synthesized pvc based membranes are used for the purification of wastewater in this regard hongtek filtration co ltd china chiwatec water treatment technology china suzhou litree purifying technology co ltd china wuhan aqucell membrane technology co china philos co south korea are the manufacturing and supply of commercial pvc membranes it is noted that commercial application of pvc based membranes is limited for hollow fiber configuration for uf however there is a scope for pvc based membranes to use in the fabrication of flat sheet membranes for uf and nf applications table 9 summarizes the examples of commercial pvc based membranes available in the market with their characteristics 8 challenge and future outlook the main challenges during the treatment of wastewater using polymeric membranes are to synthesize low cost high performing anti fouling membranes having high flux with permitted discharge limit membrane fouling decreases the membrane lifetime and reduces the permeate flux at constant trans membrane pressure 25 26 however the high hydrophilic polymeric membrane can effectively treat wastewater with reduced membrane fouling as most wastewater is water hence the development of a cost efficient super hydrophilic polymeric membrane is required for real world application for wastewater separation a super hydrophilic membrane may exhibit maximum fouling resistance with a dynamic contact angle 10 this is achieved by advancing the surface of the membranes to reduce the water contact angle as much as possible moreover the surface morphology of the membrane also has a remarkable influence on wastewater separation 23 127 pvc membrane with a rough surface small pore size with narrow distribution and increased pore density can be fabricated by controlling the non solvent and solvent demixing rate 30 57 to develop a high efficiency membrane cost effective membrane material with great hydrophilicity must be synthesized therefore the fabrication of a low cost super hydrophilicity membrane is crucial for advancing the high efficiency membrane in the case of membrane modification especially in the existence of inorganic nanoparticles in the cs agglomeration in the membrane structure due to obstructs in forming a homogenous solution is the main problem agglomeration of additives reduces the membrane performance as it reduces the flow surface area 174 dispersion of additives in cs depends on their size and shape 190 a spherical nanoparticle with particle size 100 nm restrains both aggregation and agglomeration due to better dispersion in the cs compared to polyhedral nanoparticles 191 in terms of the economic aspect the development of pvc based membranes is carried out using expensive nanoparticles like hmo hao al2o3 and tio2 which remains an obstacle in their commercial application in addition the use of various carbon based materials like cnts and graphene in the pvc membrane for wastewater separation is limited hence the synthesis of pvc membrane with low cost hydrophilic additives using simple method is the option to produce a cost effective membrane with improved morphology and performance apart from membrane material membrane lifetime also affects the cost of the membrane by increasing membrane replacement chemical and labor costs these costs may be reduced by minimizing membrane cleaning for synthesized antifouling membranes hence the development of low cost materials is required for the polymeric ufm to be commercialized in the future in addition the surface of pvc membrane can be improved effectively for enhancing their performance for wastewater treatment using several physical and chemical surface modification techniques however the application of surface modification technique for pvc based membranes is limited improvement of both flux and rejection at the same time is difficult as they are mutually antagonistic processes 29 however by reducing the surface pore size and increasing the density of the surface pores both permeate flux and oil rejection can simultaneously be improved the above mention membrane properties may be achieved by regulating the non solvent and solvent demixing rate using different solvents and non solvent by changing solvent or non solvent in the coagulation bath the demixing rate may be controlled due to a change in the interaction of solvent and non solvent most researchers synthesized flat sheet pvc membrane and their performance was evaluated using dead end type filtration suitable to handle a small volume of wastewater this situation becomes more complex when handling larger volumes of water which occurs when laboratories are scaled up to commercial studies for the successful treatment of large volumes of wastewater it is essential that studies in the laboratory are scaled up to pilot plants and commercial plants to maintain almost identical performance reproducing laboratory results at the pilot or commercial scale is a very challenging task 9 conclusions this article focused on the treatment of wastewater generated from different industries via pvc based membrane and the development in the hydrophilic modifications of pvc based membrane was comprehensively reviewed it is concluded that pvc is an excellent membrane material for the synthesis of the membrane due to its excellent properties including low cost good thermal stability good stiffness high mechanical strength high resistance to chlorine bases and acids compared to other base polymers in terms of the pvc based membrane fabrication method nips is frequently employed the fabrication condition such as pvc concentration in the cs choice and composition of non solvent in the cb nature of solvent in the cs type of additives affected the membrane morphology and performances a major limitation of pvc based membrane application i e membrane fouling for wastewater separation has been highlighted and concluded that membrane anti fouling could be enhanced by blending different additives as well as surface modification of the membrane in this regard low cost pvc may be used as membrane material blended with additives like amphiphilic copolymers inorganic nanoparticles hydrophilic polymer additive and second polymers pvp and peg are frequently utilized as hydrophilic polymer additives at the same time silver alumina oxide zinc oxide titanium dioxide iron oxide silica dioxide hydrous manganese oxide halloysite nanotubes bentonite and graphene oxide are frequently employed for the fabrication and modification of pvc based membranes likewise amphiphilic copolymers such as pluronic f 127 pvc g pegma poly vc co pegma pes g pegma pmma g peg pvc g poly 3 sulfopropyl methacrylate and p mma b maa may be used to modify pvc based membranes blending a second polymer like pan ca glycerol cpvc psr pvf and pc with pvc is also an exciting way of improving the performance of pvc based membranes it is also concluded that the mechanical strength of the pvc based membrane also increases in the presence of an additive hence enhancing its lifetime declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13168,various industries generate a considerable volume of wastewater containing toxic contaminants arsenic dyes heavy metals perchlorate oil from multiple sectors among several polymeric materials low cost polyvinyl chloride pvc has attracted significant consideration as a membrane material due to its excellent properties such as good thermal stability good stiffness high mechanical strength high resistance to chlorine bases and acids compared to other polymers however fouling of hydrophobic pvc based membranes due to adsorption or deposition of particles macromolecules and biomolecules e g polysaccharides proteins salts colloids on the surface and pores of the membrane is a major hindrance thus to advance the performance of hydrophobic pvc based membranes the hydrophilicity i e wettability and fouling resistance properties of the membranes should be improved despite current trends it remains challenging to fabricate membranes with high flux and fouling resistance properties

wastewater treatment 1 introduction a growing population misuse of freshwater resources and water supply pollution contribute to water shortages population rich countries including india china middle east north africa are expected to experience water scarcity in the coming years 1 therefore wastewater treatment may partially fill the gap for fresh water in the upcoming years thus finding effective and economic separation techniques or improvements in the existing one enable the world to solve water scarcity and pollution concerns in this regard membrane technology has proven its potential and gained more attention among other available techniques 2 8 several significant milestones have been reached in the progress of membrane technologies since the invention of the first commercial membrane via phase inversion methodology in the 1960s today membrane technologies are used in almost every field including the energy biotechnological environment chemical and electronic sectors 9 14 however reducing permeate flux results from membrane fouling during the wastewater separation is one of the main limitations during the membrane separation process 15 wastewater separation demands membrane with increased permeability and rejection with fouling resistance properties to achieve the cost effectiveness and highest degree of energy efficiency the current generation of membranes is undergoing much development especially in antifouling properties mechanical strength and chemical resistance 11 16 17 nowadays polymer based membrane separation techniques are the most trustworthy technology used for wastewater treatment due to the smaller footprints required for installation its straightforward pore forming mechanism and relatively low costs compared to the inorganic membrane 18 19 most wastewater consists of complex components including polysaccharides proteins dissolved organic matter cations and dissolved solids 20 in the case of hydrophobic membranes these components tend to cause severe fouling fouling reduces the water flow and makes backwashing more frequent reducing membrane life besides severely decreasing the efficiency of the membranes this also increases the cost of the membranes hydrophilic membranes that have low cost are therefore required for wastewater treatment in addition they should be capable of high permeate with good separation efficiency in this regard low cost polyvinyl chloride pvc has to gain significant consideration as a membrane material for the synthesis of microfiltration mf 21 22 ultrafiltration uf 23 24 and nanofiltration nf 25 26 membranes due to its excellent properties such as good stiffness high resistance to chlorine bases and acids compared to other base polymers 27 29 compared to mf uf and nf membranes a few works are reported in the literature for pvc based reverse osmosis and forward osmosis membranes due to the low pressure resistance of the membrane material caused by the flexible polymer chains 26 moreover pvc membranes can maintain a long membrane life despite being repeatedly cleaned with various chemical agents 30 pvc membranes have been extensively used for the separation of toxic contaminants 31 arsenic 32 dyes 33 heavy metals 34 35 perchlorate 36 and oily wastewater 23 from industrial effluents in addition pvc membranes are currently being studied as possible candidates for membrane distillation and contactor applications 37 39 pvc membranes have been studied extensively since the 1980s and several studies have reported on their applications and development for the separation of wastewater 24 29 40 42 the fabrication of pvc membrane with high performance has made remarkable progress in recent years including its use in membrane distillation membrane contactors and wastewater treatment it is however challenging to synthesize high performance pvc membranes for the separation of wastewater in the literature numerous articles discuss the application of membranes for wastewater treatment in this regard a detailed review of the use of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf based membranes was conducted by otitoju et al 43 and liu et al 44 more recently fabrication techniques of pvc based membranes have been discussed by safarpour et al 45 the review article was focusing the appropriate method and processing conditions to fabricate the membranes with desired morphology and performance other than fabrication techniques several aspects also affect the performance of pvc based membranes performance hence in detail the present review article addresses the application of pvc based membrane particularly for wastewater treatment thus the present article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the progress production and challenges of pvc membranes for wastewater treatment 2 pvc as a membrane material a wide variety of polymers with relatively high costs have been studied for wastewater treatment such as pvdf 46 polyethersulfone pes 47 polysulfone psf 48 polyvinyl alcohol pval 49 cellulose acetate ca 50 polyacrylonitrile pan 51 and the details have been reviewed by zahid et al 52 pvc is relatively more hydrophobic compared to other base polymers such as psf pes and pan the hydrophobicity of polymer is often associated with their surface tensions the critical surface tensions of frequently used polymer to fabricate membrane are listed in table 1 44 hence due to its high hydrophobic nature membranes synthesized using pvc as base polymer are more prone to fouling therefore it is challenging to fabricate pvc based membranes with high flux and fouling resistance properties to separate wastewater in addition a significant part of the membrane price is due to the cost of polymer which is a deciding factor for their extensive use especially in developing nations a combination of excellent physical and chemical properties with a low price makes pvc an excellent membrane material for the treatment of wastewater today 28 53 56 the cost of pvc polymer is less than 10 cost of pvdf polymer and the price list of common polymers used for membrane synthesis is listed in table 2 further pvc dissolves easily in common solvents resulting in forming a porous pvc membrane via the non solvent induced phase separation nips method in addition as membrane material pvc is also an attractive option because of its excellent thermal stability and high mechanical strength ahmad et al 57 investigated the various mechanical properties i e tensile strength young s modulus and elongation at break of pvc membrane and found to be 10 01 mpa 218 08 mpa and 44 04 respectively it was also revealed that pvc membranes were successfully used for practical application and the long term run 57 a similar observation for pvc based membrane was also reported in another study by ahmad et al 30 comparable mechanical properties were also reported by various researchers using different base polymers like psf 58 59 ca 60 pes 61 and pan 62 on the other hand a reduced mechanical property was observed for pvc based membranes compared to other commonly used base polymers like pvdf 44 however it is also noted that the mechanical properties of pvc based membrane was further enhanced by adding inorganic additive in the casting solution cs 57 and changing coagulation bath cb composition 30 the above mention properties of pvc make it suitable for the treatment of wastewater in this regard several researchers developed pvc membranes in different configurations such as hollow fiber 28 63 64 and flat sheet 30 65 66 in contrast to other polymers pvc can be blended with other hydrophilic polymers e g pan ca glycerol carboxylated polyvinylchloride cpvc polystyrene psr polyvinyl formal pvf polycarbonate pc over a wide variety of compositions 35 54 67 70 combining pvc with the other hydrophilic polymer can produce a new material with diverse properties and economic benefits further it is possible to chemically modify the pvc membrane surface to increase hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties 71 74 pvc based membranes have been subject to a comprehensive study in the past few years to improve their performance by i controlling the membrane precipitation rate ii enhancing membrane morphology iii improving membrane hydrophilicity for enhanced anti fouling properties and iv controlling average pore size and pore density publications on wastewater treatment using pvc based membrane increased exponentially in the past two decades and shown in fig 1 where the data are obtained based on screening and searching using the keywords polyvinyl chloride or poly vinyl chloride or pvc and wastewater and membrane in the database of web of science on 25 october 2021 3 preparation of pvc based membranes numerous methods such as sintering stretching track etching coating electrospinning and phase separation are used to fabricate the pvc based membranes 75 77 the phase separation technique is frequently used over other membrane fabrication techniques to fabricate pvc membranes due to advantages like easiness and flexible production scales which reduce its production cost 15 researches have focused much attention on the phase separation method it has also been considered the primary method for membranes synthesis 30 68 75 78 79 based on the mechanism used to separation also known as precipitation or demixing homogeneous dope solution phase separation is classified as evaporation induced phase separation eips thermally induced phase separation tips vapor induced phase separation vips and immersion precipitation or non solvent induced phase separation nips 52 in eips a polymer is dissolved in the mixture of non solvent and solvent where the non solvent is less volatile than the solvent polymer precipitation starts due to shifting of composition during evaporation to a higher nonsolvent and polymer content in the tips technique phase separation of the system has been achieved by cooling polymer solution in the vips method the casted polymeric solution is placed in a vapour atmosphere and a high solvent concentration in the vapor phase prevents solvent evaporation from the casted membrane membrane precipitation occurs because of the diffusion of non solvent into the cast membrane film the precipitation of the cast membrane occurs when different concentrations of solvent and non solvent are exchanged in the cb 52 whereas in the nips method solidification of the cast membrane occurs when different concentrations of solvent and non solvent are exchanged in the cb the mechanism involved in the separation is listed in table 3 among the various phase separation techniques the nips method developed by loeb and sourirajan 80 is the first to be commercially explored and frequently used to fabricate membrane due to the effortless fabrication technique and the only restraint to the solubility of the polymer in the solvent 81 82 since pvc dissolves easily in various common solvents like dimethylacetamide dmac 23 27 tetrahydrofuran thf 83 84 n n dimethylformamide dmf 85 and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 30 86 most pvc membranes are synthesized by nips methods zahid et al 52 discussed the mechanisms involved in the synthesis of the membrane using the nips method in detail the process of synthesizing a membrane by nips is illustrated in fig 2 hirose and co workers investigate the relationship between the phase separation process and membrane structure 87 several researchers have also actively pursued research and development of pvc membranes prepared via the nips method including examining the effects of different preparation conditions on membrane separation efficiency and morphology 24 27 28 78 88 89 4 parameters effacing pvc based membrane performance it is possible to create membranes with diverse pore sizes and morphology using the nips method a variety of parameters such as nature of the solvent type of additives and their relative concentration in the cs prior evaporation time nature of non solvent coagulation bath and its temperature membrane thickness affect the expected morphology and performance of the pvc based membranes during synthesis the effect of some of the parameters such as polymer loading membrane thickness prior evaporation time may be the same for all the polymers still some parameters such as type of solvent the composition of coagulation bath are not the same for all other polymers like psf pe pes pan etc due to differences in interaction hanson solubility parameter between base polymer i e pvc solvent and non solvent hence in this study quantitative analysis of the effect of various parameters on the performance of pvc based membrane was studied 4 1 pvc concentration and temperature of the cs membrane performance is affected by pvc concentration in the cs and typically varies from 12 to 25 wt 90 with an increase in pvc concentration the viscosity of cs increases which reduces the demixing rate of non solvent and solvent subsequently a membrane with low porosity and sponge structure is obtained 42 57 furthermore polymer concentration in the interface of non solvent increases at high pvc concentration and a low porous membrane is obtained numerous studies have explored the effects of pvc concentration on the morphology of the membrane 42 57 91 93 xie et al 42 found that increasing pvc concentration from 6 g 10 g in the cs membrane structure became denser with a reduced pore size 27 to 21 nm pore density 4 8 1013 to 3 1 1013 m 2 and porosity 88 6 to 86 4 and shown in fig 3 the surface roughness of the membrane fabricated using high loading of pvc in the cs reduces due to low pore density on the membrane surface concurrently wettability of the pvc based membrane also reduces at a high concentration of pvc in the cs as wettability is usually correlated with surface roughness the same effect of pvc concentration on the membrane morphology is also reported by other researchers using various solvents such as thf 91 nmp 57 94 and dmac 92 ahmad et al 92 synthesized pvc dmac bentonite membrane to separate oily wastewater and found that increasing pvc loading in the cs reduces membrane flux from 191 l m 2 h 1 to 159 l m 2 h 1 due to sponge membrane structure in contrast oil rejection increases at higher pvc concentration and found to be 92 due to small pore size moreover a similar observation was also stated in another work by ahmad et al 57 pure water flux of pvc based membrane decreases from 405 l m 2 h 1 to 320 l m 2 h 1 when pvc loading increase from 10 g to 18 g namdar et al revealed that increasing pvc loading from 13 to 20 in the cs significantly reduces water flux 400 to 235 kg m 2 h 1 however the hydrophilicity of the membranes samples are almost constant fig 4 the reduction in water flux was mainly attributed to the sponge membrane structure 94 a reduced humic substance rejection was reported by sidabutar et al 95 at high pvc loading the temperature of the cs is a key parameter to affect the kinetics of the phase inversion by reducing the viscosity of the cs which affects the structure and performance of resultant membranes 96 the viscosity of the cs alter the exchange rate between non solvent and solvent that further affect the membrane formation kinetics consequently change in the membrane morphology mei et al 97 observed that viscosity of the pvc dmac dope solution decreases in the entire range of temperature i e 30 80 c and found that more water was required for the precipitation of pvc at high temperature consequently alter the morphology and structure of the resultant membranes during the phase inversion process 4 2 effect of solvents on membrane performance as far as the overall properties and performance of a membrane are concerned the solvent is critical on the one hand pvc and solvents must be soluble whereas non solvents must be miscible with solvents numerous solvents such as dimethylacetamide dmac 23 27 tetrahydrofuran thf 83 84 n n dimethylformamide dmf 85 and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 30 86 are highly compatible and frequently used to fabricate pvc based membranes high chain mobility of polymer can be maintained by choosing the appropriate solvent 44 in addition the final morphology of the membrane fabricated in different solvents is governed by the kinetic parameter i e demixing rate of solvent nonsolvent pairs as well thermodynamic property i e interaction between solvent nonsolvent and solvent polymer pairs when the difference in solubility parameter is low solvents and polymers are compatible and pvc molecules easily dissolve in the solvent in contrast incompatible solvent i e high solubility differences between pvc and solvent results in the aggregation of pvc in addition the solubility difference of solvent and non solvent also determines the interaction of solvent and non solvent morphology of membrane is highly influenced by the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent a fast demixing rate was obtained during membrane precipitation for low solubility difference i e high mutual affinity solvent nonsolvent pairs resulting in a more porous finger like structure in contrast a slow demixing rate was observed for high solubility difference i e low mutual affinity solvent nonsolvent pairs resulting in the sponge like structure 15 84 the solubility parameter of various pvc compatible solvents is listed in table 4 numerous researches have been conducted to understand the effect of solvent type on the performance of pvc membrane 40 41 91 98 among the pvc compatible solvents mentioned above dmac and nmp are frequently used as non solvent to synthesize pvc based membranes in their different studies ahmad et al 23 24 30 92 fabricate flat sheet pvc based membrane using dmac and nmp as non solvent and found that both solvents can produce high performing defect free pvc membranes for the separation of oily wastewater alsalhy et al 99 investigated the effects of dmac solvent concentration in the internal coagulant on the membrane pvc based hollow fiber membranes they found that membrane morphology changed from finger like macro voids to fully sponge like structures in the presence of dmac as an internal coagulant roy et al 40 explored the effects of two different solvents i e dmac and nmp on pvc based membrane performance compared to dmac improved interaction between nmp and pvc was observed and membrane synthesis using nmp induced cs delivers enhanced thermal stability mechanical strength and antifouling properties it is also noted that dmac has a high affinity with water compared to nmp on the other hand it has a weak interaction with pvc an enhanced pure water flux i e 236 8 l m 2 h 1 was obtained for dmac solvent compared to nmp solvent i e 155 2 l m 2 h 1 hence it may be concluded that more substantial solvent power i e better compatibility resulted in a faster precipitation rate consequently a membrane with a porous and finger like structure was found and able to deliver high flux thf is also used as a main non solvent or co solvent in the presence of other solvents such as nmp or dmac thf has high volatility compared to other common solvents for pvc like dmac and nmp table 4 membrane fabricated using thf solvent possess dense top layer with suppressed microvoids results in reduced pure water flux 27 07 l m 2 h 1 compared to dmac system 41 07 l m 2 h 1 84 kawai et al 100 studied the effect of thf and dmf solvent on membrane formation using a phase diagram a continuous structure with non circular pores was obtained for pvc thf water system on the other hand a porous membrane appeared due to the absorption of water by dmf during the evaporation of dmf maghsoud et al 98 fabricated pvc membrane using two different solvents i e dmf and thf in the water coagulation bath wcb using immersion precipitation they studied the effect of solvents on membrane formation using a phase diagram thf has a low mutual affinity i e low tendency to mix with water whereas dmf water mixtures have high mutual affinity a sponge morphology with isolated pores was obtained for pvc thf water system due to delayed demixing in contrast a porous membrane appeared for pvc dmf water due to instantaneous demixing characteristics and shown in fig 5 as discussed earlier membrane morphology relies on the mutual affinity between solvent nonsolvent pairs therefore using a mixture of two different solvents with different affinities towards the non solvent may be a potential method to obtain the desired membrane morphology 29 84 91 98 101 okuno et al 91 prepared pvc membranes using thf and alcohols as a solvent and a more porous membrane was obtained due to decreased viscosity of cs it is also noted that a similar morphology was also obtained with reduced pvc molar mass therefore it may conclude that kinetic rather than thermodynamic factors primarily determine the morphology of pvc membranes maghsoud et al reported that membrane with variable morphology could be obtained using a mixture of thf and dmf the membrane morphology changes from sponge to macro void by increasing dmf concentration in the mixed solvent composition it may also conclude that the overall behavior of the system may be predicted using a ternary phase diagram still it is not easy to predict the changes in membrane morphology by considering the thermodynamic properties of the polymer solution alone 98 bagheripour et al 84 investigate the effect of solvents ratio thf dmac on the membrane performance and a reduced flux and enhanced rejection are obtained at high thf concentration wu et al 41 synthesized pvc graft poly ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate pvc pvc g pegma blended pvc membrane using dmac solvent they observed a large macro voids structure on the membrane however these macro voids structures are suppressed with increasing thf amount in the cs 29 wu et al 29 also investigated the consequence of solvent on the performance and morphology of pvc based membrane they found a low porous membrane with narrow pore size at increased thf to nmp ratio it is also noticed that the roughness of the membrane significantly reduces in the presence of thf in the cs liu et al 102 reported a membrane with enhanced mechanical property obtained using dmac dioctyl phthalate as the mixed solvents it is also noted that a membrane with a dense structure and big pore is observed when fabricated in the mixed solvent all of above mention pvc compatible traditional solvents are toxic explosive hazardous and slowly biodegradable hence using these conventional solvents is risky for the environment health and safety ehs numerous researchers use green solvents for various base polymers such as pvdf 103 104 ca 105 pes 105 pan 106 psf 105 and polyimide p84 107 in place of traditional solvents to reduce the risky for ehs however the application of green solvents for pvc based membranes is limited due to the lack of information as well as it is costly compared to convention solvents in addition little research has been carried out to understand the performance of membrane fabricated using green solvents in this regard xie et al 42 establish the viability of using a green solvent to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of membrane processes pvc pvc g pegma membrane is synthesized using green solvent methyl 5 dimethylamino 2 methyl 5 oxopentanoate i e rhodiasolv polarclean and showed an improved water permeability i e 5000 l m 2 h 1 and sodium alginate sa rejection i e 98 however it is interesting to note that thermodynamic stability of the system reduces in the presence of rhodiasolv polarclean solvent compared to dmac due to high solubility parameter between pvc rhodiasolv polarclean compared to pvc dmac resulting in small pore sizes with narrow pore distribution on the membrane surface xie et al 42 observed that membrane synthesis using traditional dmac had larger pore sizes i e 41 0 nm with a wider pore distribution range than polarclean induced membrane with pore size 31 0 nm dimethyl sulfoxide dmso green solvent has been successfully used by xie et al 101 to substitute the toxic solvents partly and enhance the performance of the membrane the usage of dmso as a solvent during pvc based membrane synthesis is not common as pvc is insoluble in dmso hence xie et al use a mixture of dmso and traditional solvents e g nmp and dmac to reduce the risk for ehs 101 it is also be noted that a better membrane morphology with enhanced performance was observed in the presence of a mixture of dmso nmp dmac solvent compared to membrane fabricated by xie et al 42 using rhodiasolv polarclean solvent xie et al 101 also observed that average pore sizes of the membrane decreases in mixed solvent and were found to be 23 nm compared to nmp i e 27 nm 4 3 effect of evaporation time the evaporation time before membrane precipitation influences the membrane morphology and performance mainly when amphiphilic copolymer blended membrane is synthesized using the nips method 108 109 wu et al 29 investigate the effect of evaporation time during casting of pvc pvc g pegma membrane it is observed that membrane hydrophilicity increases with solvent evaporation time due to the enrichment of hydrophilic pegma segments on the pvc based membrane surface membrane with a suppressed macro voids structure is observed at long evaporation time due to fast evaporation of thf before immersion in cb as a result a tight active layer is developed on the membrane surface the water flux of pvc based membrane fabricated in thf and dmac solvent decreases from 60 l m 2 h 1 to 40 l m 2 h 1 with increased evaporation time before membrane precipitation from 0 s to 80s 110 an increase in evaporation time increases the phase inversion time in the cb in other words the pvc concentration on the top layer of the membrane film rises due to the loss of volatile thf which slows down the diffusion of water in membrane film during the phase separation process due to the high viscosity of the top layer of the membrane film hence membranes with a dense top layer with suppressed microvoids are formed and flux reduces effect of evaporation time on mechanical properties was also carried out and found that tensile strength increased dramatically with increasing evaporation time for fabricated membranes it is also noticed that the thickness of the final membrane reduces after the phase inversion process with more evaporation time due to the change of the porous layer into a dense layer 4 4 effect of pvc membrane thickness as far as the membrane performance i e flux and rejection is concerned pvc membrane thickness plays an important role increasing membrane thickness makes more resistance for water to pass through the membranes consequently reducing the water flux while phase inversion time increases with the increases in membrane thickness due to more pvc in the cs contacting with non solvent and a denser membrane with a thick skin layer is obtained which helps to increase the rejection of solute several studies have been conducted to examine the effect of pvc membrane thickness on the performance of membranes 92 110 ahmad et al 92 investigated the impact of varying membrane thickness i e 100 to 300 μm on the performance of pvc based membranes they reported that increasing membrane thickness reduces water flux from 225 l m 2 h 1 to 140 l m 2 h 1 whereas the oil rejection improves at relatively high membrane thickness the same effect of membrane thickness on the flux is also observed by other researchers 110 fig 6a shows the variation of water flux with varying membrane thicknesses of 100 to 300 μm and observed a clear trend towards lower water flux as the membrane thickness increases due to more resistance for water to pass through the membranes 110 in addition phase inversion time increases with increasing membrane thickness due to more pvc in the cs contacting with non solvent resulting increasing phase inversion time fig 6b mechanical properties of pvc based membranes were also influenced by their thickness and membrane with improved mechanical strength was obtained with increased membrane thickness 4 5 effect of coagulation bath medium and its temperature adding additives in the cs decreases the thermodynamic stability of the cs leading to fast diffusion of solvent from casting film into the non solvent and a porous membrane with macro voids is observed on the other hand adding additives in the cs increases its viscosity resulting in the precipitation rate and a sponge like membrane is expected hence the final morphology of pvc based membrane will depend on the dominance of thermodynamic and kinetic properties in this regard controlling the demixing rate by changing non solvent cb is a potential way to improve membrane morphology and performance porous structures of membranes are strongly influenced by the nature of non solvent used in the cb polymer affinity and solvent miscibility with non solvent influenced demixing rate as a result the membrane precipitation path changes 15 111 in the cb distilled water is usually employed as a non solvent to prepare membranes 27 42 98 110 by altering the non solvent composition in the cb one can adjust the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent in this regard ethanol 112 inorganic salts like kcl nacl nh4cl mgcl2 and cacl2 30 53 57 78 92 sodium hydroxide 51 113 and potassium hydroxide 30 are also used as non solvent in the cb to improve the demixing process to advance the pvc based membrane morphology fang et al 112 fabricate pmmag peg blended pvc membranes in different cb like water and ethanol and evaluate the effect of nano solvent on the performance of the membrane the result demonstrates that the flory huggins interaction parameter of pvc ethanol is very low compared to pvc water due to the comparable value of solubility parameter of ethanol i e 26 6 mpa1 2 and pvc 19 5 mpa1 2 consequently promoting a fast demixing hence membrane prepared in water cb has high flux and rejection to bovine serum albumin bsa due to smoother surfaces with higher porosity than those formed in ethanol it is also observed that pvc pmmag peg membrane involving water cb shows 100 reversible fouling several researchers use inorganic salts in the cb to improve the performance of the pvc based membranes by controlling the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent 30 53 57 78 92 according to zhang et al cb with the almost saturated solution of nacl enhanced the performance of pvc pluronic f127 nmp membrane with a notable flux of 1405 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 53 nacl addition in the cb results in a higher demixing rate between non solvent and solvent due to a shift in the binary curve towards the pvc nmp axis i e membrane precipitates with the small amounts of non solvent consequently more porous and finger like was obtained it is also observed that the effect of nacl in the cb has dominating effect in the presence of amphipathic pluronic f127 in comparison to peg the effect of salt coagulation bath in the presence of pluronic f127 is shown in fig 7 a similar effect of different inorganic salts e g nacl kcl nh4cl cacl2 and mgcl2 in the cs on the morphology of pvc bentonite and pvc bentonite pluronic f127 based membrane in the presence of nmp and dmac solvents is also observed by ahmad et al 30 57 78 92 ahmad et al 92 enhanced pvc based membranes performance by using a salt coagulation bath to treat oil water emulsion and achieved a remarkably enhanced flux of 467 49 l m 2 h 1 in the kcl coagulation bath which is equivalent to 79 01 enhancement in pure water flux over with wcb ahmad et al 92 also observed that the surface roughness of the membrane enhanced in the presence of salt in the coagulation bath compared to wcb it is also revealed that a membrane with narrow pore size distribution is observed when salt is used in the coagulation bath based on the wenzel theory 114 water droplets are efficiently trapped on the rough membrane surface due to the capillary effect on a nanostructure membrane surface higher surface roughness with narrow pore size distribution usually induces an additional suction pressure which reduces the contact angle consequently reduces the fouling tendency of the membrane surface fig 8 shows the effect of water and an aqueous solution of kcl as non solvent on the morphology of the pvc bentonite membrane 92 ahmad et al conducted cloud point experiments and obtained a binodal curve in the ternary phase diagram that has shifted to the pvc solvent axis in the presence of bentonite additive 92 the binodal curve using salt coagulation baths is closer to the polymer solvent axis than the water coagulation bath fig 9 with a salt content in the coagulation bath a lesser amount of non solvent is necessary to cause phase separation i e pvc flocculation due to a decrease in thermodynamic stability of the system however it is noted that in the presence of bentonite and pluronic f127 the best performing membrane was obtained in kcl cb irrespective of the solvent type this result suggests that salt solutions are stronger non solvents than water in both solvents the thickness of the membrane increases in all salt induced cb and membrane with maximum thickness is obtained in cacl2 cb in order words swelling of the membrane is enhanced with salt solubility and follows the following order cacl2 mgcl2 nh4cl kcl nacl 92 alkali based cb was also used to improve the performance of pan blended pvc membranes 30 51 113 in an alkali environment the nitrile group of pan can be transformed into the hydrophilic amide or carboxyl group using alkaline hydrolysis and the membrane surface becomes hydrophilic consequently a membrane with improved performance and antifouling properties was observed a detailed change in dynamic water contact angle of the synthesized membranes using wcb salt coagulation bath scb alkali induced water coagulation bath aiwcb and alkali induced salt coagulation bath aiscb are shown in fig 10 it is also noted that the membrane morphology does not change in the presence of an alkali coagulation bath 51 the effect of coagulation bath temperature also plays an important role in controlling the membrane morphology and surface pore size 96 in this regard farahani et al 93 examine the consequence of varying coagulation bath temperature on the morphology and performance of pvc based membranes farahani et al revealed that increasing the coagulation bath temperature from 5 to 45 c results in membrane with increased surface pores size in addition the morphology of the membrane changes from macro voids to fully developed finger like pores with an increase in coagulation bath temperature and achieved a remarkably enhanced flux of 165 l m 2 h 1 at 45 c which is equivalent to 35 enhancement in pure water flux at 5 c coagulation bath temperature wenjuan et al 115 synthesized pvc copolymer membrane in varying coagulation bath temperatures i e 5 to 25 c they found that pure water flux of membrane increased from 77 8 to 103 8 ml cm 2 h 1 with an increase in coagulation bath temperature due to improved membrane morphology 4 6 relative humidity the relative humidity is also an important synthesis parameter to influence the membrane performance 96 wenjuan et al 115 investigated the effect of relative humidity on pvc copolymer membrane performance and found that pure water flux of membrane increase from 70 7 to 154 1 ml cm 2 h 1 with an increase in relative humidity from 30 to 70 due to a more porous membrane structure it was also noted that there is no significant change in the retention of bsa solution varied from 91 9 to 90 7 due to low variation in the membrane pore size 105 to 107 nm 4 7 bore solutions flow rate bore solutions flow rate is also an important parameter to control the membrane morphology for hollow fiber membranes alobaidy et al 116 investigate the effect of various flow rates i e 2 6 3 6 4 5 7 9 11 and 13 ml min 1 on the morphology and performance of pvc dmac hollow fiber membrane they observed that the height of the nodules is reduced with increasing bore flow rate due to a decrease in the pore size at the inner surface the mean pore size of the hollow fibers is reduced from 146 27 to 104 7 nm when the bore flow rate changes from 2 6 to 13 ml min 1 4 8 air gap lengths air gap length can profoundly affect the ultimate performances of hollow fiber membranes membrane with suppressed macro voids structure can be obtained with shorter air gap length due to a faster stretching of the nascent hollow fiber 117 khayet et al 118 fabricated pvc peg hollow fiber membranes dry wet and wet wet spinning techniques and examined the effect of different air gap lengths on the performance and structure of the membrane they found that both the diameters outer and inner of the pvc peg hollow fiber membranes decrease with an increase in the air gap distance due to the gravitational force effect it was also observed that the pore size of the synthesized membrane increases with an increase in air gap lengths consequently enhancing the pure water flux on the other hand a reduced separation efficiency was observed at increased air gap lengths due to large pore size 4 9 casting speed morphology of the fabricated pvc based membrane may also be controlled by regulating the casting speed the exposure time of casting film before contact to non solvent in the coagulation bath was changed by changing casting machine speed and membrane with dense layer was obtained 119 ahmad et al 23 synthesized pvc dmac bentonite membrane to enhance the pvc based ufm performance for oily wastewater treatment the viscoelastic properties of cs were used to determine the optimal casting speed and were 0 71 cm s 1 it was also revealed that the casting speed also helps to control the special orientation of bentonite platelets in the membrane and enhances the membrane performance pure water flux 186 l m 2 h 1 and oil rejection 97 due to the uniform dispersion of bentonite in the membrane matrix 4 10 type of additives membrane synthesis using the cs having polymeric and inorganic additives has significantly better performance sections 5 2 and 5 3 provide detailed explanations of how different additives affect membrane performance 5 hydrophilic modification of pvc membrane the fouling of pvc membranes is the primary barrier to the broader application of pvc based membranes researchers have found that membranes can be made more foul resistant by increasing their hydrophilicity 20 24 to overcome polymer membrane fouling increasing membrane hydrophilicity might be an appropriate strategy in this regard various methods like surface grafting 71 120 surface coating 72 73 and blending 30 110 121 have been adopted to advance the membrane hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties 5 1 surface modification of pvc membrane the surface of pvc membrane can be modified effectively to enhance their performance for wastewater treatment using several surface modification techniques 71 74 furthermore the pvc membrane also provided some fouling resistance properties because of a layer of hydrophilic material forming on its surface which prevented foulant present in wastewater from interacting with the membrane surface it is possible to modify the surface of the pvc membrane using physical and chemical modification in a physical surface modification hydrophilic modifiers exist on the surface of pvc membrane interacted via physical interaction without changing the chemical composition of pvc membrane two ways can accomplish it i membrane surfaces are directly coated or deposited with hydrophilic organic materials further treatment is required occasionally and ii initially a solution containing chemically active monomers is soaked or coated onto the pvc membrane a crosslinking or polymerization reaction immobilizes the monomers onto the membrane surface without the participation of the pvc membrane however the application of surface modification technique for pvc based membranes is limited 5 1 1 surface coating coating the pvc membrane surface with a hydrophilic thin layer is the simplest way to improve its surface hydrophilicity in this regard chapman et al 73 cheng et al 122 and hosseini et al 72 123 modified pvc based membrane by surface coating and reported enhanced membrane performance with improved surface hydrophilicity by using solvent nonsolvent coating without the use of low surface energy compounds li et al developed a new simple method to achieve a super hydrophobic pvc membrane surface with a water contact angle of 4 8 124 when exposed to acid alkali and salt solutions the pvc film is nearly or still retaining its superhydrophobicity the hydrophobic pvc surfaces showed a lotus like structure with nano and micro papillae as compared to smooth pvc surfaces cheng et al 122 modify pvc based uf membranes using silica sol in the cb during the nips process pvc membrane structure changed from a cavity like shape to a finger like shape as silica sol concentration increased in cb in addition hydrophilicity and permeability of modified pvc membrane are also enhanced however membrane pores become blocked and the coating layer is easily washed out over time additionally the surface coating requires an extra step to modify the surface of the membrane increasing membrane manufacturing costs the coated layer could be eluted during filtration and cleaning operation due to the comparatively weak between coated layer and pvc membrane 5 1 2 surface grafting as discussed earlier the use of hydrophilic polymers for surface coating successfully improved the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane the disadvantage of this approach is that there is an increase in permeate resistance and membrane pores become blocked as a result causing a reduction in water flux especially if the pvc membranes have smaller pores a hydrophilic coating on the modified membrane may delaminate in the long term process due to relatively weak interaction between the pvc membrane and surface coated layer leading to the loss of hydrophilicity some researchers have also focused their attention on chemically modifying pvc membranes 84 88 92 to overcome these problems the pvc membrane surface is chemically modified with hydrophilic additives through covalent bonding interaction in the procedure pvc chains are first activated with a chemical reaction or high energy radiation and then hydrophilic additives are grafted on the pvc surface hence membrane surface characteristics tend to improve in this situation while membrane bulk is not significantly affected furthermore covalent attachments offer long term chemical stability of membranes compared to physical surface coating 125 by controlling the grafting reaction the characteristics of the pvc membrane can be altered even a small number of hydrophilic groups such as cooh oh is sufficient to improve their hydrophilicity and performance if they were situated on the walls of the pores in spite of the fact that grafting reduces membrane fouling grafting requires extra steps to modify the surface of the prepared membranes in this regard pegma and zwitterionic monomers 2 methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine mpc and 2 methacryloyloxy ethyl dimethyl 3 sulfopropyl ammonium hydroxide medsah were studied as grafting chains on pvc membrane surfaces to enhance the membrane antifouling property when pegma was grafted on the membrane surface fouling was reduced more effectively than when zwitterionic were grafted 71 vigo et al 126 improved membrane hydrophilicity and performance by glow discharge grafting of poly acrylic acid on the pvc membrane surface babu and gaikar observed a slight reduction in fouling characteristics of pvc membranes that had been grafted with acrylic acid 127 despite this liu et al found that acrylic acid grafted pvc membranes had higher water permeability i e 187 l m 2 h 1 and antifouling characteristics than pvc membranes i e 107 9 l m 2 h 1 120 the performance of pvc membrane was also improved by grafting n vinyl 2 pyrrolidinone using uv aided graft polymerization on the membrane surface resulting surface with increased surface hydrophilicity and reduced absorption fouling 128 they observed a sharp decrease in the grafted pvc membrane fouling combined with cross pulsing and membrane surface modification ahn et al use one step atrp method to modify pvc with acrylated oligopolyethylene glycol 129 in another study by using atom transfer radical polymerization pvc membranes were hydrophilically modified with poly oxyethylenemethacrylate poem 130 fahmy et al 74 grafted polystyrene on the pvc membrane surface to achieve a super hydrophilic membrane surface the chemical treatment of pvc membrane using plasma o2 treatment followed by sulfonation and amination processes are shown in fig 11 the contact angle of the atmospheric o2 plasma treated pvc membrane was reduced to 10 whereas the contact angle of untreated pristine pvc was found to be 54 however the main disadvantage of surface grafting is that it requires an extra step to modify the surface of the prepared membrane increasing membrane manufacturing costs 5 2 blending modification of pvc membrane the effectiveness of grafting hydrophilic monomers on membrane surfaces by chemical modification e g grafting hydrophilic monomers on the surface of the membrane has been tested many times still as a whole the results have not been satisfactory for those attempting to reduce membrane fouling blending modification advances have extended the range of applications for membrane technologies to treat water and wastewater more efficiently numerous research communities have recently reported the beneficial effects of blending modification of membranes on reducing membrane fouling 23 84 the most common and cheapest method of improving fouling resistance is to blend hydrophilic polymer or inorganic additives in pvc induced cs it is a one step process as additives and membranes are not treated prior to or after blending modification as required for grafting and surface coating techniques in blending modification of pvc membrane antifouling properties and membrane performance enhance due to enhanced hydrophilicity of membrane surface and internal pores reduced thermodynamic stability is observed for the additive blended cs system which increases the exchange of non solvent and solvent and a porous and finger like structure membrane is obtained 131 on the other hand adding additives in the cs increases its viscosity which results in the precipitation rate and a sponge like membrane is expected 131 as a result developing a better trade off between kinetics and thermodynamics of membrane synthesis can manipulate membrane morphology however leaching out of blending additives from the membrane during membrane synthesis and filtration operation reduces the membrane performance 5 2 1 hydrophilic polymer hydrophilic polymer additives e g polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 28 56 132 and polyethylene glycol peg 40 110 121 are frequently used to blend with pvc to enhance the membrane performance moreover these additives can control the thermodynamics and kinetics property during membrane precipitation to control the morphology pore size and distribution 110 adding additives in the cs decreases the thermodynamic stability of the cs leading to fast diffusion of solvent from casting film into the non solvent and a porous membrane with macro voids is observed 133 furthermore polymer additives in the cs also enhance the hydrophilicity porosity and flux of the pvc membrane 40 110 however the mechanical strength of the membrane decreases from 4 27 mpa to 3 25 mpa due to an increase in membrane porosity 40 anti fouling properties of the membrane consisting of polymer additives also increase due to reduced adsorption of solutes present in the water onto the surface of the membrane consequently enhanced and more uniform flux i e 433 96 l m 2 h 1 is obtained compare to bare pvc membrane i e 119 67 l m 2 h 1 40 due to their water soluble properties pvp or peg play more of a pore forming role in pvc membranes modification and preparation process than their hydrophilic properties because they can be washed out during filtration operation of the membrane 48 134 a reduction in hydrophilicity and fouling resistance is expected due to leaching out of hydrophilic polymers from pvc membrane and mainly relies on the molecular weight of the polymeric additive and its affinity with the nonsolvent a significant focus has been placed on the use of peg among the above mentioned polymer additives as peg is a better pore forming agent for example bagheripour et al 110 examine the performance of pvc based membranes with varying peg concentrations 0 4 it is observed that membrane flux with 4 peg increases significantly compared to pristine membranes which is equivalent to 45 2 enhancement in pure water flux due to the formation of a membrane with macro voids structure a similar macro voids structure at high peg loading is also reported by farahani et al 93 with enhanced pure water flux of 35 compared to pristine pvc membranes roy et al found that the pore size of pvc membranes increases at high concentrations of peg in the cs 121 in addition the prepared pvc dmac peg membrane has an excellent water flux good thermostability and good mechanical strength farahani et al 93 examine the consequence of varying peg concentration 0 0 6 0 on the morphology and performance of pvc based membranes the best performing membrane was found at 4 peg and 13 pvc concentration with enhanced pure water flux due to the enhanced porosity hydrophilicity finger like structure and broad pore size distribution more addition of peg concentration i e 6 reduces membrane performance roy et al 121 reported that the addition of peg in the pvc based cs promotes a finger like structure in the membrane whereas a spongy membrane structure was observed at high peg concentration xu and xu 28 investigated the blending effect of pvp and peg with pvc and found that both the additives can improve the porosity and flux of hollow fiber pvc membranes by altering the morphology of the membrane a defect free smooth and porous pvc based membrane with excellent mechanical behavior was reported by bhran et al using pvp additive 135 these pvc pvp hybrid membranes are hydrophilic and are less prone to fouling by the adsorption of proteins 56 it is interesting to note that the addition of pvp to pvc increases the difference in their heats of fusion and melting temperatures δh suggesting more crystalline polymer blend in the presence of pvp fig 12 56 furthermore pvp acts as an antifouling agent by increasing surface hydrophilicity preventing biofouling on the surface fang et al 136 blended a novel phosphate based zwitterionic polymer methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine co poly propylene glycol methacrylate mpc ppgma with pvc to synthesize high performing membranes and found that mpc ppgma is compatible with pvc the zwitterionic segments of the mpc ppgma doped in the cs can exert good hydration properties thereby improving surface hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties of the pvc blend membranes excellent biofouling and organic fouling were also observed in the presence of mpc ppgma in the pvc membrane matrix the molecular weight of the polymer additives also has a significant impact on membrane performance and morphology cs with higher viscosity was obtained when polymeric additives with high molecular weights were added results in a dense membrane morphology with fewer macro voids in the sub layer due to slow demixing between non solvent and solvent 40 137 two ways delay demixing and influences membrane morphology firstly skin thickness and total membrane thickness increase due to delayed precipitation of the membrane secondly the pore size of the membrane reduces due to a spongy membrane 40 numerous studies have been conducted on the effect of molecular weight of polymeric additives on membrane structure and transport characteristics 40 according to roy et al 40 a rise in the molecular weight of peg would cause an increase in membrane porosity with a denser structure hence peg and pvp can be considered effective polymeric additives to improve the hydrophilicity morphology and fouling resistivity properties of the pvc based membranes however these polymeric additives tend to leached out from the polymer matrix during filtration operation and do not have any significant contribution to the improvement in the thermal chemical and mechanical properties of the membrane 138 an overview of polymer blending for membrane modification based on pvc is provided in table 5 5 2 2 amphiphilic copolymers most hydrophilic polymers are incompatible with pvc making blending modification very challenging however this problem may be solved by blending a copolymer that has amphiphilic properties in addition amphiphilic copolymer also reduces the leaching out effect from the membrane during membrane synthesis and filtration operation as experienced in blending the hydrophilic polymer 53 as amphiphilic polymers possess both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components they are much effective than hydrophilic copolymers to improve membrane performance during the membrane precipitation in the cb at the polymer water interface the hydrophilic components of amphiphilic polymers segregate without leaching out of the membrane matrix due to the interfacial energy and then build up a hydrophilic fouling resistant layer on the surface of the membrane as well as inside the pores after the membrane materials solidify in one step amphiphilic copolymer blending both of these objectives can be achieved firstly phase inversion allows hydrophobic copolymers to be entrapped in the membrane matrix to reduce membrane fouling and leaching tendency secondly hydrophilic copolymers are to be accumulated on the surface of the membrane to improve the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface 139 pvc membranes made of amphiphilic copolymer have the unique advantage of self organization modification and phase inversion fabrication polymerization of two or more monomers results in the synthesis of amphiphilic copolymers a general radical polymerization atom transfer radical polymerization atrp thermal graft copolymerization and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization raft 29 41 140 can usually be employed to synthesize amphiphilic copolymers amphiphilic copolymers of different structures i e comb like triblock or hyperbranched star have been received great consideration in recent years to synthesize hydrophilic pvc membranes including pluronic f 127 27 53 pvc g pegma 29 41 42 101 poly vinyl chloride co poly ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate poly vc co pegma copolymer 134 141 pes g pegma 20 pmma g peg 112 pvc g poly 3 sulfopropyl methacrylate 142 and poly methyl methacrylate b methacrylic acid p mma b maa 143 an overview of amphiphilic copolymer blending for membrane modification based on pvc is provided in table 5 superior antifouling properties with enhanced performance of pvc based membrane can be achieved by using commercial pluronic f127 27 53 54 sulfonated polysulfone spsf 76 and pvc poly vc co pegma 134 141 in the cs due to their ability to form a hydration layer an amphiphilic copolymer containing peg chains exhibits improved hydrophilicity and fouling resistance properties in the preparation of pvc based antifouling membranes pluronic f127 has excellent potential as a new additive due to its low cost a triblock copolymer of pluronic f127 comprises a hydrophobic block of polypropylene oxide ppo at the center and two hydrophilic blocks of polyethylene oxide peo on either side liu et al 27 determined the consequence of varying amounts of pluronic f127 i e 0 10 wt on the membrane performance and found that hydrophilicity of membrane surface continuously increases up to10 wt due to an upsurge in oxygen content on the membrane surface however the optimal concentration of pluronic f127 was 8 0 wt up to which flux pore size and the pore density increase however further addition of pluronic f127 led to a decrease in the flux due to reduced pore size and the pore density it is noted that the performance of the pluronic f127 composite membrane was significantly enhanced by changing coagulation bath composition 53 57 78 zhang et al 53 determined the effect of salt cb on pluronic f127 blended pvc based membrane a remarkably enhanced water flux i e 1405 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was obtained due to enhance membrane hydrophilicity and pore density a similar observation is also reported by ahmad et al 57 78 it is also noted that mechanical properties of pluronic f127 blended pvc based membrane deteriorate due to an increase in microvoids and inherent reduced mechanical properties of pf127 57 zhou et al 134 synthesize pvc poly vc co pegma membranes having varying pegma amounts the outcome of change in the pegma percentage on membrane antifouling properties was studied and found that almost fouling free membrane can be produced with 9 8 pegma in poly vc co pegma however fouling free membrane possess very poor mechanical strengths making it not suitable for practical applications in another study zhou et al 141 improved membrane mechanical strength by varying pvc and poly vc co pegma with a pegma of 9 8 blend ratios in addition to commercial amphiphilic copolymers various lab synthesized amphiphilic polymers are also used to advance the performance of pvc based membranes pmma g peg copolymer comb like structure is obtained from poly ethylene glycol methacrylate and methyl methacrylate the pvc pmma g pegma blend system is stable because pmma and pvc have outstanding compatibility during the preparation and use of doping solutions fang et al 112 fabricate pmmag peg blended pvc membranes in different cb like water and ethanol and determine the effect of nano solvent on the membrane performance the result demonstrates that hydrophilicity of pvc membrane increased significantly in the presence of pmmag peg and 100 reversible fouling was achieved wu et al 41 fabricate pvc based membrane by blending amphiphilic pvc g pegma and found that increasing pvc g pegma in the cs increases hydrophilicity and pure water flux whereas pore density and pore size of membrane surface decreased an enhanced sa rejection i e 90 and flux recovery ratio i e frr 89 than the pure pvc membrane was obtained in the presence of pvc g pegma in the membrane matrix moreover a similar observation was also reported in wu et al 29 and xie et al 42 101 pvc pes g pegma blend membranes fabricated by jiang et al exhibits stronger hydrophilicity high flux and more antifouling properties than pure pvc membranes 20 it is also observed that synthesized pes g pegma is more compatible with pvc than pvc pes blending system pvc based copolymers are another amphiphilic copolymer made when pvc is used directly as the macroinitiator 140 according to fig 13 there are only two steps in the pvc g pmaa synthesis procedure a tert butyl methacrylate tbma graft is first applied to pvc via the atrp process and then the pvc g ptbma is hydrolyzed pmaa chains were found to be segregated towards the surface of membranes and they possessed negative charges improved membrane hydrophilicity and performance with good resistance to bsa have been reported in the presence of pvc g pmaa moreover pvc p mma b maa membranes 143 with good resistance to protein have been reported 5 2 3 inorganic nanoparticles a polymeric additive has certain limitations including limited mechanical chemical and thermal resistance and is prone to leaching out 138 as the 1980s progressed a new idea of hybrid membranes appeared that contained inorganic additives in the membrane matrix 148 149 various nanoparticles like alumina al2o3 84 150 silver ag 151 hydrous manganese oxide hmo 35 152 anatase titania ant 35 halloysite nanotubes hnts 132 titanium dioxide tio2 83 151 153 iron oxide fe3o4 88 145 zinc oxide zno 144 154 155 silica sio2 147 156 157 bentonite 19 92 graphene oxide go 158 159 are reported in the literature to improve the fouling resistance properties of pvc based membranes the addition of inorganic nanoparticles also enhances thermal stability which also contributes to strengthening the mechanical properties of the membrane 83 150 the viscosity of the cs increases with increasing inorganic nanoparticles concentration which reduces the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent consequently a membrane with low porosity and sponge structure is obtained 42 57 the effect of inorganic nanoparticles concentration on the viscosity of cs dominates in the presence of sio2 compared to other metal oxides such as al2o3 zno and tio2 as shown in fig 14 160 however the agglomeration of inorganic nanoparticles at high concentrations hinders membranes limiting their application table 6 summarizes the inorganic nanoparticles blending for the modification of pvc based membrane alumina based nanoparticles have been one of the most stable inorganic additives used in pvc membrane fabrication for increasing membrane performance the properties of alumina based nanoparticles are similar to those of other metal oxide nanoparticles and might enhance the performance of membranes fabricated with them the hydrophilicity of membrane increases due to presence of oh groups on the surface of hydrophilic alumina based nanoparticles 150 161 the interactions between alumina blended pvc membrane surface and hydrophobic foulant decreases which increases membrane antifouling properties and rejection aside from its affordability it is also nontoxic highly abrasive and highly resistant 165 alumina nanoparticles should be added carefully to pvc membranes since too much addition could lead to a loss of membrane strength and performance due to the aggregation of nanoparticles 84 150 in this regard bagheripour et al 84 fabricate pvc based membranes via the phase separation method using sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and aluminum oxide al2o3 as an additive and determine the effect of additives on the physicochemical properties of the pvc based membranes the presence of sds forms a dense top layer on the membrane surface that results in an enhanced rejection thus a reduced flux on the other hand more porous with big pore size is obtained in the presence of al2o3 in the cs which leads to enhancement in flux and maximum flux of 79 61 l m 2 h 1 with reduced rejection al2o3 nanoparticles display high hydrophilicity and surface area also leading to increased pure water and permeability flux etemadi and qazvini 150 enhance pvc based uf membrane performance by increasing membrane hydrophilicity using al2o3 it is also observed that the addition of al2o3 in the membrane matrix significantly enhances its porosity and antifouling properties however a membrane with a reduced tensile strength was observed in the presence of al2o3 due to an increase in porosity a similar effect of al2o3 on the membrane morphology and performance for the separation of activated sludge 161 it is interesting to note that the addition of al2o3 increases the mechanical properties like tensile strength and elongation at break of al2o3 blended pvc membrane up to 3 wt which contradicts other researchers observations 150 however it is also reported that further addition of al2o3 leads to a reduction in mechanical strength of the membrane due to the agglomeration of al2o3 at high loading farjami et al 163 increased the performance of the pvc based membrane with the mixing of boehmite particles boehmite is a particle of aluminum oxide hydroxide γ alooh including hydroxyl groups on its surface the boehmite nanoparticles have an orthorhombic structure with extra hydroxyl groups on their surfaces nanoparticles of boehmite consist of two sheets of octahedral chains with aluminum ions at their centers 166 it is reported that using 0 75 wt boehmite incorporated membrane increase in water flux from 422 6 to 7014 l m 2 h 1 with bsa rejection 98 due to their stable porous structure with uniform pore size silica can provide high surface area and porosity to mixed matrix membranes improving the membrane s permeability silica nanoparticles have been studied extensively and proven an effective inorganic additive due to their chemical and thermal stability large surface areas fine suspension in aqueous solution and environmental inertness 156 157 pvc membrane with sio2 nanoparticles also showed superior antifouling performance and removal efficiency using municipal wastewater than bare membranes due to enhanced membrane hydrophilicity 157 it is also reported that cs with a nano sio2 3 wt increased viscosities a negative degassed effect and poor film forming performance 157 saberi et al 167 investigate the effect of varying sio2 loading on the performance of pvc sio2 hollow fiber membranes it is reported the sio2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed in the membrane matrix and enhanced hydrophilicity of the membrane surface tio2 has been emerging as a leading additive for the production of nano composites pvc based membranes due to the hydrophilic nature and photocatalytic of tio2 nanomaterials rabiee et al 153 found that tio2 incorporated into the polymer matrix boosted water flux hydrophilicity and fouling resistance of emulsion pvc membranes an sem image reveals that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles resulted in macro voids instead of finger like structures and membrane structure returned to elongated finger like pores at tio2 concentration 1 wt fig 15a and b with tio2 addition surface hydrophilicity of pvc based membrane improved dramatically enhancing water flux and flux recovery remarkably the effect of tio2 membrane structure pure water flux and rejection are shown in fig 15 according to behboudi et al 83 increased tio2 nanoparticles in pvc membrane resulted in lower fouling ratios increasing water flux due to increased membrane hydrophilicity it is also noted that the thermal stability and mechanical strength of pvc based membranes improved in the existence of tio2 the modification of porous membranes using silver ag has also been a significant area of research in the last several decades due to its excellent chemical stability anti pollution capacity and antibacterial property aside from its useful properties one of the challenges of silver nanoparticles is their leaching tendency from membrane surfaces the leaching of silver nanoparticles reduces the membrane performance in addition drinking water obtained from wastewater treatment desalination processes can be polluted by the leaching of silver nanoparticles and pose a threat to marine life and human beings 168 a nanocomposite blend of silver and other nanoparticles is developed to address this issue immobilizing silver nanoparticles on membrane surfaces and improving antibacterial properties behboudi et al 162 modified silver nanoparticles using silica by stöber method and synthesized pvc based membrane by blending modified silver nanoparticles using the wet spinning method and determine the consequence of unmodified and modified silver nanoparticles on the properties and performance of pvc based membranes it is reported that membrane properties and performance significantly improve in the presence of modified silver nanoparticles compared to unmodified silver nanoparticles it was found that both unmodified and modified silver nanoparticles improved the tensile strength of the membrane due to the reinforcement effect of silver nanoparticles in the membrane matrix however the result is dominating in the presence of modified silver nanoparticles haghighat et al 151 synthesized pvc based membrane via co precipitation process using ag and tio2 as a nanoparticle resulting in nanohybrid membrane with enhanced membrane performance it is also reported that the leaching tendency of silver from the membrane matrix was insignificant it could be decided that the nanoparticle was stable after thirty days since the leaching rate remained constant after twenty days and no further leaching occurred after thirty days the results also revealed that biofouling resistance and antibacterial activity of pvc ag tio2 membranes increases by using iron oxide nanoparticles foulant adsorption and attachment on the membrane surface or inner structure can be reduced consequently the fouling resistance property of the membrane increases gholami et al 145 reported that the addition of fe3o4 increases the porosity and fouling resistance properties of pvc based membranes however water flux reached its maximum at 0 1 wt loading of fe3o4 and further addition of fe3o4 causes channel blockage due to agglomeration leads to a reduction in flux a fe3o4 nanocomposite membrane was significantly better at salt rejection than a bare membrane with a rejection rate of 46 4 at 0 1 wt 228 5 higher than bare pvc membranes a pvc based membrane with 1 0 wt fe3o4 had 52 lower salt rejection than a membrane with 0 1 wt fe3o4 at high fe3o4 concentration the lower salt rejection was attributed to an increased effective surface area associated with the accumulation and agglomeration of fe3o4 nanoparticles in another study fe2o3 nanoparticles incorporated pvc based membranes displayed decreased roughness and improved hydrophilicity as indicated by a 22 reduction of the water contact angle at 1 0 wt compared to the bare membrane 88 in addition the mechanical strength of fe2o3 blended pvc membranes also increases zinc oxide nanoparticles possess a similar antimicrobial function as titanium oxide nanoparticles however they are less expensive and more stable zno nanoparticles are gaining popularity in membrane technology due to their anti corrosive antifungal and antimicrobial properties various studies have demonstrated enhanced antifouling properties hydrophilicity porosity and high permeability with zno in pvc based membranes 144 154 155 rabiee et al 155 improve pvc membrane performance by blending zno nanoparticles based on the results of this study the pure water flux of pvc zno membranes increased with a zno addition up to 3 wt which was the optimal concentration of zno nanoparticles furthermore the frr of nanocomposite membranes improved from 69 to above 90 when zno was added at 3 0 wt and further addition of zno reduces the membrane performance due to aggregation of zno nanoparticles another study found that zno nanoparticles added at a concentration of 2 wt resulted in particles agglomerating 95 the addition of 0 1 g of zno nanoparticles remarkably improved the pure water flux and the mean roughness by 315 and 140 respectively resulting in smaller mean pore size with narrower pore distribution 144 it was also observed that cake layer thickness on the pvc based membrane surface was reduced from 52 8 to 10 42 μm with increasing zinc oxide content up to 0 3 g due to the anti biofouling effect of zinc oxide consequently an average 500 long term improved membranes life was observed compared to the neat pvc membranes fig 16 144 due to their high surfaces and structural characteristics hydrous metal oxides such as ferric oxide magnesium oxide and manganese oxide are also gaining attention as an additive to increase membrane performance hydrous manganese oxide hmo nanoparticles among the various types of hydrous metal oxides that have been studied hmo showed the best decontamination efficiency for toxic heavy metals because of their high adsorption capacities 35 carbon nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes cnts or graphene have recently received considerable attention as a promising additive for membrane modification for instance hybrid membranes incorporating cnts and organic materials have a higher water flux than pristine membranes 164 169 hosseini 170 studied the effect of multiwall carbon nanotube mwcnt nanocomposite concentration on membrane electrochemical characteristics it was revealed that selectivity of pvc mwcnt membranes was enhanced slightly in bi valent ionic up to 8 wt mwcnt concentration and further addition of mwcnt reduce the selectivity of the membrane an increased pore density i e number of pores on the surface of membranes with reduced pore size was observed in the presence of mwcnt by masoumi et al 171 the hydrophilicity tensile strength pure water flux and humic acid rejection of the pvc mwcnt membrane increased with increasing the content of mwcnt up to 0 3 wt from 88 60 to 70 20 4 30 to 6 17 mpa 244 8 to 484 7 l m 2 h 1 and 62 40 to 96 88 respectively and then decreased due to the agglomeration of nanotubes 171 the increased range of optimal dosage of the cnt increases membrane production cost and as a result it raises serious concerns for its membrane modification practices graphene derivatives are popular for wastewater separation due to their extraordinary chemical stability excellent physical characteristics and unique two dimensional structure graphene oxide go is a derivative sp2 hybridized of graphene intercalated with different oxygen rich functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy groups 172 graphene oxide has amphiphilic properties due to oxygen functional groups at the edges and basal plane as a result of the hydrophilicity imparted by these functional groups go sheets have a high surface area and are highly effective as additives in pvc based membranes several novel methods for preparing go at low cost have been developed making it more competitive and accessible than cnt 159 173 currently minimal literature is available that discusses the modification of pvc based membranes by blending go zhao et al 159 modify pvc membrane with go via phase inversion method to improve its hydrophilicity and mechanical properties it was reported that the pvc go hybrid membranes exhibit improved hydrophilicity water flux and mechanical properties the pure water flux of the pvc go membrane increased from 232 6 to 430 0 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the tensile strength increased from 231 3 to 305 3 cn in the presence of 0 1 wt go jhaveri et al 158 blended go tio2 nanosheets in the cs to enhance the performance of pvc membrane in terms of permeability solute rejection and anti fouling behavior it was reported that pure water flux of pvc go tio2 membrane increased from 70 to 250 l m 2 h 1 bar with increased humic acid rejection from 98 to 99 5 due to enhanced membrane hydrophilicity and porosity the enhancement in the properties of the go hybrid pvc membranes is mainly attributed to the strong hydrophilicity of functional groups on the go surface demonstrating that go has a promising candidate for modification of pvc ultrafiltration membranes in wastewater treatment the metal oxide nanoparticles referred to above are promising candidates for enhancing the performance of pvc membrane but their expense has encouraged researchers to explore other approaches the low cost bentonite nanoclay widely used for drilling fluid has a high cation exchange capacity making it a potential additive for the performance enhancement of pvc membranes an enhanced flux and rejection results from the uniform dispersion of bentonite in the cs 23 membrane with finger like structure enhanced membrane porosity hydrophilicity and pore density was observed in the presence of bentonite additive in the pvc based membrane matrix 23 57 92 it is also reported that a more sponge structure membrane was obtained at higher bentonite loading due to a rise in the viscosity of the cs which slowed down the demixing rate between non solvent and solvent as shown in fig 17 48 table 7 lists the intrinsic properties and structural effects of inorganic nanoparticles used to fabric pvc based membranes the hydrophilicity and properties such as mechanical chemical and thermal resistance of the membrane may be enhanced in the presence of inorganic nanoparticles in the cs however a critical loading and homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles are essential to avoid agglomeration which reduces membrane performance by reducing the effective surface area to flow 174 5 3 second polymer component blending of a second polymer like pan 30 67 ca 35 145 176 177 glycerol 35 cpvc 54 56 psr 68 pvf 70 pc 69 86 with pvc is a very interesting way of improving the performance of pvc based membranes and detail are shown in table 8 combining pvc with the second polymer can produce a new material with diverse properties and economic benefits by using a polymer blend system membrane hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity can be modified as well and polymer blended pvc based membranes perform better than unblended membranes the main restriction in polymer blending is that most polymer pairs are somewhat incompatible i e immiscible polymers miscible with pvc must be chemically very similar they should have low entropy of mixing δhm and heat of mixing specific interactions contribute to the miscibility of many of the most common and practical miscible polymers e g electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding of blended polymers for instance a weak hydrogen bond is suggested between oxygen and halogen containing polymers 56 in this regard excellent properties of pan include hydrophilicity repellency of oil fat and grease resistance to oxidation and hydrolysis with good thermal and mechanical stability make it suitable to be used as an additive for the development in pvc based membranes however the blended second polymer must be compatible with pvc to achieve a homogeneous cs the solubility parameter is one of the standard methods used to determine the compatibility of blend polymers using the entropy of mixing δhm and minimum δhm indicates better compatibility of the two polymers 67 a higher δhm value of pvc pan blend indicates partly incompatible systems however pvc pan should be miscible in a common polar solvent because both are polar polymers 67 mei et al 113 determined the miscibility of pvc pan blend using viscosity measurements and found blends are immiscible for pan contents 20 wt or 80 wt 113 researchers reported that pvc psr 68 and pvc ca 176 are not completely compatible rabiee et al 178 investigated the performance of pan blended pvc membrane fabricate in water coagulation bath and found a pure water flux of 54 6 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 with a blending ratio of 70 30 pvc pan pakbaz and maghsoud 75 fabricate pvc pan blend membranes with various pan contents and membrane with increased porosity and hydrophilicity was obtained at higher pan loading fig 18 it is reported that the contact angle of pure pvc membrane was 71 9 and reduced to 64 4 by adding 20 wt of pan similarly the porosity of 20 wt of pan has maximum porosity of 63 7 a similar effect of pan blending with pvc is reported by several researchers 67 146 179 180 it is interesting to note that the nitrile group cn of pan can be changed into the hydrophilic amide group conh2 or carboxyl cooh using alkaline hydrolysis fig 19 51 113 in this regard mei et al 113 uses sodium hydroxide naoh solution in the cb and determine the consequence of naoh on the performance of pan blended pvc membranes it found that membrane properties i e hydrophilicity and porosity and performance i e flux protein filtration and anti fouling enhance due to hydrolysis of pan in the presence of naoh it is also observed that mechanical properties like elongation at break and tensile strength reduce in the presence of naoh due to hydrolysis of pan details of properties and performance of pvc pan sio2 membrane in the presence of varying naoh concentrations are shown in fig 20 pakbaz and maghsoud 75 used naoh solution in the cb to synthesize pvc pan membrane and found improved pure water flux of 75 6 7 2 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 1 4 times higher than membrane fabricates in the water coagulation bath more recently ahmad et al 30 synthesized pvc pan pluronic f127 bentonite blended super wetting membrane in aqueous koh solution to separate oilfield produced water and accomplished unusually enhanced flux of 1760 55 l m 2 h 1 permeate flux of 790 12 with oil rejection 97 0 membrane with super wetting surface and the improved mechanical property was attained due to the hydrolysis of cn functional groups of pan into coo na in the presence of koh induced cb it is also concluded that the performance of pan blended pvc membrane synergized in the presence of koh cb compared to water cb hence the performance of pvc based membrane can be enhanced by blending pan alkali cb medium in addition to pan various other second polymer components are also blended with pvc to enhance their performance in another study the antifouling properties and performance of pvc chlorinated polyvinyl chloride cpvc membrane were further enhanced by liu et al 54 it is noted that membrane water permeability further enhances after the addition of the cpvc also complete flux recovery was achieved using bsa bovine serum albumin solution 1000 ppm after washing the poly vinyl butyral pvb was introduced by peng and sui 55 as an additional polymer component with pvc to enhance membrane hydrophilicity and performance compared to pvb and pvc membranes the blended membranes showed much better water flux and hydrophilicity but protein rejection decreased slightly peng et al 55 studied the miscibilities of pvc and pvb in dmac and found that the system is partially miscible elastic properties of pvc membrane were improved by introducing co poly butadiene acrylonitrile as the second polymer by islam et al 181 pvc psr membrane exhibits improved structural morphology and mechanical properties 68 the rejection of pvc psr membrane increases from 76 2 to 98 53 with a marginal decrease in pure water permeation at 2 0 wt psr concentration in cs pc is extensively used in various applications due to its excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability when blended pvc and pc a double bond oxygen atom in the pc chains leads to a hydrophilic membrane with improved antifouling properties 69 6 optimal synthesis and operation of pvc membranes membrane design factors e g pvc to additive ration type of solvent and non solvent membrane thickness type of additive and process operating variables e g feed composition and temperature trans membrane pressure play a significant role in the separation of wastewater 42 53 160 however it is difficult and costly to study the effect of membrane performance as a function of design and operating parameters by varying one parameter at a time because many experiments are involved as well there are complex interactions between the membrane variables which cannot be determined by varying them individually in this regard optimum design of experiments may be a potential tool to establish the relationship between operating variables and or response variables with membrane performance i e permeate flux rejection and fouling resistance properties it is a quick and straightforward method as a minimum number of experiments are required to determine the individual and interaction effect of various design and operating factors however the application of experimental design tools to optimize the pvc based membrane performance is limited and very little work is reported in the literature 30 57 92 183 in this regard ahmad et al 92 employed five factor i e pvc and bentonite concentration membrane thickness feed ph and tmp response surface method rsm studies based on central composite design ccd to minimize the number of experiments for optimal performance of the pvc based membrane it is observed that maximum permeability i e 425 5 l m 2 h 1 was achieved at relatively low pvc loading and membrane thickness and high bentonite loading tmp and ph on the other hand rejection of i e 99 7 increases at low tmp and ph and higher membrane thickness and pvc loading the above results suggest a contradictory relation between flux and rejection as shown in fig 21a hence a non dominated sorting genetic algorithm is used to determine the optimal relation between flux and rejection fig 21a a decision maker may choose the suitable flux from fig 21a and b shows the value of the corresponding optimal variable a similar rsm approach is also adopted by ahmad et al 30 57 in their another study to maximize the membrane performance by considering design and operative variables like pvc loading pluronic f127 loading bentonite loading feed ph feed temperature and pan loading pluronic f127 loading bentonite loading respectively 7 commercial pvc membranes the global membrane treatment market size was estimated at 19 6 billion usd in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12 2 from 2020 to 2028 184 in this regard commercially available membranes are primarily prepared from polymeric materials like pes pan pvdf and psf whereas the application of pvc is limited compared to other polymers 185 189 however hollow fiber configuration commercially synthesized pvc based membranes are used for the purification of wastewater in this regard hongtek filtration co ltd china chiwatec water treatment technology china suzhou litree purifying technology co ltd china wuhan aqucell membrane technology co china philos co south korea are the manufacturing and supply of commercial pvc membranes it is noted that commercial application of pvc based membranes is limited for hollow fiber configuration for uf however there is a scope for pvc based membranes to use in the fabrication of flat sheet membranes for uf and nf applications table 9 summarizes the examples of commercial pvc based membranes available in the market with their characteristics 8 challenge and future outlook the main challenges during the treatment of wastewater using polymeric membranes are to synthesize low cost high performing anti fouling membranes having high flux with permitted discharge limit membrane fouling decreases the membrane lifetime and reduces the permeate flux at constant trans membrane pressure 25 26 however the high hydrophilic polymeric membrane can effectively treat wastewater with reduced membrane fouling as most wastewater is water hence the development of a cost efficient super hydrophilic polymeric membrane is required for real world application for wastewater separation a super hydrophilic membrane may exhibit maximum fouling resistance with a dynamic contact angle 10 this is achieved by advancing the surface of the membranes to reduce the water contact angle as much as possible moreover the surface morphology of the membrane also has a remarkable influence on wastewater separation 23 127 pvc membrane with a rough surface small pore size with narrow distribution and increased pore density can be fabricated by controlling the non solvent and solvent demixing rate 30 57 to develop a high efficiency membrane cost effective membrane material with great hydrophilicity must be synthesized therefore the fabrication of a low cost super hydrophilicity membrane is crucial for advancing the high efficiency membrane in the case of membrane modification especially in the existence of inorganic nanoparticles in the cs agglomeration in the membrane structure due to obstructs in forming a homogenous solution is the main problem agglomeration of additives reduces the membrane performance as it reduces the flow surface area 174 dispersion of additives in cs depends on their size and shape 190 a spherical nanoparticle with particle size 100 nm restrains both aggregation and agglomeration due to better dispersion in the cs compared to polyhedral nanoparticles 191 in terms of the economic aspect the development of pvc based membranes is carried out using expensive nanoparticles like hmo hao al2o3 and tio2 which remains an obstacle in their commercial application in addition the use of various carbon based materials like cnts and graphene in the pvc membrane for wastewater separation is limited hence the synthesis of pvc membrane with low cost hydrophilic additives using simple method is the option to produce a cost effective membrane with improved morphology and performance apart from membrane material membrane lifetime also affects the cost of the membrane by increasing membrane replacement chemical and labor costs these costs may be reduced by minimizing membrane cleaning for synthesized antifouling membranes hence the development of low cost materials is required for the polymeric ufm to be commercialized in the future in addition the surface of pvc membrane can be improved effectively for enhancing their performance for wastewater treatment using several physical and chemical surface modification techniques however the application of surface modification technique for pvc based membranes is limited improvement of both flux and rejection at the same time is difficult as they are mutually antagonistic processes 29 however by reducing the surface pore size and increasing the density of the surface pores both permeate flux and oil rejection can simultaneously be improved the above mention membrane properties may be achieved by regulating the non solvent and solvent demixing rate using different solvents and non solvent by changing solvent or non solvent in the coagulation bath the demixing rate may be controlled due to a change in the interaction of solvent and non solvent most researchers synthesized flat sheet pvc membrane and their performance was evaluated using dead end type filtration suitable to handle a small volume of wastewater this situation becomes more complex when handling larger volumes of water which occurs when laboratories are scaled up to commercial studies for the successful treatment of large volumes of wastewater it is essential that studies in the laboratory are scaled up to pilot plants and commercial plants to maintain almost identical performance reproducing laboratory results at the pilot or commercial scale is a very challenging task 9 conclusions this article focused on the treatment of wastewater generated from different industries via pvc based membrane and the development in the hydrophilic modifications of pvc based membrane was comprehensively reviewed it is concluded that pvc is an excellent membrane material for the synthesis of the membrane due to its excellent properties including low cost good thermal stability good stiffness high mechanical strength high resistance to chlorine bases and acids compared to other base polymers in terms of the pvc based membrane fabrication method nips is frequently employed the fabrication condition such as pvc concentration in the cs choice and composition of non solvent in the cb nature of solvent in the cs type of additives affected the membrane morphology and performances a major limitation of pvc based membrane application i e membrane fouling for wastewater separation has been highlighted and concluded that membrane anti fouling could be enhanced by blending different additives as well as surface modification of the membrane in this regard low cost pvc may be used as membrane material blended with additives like amphiphilic copolymers inorganic nanoparticles hydrophilic polymer additive and second polymers pvp and peg are frequently utilized as hydrophilic polymer additives at the same time silver alumina oxide zinc oxide titanium dioxide iron oxide silica dioxide hydrous manganese oxide halloysite nanotubes bentonite and graphene oxide are frequently employed for the fabrication and modification of pvc based membranes likewise amphiphilic copolymers such as pluronic f 127 pvc g pegma poly vc co pegma pes g pegma pmma g peg pvc g poly 3 sulfopropyl methacrylate and p mma b maa may be used to modify pvc based membranes blending a second polymer like pan ca glycerol cpvc psr pvf and pc with pvc is also an exciting way of improving the performance of pvc based membranes it is also concluded that the mechanical strength of the pvc based membrane also increases in the presence of an additive hence enhancing its lifetime declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13169,applying advanced oxidation processes aops in sludge dewatering to improve sludge treatment disposal and environmental protection has attracted much interest due to the difficulties arising in extracellular polymeric substances eps degradation during the sludge dewatering process oxidants can produce different types of free radicals and exert specific oxidation effects through different action mechanisms on water saturated sludge this plays an important role in sludge dewatering sludge minimization and removal of different types of micropollutants and or their transformation the current review critically evaluates the role of aop in improving the efficiency of sludge dewatering characteristics of advanced oxidation methods applied to sludge dewatering are systematically illustrated through different mechanisms using free radical reactions and various sludge dewatering conditions factors which impact on influencing the minimization of sludge and removals of typical micropollutants during the sludge conditioning process are also analyzed finally applications of advanced oxidation methods in the future are proposed based on a technoeconomic analyses of dewatering efficiency and operation cost this review provides theoretical support regarding the application of advanced oxidation processes in sludge dewatering and avenues for practical engineering in the current review it is determined that the efficiency of aop for the improvement of sludge dewatering micropollutants removal and sludge minimization in the treatment and disposal of sludge have been

advanced oxidation processes sludge dewatering oxidants free radicals sludge conditioning 1 introduction in tandem with the world s rising population the number of municipal wastewater treatment plants is increasing year by year it is estimated that 60 million tons of wet sludge is produced per year in china and needs extensive treatment facilities for proper handling 1 the large amounts of activated sludge which are produced as an intermediate product from traditional activated sludge processes have become a critical problem 2 4 high moisture content of sludge increases its total volume which will further increase the costs involved in transportation treatment and disposal it is therefore important to reduce the sludge moisture before treatment and final disposal sludge dewatering can become a meaningful process reduce sludge volume and diminish the area occupied by sludge this process has great significance for environmental protection and land use 5 7 furthermore excessive pollutant accumulation in the sludge during the process of wastewater purification by heavy metals hormones endocrine disrupting compounds edc pathogens pg tetracyclines tc persistent organic pollutants pops poses significant downstream risk especially in the context of resource recovery through sludge valorization 8 10 for this reason it is urgent to apply effective and economic measures to achieve not only efficient sludge dewatering outcomes but also reasonable degradation of large quantities of sludge pollutants to ensure a safe recovered material sludge resource for integration into circular innovation ecosystems in recent years many useful conditioning methods classified as physical chemical or biological methods have been employed to improve the physicochemical and biochemical properties of sludge to achieve effective reduction of both sludge mass and volume and subsequent utilization of sludge resources 5 11 15 advanced oxidation process aop being a typical chemical conditioning method produces free radicals with a strong oxidation effect free radicals are produced using various oxidants while different oxidants are selected to produce diverse free radicals with these reaction mechanisms being obviously distinct hydrogen peroxide h2o2 16 persulfate 17 ferrate 18 permanganate 19 and ozone o3 20 are commonly used oxidants in existing research this includes hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 superoxide radical o2 ferrate radical feo4 2 and ozone radical o3 that would become respective in order to facilitate the reaction in the process of oxidation extracellular polymeric substances eps the main component of sludge could promote the flocculation of sludge for its ingredients 21 however excessive eps content would bring about extremely deteriorated dewatering outcomes for the hydrophily and the strong intermolecular forces 21 23 hence decreasing the content of eps and increasing the eps hydrophobicity are beneficial to the removal of water it is anticipated eps will be effectively hydrolyzed by the oxidation effect of aop thus weakening the strong binding ability of eps and releasing the strongly bonded water from sludge resulting in the improvement of sludge dewaterability 24 26 in aop a number of pollutants in sludge can be degraded or transformed simultaneously the binding state of metal ions can be transformed into a free state through the actions of free radicals the generation of odors can be diminished and persistent organic compounds and hormone substances can be degraded effectively 20 27 28 therefore aop has in recent times attracted the attention of researchers because of its efficient economical and environmentally friendly character in this paper we critically address the application of different oxidation methods for improved sludge dewatering and provide a related economic analysis of their utility in sludge dewatering and micropollutant removal we found all free radicals oh so4 o2 feo4 2 and o3 exert oxidation effect on organic matters and heavy metals leading to the minimization of sludge and the removal of micropollutants from sludge system notably oh and so4 are more advantageous to improve sludge dewaterability however the geographical conditions application purpose economic development level and climatic circumstance should be considered before the choice of oxidants and aop methods this review could provide new ideas for researchers and make them pay more attention to the study of new method of free radical production rather than focusing excessively on existing method or adding too much catalyst to the original method this will make it possible to develop new methods with better dewatering efficiency that are more economical and protect the environment better 2 correlation between sludge composition and sludge dewatering 2 1 the composition of sludge moisture sludge has a very complex structure composition in addition to different organic matter or inorganic solids and most of the volume is composed of water and consequently sludge has a high moisture content 2 29 hence the water in sludge can be reasonably classified according to the difficulty of removal and its proportion and specific properties can be explored 30 early research on the water composition of sludge classified water content in sludge into free water and bound water 30 with the deepening of the research on sludge moisture content simply dividing the moisture components into two categories no longer helps researchers to understand and predict the dehydration mechanism and some pretreatment methods related to sludge conditioning coagulation flocculation ultrasound etc 30 therefore sludge water is now divided into four categories namely free water 31 interstitial water 32 surface water and hydration or internal water in the recent research and corresponding discussions the categories of sludge moisture are shown in fig 1 usually interstitial water surface water and hydration or internal water are generally referred to as bound water 30 33 35 in these four kinds of sludge water firstly free water is unaffected by solid particles and it includes the water in the pores but unaffected by capillary force and free water which can account for approximately 70 of the total water 31 secondly interstitial water is the water that is trapped inside the crevices and interstitial spaces of flocs and organisms 32 thirdly surface water is the water which holds on to the surface of solid particles by adsorption and adhesion 30 fourthly hydration or internal water is the water which is tightly bound to the solids and difficult to remove by mechanical methods 30 although the above classification of water content in sludge is accepted by most researchers it does not fully involve the impact of the eps compositions which also constitutes activated sludge therefore how to classify the water composition of sludge more correctly or more appropriately remains to be explored 2 2 the composition and characteristics of eps eps are composed of carbohydrates proteins humic substances and nucleic acids which account for the majority of cell organic material and the presence of a large number of carbohydrates and proteins does lead to the strong hydrophilic properties of eps eps are usually divided into three categories according to the structure and physical state soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps 30 36 the components of eps and the construction of bacteria is shown in fig 2 there exists an important effective factor of eps in that it can affect sludge thickening and dewatering processes 37 furthermore several studies found that polysaccharide and protein contribute to the positive and negative charges of eps respectively 38 40 correspondingly the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and surface charge of sludge flocs depend on the content ratio of polysaccharide and protein in eps 41 protein is the main existing substance that contributes to the high water retaining capacity of eps so reducing the protein content in eps can improve the sludge dehydration capacity 42 the humic substances and nucleic acids exert no significant effect on sludge dewaterability 21 some studies have shown that the sludge dewatering ability improves as the eps content drops 32 43 lower eps content is more conducive to sludge flocculation and dewatering as it makes the cells bind more tightly 37 there are two binding mechanisms between eps and water molecules electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds the former is active between the permanent dipoles of water and the functional groups of eps 30 the latter are active between eps hydroxyl groups and water molecules 44 the existence of eps will generate a certain space force to prevent contact between cells and the inability of the cells to contact each other makes it impossible to reasonably condense floc in the dehydration process 45 this decreases the ability of solid liquid separation thus reducing the dehydration efficiency eps can also form a stable gel that prevents water seepage from the pores of flocs which deteriorates the ability of sludge dewatering 45 2 3 strategies for improving sludge dewaterability the composing proportion of different water within the sludge directly affects the efficiency of sludge dewatering free water is easier to remove than the other three because it is hardly affected by sludge solids however the content of bound water is one of the most important factors affecting sludge dewatering 29 30 usually free water and a portion of bound water can be removed in sewage treatment plant and such a dewatering process also requires high investment operational costs using heavy compression pressure how to remove bound water and other potential types of water more economically will be the main problem generally there exists typical measures to further release water 1 to destruct eps and sludge cell directly 2 to reduce the hydrophilic of eps or to decrease the strong bonding force between eps and bound water to make the bound water into free water in order to achieve these goals sludge conditioning is applied to change characteristics of eps and cell before sludge dewatering process sludge conditioning can be divided into physical conditioning 46 50 chemical conditioning 51 54 biological conditioning 55 57 and the combination 58 60 between these methods these methods generally include coagulation 61 62 ultrasonication 63 64 pyrolysis 46 65 advanced oxidation 66 67 and bioleaching etc the release and transformation of the bound water and intracellular water of course reduces the proportion of water which is difficult to remove but applying an increase of free water ratio to sludge dewatering does not mean that the dewaterability of sludge improves it is reported by ruiz hernando et al 69 that the applications of the ultrasonic wave heat and alkali would have after effects on sludge with the percentage of bound water content increasing but did not undermine the ability of sludge dewatering instead sludge dewatering became successful therefore sludge moisture requires further investigation for transformation strategies and practical applications 3 principles of different advanced oxidation methods advanced oxidation is one of the most efficient and promising technologies which is widely used in the water treatment industry 70 for sludge treatment and disposal in wastewater treatment plants advanced oxidation is usually employed as a pretreatment technology 44 there are various methods to conduct advanced oxidation by producing either different or the same free radicals 3 1 hydrogen peroxide based advanced oxidation processes hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a common oxidant is widely utilized in the advanced oxidation process 71 strong oxidative hydroxyl radicals oh formed in h2o2 plays an important role in water treatment for example it can inactivate bacteria during the disinfection process and release water by oxidizing the eps of sludge during sludge dewatering process 72 the oh can destroy the cell walls of microorganisms or bacteria enhance cell membrane permeability and conformably break the cell walls so that the intracellular water could be released from the cells 73 in general fe2 is used as a catalyst to produce oh with strong oxidizability when h2o2 is used as an oxidizing agent 74 the reaction of fe2 with h2o2 to produce oh is often referred to as the common fenton method 75 the oh production from the fenton method can be achieved through the decomposition of h2o2 catalyzed by the fe2 eq 1 74 in the meantime a fenton like process occurred when fe3 ions exist following by the formation of fe2 ions for the fenton process eq 2 70 besides the generated fe3 also reacts with the water h2o in the solution after which fe2 and oh can also be produced eq 3 76 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 2 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 3 fe 3 h 2 o fe 2 oh h in the process of generating oh by fenton or fenton like methods fe2 makes a pivotal contribution to the initiation and processing of the reaction however if the ph solution rises in alkalinity after the generation of fe3 it has a certain influence which will lead to the precipitation of fe3 eq 4 at the same time if the addition of h2o2 is excessive the generation of oh will be hindered and lose oxidability 77 78 4 fe 3 oh fe oh 3 ultrasound us as a traditional physical pretreatment method can cooperate with the fenton process in assisting the activation of h2o2 to produce the oh in the us fenton process h2o2 and h2o will be decomposed and this favors the production of oh eqs 5 and 6 79 the cavitation effect can accelerate the fenton process which improves the transformation of fe3 to fe2 therefore the oh will be produced again through the fenton process in which the generated fe2 continues to grow 63 in the us fenton process the dosage of fe2 and h2o2 can be reduced resulting in shortened reaction times and improved efficiency 80 microwave mw as a common physical method is widely used in daily life in the water treatment industry mw method is often used to degrade organic matter or crack sludge floc 16 when mw is combined with h2o2 it can assist the decomposition of h2o2 into oh eq 7 which enables oh to execute strong oxidation 81 besides of the application of physical methods in conjunction with the fenton method or assisting in the production of oh the use of light photo fenton process may bring different effects and light is relatively easy to obtain 82 in the photo fenton process light is used to assist the production of oh the fe3 decreased in this reaction system and is transformed into fe2 to activate h2o2 to produce oh eq 8 83 when adding excessive h2o2 the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 can be produced by consuming oh eq 9 84 85 there is no positive effect on aop arising from the existence of ho2 5 ultrasound h 2 o 2 2oh 6 ultrasound h 2 o h oh 7 microwave h 2 o 2 2oh 8 fe 3 h 2 o hv fe 2 oh h 9 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o the high efficiency production of oh can not only reduce the dosage of catalyst i e fe2 but also shorten the reaction time which can decrease the volume of reaction tank in practical application hence these methods which could effectively promote the production of oh have the positive effects on the sludge dewatering process see section 4 2 3 2 sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes compared with the advanced oxidation process of hydrogen peroxide one of the advantages of sulfate radical oxidation method is that the raw material is solid and easy to transport and store there are some other excellent advantages of sulfate radical advanced oxidation processes sr aops such as a higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v a longer half life and a wider operative ph range 2 10 58 persulfate ps and peroxymonosulfate pms are usually employed as the oxidants to produce sulfate radical with respect to the activation of ps and pms there are three common methods involved in the generation of sulfate radicals i representative transition metal ii heat and iii ultraviolet irradiation methods the mechanisms of these three methods are shown in eqs 10 14 17 86 87 compared with pms the efficiency of ps in the activation process is superior to that of pms 88 when using metal ions to activate pms or ps free homogeneous cobalt ii can significantly activate pms while iron ii ions play a valuable role in activating ps 89 generally speaking thermal activation can promote the generation of so4 in pms system 67 90 and also produce oh at the same time eq 15 91 which has a dual promoting effect on the oxidation of the target however excessive addition of pms has a negative effect on the oxidation of the system reducing the generation of so4 free radicals with effective oxidation eqs 16 17 92 94 10

the microwave radiation method also can effectively promote the reaction of activating the production of sulfate radical so as to enhance the efficiency of aop at the same time it achieves the objective of delving into optimal processing 58 microwave induced persulfate could generate so4 efficiently through microwave power or microwave temperature controls as shown in eq 18 95 while increasing the amount of so4 by combining microwave radiation continuously increasing the amount of ps will still reduce the content of effective so4 eq 19 96 97 consequently when choosing different methods to produce effective free radicals the dosage amount is an important factor 98 under the combination of microwave irradiation common granular activated carbon gac can catalyze the reaction system observably to produce so4 at the same time the persulfate microwave system can regenerate gac and improve the utilization rate of gac herein the hot spots of pollutant absorbed gac enable the degradation performance to be efficient in terms of taking only seconds eqs 20 and 21 54 99 18 s 2 o 8 2 microwave 2so 4 19 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 20 ac surface ooh s 2 o 8 2 so 4 hso 4 ac

substrate to avoid excessive waste of materials similar to oh the use of so4 can also improve the dewatering capacity of sludge see section 4 2 3 3 permanganate ferrate and ozone oxidation methods recent research and applications have popularized the application of h2o2 and ps pms as substrates after adding catalyst to produce oh and so4 in advanced oxidation processes additionally potassium permanganate oxidation ferrate oxidation and ozone oxidation can also serve as reliable oxidation methods in aop the use of fe ii kmno4 can have an efficient effect in water purification which consists both of oxidation and flocculation capacities concerning organic matter and it has been already widely used in the high algal water and arsenic containing water treatments 41 100 under the catalysis of fe2 kmno4 can react with it to form strong oxidizing manganese dioxide mno2 eq 22 101 the o2 which has the strong capacity of oxidizing can be generated sustainably by various mno2 polymorphs in the dark eq 23 102 with reference to application the potassium permanganate oxidation method can effectively improve sludge dewatering 49 the fe ii kmno4 system can be combined with pyrolysis sludge based carbon sbc 100 to construct the fe mn sbc system aiming to effectively adsorb as iii from groundwater and repair groundwater pollution 49 22 fe 2 kmno 4 fe 3 mno 2 23 o 2 mn iii o 2 mn iv in recent decades ferrate vi has been applied in the field of water treatment as a strong oxidant and disinfectant because of the iron in 6 oxidation state 18 51 103 the oxidation mechanism is the strong oxidation effect of ferrate during the reduction of high iron eq 24 104 the oxidation capacity of ferrate vi is highly dependent on the ph water constituents type and concentration of contaminants 105 106 simultaneously ferrate vi has flocculation function when it is reduced to iron ions or iron hydroxide ferrate vi acts as an economical energy saving and environmental protection chemical reagent 107 108 in the latest research wu et al 104 found that when the ferrate vi system was formed using a combination of uv and ferrate vi the oxidation capacity became stronger and superoxide radical o2 could be produced this has a more significant effect on the degradation of phenolic pollutants 24 2feo 4 2 5h 2 o 2fe 3 10 oh 1 5o 2 ozone is a strong oxidizing substance usually used in pre oxidation and advanced oxidation processes ozone can also be employed as a catalyst to catalyze h2o2 and pms in order to generate radical oh eq 25 24 and so4 eq 26 with a strong oxidation effect it was found that lepidocrocite γ feooh with surface hydroxyl groups can catalyze ozonation to generate hydroxyl radicals which would further participate in the removal of organic matter 109 the process was described as reactions shown in eqs 27 30 109 25 2o 3 h 2 o 2 2oh 3o 2 26 o 3 pms o 2 so 4 27 feooh o 3 feooh o 3 s 28 feooh o 3 s feo ho 3 o 3 29 feo h 2 o feoh oh 30 o 3 h 2 o oh o 2 oh in addition to promoting the production of corresponding free radicals i e oh and so4 by h2o2 and ps pms o3 also could directly oxidize organic matters relying on its strong oxidation performance hence the use of o3 is wide in aops in the process of sludge dewatering functional free radicals generated in different oxidants could leads to the destruction of sludge eps and cell meanwhile it has positive significance for the transformation of bound water and intracellular water into free water all these aop methods have good applicability and the selection needs to be optimized according to specific environmental conditions and equipment conditions to achieve the desired outcome 4 aop conditioning in sludge dewatering 4 1 effects of aop conditioning on sludge eps and sludge water 4 1 1 degradation of eps in the process of sludge dewatering even if a lot of pressure is required to compress the sludge it is difficult to remove the water due to the strong binding force see section 2 2 subsequently too much water is retained in the sludge resulting in poor dewatering efficiency aops can produce strong oxidizing free groups oh so4 o2 etc which can oxidize eps and destroy sludge floc 70 the components proteins polysaccharides lipids etc of eps are oxidized to soluble organic substances or water by free radicals exerting a strong oxidation effect resulting in damage and rupture to eps of sludge cell in this way the eps content declines 81 meanwhile the functional groups in sludge eps are oxidized by free radicals oh so4 o2 etc which firstly reduces the degree of π electron systems secondly decreases the number of aromatic rings and conjugated bonds in a chain structure and thirdly converts a linear ring system to a non linear ring system 93 110 during this period the collapse of eps results in the destruction of sludge matrix and the easier oxidation of microorganism cells 23 the oxidizing free groups oh so4 o2 etc can penetrate the microbial wall then improve the permeability of cell membranes and destroy the uniformity of cell walls thus the intracellular water in sludge cell can be released out of the water environment 94 all these contribute to improving sludge dewaterability the mechanism of aop conditioning in sludge cell disruption is depicted in fig 3 while the mechanism of how aop modulates sludge dewatering is shown in fig 4 notably the breakage of eps would result in the increase of low molecular weight organic matter in the liquid phase of sludge and deteriorate the efficiency of sludge dewatering because of the blocking of channels for water discharge 111 accordingly coagulants flocculants are usually used to weaken the negative influence of low molecular weight organic matter and guarantee the improvement of sludge dewaterability hence the choices of oxidants or catalytic methods which could play both oxidation and flocculation performances are worth studying in the future 4 1 2 transformation of sludge water the aop usually influences on the moisture content of sludge this is explained in more detail below since free water is not affected by sludge solids the aop has no effect on the content of original free water bound water has a certain ability to interact with solid particles therefore advanced oxidation methods focus on the role of sludge solids aop can change the form of water adhesion as well as the binding capacity of water in sludge solids damage of the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds so as to alter the nature of the combined water making the it isolated from solid particles and transferred into free water as shown in fig 3 after the action of free radicals oh so4 o2 etc with high oxidation capacity the sludge eps are broken down and the cell membrane is ruptured destruction of eps proteins and oxidation of polysaccharide the water bound to proteins and polysaccharides in the eps is released and water inside the cell is then released into the external environment at the same time as the main components of eps are protein and polysaccharide substances this organic matter oxidizes into carbon dioxide and water afterwards oxidation thus increasing the water content in the sludge moreover this increase in water content is free water which can be easily removed in the case of advanced oxidation methods being combined with other physical chemical or biological conditioning methods the change in the moisture composition of the sludge also arises the methods of using ultrasonic 79 adding acid or alkali 112 using uv 104 etc can also damage sludge cells and promote the release of intracellular water or moisture in the eps the combination of these methods applying advanced oxidation can effectively realize dual functions including the release of water in the cells of sludge and a greater proportion of bound water turning into free water so as to improve the ability of sludge dewatering utilization of combined methods should consider reasonable selection as per according to environmental and experimental conditions in order to maximize effects numerous approaches and or observation reduction analysis have their own unique requirements and this enables researchers to make reasonable decisions choosing the most economical and applicable method will make this technology become more widely accepted 4 2 sludge dewaterability post aop conditioning three parameters are mainly used in evaluating sludge dewatering performance including capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filterability srf and water content wc additionally zeta potential is also occasionally applied here the effects of aop on sludge dewatering are summarized in table 1 and these operating conditions then refer to table 2 using fe2 or fe3 as the catalyst to catalyze h2o2 to produce oh radical as the functional group is generally called fenton or fenton like process see section 3 1 the fenton process can effectively improve the dewatering efficiency of sludge for example masihi and badalians gholikandi 113 investigated the effect of the fenton process in sludge dewatering the moisture of sludge cake reduced from 97 6 to 71 with dosages of fe and h2o2 at 75 mg g ds and 50 mg g ds under ph of 6 87 meanwhile the srf of sludge was reduced by 85 3 compared with the original sludge additionally lime was utilized as the skeleton material which played a positive role in the construction of the sludge conveyance channel for water discharge using fenton or fenton like method directly produced oh to oxidize sludge leading to the damage of sludge cell and decrease of bound water promoting the enhance of sludge dewaterability with the decline of srf and water content of filtered cake the fenton method can also be combined with the electrochemical method which can generate strong destructive power by electric current 113 electric current could penetrate sludge cell accelerating the breakage of sludge flocs and shortening reaction time it is worth noting that with the assistance of electrochemical fenton method the water content of the mud cake and sludge can be further reduced and the dosage of h2o2 and fe2 was even lower 113 the us approach can also have a good effect combined with the use of the fenton method in the us fenton process the 1 5 h us reaction time at a ph of 3 with 0 2 g l of fe2 and 0 25 g l of h2o2 the cst and srf indicated reductions of 84 95 and 97 04 respectively 80 external energy input i e electricity heat and magnetism can not only improve the generation capacity of oh but also reduce the dosage of reagent i e substrate and catalyst in practical application the employment of external energy could decrease the area to store corresponding reagent and save relevant construction cost however the cost of corresponding input energy would be increased considering biochar bc has a certain adsorption effect which could promote the agglomeration of sludge flocs and widen holes among sludge flocs for water discharge easily tao et al 114 studied the effects of iron rich biochar combined with h2o2 on the sludge dewatering capacity the iron contained in biochar combines with h2o2 which can accelerate fenton reactions in the reaction process red mud was put into it as a certain skeleton material the wc of the mud cake decreased from 96 49 to 46 38 following this cst and srf decreased by 90 24 and 98 01 respectively and h2o2 biochar and red mud were added in amounts of 0 072 0 792 and 0 750 g g vs at ph 2 respectively the addition of biochar increased channels for water discharge which promoted the outflow of more sludge water under the same pressure in the dewatering process so that enhanced the dewatered efficiency apart from h2o2 there are other novel approaches to producing oh yu et al 66 applied oh generated by fe ii ca clo 2 to improve the ability of sludge dewatering with the dosage of fe ii and ca clo 2 at 106 1 and 234 5 mg g vs respectively the wc of sludge was effectively reduced from 98 4 to 64 9 and cst and srf were also reduced by 83 03 and 94 74 respectively in this system lesser viable cells can be found because of the high efficiency oxidizing capacity of oh but sludge flocs were integrated it is regarded as intracellular oxidation hence the oxidation was mainly due to the existence of oh in the reaction system and the production of oh has various ways in the aop so4 also has a certain effect on sludge dewatering the wc of the sludge decreased significantly and the cst and srf of the sludge both decreased to some extent when a certain amount of pms and fe2 were added 26 52 compared with fe2 zero valent iron zvi has a more significant catalytic effect on pms under acidic conditions zvi could effectively reduce the wc of the mud cake but had a negative effect on the reduction of cst 26 at the same time the combination of zvi and ps greatly improved the sludge dewatering performance 115 mw and thermal activation as the methods of external energy input could activate the sulfate radical availably zhen et al 116 applied mw as a pretreatment to fe ii ps system through using 500 w mw irradiation lasting for 180 s to break down the sludge flocs facilitating more efficient follow up the results indicated that cst was reduced by 94 6 through adding the dosage of ps and fe2 at 0 5 mmol g ts and 0 4 mmol g ts respectively the use of mw shortened the reaction time accelerated the breakage of sludge flocs and further improved the dewaterability guo et al 27 used the thermal activation method to activate ps meanwhile free radicals were generated to effectively oxidize sludge the wc of sludge decreased to 42 6 and the effect of enhancing the dewatering capacity was obvious high temperature can affect the survival activities of sludge and damage sludge cell to release organic matter and intracellular water however the system required the application of heat to 70 c which consumed a large amount of energy therefore choosing reasonable method to enhance the production of radicals is significant to control excess input of energy and fund compared to oh so4 also has strong oxidation notably catalyzing stimulating ps pms can not only produce so4 but also produce oh see section 3 2 it is beneficial to elevating oxidation rate at the same time saving the quantities of used reagents among the advanced oxidation methods ferrates and permanganates can also produce groups that are identical to the strong oxidation effect of oh and so4 radicals fe2 and zvi have catalytic effects on potassium permanganate enabling it to produce mno2 with oxidation in the intermediate valence state 49 101 following sludge treatment the wc cst and srf of sludge can be reduced efficiently and the effect is stronger than that of kmno4 alone 19 similarly applying heat treatment or acid treatment prior to oxidant action was proved to be effective reducing the moisture content to as low as 59 32 101 it can be seen that permanganates itself has a certain oxidation capacity and the catalytic system could improve the ability of permanganates oxidation under acidic and neutral conditions the addition of ferrate can reduce the wc of sludge without assistance with catalytic reagents when biochar was used as skeleton material the wc reduced less than 60 25 117 hence it is obvious that the use of ferrate needs to control suitable ph value to make the addition of ferrate useful the maintained ph value would increase the use of acid alkaline and create extra expense ozone is generally used as a catalytic substance to catalyze h2o2 to produce oh and ozone itself has a certain oxidation capacity the wc of sludge can decrease down to 60 and the cst can be reduced by nearly 80 when ozone and chitosan were combined for the condition of sludge revealing an efficient outcome 118 in this ozone chitosan system eps and sludge cell were damaged by ozone at the same time chitosan as the coagulant could increase sludge flocs size to enhance dewatering ability accordingly reasonable control of o3 dosage could both stimulate its catalytic and oxidation performance in summary different free radicals oh so4 o2 etc all have good performances on enhancing sludge dewaterability in contrast oh is more helpful for the reduction of srf and sludge water content and the dosages of h2o2 and relevant catalysts were lower than using other oxidants notably the oxidation of so4 was second only to oh at the same time external energy input was obvious to promoting oxidation of free radicals and decreased the addition of corresponding reagents it was not obvious that the addition of permanganate ferrate and ozone alone promoted the improvement of corresponding dewatering indexes in these systems relevant catalytic means should be employed to play the potential levels of oxidation of radicals 4 3 sludge minimization post aop conditioning sludge minimization is realized by the disintegration mineralization and ablation of sludge 119 aops act as a strong method to achieve the objective exerting a conspicuous effect on it the disintegration of sludge is caused by the key factor high oxidizing free radical action in the process of advanced oxidation under the oxidation of free radicals the extracellular polymer of sludge breaks down and the soluble organic matter content increases while the content of the dense extracellular polymer decreases and the damaged cells also lead to the release of intracellular organic matter which aggravates the significant increase of soluble organic matter 70 meanwhile this process will not encourage the formation of more organic compounds and the increase the difficultly removed water content this is illustrated in fig 5 where the mechanism of aop conditioning in sludge minimization is expressed the free radicals such as oh so4 o3 o2 etc would have the initial roles to decrease the total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss mixed liquid suspended solids mlss total chemical oxygen demand tcod the average particle size and dissolve organic carbon doc but increase the soluble cod scod to achieve sludge minimization 70 the effects of aop which support these high efficiency free radicals in sludge minimization are summarized in table 3 doc of lb eps and tb eps decreased widely when adding h2o2 and fe2 at 25 mg g ds and 15 mg g ds respectively 113 this phenomenon also occurs in the electrochemical fenton process and the decline in doc around tb eps showed a stronger effect than lb eps 40 and 61 6 reduction could be achieved in this process respectively the decrease of doc could weaken the negative effects of organic matters on sludge dewatering process insuring the use of unobstructed channels for water discharge similarly the vss of sludge and the scod of the mixture also significantly changed in electrochemical fenton process the decline in vss and the increase in scod were 36 89 and 539 19 respectively 120 these results indicated a powerful change in the scod s increase and suggested that oxidation can effectively destroy the extracellular polymer and intracellular organic matter resulting in their release into the mixture and further enhance the dewaterability of sludge 120 121 not only fenton and fenton like reactions with oh acting groups but the potassium ferrates associated with sulfate radicals have the same ability as well in the study by badalians gholikandi et al 122 the vs decreased by 42 while scod increased by 1250 mg l when using 0 75 mmol l pms and 12 5 mmol l o3 at ph of 11 ps can also serve as the substrate however it is not as effective as pms it has been confirmed that ph is of great importance by changing the activity of so4 122 thus it is important to control the ph value in aops to make the oxidation of free radicals useful zhang et al 53 assessed the effect of potassium ferrate pf with ocl and oh which were catalysts in the sludge minimization and found that mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss decreased by 59 and 73 respectively these percentages demonstrated the excellent outcome concerning sludge minimization which was also confirmed by wu et al 123 the decrement of mlss and mlvss also indicated that the good effect of aops in sludge reduction promoting the cutback of sludge quantity ozone usually acts as a catalyst for oxidation meanwhile it is a strong oxidant itself ge et al 118 used o3 to disintegrate sludge and their findings showed that the tscod totally soluble cod increased by 432 8 exhibiting an effective degradation of organic matter in addition to the visualized performance of the sludge reduction index the average size and viscosity of the sludge assisted greatly with sludge minimization it is shown in table 2 that potassium permanganate conditioning and potassium ferrate treatment could reduce the average particle size of sludge 19 25 in general the measured d 50 represents the average particle size of sludge the much reduced particle size revealed that the sludge flocs were destroyed and fine particles were released the application of fe2 persulfate tannic acid ta could decrease the sludge supernatant viscosity by approximately 86 7 112 viscosity of sludge supernatant explains the fluidity of sludge which is linked to the number of extracellular polymers in the cell the decline in sludge supernatant viscosity suggests two things the breaking up of sludge eps and the indirect disintegration of sludge accordingly sludge minimization could be achieved by adopting different radicals the decrement of eps content and the changes of physico chemical characteristics of sludge indicated the efficient oxidation of aop on sludge which was beneficial to achieving high efficiency sludge dewatering process 5 effects of aop conditioning on micropollutant removal 5 1 typical pollutants involved in sewage sludge sludge floc always contains a series of bacteria viruses and pollutants which would have certain adverse effects on subsequent sludge disposal and even bring serious diseases and illnesses 124 referring to the wastewater treatment process a large volume of sludge should be stored and transported it produces certain gases and volatile organic compounds which are released into the air generating odors that are harmful to human health 125 126 these gases would more or less damage the atmosphere 127 the control of odors emission is one of important aspects for sludge management in sewage plants currently many countries are gradually turning their attentions to environmental protection the solutions to heavy metals edc tc di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp etc in sludge have to be decisive 128 129 advances in science and technology coupled with massive improvements in people s living standards have made the requirements for water quality much stricter in recent years the standard of sewage water quality has gradually improved and more unknown edcs and emerging pops which are harmful to human health have been detected in sewage in particular the large amount of hormone utilization is aggravating wastewater treatment 8 130 as a class of pollutants with a significantly destructive effect on human and ecological environments it is of great importance to study hormones especially the estrogens which are the most typical pollutants these include such as estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 8 therefore the degradation of harmful micropollutants from sludge system is vital to protect environment and human life 5 2 micropollutants removal post aop conditioning free groups produced through aops not only aid in eps hydrolysis but also exert a certain level of efficiency in removing pollutants contained in the sludge and a positive effect on the quality of water as we all know the water removed after sludge dewatering still needs to be treated and purified removing corresponding micropollutants in sludge sludge miscible liquids before dewatering could reduce the burden of subsequent water quality treatment and improve the subsequent use of sludge cake the effects of aop in the removal of pollutants in sludge conditioning process are summarized in table 4 secondary benefit of micropollutant elimination invites possibility to improve the biological safety of aop conditioned sludge for circular use e g fertilizer novel building materials the mechanism of aop conditioning in the removal of micropollutants is shown in fig 6 free radicals generated through aop have excellent abilities of pollutant removal such as organic micropollutants and the presence of it could reduce the environmental risk of various pollutants existing in sludge in general different radicals can be produced by various methods as mentioned in section 3 for the degradation of pops the remarkable effects could be achieved by both oh and so4 gan et al 131 reported that the pc removal rate reached 100 when using the fenton like process by adding biochar fenton rm as a catalyst producing a significant effect compared to oh tc could be removed efficiently by so4 wei et al 132 studied the removal efficiency of tc by adding ps catalyzed by bio hydrochar and the results showed that the removal efficiency of tc was as high as 99 72 m cresol is a kind of pops which is very harmful to human beings plants and animals yu et al 133 put forward a new method of catalytic wet peroxide oxidation process cwpo which was applied to reduce the amount of m cresol and the removal rate could reach 100 similarly liang et al 134 added biochar to the reaction system as the catalyst and removed 57 8 of phenol a type of pops in addition dehp can be removed efficiently by using the sab bc fe3o4 ps oxidation system 135 compared with oh and so4 permanganate ferrate and ozone have less research on the removal of pops according to the application in improving the efficiency of sludge dewatering we can speculated that it would not be obvious on the removal of pops by the radicals produced from permanganate ferrate and ozone for the degradation of edcs o2 generated by kmno4 also has a good impact on the removal of edcs besides oh and so4 using the fenton process the removal rates of e1 e2 ee2 and e3 achieved 70 90 84 and 98 respectively 77 sakulthaew and chokejaroenrat 136 investigated a mno4 candles oxidation process to reduce e2 and the removal rate reached 92 these results confirmed that the ion of permanganate also had a strong oxidation effect and can degrade micropollutants to a certain extent compared to the removal of pops and edcs noxious gases and volatile organic compounds could be cleared away by more free radicals liu et al 137 found that the us fenton process can reduce the content of s2 effectively with a removal rate of 53 5 ma et al 138 utilized the kmno4 pfc poly ferric chloride and pf oxidation process to investigate the removal rate on dimethyl trisulfide which is a source of odors these results showed that the pf oxidation process can remove 92 5 of dimethyl trisulfide which was more efficient than the kmno4 pfc process with a removal rate of 90 9 by this token feo4 2 was more useful than o2 on the elimination of odors as the origin of toxic odors dimethyl silanediol ds acetic acid aa and diisobutyl phthalate dp would damage the respiratory and nervous systems of people in the study of ma et al 20 o3 was applied to solve the problem of toxic odors and the removal rates of ds aa and dp were 12 4 12 and 8 4 respectively summary oxidants need to be selected according to specific types of odors when eliminating the gas produced by sludge additionally pollution by heavy metals has been a serious problem worldwide for many decades aop can reduce the amount of sludge and purify the final discharged water by oxidizing heavy metals and controlling the ph of the solution yu et al 10 utilized 0 25 g g ss pf to remove heavy metals from wastewater activated sludge and their results showed that the removal rates of cu zn ni pb cr and mg can reach 22 2 14 7 12 5 9 5 10 6 and 9 8 respectively andrews et al and zhu et al 68 139 used oh to remove heavy metals and achieved a better outcome unfortunately most studies focused on the industrial removal of heavy metals rather than the sludge system the low removal rate of heavy metals in sludge by aops may be one of the main reasons as a result the development of aop methods on removing heavy metals from sludge is limited no matter which free radical has the effective oxidation ability the aop is very convincing in its ability to remove pollutants during the aop sludge conditioning prior to dewatering however the pollutants removal rate of different radicals is different for this reason it is quite important for us to choose an optimal advanced oxidation method to treat pollutants efficiently in sewage or sludge in the future 6 economic considerations in order to apply aops to real life scenarios and make use of the advantages to solve practical engineering problems cost estimation must be considered advanced oxidation technology with excellent dewatering efficiency may not be socially acceptable if it is too expensive consequently it is necessary to ascertain the best method in terms of treatment efficiency and economic and environmental benefits based on the research that has been done on enhancing sludge dewatering by using advanced oxidation methods the available data were classified and analyzed this was done according to different free radicals and the relationship between total cost and dewatering efficiency which were clearly analyzed to explore its economic and treatment effects the economic analysis is summarized in table 5 as shown in table 5 free radicals can enhance the effect of sludge dewatering and reduce the water content wc of sludge hydroxyl radical oh demonstrated the best dewatering method compared with other free radicals nitrilotriacetic acid nta fe0 cao2 process reduced the wc to 40 68 which cost 63 5 t ds and the cost was higher than fenton s reagent cao process uta zvsi h2o2 cao process and electrochemical fenton process these two processes cost 61 2 t ds 49 5 t ds and 41 82 t ds respectively even though the electrochemical fenton process reduced the wc to 42 89 and was higher than that of the nta fe0 cao2 process the method can save 21 68 t ds compared to the latter considering the dewatering efficiency and the cost the electrochemical fenton process may be the best method to use in the actual sludge treatment system it is evident that the traditional fenton process meant spending more money on the dosage of the chemicals and had the worst efficiency of reducing wc in comparison with the other fenton processes or fenton like processes which are based on the oh function other free radicals with oxidation ability also greatly enhance sludge dewatering but they are all weaker than oh and the cost cannot be cheaper it is known from table 5 that the cost of persulfate zvi conditioning process and fe ii s2o8 2 zeolites pdadmac process were 416 1 t ds and 208 t ds respectively this is despite that fact that the methods were used for treating anaerobic sludge or the municipal sludge for a hypothetical population of 100 000 the higher cost of emissions should not be accepted due to inefficiency and the uneconomical nature of this process to find the best dewatering outcomes of advanced oxidation methods it is necessary to select a more suitable free radical according to the current studies better oxidation properties and more economical factors may contribute to scholars growing preference for the fenton process or fenton like process this is based on the emergence of new methods in which different catalysts are added or reaction conditions are changed although it has not been confirmed that whether other strong oxidizing free radicals have better dewatering and economic performance based on the obtained data further research is needed in the future similarly the relevant research on the economic analysis of potassium ferrate oxidation method and ozone oxidation method has not yet been undertaken subsequently it is difficult to confirm whether the methods are more economical which will be a subject for future studies to explore the premise is that advances in technology will help to develop satisfying economic and engineering practical conditions exploring better treatment efficiency and more economical methods are intrinsically linked 7 compared analysis of different radicals and prospect 7 1 compared analysis of different radicals 7 1 1 oxidizability all free radicals oh so4 o2 feo4 2 and o3 exert oxidation effect on organic matters and heavy metals leading to the minimization of sludge and the removal of micropollutants from sludge system for sludge minimization doc vss particle size etc decreased obviously after the function of different radicals see section 4 2 but the removal capacity and types of micropollutants were contrasting among different radicals see section 5 2 the underlying cause is the difference in oxidation potential the oxidation potentials of oh 2 8 v and so4 2 5 3 1 v are higher than other radicals o2 0 6 1 7 v feo4 2 2 2 v and o3 2 1 v resulting in the stronger oxidation to degrade more typical micropollutants from sludge system see table 4 58 140 141 additionally the oxidation capacity of radicals would be affected by selected catalysts and external energy input 7 1 2 application on sludge dewatering based on the oxidizability and measurements of relevant indexes of sludge dewatering srf cst and wc see section 4 2 oh and so4 are more advantageous to improve sludge dewaterability fortunately the minimization of sludge and the removal of micropollutants could achieve higher levels in the meantime other radicals own less satisfactory performance on sludge dewatering which can be attributed to the reason why researchers rarely study on these free radicals 7 1 3 economic analysis the applications of aop methods which could generate oh would cost lower funds in practical engineering see section 6 but the choice is not absolute for all applications of engineering the geographical conditions application purpose economic development level and climatic circumstance should be considered before the choice of oxidants and aop methods for example solid reagents would be the preferred choice for those places difficult to transport liquid reagents therefore so4 could be preferentially selected as the free radical rather than oh regarding the caparison between solid properties of pms ps and liquid properties of h2o2 7 2 prospect the aops can greatly improve sludge dewatering performance free radicals with advanced oxidation function play an important role in destroying cells oxidizing organic matter releasing intracellular water degrading pollutants in sludge and decreasing the content of binding water it should be noted that the dewatering process is difficult to implement the fenton process and fenton like process which are the most widely used methods at present are characterized by their highly efficient oxidation capacity and reasonable economic benefits for this reason they are also the focus of most researchers and different oxidation processes have been evaluated with hydroxyl radical oh as the core component research in the future is likely to incorporate the generation of oh in advanced oxidation methods oxidizing substances sulfate ozone ferrate permanganate etc can produce different free radicals and substantially enhance the ability of sludge dewatering however there are few studies about them and especially the use of ferrate in order to better solve the problem of sludge dewatering future research could concentrate instead on analyzing different oxide free radicals other than oh their potential advantages should be investigated with an emphasis on exploring their feasibility in actual production and life and providing more information to choose advanced oxidation methods 8 conclusion the current article reviewed the application of aops in enhancing sludge dewatering efficiency through producing different radicals such as oh so4 feo4 2 etc different aop methods generate a variety of radicals and we compared the characteristics of different aop methods by describing and analyzing the involved reaction mechanisms in addition we illustrated the principles and effects of aop applied to sludge dewatering demonstrating its applicability and efficiency for sludge contaminant removal 1 different radicals damage the eps and sludge cells thus releasing the bound water and intracellular water reducing the wc which is difficult to remove in any case so as to improve the ability of sludge dewatering notably oh and so4 are the most significant radicals in the data obtained 2 aops also can remove pollutants from the sludge to a certain extent for example tc edc dehp or pc can be effectively removed by using oh so4 and o2 using oh and so4 can effectively remove pops from the sludge feo4 2 can remove the heavy metals from sludge and odor removal can be conducted through oh o2 feo4 2 and o3 the use of oh can promote the removal of multiple pollutants 3 through economic comparison and analysis the application of oh presents economic advantages which provides better supporting conditions for the extensive use of corresponding technologies 4 although advanced oxidation methods have successfully improved sludge dewatering capacity there are still some gaps current research is basically at the laboratory stage and whether it can enlarge to full scale sewage plant remains to be confirmed the causes for the differences between different effects of the various free radicals have to be further discussed and whether the related electrochemical or ultrasonic methods can be applied needs to be explored analysis of the economic features also needs to be done in order to balance the demands of society and business rather than to blindly create new advanced oxidation methods in future studies for different oxidative radicals more attention should be paid to the new method of free radical production rather than focusing excessively on existing method or adding too much catalyst to the original method this will make it possible to develop new methods with better dewatering efficiency that are more economical and

13169,applying advanced oxidation processes aops in sludge dewatering to improve sludge treatment disposal and environmental protection has attracted much interest due to the difficulties arising in extracellular polymeric substances eps degradation during the sludge dewatering process oxidants can produce different types of free radicals and exert specific oxidation effects through different action mechanisms on water saturated sludge this plays an important role in sludge dewatering sludge minimization and removal of different types of micropollutants and or their transformation the current review critically evaluates the role of aop in improving the efficiency of sludge dewatering characteristics of advanced oxidation methods applied to sludge dewatering are systematically

advanced oxidation processes sludge dewatering oxidants free radicals sludge conditioning 1 introduction in tandem with the world s rising population the number of municipal wastewater treatment plants is increasing year by year it is estimated that 60 million tons of wet sludge is produced per year in china and needs extensive treatment facilities for proper handling 1 the large amounts of activated sludge which are produced as an intermediate product from traditional activated sludge processes have become a critical problem 2 4 high moisture content of sludge increases its total volume which will further increase the costs involved in transportation treatment and disposal it is therefore important to reduce the sludge moisture before treatment and final disposal sludge dewatering can become a meaningful process reduce sludge volume and diminish the area occupied by sludge this process has great significance for environmental protection and land use 5 7 furthermore excessive pollutant accumulation in the sludge during the process of wastewater purification by heavy metals hormones endocrine disrupting compounds edc pathogens pg tetracyclines tc persistent organic pollutants pops poses significant downstream risk especially in the context of resource recovery through sludge valorization 8 10 for this reason it is urgent to apply effective and economic measures to achieve not only efficient sludge dewatering outcomes but also reasonable degradation of large quantities of sludge pollutants to ensure a safe recovered material sludge resource for integration into circular innovation ecosystems in recent years many useful conditioning methods classified as physical chemical or biological methods have been employed to improve the physicochemical and biochemical properties of sludge to achieve effective reduction of both sludge mass and volume and subsequent utilization of sludge resources 5 11 15 advanced oxidation process aop being a typical chemical conditioning method produces free radicals with a strong oxidation effect free radicals are produced using various oxidants while different oxidants are selected to produce diverse free radicals with these reaction mechanisms being obviously distinct hydrogen peroxide h2o2 16 persulfate 17 ferrate 18 permanganate 19 and ozone o3 20 are commonly used oxidants in existing research this includes hydroxyl radical oh sulfate radical so4 superoxide radical o2 ferrate radical feo4 2 and ozone radical o3 that would become respective in order to facilitate the reaction in the process of oxidation extracellular polymeric substances eps the main component of sludge could promote the flocculation of sludge for its ingredients 21 however excessive eps content would bring about extremely deteriorated dewatering outcomes for the hydrophily and the strong intermolecular forces 21 23 hence decreasing the content of eps and increasing the eps hydrophobicity are beneficial to the removal of water it is anticipated eps will be effectively hydrolyzed by the oxidation effect of aop thus weakening the strong binding ability of eps and releasing the strongly bonded water from sludge resulting in the improvement of sludge dewaterability 24 26 in aop a number of pollutants in sludge can be degraded or transformed simultaneously the binding state of metal ions can be transformed into a free state through the actions of free radicals the generation of odors can be diminished and persistent organic compounds and hormone substances can be degraded effectively 20 27 28 therefore aop has in recent times attracted the attention of researchers because of its efficient economical and environmentally friendly character in this paper we critically address the application of different oxidation methods for improved sludge dewatering and provide a related economic analysis of their utility in sludge dewatering and micropollutant removal we found all free radicals oh so4 o2 feo4 2 and o3 exert oxidation effect on organic matters and heavy metals leading to the minimization of sludge and the removal of micropollutants from sludge system notably oh and so4 are more advantageous to improve sludge dewaterability however the geographical conditions application purpose economic development level and climatic circumstance should be considered before the choice of oxidants and aop methods this review could provide new ideas for researchers and make them pay more attention to the study of new method of free radical production rather than focusing excessively on existing method or adding too much catalyst to the original method this will make it possible to develop new methods with better dewatering efficiency that are more economical and protect the environment better 2 correlation between sludge composition and sludge dewatering 2 1 the composition of sludge moisture sludge has a very complex structure composition in addition to different organic matter or inorganic solids and most of the volume is composed of water and consequently sludge has a high moisture content 2 29 hence the water in sludge can be reasonably classified according to the difficulty of removal and its proportion and specific properties can be explored 30 early research on the water composition of sludge classified water content in sludge into free water and bound water 30 with the deepening of the research on sludge moisture content simply dividing the moisture components into two categories no longer helps researchers to understand and predict the dehydration mechanism and some pretreatment methods related to sludge conditioning coagulation flocculation ultrasound etc 30 therefore sludge water is now divided into four categories namely free water 31 interstitial water 32 surface water and hydration or internal water in the recent research and corresponding discussions the categories of sludge moisture are shown in fig 1 usually interstitial water surface water and hydration or internal water are generally referred to as bound water 30 33 35 in these four kinds of sludge water firstly free water is unaffected by solid particles and it includes the water in the pores but unaffected by capillary force and free water which can account for approximately 70 of the total water 31 secondly interstitial water is the water that is trapped inside the crevices and interstitial spaces of flocs and organisms 32 thirdly surface water is the water which holds on to the surface of solid particles by adsorption and adhesion 30 fourthly hydration or internal water is the water which is tightly bound to the solids and difficult to remove by mechanical methods 30 although the above classification of water content in sludge is accepted by most researchers it does not fully involve the impact of the eps compositions which also constitutes activated sludge therefore how to classify the water composition of sludge more correctly or more appropriately remains to be explored 2 2 the composition and characteristics of eps eps are composed of carbohydrates proteins humic substances and nucleic acids which account for the majority of cell organic material and the presence of a large number of carbohydrates and proteins does lead to the strong hydrophilic properties of eps eps are usually divided into three categories according to the structure and physical state soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps 30 36 the components of eps and the construction of bacteria is shown in fig 2 there exists an important effective factor of eps in that it can affect sludge thickening and dewatering processes 37 furthermore several studies found that polysaccharide and protein contribute to the positive and negative charges of eps respectively 38 40 correspondingly the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and surface charge of sludge flocs depend on the content ratio of polysaccharide and protein in eps 41 protein is the main existing substance that contributes to the high water retaining capacity of eps so reducing the protein content in eps can improve the sludge dehydration capacity 42 the humic substances and nucleic acids exert no significant effect on sludge dewaterability 21 some studies have shown that the sludge dewatering ability improves as the eps content drops 32 43 lower eps content is more conducive to sludge flocculation and dewatering as it makes the cells bind more tightly 37 there are two binding mechanisms between eps and water molecules electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds the former is active between the permanent dipoles of water and the functional groups of eps 30 the latter are active between eps hydroxyl groups and water molecules 44 the existence of eps will generate a certain space force to prevent contact between cells and the inability of the cells to contact each other makes it impossible to reasonably condense floc in the dehydration process 45 this decreases the ability of solid liquid separation thus reducing the dehydration efficiency eps can also form a stable gel that prevents water seepage from the pores of flocs which deteriorates the ability of sludge dewatering 45 2 3 strategies for improving sludge dewaterability the composing proportion of different water within the sludge directly affects the efficiency of sludge dewatering free water is easier to remove than the other three because it is hardly affected by sludge solids however the content of bound water is one of the most important factors affecting sludge dewatering 29 30 usually free water and a portion of bound water can be removed in sewage treatment plant and such a dewatering process also requires high investment operational costs using heavy compression pressure how to remove bound water and other potential types of water more economically will be the main problem generally there exists typical measures to further release water 1 to destruct eps and sludge cell directly 2 to reduce the hydrophilic of eps or to decrease the strong bonding force between eps and bound water to make the bound water into free water in order to achieve these goals sludge conditioning is applied to change characteristics of eps and cell before sludge dewatering process sludge conditioning can be divided into physical conditioning 46 50 chemical conditioning 51 54 biological conditioning 55 57 and the combination 58 60 between these methods these methods generally include coagulation 61 62 ultrasonication 63 64 pyrolysis 46 65 advanced oxidation 66 67 and bioleaching etc the release and transformation of the bound water and intracellular water of course reduces the proportion of water which is difficult to remove but applying an increase of free water ratio to sludge dewatering does not mean that the dewaterability of sludge improves it is reported by ruiz hernando et al 69 that the applications of the ultrasonic wave heat and alkali would have after effects on sludge with the percentage of bound water content increasing but did not undermine the ability of sludge dewatering instead sludge dewatering became successful therefore sludge moisture requires further investigation for transformation strategies and practical applications 3 principles of different advanced oxidation methods advanced oxidation is one of the most efficient and promising technologies which is widely used in the water treatment industry 70 for sludge treatment and disposal in wastewater treatment plants advanced oxidation is usually employed as a pretreatment technology 44 there are various methods to conduct advanced oxidation by producing either different or the same free radicals 3 1 hydrogen peroxide based advanced oxidation processes hydrogen peroxide h2o2 as a common oxidant is widely utilized in the advanced oxidation process 71 strong oxidative hydroxyl radicals oh formed in h2o2 plays an important role in water treatment for example it can inactivate bacteria during the disinfection process and release water by oxidizing the eps of sludge during sludge dewatering process 72 the oh can destroy the cell walls of microorganisms or bacteria enhance cell membrane permeability and conformably break the cell walls so that the intracellular water could be released from the cells 73 in general fe2 is used as a catalyst to produce oh with strong oxidizability when h2o2 is used as an oxidizing agent 74 the reaction of fe2 with h2o2 to produce oh is often referred to as the common fenton method 75 the oh production from the fenton method can be achieved through the decomposition of h2o2 catalyzed by the fe2 eq 1 74 in the meantime a fenton like process occurred when fe3 ions exist following by the formation of fe2 ions for the fenton process eq 2 70 besides the generated fe3 also reacts with the water h2o in the solution after which fe2 and oh can also be produced eq 3 76 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 2 fe 3 h 2 o 2 fe 2 ho 2 h 3 fe 3 h 2 o fe 2 oh h in the process of generating oh by fenton or fenton like methods fe2 makes a pivotal contribution to the initiation and processing of the reaction however if the ph solution rises in alkalinity after the generation of fe3 it has a certain influence which will lead to the precipitation of fe3 eq 4 at the same time if the addition of h2o2 is excessive the generation of oh will be hindered and lose oxidability 77 78 4 fe 3 oh fe oh 3 ultrasound us as a traditional physical pretreatment method can cooperate with the fenton process in assisting the activation of h2o2 to produce the oh in the us fenton process h2o2 and h2o will be decomposed and this favors the production of oh eqs 5 and 6 79 the cavitation effect can accelerate the fenton process which improves the transformation of fe3 to fe2 therefore the oh will be produced again through the fenton process in which the generated fe2 continues to grow 63 in the us fenton process the dosage of fe2 and h2o2 can be reduced resulting in shortened reaction times and improved efficiency 80 microwave mw as a common physical method is widely used in daily life in the water treatment industry mw method is often used to degrade organic matter or crack sludge floc 16 when mw is combined with h2o2 it can assist the decomposition of h2o2 into oh eq 7 which enables oh to execute strong oxidation 81 besides of the application of physical methods in conjunction with the fenton method or assisting in the production of oh the use of light photo fenton process may bring different effects and light is relatively easy to obtain 82 in the photo fenton process light is used to assist the production of oh the fe3 decreased in this reaction system and is transformed into fe2 to activate h2o2 to produce oh eq 8 83 when adding excessive h2o2 the hydroperoxyl radical ho2 can be produced by consuming oh eq 9 84 85 there is no positive effect on aop arising from the existence of ho2 5 ultrasound h 2 o 2 2oh 6 ultrasound h 2 o h oh 7 microwave h 2 o 2 2oh 8 fe 3 h 2 o hv fe 2 oh h 9 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o the high efficiency production of oh can not only reduce the dosage of catalyst i e fe2 but also shorten the reaction time which can decrease the volume of reaction tank in practical application hence these methods which could effectively promote the production of oh have the positive effects on the sludge dewatering process see section 4 2 3 2 sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes compared with the advanced oxidation process of hydrogen peroxide one of the advantages of sulfate radical oxidation method is that the raw material is solid and easy to transport and store there are some other excellent advantages of sulfate radical advanced oxidation processes sr aops such as a higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v a longer half life and a wider operative ph range 2 10 58 persulfate ps and peroxymonosulfate pms are usually employed as the oxidants to produce sulfate radical with respect to the activation of ps and pms there are three common methods involved in the generation of sulfate radicals i representative transition metal ii heat and iii ultraviolet irradiation methods the mechanisms of these three methods are shown in eqs 10 14 17 86 87 compared with pms the efficiency of ps in the activation process is superior to that of pms 88 when using metal ions to activate pms or ps free homogeneous cobalt ii can significantly activate pms while iron ii ions play a valuable role in activating ps 89 generally speaking thermal activation can promote the generation of so4 in pms system 67 90 and also produce oh at the same time eq 15 91 which has a dual promoting effect on the oxidation of the target however excessive addition of pms has a negative effect on the oxidation of the system reducing the generation of so4 free radicals with effective oxidation eqs 16 17 92 94 10 s 2 o 8 2 uv 2so 4 11 hso 5 uv so 4 oh 12 s 2 o 8 2 heat 2so 4 13 s 2 o 8 2 me n so 4 so 4 2 me n 1 14 ho 5 me n so 4 oh me n 1 15 hso 5 heat so 4 oh 16 so 4 hso 5 so 5 so 4 2 h 17 so 4 so 4 s 2 o 8 2 the microwave radiation method also can effectively promote the reaction of activating the production of sulfate radical so as to enhance the efficiency of aop at the same time it achieves the objective of delving into optimal processing 58 microwave induced persulfate could generate so4 efficiently through microwave power or microwave temperature controls as shown in eq 18 95 while increasing the amount of so4 by combining microwave radiation continuously increasing the amount of ps will still reduce the content of effective so4 eq 19 96 97 consequently when choosing different methods to produce effective free radicals the dosage amount is an important factor 98 under the combination of microwave irradiation common granular activated carbon gac can catalyze the reaction system observably to produce so4 at the same time the persulfate microwave system can regenerate gac and improve the utilization rate of gac herein the hot spots of pollutant absorbed gac enable the degradation performance to be efficient in terms of taking only seconds eqs 20 and 21 54 99 18 s 2 o 8 2 microwave 2so 4 19 s 2 o 8 2 so 4 so 4 2 s 2 o 8 20 ac surface ooh s 2 o 8 2 so 4 hso 4 ac

substrate to avoid excessive waste of materials similar to oh the use of so4 can also improve the dewatering capacity of sludge see section 4 2 3 3 permanganate ferrate and ozone oxidation methods recent research and applications have popularized the application of h2o2 and ps pms as substrates after adding catalyst to produce oh and so4 in advanced oxidation processes additionally potassium permanganate oxidation ferrate oxidation and ozone oxidation can also serve as reliable oxidation methods in aop the use of fe ii kmno4 can have an efficient effect in water purification which consists both of oxidation and flocculation capacities concerning organic matter and it has been already widely used in the high algal water and arsenic containing water treatments 41 100 under the catalysis of fe2 kmno4 can react with it to form strong oxidizing manganese dioxide mno2 eq 22 101 the o2 which has the strong capacity of oxidizing can be generated sustainably by various mno2 polymorphs in the dark eq 23 102 with reference to application the potassium permanganate oxidation method can effectively improve sludge dewatering 49 the fe ii kmno4 system can be combined with pyrolysis sludge based carbon sbc 100 to construct the fe mn sbc system aiming to effectively adsorb as iii from groundwater and repair groundwater pollution 49 22 fe 2 kmno 4 fe 3 mno 2 23 o 2 mn iii o 2 mn iv in recent decades ferrate vi has been applied in the field of water treatment as a strong oxidant and disinfectant because of the iron in 6 oxidation state 18 51 103 the oxidation mechanism is the strong oxidation effect of ferrate during the reduction of high iron eq 24 104 the oxidation capacity of ferrate vi is highly dependent on the ph water constituents type and concentration of contaminants 105 106 simultaneously ferrate vi has flocculation function when it is reduced to iron ions or iron hydroxide ferrate vi acts as an economical energy saving and environmental protection chemical reagent 107 108 in the latest research wu et al 104 found that when the ferrate vi system was formed using a combination of uv and ferrate vi the oxidation capacity became stronger and superoxide radical o2 could be produced this has a more significant effect on the degradation of phenolic pollutants 24 2feo 4 2 5h 2 o 2fe 3 10 oh 1 5o 2 ozone is a strong oxidizing substance usually used in pre oxidation and advanced oxidation processes ozone can also be employed as a catalyst to catalyze h2o2 and pms in order to generate radical oh eq 25 24 and so4 eq 26 with a strong oxidation effect it was found that lepidocrocite γ feooh with surface hydroxyl groups can catalyze ozonation to generate hydroxyl radicals which would further participate in the removal of organic matter 109 the process was described as reactions shown in eqs 27 30 109 25 2o 3 h 2 o 2 2oh 3o 2 26 o 3 pms o 2 so 4 27 feooh o 3 feooh o 3 s 28 feooh o 3 s feo ho 3 o 3 29 feo h 2 o feoh oh 30 o 3 h 2 o oh o 2 oh in addition to promoting the production of corresponding free radicals i e oh and so4 by h2o2 and ps pms o3 also could directly oxidize organic matters relying on its strong oxidation performance hence the use of o3 is wide in aops in the process of sludge dewatering functional free radicals generated in different oxidants could leads to the destruction of sludge eps and cell meanwhile it has positive significance for the transformation of bound water and intracellular water into free water all these aop methods have good applicability and the selection needs to be optimized according to specific environmental conditions and equipment conditions to achieve the desired outcome 4 aop conditioning in sludge dewatering 4 1 effects of aop conditioning on sludge eps and sludge water 4 1 1 degradation of eps in the process of sludge dewatering even if a lot of pressure is required to compress the sludge it is difficult to remove the water due to the strong binding force see section 2 2 subsequently too much water is retained in the sludge resulting in poor dewatering efficiency aops can produce strong oxidizing free groups oh so4 o2 etc which can oxidize eps and destroy sludge floc 70 the components proteins polysaccharides lipids etc of eps are oxidized to soluble organic substances or water by free radicals exerting a strong oxidation effect resulting in damage and rupture to eps of sludge cell in this way the eps content declines 81 meanwhile the functional groups in sludge eps are oxidized by free radicals oh so4 o2 etc which firstly reduces the degree of π electron systems secondly decreases the number of aromatic rings and conjugated bonds in a chain structure and thirdly converts a linear ring system to a non linear ring system 93 110 during this period the collapse of eps results in the destruction of sludge matrix and the easier oxidation of microorganism cells 23 the oxidizing free groups oh so4 o2 etc can penetrate the microbial wall then improve the permeability of cell membranes and destroy the uniformity of cell walls thus the intracellular water in sludge cell can be released out of the water environment 94 all these contribute to improving sludge dewaterability the mechanism of aop conditioning in sludge cell disruption is depicted in fig 3 while the mechanism of how aop modulates sludge dewatering is shown in fig 4 notably the breakage of eps would result in the increase of low molecular weight organic matter in the liquid phase of sludge and deteriorate the efficiency of sludge dewatering because of the blocking of channels for water discharge 111 accordingly coagulants flocculants are usually used to weaken the negative influence of low molecular weight organic matter and guarantee the improvement of sludge dewaterability hence the choices of oxidants or catalytic methods which could play both oxidation and flocculation performances are worth studying in the future 4 1 2 transformation of sludge water the aop usually influences on the moisture content of sludge this is explained in more detail below since free water is not affected by sludge solids the aop has no effect on the content of original free water bound water has a certain ability to interact with solid particles therefore advanced oxidation methods focus on the role of sludge solids aop can change the form of water adhesion as well as the binding capacity of water in sludge solids damage of the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds so as to alter the nature of the combined water making the it isolated from solid particles and transferred into free water as shown in fig 3 after the action of free radicals oh so4 o2 etc with high oxidation capacity the sludge eps are broken down and the cell membrane is ruptured destruction of eps proteins and oxidation of polysaccharide the water bound to proteins and polysaccharides in the eps is released and water inside the cell is then released into the external environment at the same time as the main components of eps are protein and polysaccharide substances this organic matter oxidizes into carbon dioxide and water afterwards oxidation thus increasing the water content in the sludge moreover this increase in water content is free water which can be easily removed in the case of advanced oxidation methods being combined with other physical chemical or biological conditioning methods the change in the moisture composition of the sludge also arises the methods of using ultrasonic 79 adding acid or alkali 112 using uv 104 etc can also damage sludge cells and promote the release of intracellular water or moisture in the eps the combination of these methods applying advanced oxidation can effectively realize dual functions including the release of water in the cells of sludge and a greater proportion of bound water turning into free water so as to improve the ability of sludge dewatering utilization of combined methods should consider reasonable selection as per according to environmental and experimental conditions in order to maximize effects numerous approaches and or observation reduction analysis have their own unique requirements and this enables researchers to make reasonable decisions choosing the most economical and applicable method will make this technology become more widely accepted 4 2 sludge dewaterability post aop conditioning three parameters are mainly used in evaluating sludge dewatering performance including capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filterability srf and water content wc additionally zeta potential is also occasionally applied here the effects of aop on sludge dewatering are summarized in table 1 and these operating conditions then refer to table 2 using fe2 or fe3 as the catalyst to catalyze h2o2 to produce oh radical as the functional group is generally called fenton or fenton like process see section 3 1 the fenton process can effectively improve the dewatering efficiency of sludge for example masihi and badalians gholikandi 113 investigated the effect of the fenton process in sludge dewatering the moisture of sludge cake reduced from 97 6 to 71 with dosages of fe and h2o2 at 75 mg g ds and 50 mg g ds under ph of 6 87 meanwhile the srf of sludge was reduced by 85 3 compared with the original sludge additionally lime was utilized as the skeleton material which played a positive role in the construction of the sludge conveyance channel for water discharge using fenton or fenton like method directly produced oh to oxidize sludge leading to the damage of sludge cell and decrease of bound water promoting the enhance of sludge dewaterability with the decline of srf and water content of filtered cake the fenton method can also be combined with the electrochemical method which can generate strong destructive power by electric current 113 electric current could penetrate sludge cell accelerating the breakage of sludge flocs and shortening reaction time it is worth noting that with the assistance of electrochemical fenton method the water content of the mud cake and sludge can be further reduced and the dosage of h2o2 and fe2 was even lower 113 the us approach can also have a good effect combined with the use of the fenton method in the us fenton process the 1 5 h us reaction time at a ph of 3 with 0 2 g l of fe2 and 0 25 g l of h2o2 the cst and srf indicated reductions of 84 95 and 97 04 respectively 80 external energy input i e electricity heat and magnetism can not only improve the generation capacity of oh but also reduce the dosage of reagent i e substrate and catalyst in practical application the employment of external energy could decrease the area to store corresponding reagent and save relevant construction cost however the cost of corresponding input energy would be increased considering biochar bc has a certain adsorption effect which could promote the agglomeration of sludge flocs and widen holes among sludge flocs for water discharge easily tao et al 114 studied the effects of iron rich biochar combined with h2o2 on the sludge dewatering capacity the iron contained in biochar combines with h2o2 which can accelerate fenton reactions in the reaction process red mud was put into it as a certain skeleton material the wc of the mud cake decreased from 96 49 to 46 38 following this cst and srf decreased by 90 24 and 98 01 respectively and h2o2 biochar and red mud were added in amounts of 0 072 0 792 and 0 750 g g vs at ph 2 respectively the addition of biochar increased channels for water discharge which promoted the outflow of more sludge water under the same pressure in the dewatering process so that enhanced the dewatered efficiency apart from h2o2 there are other novel approaches to producing oh yu et al 66 applied oh generated by fe ii ca clo 2 to improve the ability of sludge dewatering with the dosage of fe ii and ca clo 2 at 106 1 and 234 5 mg g vs respectively the wc of sludge was effectively reduced from 98 4 to 64 9 and cst and srf were also reduced by 83 03 and 94 74 respectively in this system lesser viable cells can be found because of the high efficiency oxidizing capacity of oh but sludge flocs were integrated it is regarded as intracellular oxidation hence the oxidation was mainly due to the existence of oh in the reaction system and the production of oh has various ways in the aop so4 also has a certain effect on sludge dewatering the wc of the sludge decreased significantly and the cst and srf of the sludge both decreased to some extent when a certain amount of pms and fe2 were added 26 52 compared with fe2 zero valent iron zvi has a more significant catalytic effect on pms under acidic conditions zvi could effectively reduce the wc of the mud cake but had a negative effect on the reduction of cst 26 at the same time the combination of zvi and ps greatly improved the sludge dewatering performance 115 mw and thermal activation as the methods of external energy input could activate the sulfate radical availably zhen et al 116 applied mw as a pretreatment to fe ii ps system through using 500 w mw irradiation lasting for 180 s to break down the sludge flocs facilitating more efficient follow up the results indicated that cst was reduced by 94 6 through adding the dosage of ps and fe2 at 0 5 mmol g ts and 0 4 mmol g ts respectively the use of mw shortened the reaction time accelerated the breakage of sludge flocs and further improved the dewaterability guo et al 27 used the thermal activation method to activate ps meanwhile free radicals were generated to effectively oxidize sludge the wc of sludge decreased to 42 6 and the effect of enhancing the dewatering capacity was obvious high temperature can affect the survival activities of sludge and damage sludge cell to release organic matter and intracellular water however the system required the application of heat to 70 c which consumed a large amount of energy therefore choosing reasonable method to enhance the production of radicals is significant to control excess input of energy and fund compared to oh so4 also has strong oxidation notably catalyzing stimulating ps pms can not only produce so4 but also produce oh see section 3 2 it is beneficial to elevating oxidation rate at the same time saving the quantities of used reagents among the advanced oxidation methods ferrates and permanganates can also produce groups that are identical to the strong oxidation effect of oh and so4 radicals fe2 and zvi have catalytic effects on potassium permanganate enabling it to produce mno2 with oxidation in the intermediate valence state 49 101 following sludge treatment the wc cst and srf of sludge can be reduced efficiently and the effect is stronger than that of kmno4 alone 19 similarly applying heat treatment or acid treatment prior to oxidant action was proved to be effective reducing the moisture content to as low as 59 32 101 it can be seen that permanganates itself has a certain oxidation capacity and the catalytic system could improve the ability of permanganates oxidation under acidic and neutral conditions the addition of ferrate can reduce the wc of sludge without assistance with catalytic reagents when biochar was used as skeleton material the wc reduced less than 60 25 117 hence it is obvious that the use of ferrate needs to control suitable ph value to make the addition of ferrate useful the maintained ph value would increase the use of acid alkaline and create extra expense ozone is generally used as a catalytic substance to catalyze h2o2 to produce oh and ozone itself has a certain oxidation capacity the wc of sludge can decrease down to 60 and the cst can be reduced by nearly 80 when ozone and chitosan were combined for the condition of sludge revealing an efficient outcome 118 in this ozone chitosan system eps and sludge cell were damaged by ozone at the same time chitosan as the coagulant could increase sludge flocs size to enhance dewatering ability accordingly reasonable control of o3 dosage could both stimulate its catalytic and oxidation performance in summary different free radicals oh so4 o2 etc all have good performances on enhancing sludge dewaterability in contrast oh is more helpful for the reduction of srf and sludge water content and the dosages of h2o2 and relevant catalysts were lower than using other oxidants notably the oxidation of so4 was second only to oh at the same time external energy input was obvious to promoting oxidation of free radicals and decreased the addition of corresponding reagents it was not obvious that the addition of permanganate ferrate and ozone alone promoted the improvement of corresponding dewatering indexes in these systems relevant catalytic means should be employed to play the potential levels of oxidation of radicals 4 3 sludge minimization post aop conditioning sludge minimization is realized by the disintegration mineralization and ablation of sludge 119 aops act as a strong method to achieve the objective exerting a conspicuous effect on it the disintegration of sludge is caused by the key factor high oxidizing free radical action in the process of advanced oxidation under the oxidation of free radicals the extracellular polymer of sludge breaks down and the soluble organic matter content increases while the content of the dense extracellular polymer decreases and the damaged cells also lead to the release of intracellular organic matter which aggravates the significant increase of soluble organic matter 70 meanwhile this process will not encourage the formation of more organic compounds and the increase the difficultly removed water content this is illustrated in fig 5 where the mechanism of aop conditioning in sludge minimization is expressed the free radicals such as oh so4 o3 o2 etc would have the initial roles to decrease the total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss mixed liquid suspended solids mlss total chemical oxygen demand tcod the average particle size and dissolve organic carbon doc but increase the soluble cod scod to achieve sludge minimization 70 the effects of aop which support these high efficiency free radicals in sludge minimization are summarized in table 3 doc of lb eps and tb eps decreased widely when adding h2o2 and fe2 at 25 mg g ds and 15 mg g ds respectively 113 this phenomenon also occurs in the electrochemical fenton process and the decline in doc around tb eps showed a stronger effect than lb eps 40 and 61 6 reduction could be achieved in this process respectively the decrease of doc could weaken the negative effects of organic matters on sludge dewatering process insuring the use of unobstructed channels for water discharge similarly the vss of sludge and the scod of the mixture also significantly changed in electrochemical fenton process the decline in vss and the increase in scod were 36 89 and 539 19 respectively 120 these results indicated a powerful change in the scod s increase and suggested that oxidation can effectively destroy the extracellular polymer and intracellular organic matter resulting in their release into the mixture and further enhance the dewaterability of sludge 120 121 not only fenton and fenton like reactions with oh acting groups but the potassium ferrates associated with sulfate radicals have the same ability as well in the study by badalians gholikandi et al 122 the vs decreased by 42 while scod increased by 1250 mg l when using 0 75 mmol l pms and 12 5 mmol l o3 at ph of 11 ps can also serve as the substrate however it is not as effective as pms it has been confirmed that ph is of great importance by changing the activity of so4 122 thus it is important to control the ph value in aops to make the oxidation of free radicals useful zhang et al 53 assessed the effect of potassium ferrate pf with ocl and oh which were catalysts in the sludge minimization and found that mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss decreased by 59 and 73 respectively these percentages demonstrated the excellent outcome concerning sludge minimization which was also confirmed by wu et al 123 the decrement of mlss and mlvss also indicated that the good effect of aops in sludge reduction promoting the cutback of sludge quantity ozone usually acts as a catalyst for oxidation meanwhile it is a strong oxidant itself ge et al 118 used o3 to disintegrate sludge and their findings showed that the tscod totally soluble cod increased by 432 8 exhibiting an effective degradation of organic matter in addition to the visualized performance of the sludge reduction index the average size and viscosity of the sludge assisted greatly with sludge minimization it is shown in table 2 that potassium permanganate conditioning and potassium ferrate treatment could reduce the average particle size of sludge 19 25 in general the measured d 50 represents the average particle size of sludge the much reduced particle size revealed that the sludge flocs were destroyed and fine particles were released the application of fe2 persulfate tannic acid ta could decrease the sludge supernatant viscosity by approximately 86 7 112 viscosity of sludge supernatant explains the fluidity of sludge which is linked to the number of extracellular polymers in the cell the decline in sludge supernatant viscosity suggests two things the breaking up of sludge eps and the indirect disintegration of sludge accordingly sludge minimization could be achieved by adopting different radicals the decrement of eps content and the changes of physico chemical characteristics of sludge indicated the efficient oxidation of aop on sludge which was beneficial to achieving high efficiency sludge dewatering process 5 effects of aop conditioning on micropollutant removal 5 1 typical pollutants involved in sewage sludge sludge floc always contains a series of bacteria viruses and pollutants which would have certain adverse effects on subsequent sludge disposal and even bring serious diseases and illnesses 124 referring to the wastewater treatment process a large volume of sludge should be stored and transported it produces certain gases and volatile organic compounds which are released into the air generating odors that are harmful to human health 125 126 these gases would more or less damage the atmosphere 127 the control of odors emission is one of important aspects for sludge management in sewage plants currently many countries are gradually turning their attentions to environmental protection the solutions to heavy metals edc tc di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp etc in sludge have to be decisive 128 129 advances in science and technology coupled with massive improvements in people s living standards have made the requirements for water quality much stricter in recent years the standard of sewage water quality has gradually improved and more unknown edcs and emerging pops which are harmful to human health have been detected in sewage in particular the large amount of hormone utilization is aggravating wastewater treatment 8 130 as a class of pollutants with a significantly destructive effect on human and ecological environments it is of great importance to study hormones especially the estrogens which are the most typical pollutants these include such as estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 estriol e3 and 17 α ethinylestradiol ee2 8 therefore the degradation of harmful micropollutants from sludge system is vital to protect environment and human life 5 2 micropollutants removal post aop conditioning free groups produced through aops not only aid in eps hydrolysis but also exert a certain level of efficiency in removing pollutants contained in the sludge and a positive effect on the quality of water as we all know the water removed after sludge dewatering still needs to be treated and purified removing corresponding micropollutants in sludge sludge miscible liquids before dewatering could reduce the burden of subsequent water quality treatment and improve the subsequent use of sludge cake the effects of aop in the removal of pollutants in sludge conditioning process are summarized in table 4 secondary benefit of micropollutant elimination invites possibility to improve the biological safety of aop conditioned sludge for circular use e g fertilizer novel building materials the mechanism of aop conditioning in the removal of micropollutants is shown in fig 6 free radicals generated through aop have excellent abilities of pollutant removal such as organic micropollutants and the presence of it could reduce the environmental risk of various pollutants existing in sludge in general different radicals can be produced by various methods as mentioned in section 3 for the degradation of pops the remarkable effects could be achieved by both oh and so4 gan et al 131 reported that the pc removal rate reached 100 when using the fenton like process by adding biochar fenton rm as a catalyst producing a significant effect compared to oh tc could be removed efficiently by so4 wei et al 132 studied the removal efficiency of tc by adding ps catalyzed by bio hydrochar and the results showed that the removal efficiency of tc was as high as 99 72 m cresol is a kind of pops which is very harmful to human beings plants and animals yu et al 133 put forward a new method of catalytic wet peroxide oxidation process cwpo which was applied to reduce the amount of m cresol and the removal rate could reach 100 similarly liang et al 134 added biochar to the reaction system as the catalyst and removed 57 8 of phenol a type of pops in addition dehp can be removed efficiently by using the sab bc fe3o4 ps oxidation system 135 compared with oh and so4 permanganate ferrate and ozone have less research on the removal of pops according to the application in improving the efficiency of sludge dewatering we can speculated that it would not be obvious on the removal of pops by the radicals produced from permanganate ferrate and ozone for the degradation of edcs o2 generated by kmno4 also has a good impact on the removal of edcs besides oh and so4 using the fenton process the removal rates of e1 e2 ee2 and e3 achieved 70 90 84 and 98 respectively 77 sakulthaew and chokejaroenrat 136 investigated a mno4 candles oxidation process to reduce e2 and the removal rate reached 92 these results confirmed that the ion of permanganate also had a strong oxidation effect and can degrade micropollutants to a certain extent compared to the removal of pops and edcs noxious gases and volatile organic compounds could be cleared away by more free radicals liu et al 137 found that the us fenton process can reduce the content of s2 effectively with a removal rate of 53 5 ma et al 138 utilized the kmno4 pfc poly ferric chloride and pf oxidation process to investigate the removal rate on dimethyl trisulfide which is a source of odors these results showed that the pf oxidation process can remove 92 5 of dimethyl trisulfide which was more efficient than the kmno4 pfc process with a removal rate of 90 9 by this token feo4 2 was more useful than o2 on the elimination of odors as the origin of toxic odors dimethyl silanediol ds acetic acid aa and diisobutyl phthalate dp would damage the respiratory and nervous systems of people in the study of ma et al 20 o3 was applied to solve the problem of toxic odors and the removal rates of ds aa and dp were 12 4 12 and 8 4 respectively summary oxidants need to be selected according to specific types of odors when eliminating the gas produced by sludge additionally pollution by heavy metals has been a serious problem worldwide for many decades aop can reduce the amount of sludge and purify the final discharged water by oxidizing heavy metals and controlling the ph of the solution yu et al 10 utilized 0 25 g g ss pf to remove heavy metals from wastewater activated sludge and their results showed that the removal rates of cu zn ni pb cr and mg can reach 22 2 14 7 12 5 9 5 10 6 and 9 8 respectively andrews et al and zhu et al 68 139 used oh to remove heavy metals and achieved a better outcome unfortunately most studies focused on the industrial removal of heavy metals rather than the sludge system the low removal rate of heavy metals in sludge by aops may be one of the main reasons as a result the development of aop methods on removing heavy metals from sludge is limited no matter which free radical has the effective oxidation ability the aop is very convincing in its ability to remove pollutants during the aop sludge conditioning prior to dewatering however the pollutants removal rate of different radicals is different for this reason it is quite important for us to choose an optimal advanced oxidation method to treat pollutants efficiently in sewage or sludge in the future 6 economic considerations in order to apply aops to real life scenarios and make use of the advantages to solve practical engineering problems cost estimation must be considered advanced oxidation technology with excellent dewatering efficiency may not be socially acceptable if it is too expensive consequently it is necessary to ascertain the best method in terms of treatment efficiency and economic and environmental benefits based on the research that has been done on enhancing sludge dewatering by using advanced oxidation methods the available data were classified and analyzed this was done according to different free radicals and the relationship between total cost and dewatering efficiency which were clearly analyzed to explore its economic and treatment effects the economic analysis is summarized in table 5 as shown in table 5 free radicals can enhance the effect of sludge dewatering and reduce the water content wc of sludge hydroxyl radical oh demonstrated the best dewatering method compared with other free radicals nitrilotriacetic acid nta fe0 cao2 process reduced the wc to 40 68 which cost 63 5 t ds and the cost was higher than fenton s reagent cao process uta zvsi h2o2 cao process and electrochemical fenton process these two processes cost 61 2 t ds 49 5 t ds and 41 82 t ds respectively even though the electrochemical fenton process reduced the wc to 42 89 and was higher than that of the nta fe0 cao2 process the method can save 21 68 t ds compared to the latter considering the dewatering efficiency and the cost the electrochemical fenton process may be the best method to use in the actual sludge treatment system it is evident that the traditional fenton process meant spending more money on the dosage of the chemicals and had the worst efficiency of reducing wc in comparison with the other fenton processes or fenton like processes which are based on the oh function other free radicals with oxidation ability also greatly enhance sludge dewatering but they are all weaker than oh and the cost cannot be cheaper it is known from table 5 that the cost of persulfate zvi conditioning process and fe ii s2o8 2 zeolites pdadmac process were 416 1 t ds and 208 t ds respectively this is despite that fact that the methods were used for treating anaerobic sludge or the municipal sludge for a hypothetical population of 100 000 the higher cost of emissions should not be accepted due to inefficiency and the uneconomical nature of this process to find the best dewatering outcomes of advanced oxidation methods it is necessary to select a more suitable free radical according to the current studies better oxidation properties and more economical factors may contribute to scholars growing preference for the fenton process or fenton like process this is based on the emergence of new methods in which different catalysts are added or reaction conditions are changed although it has not been confirmed that whether other strong oxidizing free radicals have better dewatering and economic performance based on the obtained data further research is needed in the future similarly the relevant research on the economic analysis of potassium ferrate oxidation method and ozone oxidation method has not yet been undertaken subsequently it is difficult to confirm whether the methods are more economical which will be a subject for future studies to explore the premise is that advances in technology will help to develop satisfying economic and engineering practical conditions exploring better treatment efficiency and more economical methods are intrinsically linked 7 compared analysis of different radicals and prospect 7 1 compared analysis of different radicals 7 1 1 oxidizability all free radicals oh so4 o2 feo4 2 and o3 exert oxidation effect on organic matters and heavy metals leading to the minimization of sludge and the removal of micropollutants from sludge system for sludge minimization doc vss particle size etc decreased obviously after the function of different radicals see section 4 2 but the removal capacity and types of micropollutants were contrasting among different radicals see section 5 2 the underlying cause is the difference in oxidation potential the oxidation potentials of oh 2 8 v and so4 2 5 3 1 v are higher than other radicals o2 0 6 1 7 v feo4 2 2 2 v and o3 2 1 v resulting in the stronger oxidation to degrade more typical micropollutants from sludge system see table 4 58 140 141 additionally the oxidation capacity of radicals would be affected by selected catalysts and external energy input 7 1 2 application on sludge dewatering based on the oxidizability and measurements of relevant indexes of sludge dewatering srf cst and wc see section 4 2 oh and so4 are more advantageous to improve sludge dewaterability fortunately the minimization of sludge and the removal of micropollutants could achieve higher levels in the meantime other radicals own less satisfactory performance on sludge dewatering which can be attributed to the reason why researchers rarely study on these free radicals 7 1 3 economic analysis the applications of aop methods which could generate oh would cost lower funds in practical engineering see section 6 but the choice is not absolute for all applications of engineering the geographical conditions application purpose economic development level and climatic circumstance should be considered before the choice of oxidants and aop methods for example solid reagents would be the preferred choice for those places difficult to transport liquid reagents therefore so4 could be preferentially selected as the free radical rather than oh regarding the caparison between solid properties of pms ps and liquid properties of h2o2 7 2 prospect the aops can greatly improve sludge dewatering performance free radicals with advanced oxidation function play an important role in destroying cells oxidizing organic matter releasing intracellular water degrading pollutants in sludge and decreasing the content of binding water it should be noted that the dewatering process is difficult to implement the fenton process and fenton like process which are the most widely used methods at present are characterized by their highly efficient oxidation capacity and reasonable economic benefits for this reason they are also the focus of most researchers and different oxidation processes have been evaluated with hydroxyl radical oh as the core component research in the future is likely to incorporate the generation of oh in advanced oxidation methods oxidizing substances sulfate ozone ferrate permanganate etc can produce different free radicals and substantially enhance the ability of sludge dewatering however there are few studies about them and especially the use of ferrate in order to better solve the problem of sludge dewatering future research could concentrate instead on analyzing different oxide free radicals other than oh their potential advantages should be investigated with an emphasis on exploring their feasibility in actual production and life and providing more information to choose advanced oxidation methods 8 conclusion the current article reviewed the application of aops in enhancing sludge dewatering efficiency through producing different radicals such as oh so4 feo4 2 etc different aop methods generate a variety of radicals and we compared the characteristics of different aop methods by describing and analyzing the involved reaction mechanisms in addition we illustrated the principles and effects of aop applied to sludge dewatering demonstrating its applicability and efficiency for sludge contaminant removal 1 different radicals damage the eps and sludge cells thus releasing the bound water and intracellular water reducing the wc which is difficult to remove in any case so as to improve the ability of sludge dewatering notably oh and so4 are the most significant radicals in the data obtained 2 aops also can remove pollutants from the sludge to a certain extent for example tc edc dehp or pc can be effectively removed by using oh so4 and o2 using oh and so4 can effectively remove pops from the sludge feo4 2 can remove the heavy metals from sludge and odor removal can be conducted through oh o2 feo4 2 and o3 the use of oh can promote the removal of multiple pollutants 3 through economic comparison and analysis the application of oh presents economic advantages which provides better supporting conditions for the extensive use of corresponding technologies 4 although advanced oxidation methods have successfully improved sludge dewatering capacity there are still some gaps current research is basically at the laboratory stage and whether it can enlarge to full scale sewage plant remains to be confirmed the causes for the differences between different effects of the various free radicals have to be further discussed and whether the related electrochemical or ultrasonic methods can be applied needs to be explored analysis of the economic features also needs to be done in order to balance the demands of society and business rather than to blindly create new advanced oxidation methods in future studies for different oxidative radicals more attention should be paid to the new method of free radical production rather than focusing excessively on existing method or adding too much catalyst to the original method this will make it possible to develop new methods with better dewatering efficiency that are more economical and
