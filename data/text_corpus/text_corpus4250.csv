21250,the twin barge floatover method can efficiently avoid the high dynamic fender impacts between the jacket and the barges and reduce the costs of the mega topsides installation this study presents the experimental analysis of the twin barge floatover installation method two identical barges elastically hinged with the topsides by the hemisphere shaped dsu deck support unit are modeled in the tests motions of the hinged twin barge as well as dsu loads in heading beaming and quartering waves are investigated results reveal that the motion behaviors of the twin barge in heading seas are quite identical however for beaming and quartering waves the shielding effect together with the hydrodynamic and mechanical interactions have a great influence on the amplitude and phase difference of the twin barge motions due to the shielding effect the windward barge motions are much larger than the leeward barge the sloshing resonance of the in between fluid may lead to the large barge motions the recorded trajectories of the guide pins indicate that the relative long wave will threaten the mating operation as the stabbing pin motions will exceed the capture radius comparisons of the response in different wave directions indicate the quartering waves lead to the largest dsu loads keywords twin barge floatover installation elastically connection motions dsus loads wave directions 1 introduction the mega topside installation of the offshore platforms is quite challenging in the past decades the heavy lifting crane method and the floatover method are developed for the topside installation gros and lescurat 1982 oneill et al 2000 seij and groot 2007 wang et al 2010 the floatover method has great advantages on an integrated topside over the heavy lifting crane method particularly for the mega topside that exceeds the single lift capacity of the available heavy lift crane because of the fewer costs and the larger capacity the floatover installation method becomes a much more attractive and competitive alternative in the mega topside installation the floatover installation firstly uses the hull barge to transport the topsides to the location during the docking phase the mooring line the fender the winch the monitor system and the lash line are utilized to assistant the barge in approaching substructures in such a phase for preparing for the mating operation the stabling pins of the topsides are assured to be aligned with the receive unit installed on the jacket legs until the available time window the topside loads are transferred on the jackets relying on the tide level and the barge ballast system after offloading the topside onto the jacket the barge is separated from the topside and withdrawn through the jacket special attention should be paid to the docking phase which is subject to various challenges for the conventional single hull floatover installation the challenges include but are not limited to the insufficient gap between the jacket and the barge resulting in large collisions loads on the fender the excessive motions of the topsides leading to the failure of the mating operation and the nonlinear dynamic impact on the mating units to overcome the issues the twin barge or catamaran floatover installation method is proposed by applying for the two barges or a catamaran rather than the single hull the twin barge floatover method can reduce the breadth limit of the platform slot the impact loads will be thus efficiently alleviated further the twin barge floatover installation system can use two smaller barges to transfer the mega topsides and can be adapted to different topside and jacket geometries due to the complex configuration of the twin barge floatover system the multi body system is expected to experience complex responses caused by the hydrodynamic and mechanical interactions it is therefore imperative to predict the hydrodynamic performance accurately and explore the workability of the twin barge floatover operation in the past decades the floatover installation method has been studied by the field measurement physical model tests and numerical simulations for both the single hull floatover installation method and the twin barge floatover installation method tahar et al 2006 investigated the response of the floatover installation in which two rigidly connected small water plane barges were used they analyzed the tension of the lash lines between the two semi submersible barges and the jacket koo et al 2010a b used a catamaran to transfer the topsides onto the floating truss spar and measured the motions of the spar and two rigidly connected barges as well as bending loads on the topsides in the model tests to compare with the experimental results the numerical simulations were conducted in time and frequency domain with the proprietary software mltsim and fredom paulling 1995 chen et al 2014 firstly integrated the state space model into the time domain cummins equations to investigate the nonlinear impact phenomenon of the floatover operations chen et al 2017 and hu et al 2017 numerically analyzed the complex nonlinear impact loads of the single hull floatover installation by the impact map bifurcation diagram poincare maps and phase portraits jung et al 2009 and choi et al 2014 conducted the time domain steady state simulation to investigate the lmu loads of the single hull floatover installation under different loading conditions sun et al 2012 numerically investigated the interaction between the barge and the gravity based substructures in the floatover installation without consideration of the variation of the topside loads xu et al 2016 predicted the motion response of three moored barges in close proximity in the floatover installation and analyzed the coupling effect of the hydrodynamic interactions in which the mechanical interaction is not considered geba et al 2017 proposed a floater floatover installation system with a small waterplane and large mass to reduce the roll and pitch natural frequencies avoiding the resonance and providing better stability characters as to the field measurement luo et al 2015 monitored the motions of the single barge and the sea environment with the field measurement technique in the floatover installation in bohai bay china tian et al 2018 presented the design of the monitor system for jacket platform floatover installations to improve the floatover method for mega topsides installation in more rouge waves several innovative floatover installation methods were proposed recently such as the floatover installation method using the strand lifting scheme and the rapid jacking rigs to reduce the ballasting operation time wang et al 2018 bai et al 2020a b and the floatover installation by the dynamic positioning transport vessel bai et al 2014 although numerous studies on the floatover installation have been carried out most of the past studies have been limited to the rigidly connected two barges or a single hull barge considerable research efforts are required for extensions to problems involving the interaction of elastically connected twin barge floatover installation which has been rarely reported in the previous study to the best of the author s knowledge the articulated hinged connection between the topsides and the barges can efficiently reduce the bending loads on the topsides and the connection rigs from the engineering application point of view the flexible connections are much more convenient and efficient than the conventional rigid connection with the aim of investigating the hydrodynamic response of the elastically connected twin barge floatover installation system the twin barge hinged connected with the topsides by the hemisphere shaped deck support unit dsu at the docking phase is experimentally modeled in this study the hydrodynamic performance of the twin barge floatover installation system in heading beaming and quartering waves are analyzed as well as the loads on dsus the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the experimental set up in section 3 the dynamic response of the twin barge floatover installation in different wave conditions is analyzed section 4 presents the conclusions 2 experimental description 2 1 experimental model the twin barge of the floatover installation system designed by china national offshore oil corporation was the reference vessel the twin barge floatover system was designed to be applied in the potential site of the bohai sea of china with the water depth of 20 30 m to examine the hydrodynamic characteristic of the twin barge floatover installation system the physical model tests were conducted in the wave basin at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety tianjin university tianjin china the wave basin was 45 m length 50 m width 1 8 m depth with consideration of the prototype principal dimensions of the barge and the topside the scale was set as 1 40 the water depth d was 0 55 m in the experiments corresponding to 22 m in full scale the wavemakers were installed at one end of the wave basin and driven by a hydraulic system to generate the required waves at the end the absorbing beach was utilized for wave dissipation in the model test two identical barges were utilized to transport and transfer the mega topsides fig 1 shows the experimental model of the twin barge floatover installation in the basin the barges were ballasted for the specified inertial properties and displacement the main particulars of the twin barge model and the topsides model are listed as table 1 the configuration of the twin barge floatover installation is shown in fig 2 the twin barge model was positioned by 6 mooring lines and 4 spring hawsers the 6 mooring line lines were symmetrically spread and each line had a simple catenary mechanism the characteristics of the mooring lines are summarized in table 1 four spring hawsers were attached to the jacket legs the axial stiffness of the hawsers was set to be 11 25 kg m corresponding to 18 ton m in full scale in the model test the pretension of each hawser was set to be 20 ton one feature of the proposed twin barge floatover installation system is the elastic connection between the topsides and the barges the barges were connected with the topsides by the hemisphere shaped dsu compared to the rigid connections the flexible connection could effectively avoid the larger bending and shear forces and mitigate the large force on topsides and dsus the dsu which consists of the so called shock cell including the stabbing pin and a docking cone was designed to guide the stabbing pin into the docking cone and absorb the contact loads during the load transfer operations to facilitate the analysis the 6 dsus were marked as l1 3 and r1 3 as shown in fig 2 in the model test three hemisphere shaped dsus were installed at each barge to simulate the flexible connections the experimental model of the dsu is shown in fig 3 six traditional cone type lmus were installed at the jacket legs although the lmus were not subjected to the impact loads due to enough gaps the experimental model of the lmu is shown in fig 3 the stiffness and the capacity of the dsu are listed in table 1 the linear springs were utilized to simulate the stiffness of the dsu three different stiffness of the springs were used for 6 dsus this study focuses on the dynamic response at the docking phase of the twin barge floatover installation the topsides were lifted with a gap of 0 025 m between the jacket leg and the stabling pins corresponding to 1 0 m gap in full scale prior to the tests the topsides were aligned with the jacket legs 2 2 equipment and test matrix the non contact optical system equipped with three cameras was used to capture the 6 dof motions of the twin barge and the topsides the measurement system was installed on the top of the models and simultaneously records the positions of 12 tracking markers that were placed on decks of the twin barge and the topsides the barge and topside motions at the desired reference coordinate system were calculated by the tracking markers positions the coordinate system was defined as shown in fig 2 the sample frequency was 100 hz and the accuracy of the motion measurement system was 0 01 mm 0 01 to investigate the motion trajectories of the stabbing pins of the topsides the trajectories of all pins were calculated based on topside motions and the pins reference coordinates the loads on the mooring system were measured using a set of axial load cells located at the fairlead position the accuracy of the axial load cell was 0 05 n to measure the loads on dsus the load cells with an accuracy of 0 05 n were installed at the receiving cone the experimental tests were carried out in three different wave directions including heading quartering and beaming waves as defined in fig 2 the regular and random waves were simulated in the tests as listed in table 2 generally speaking the long wave condition should be avoided for the floatover installation to examine the workability of the twin barge floatover installation the twin barge floatover installation was also simulated in the long wave of 10 12 s the non uniform space of wave periods was utilized to capture resonance phenomena in adequate detail the jonswap spectrum with a peck enhancement factor of 3 3 was employed to simulate the targeted irregular wave 3 results and discussion 3 1 motions response 3 1 1 motion raos the raos for the topsides and the twin barge in three wave directions are obtained from a series of regular wave tests for the linear transfer function calculation the steady state motion values are extracted at the main incident wave frequency component by excluding the transient motions and drift motions 3 1 1 1 in heading waves the surge heave and pitch motions dominate the twin barge floatover installation system dynamics compared to the motions in other degrees of freedom for the heading wave condition the surge heave and pitch motions are therefore presented to demonstrate the hydrodynamics of the coupled system which are shown in fig 4 it is unsurprising that the twin barge motions are identical with each other in surge heave and pitch directions due to the symmetric configuration the topsides motions are largely synchronous with the twin barge in pitch direction and are slightly different from the twin barge in surge and heave motions the amplitude difference between the topsides and the twin barge is observed in both surge and heave directions the difference is mainly attributed to the elasticity of the dsu for the twin barge heave motions a peak occurs at the frequency range of 0 13 hz and corresponds to the natural heave frequency it is observed that the heave rao of the topsides generally decreases with the increase of the wave frequency for the twin barge and topsides pitch motions the peaks occur at the barge pitch natural frequency of 0 14 hz the surge raos of the barge and topsides generally decrease with the increasing of the wave frequency it is also found that the surge raos seems to be slightly coupled with the heave motion at the heave natural frequency of 0 13 hz 3 1 1 2 in beaming waves fig 5 shows rao of the roll motion which is one of the dominant motions in beam regular waves the significant difference of motions raos between barge 225 and barge 226 is observed which involved with the shielding effect and the interaction the twin barge because of the shielding effects the roll motion of barge 225 is always larger than barge 226 it is easily observed that the second peaks of the roll rao are closed to the roll resonance of the barge with the frequency of 0 133 hz it can be seen that a peak occurs at the relatively lower frequency and a peak occurs at the relatively higher frequency in the roll motion raos which are far from the roll resonance frequency the phenomenon would be associated with the mechanical and hydrodynamic interaction of the two barges as well as the disturbed free surface between the adjacent barges unlike the pumping mode of the wave resonance in a narrow gap occurred in the side by side offloading operation in which the free surface moves vertically with the surface remaining essentially horizontal wu 2007 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 li 2019 gao et al 2020 the twin barge configuration with a separation gap of 40 m may be associated with a fluid sloshing between the two barges extensive work on the so called sloshing phenomenon has been developed by molin 2001 lewandowski 2008 xu et al 2014 feng et al 2017 and chen et al 2018 the sloshing frequency depends much on the wavelength gap distance the breadth of the barge the draught and the curvature of the barge the different connections between the barges also contribute to different radiation wave field and thus result in different fluid motion modes in the interior free surface the natural modes are not so easily distinguishable and it is difficult to accurately estimate the frequency for the complex twin barge configuration according to lewandowski 2008 the sloshing frequencies can be roughly calculated as the function of the ratio of the gap distance to the wavelength ω n 2 gk tanh kd n λ n 2 d n 1 2 where d 40 m is the gap distance between the twin barges and λn is the wavelength associated with the nth sloshing mode ω n is the frequency of the nth sloshing mode g is the gravity acceleration k is the wavenumber based on the above equations the first three modes are elevated 0 136 hz for 1st sloshing mode 0 198 hz for 2nd sloshing mode and 0 242 hz for 3rd sloshing mode designers using the provided formulations need to keep in mind that the equations are derived based on the assumption of the box type barge with the vertical side wall and the horizontal bottom plate the shallow effect of the water and the shape of the barge will influence the estimations additionally the presence of the jackets installed in the gap also has impacts on the in between fluid motions from the roll motion results it is observed that the higher frequency peaks shown in the marked gray area of fig 5 are coincident with the 1st sloshing mode the peaks for both barge 225 and barge 226 in the roll direction can be attributed to the 1st sloshing resonance of the gap fluid from the plots the higher sloshing modes seem not to be activated and have less effect on the twin barge motions it is surprising to find the first peak of barge 225 roll motions at the relatively lower frequency one of the possible reasons may be the mechanical connection although the hinged connection will not transfer the moment the lateral force on the dsus will possibly result in the larger rotation moment and thus give rise to the large roll motion another possible reason may be the complex nonlinear near sloshing mode activated by the subharmonic excitation wang et al 2011 for the conventional rigid connected twin barge the roll motions are supposed to be synchronous in phase for the freely floating barges the motion phase difference will largely depend on the gap distance however for the hinged connected twin barge by the hemisphere shaped dsus different phase shifts of the roll motion between barge 225 and barge 226 are observed in the test fig 6 shows the roll phase difference between barge 225 and barge 226 for comparison the incident wave phase difference at the amidships is also plotted in fig 6 it is found that the phase difference varied with the frequency and the maximum phase differences are about 180 it can be observed that the phase difference between the twin barge is quite different from the wave the larger difference can be attributed to the shielding effect and the flexible connection for the topsides roll rao generally decreases with the increase of the wave frequency as shown in fig 5 for the hinged connected twin barge system the topside roll motions are dominated by both the amplitude and the phase difference of the twin barge heave motions fig 7 shows the heave raos and the phase difference it is found that although the amplitude of the twin barge heave motion is quite identical at the low frequency the topside roll motions almost reach its maximum the largest heave phase difference of 180 contributes to the larger topside roll motions it can be concluded that the phase difference will have great effects on the topsides motion and thus should be carefully designed to alleviate the large topsides motions fig 8 shows the sway motions of the twin barge floatover system it is observed that the 1st sloshing effect is significant for the twin barge it is also found that the sway and roll motions are slightly coupled at the roll resonant frequency fig 9 plots the yaw motions of the twin barge floatover installation the results indicate that the first sloshing resonance induced fewer yaw motions of barge 225 226 the yaw and roll motions are slightly coupled at the roll resonant frequency due to the shielding effect the leeward barge 225 motions is much smaller than the upwind barge 226 in yaw and sway directions special attention should be paid at the low frequency peaks which are also found in roll motions such larger motions at relative frequency range may be associated with the multi body hydrodynamic interaction the mechanical interaction caused by the elastic connection as well as the nonlinear sloshing fluid resonant in the interior free surface although for the target area of the designed twin barge floatover installation the long waves with the relatively small frequency are rare it is of practical interest to investigate the dynamics and interactions of the twin barge in the future work 3 1 1 3 in quartering waves fig 10 shows the six degree motions raos of the twin barge and the topsides the results reveal the quite complex motions response of the twin barge floatover installation there are so many factors that will induce the complex motion behavior of the twin barge floatover system including but not limited to the coupled motions the shielding effect as well as the sloshing behavior in the in between interior free surface from the plots it is found that the shielding effect is still significant in the quartering waves in which the leeward barge motions are to some extent smaller than the windward barge although it is much more difficult to distinguish the sloshing frequencies in quartering waves than the beaming waves the peaks at the relatively lower frequency that are possibly associated with the first order sloshing resonance occurs the results reveal that not only the lower frequency resulting in the larger drift motion but also the resonance frequency should be paid much attention as we focus on the performance and workability of the twin barge floatover system the three dimensional sloshing phenomenon in quartering waves is out of the scope of this study hence is not discussed further here 3 1 2 motions response spectral the most common load conditions hs 0 75 m tp 5 7 s for the target area is selected to analyze the motion responses the motion response spectra in frequency domain are calculated based on the fast fourier transform fig 11 shows the time series of the motions in quartering random waves fig 12 gives the corresponding motion response spectra of the twin barge and the topsides from the plots it can be seen that the low frequency motions are dominated in sway surge and yaw directions which is associated with the mooring and hawser lines the results indicate that the low frequency motions have a notable effect on the global response while the wave frequency responses have less influence in the surge sway and yaw directions the double peaks are found in heave directions the first peak is caused by the wave excitation and the second is induced by the natural frequency the results indicate the wave frequency and natural frequency motions contribute equally to the heave motions for the twin barge and the topsides it is of interest to observe that the roll motion spectral of barge 225 has two comparable peaks corresponding to the wave frequency and the natural frequency however the roll motion spectrum of barge 226 is observed to have the highest energy amplitude at the natural frequency due to the shielding effect of the twin barge the wave frequency motions of barge 226 was smaller further the pitch spectrums of the twin barge are quite different in the peak amplitudes and the peak frequency the pitch spectrum of barge 225 gets the peak at the wave frequency and the pitch spectrum of barge 226 gets the peak at the resonance frequency it is found that both the wave frequency motion and the resonance frequency motion contribute to the topside pitch motion it can be concluded that the shielding effect of the twin barge has great impacts on the heave roll and pitch motions and less effect on the surge sway and yaw motions 3 1 3 trajectory the motions of the topside stabbing pin which is associated with the collisions are of interest for the mating operation larger motions of the mating points than the capture radius of the stabbing pin will lead to larger impact loads and even result in the fail of the mating operation according to the guidelines dnv 2015 the minimum vertical clearance between the stabbing pins and the jacket legs should be 1 0 m the maximum vertical and horizontal motions of the stabbing pins are suggested not to be exceeded 0 5 m during the docking stage the suggestion is however without consideration of the radius of the receiving cone installed on the jacked legs in engineering practice the larger radius of the receiving cone will allow the larger motions of the topsides when the stabbing pins and the receiving cone are perfectly aligned vertically along the z axis the mating process will be smooth more often the topside stabbing pins move over time and are not always perfectly aligned with the receiving cone due to the environment induced motions if the deviation defined as the distance between the stabbing pins from the centre of the receiving cone is limited within the allowable distance the mating is likely to be successful although it may suffer from the collisions in this analysis the radius of the receiving cone i e 0 76 m is considered as the reference allowable distance fig 13 illustrates the trajectories of all stabbing pins in beam regular waves it can be observed that the trajectories of the stabbing pins generally are in form of the elliptic the motions of windward three stabbing pins i e b1 3 are to some extent identical although the motions of the stabbing pin b3 closed to the barge bow are slightly larger than the others in z direction which may be caused by the barge pitch motions it is observed that the amplitudes of the windward pin motions are almost equal to the leeward pin motions although the pattern of the trajectory is different detailed motions trajectories of the stabbing pins a3 are plotted in fig 14 from the right subplot the vertical trajectory of the stabbing pin tends to a sloped line due to the elliptical trajectory of the water particle in which the blue dotted lines denote the safe boundaries recommended by the dnv guidelines the maximum motion in z direction is much smaller than 0 5 m indicating that the gap of 1 0 m between the stabbing pin and the receiving cone can be enough to avoid the impact load for the trajectories in xy plane as plotted in the middle subplot the results indicate that the 0 5 m and 0 76 m limitations plotted as the blue and red dotted lines in fig 14 are not exceeded for the trajectories in beaming random waves as illustrated in fig 15 the trajectory results of the stabbing pins demonstrate that the weight transfer operation is safe from the perspective of the mating point traces the motion in xy plane is more crucial than the vertical motions judging by the two criteria the motion performance of all stabbing pins are checked demonstrating the twin barge floatover installation in heading and beaming waves are satisfactory the trajectories in the quartering wave conditions are considered as shown in fig 16 and fig 17 fig 16 plotted the trajectory of the stabbing pin a3 in regular waves with wave period t 11 s it can be clearly seen from the right subplot that the motion in z direction is not exceeded the limitations in contrast from the middle subplot it can be observed that the stabbing pin moves across the boundary for both the guideline recommendations and the radius of the receiving cone the outcrossing beyond the circular safety boundary will result in larger impact loads however it should be noted that it does not means the mating operation is not totally allowable as most times the traces are in the safe regions the results remind that if the mating in such long wave is carried out the onboard motion monitor system together with the assistant of the lash lines must be applied for the reliable mating timing for much more reliable floatover operations adding more lashing lines would be an alternative method to constraint the topsides motions for the floatover installation moreover the trajectory of a3 in random quartering waves is also examined as shown in fig 17 both the vertical motions and the in plane motions are smaller than the capture range it can be concluded that the long wave will result in larger in plane motions of the topside stabbing pin and is one of the most critical scenarios of the mating operation 3 2 dsu loads the dsu load is another concern in the design of the twin barge floatover installation the vertical loads on dsus in different wave directions are compared in this section figs 18 20 give r1 and l1 dsu loads in heading quartering and beaming random waves r1 load is quite close to l1 load in heading waves and is slightly larger than l1 load in beaming waves and quartering waves due to the roll rotation angle of the topsides both the largest r1 and l1 loads occur in the quartering waves to investigate the effect of the wave directions on dsu loads the statistical results including the significant value and the standard deviation of dsu r1 loads in different wave directions and different wave periods are evaluated and compared as shown in figs 21 and 22 it can be found from the statistical results that quartering waves induce the largest significant value and the standard deviation and heading wave results in the smallest values the largest differences of the significant value and the standard deviation between the quartering waves and the heading wave are even about 62 and 54 respectively it is also found that the statistical value generally decreases with the increase of the wave periods it can be concluded that the dsu loads are greatly sensitive to the wave directions from the perspective of the loads the quartering waves should be avoided for ensuring the safety of the floatover operation installation 4 conclusions the experimental investigation of the twin barge floatover installation is presented in this paper two identical barges elastically connected the topsides by the hemisphere shaped dsus are modeled with the goal of examining the performance and the workability of the twin barge floatover system the complicated dynamic response of the twin barge floatover system in heading beaming and quartering waves are investigated the statistical and spectrum analysis of the motion response as well as dsus loads in regular and random waves are carried out the motion results indicate that the motion raos revealed that the shielding effect and the interaction of the twin barge will greatly influence the motion behavior of the twin barge system for both the amplitude and the phase difference the first order resonance of the in between free surface will lead to the larger motion amplitude of the twin barge system it is found from the experimental results that the twin barge will experience large motions at the low frequency which is possibly caused by the hydrodynamic and mechanical interactions the twin barge floatover operation should be carefully carried out in the long wave as the trajectories will exceed the safety boundary either the guideline recommended regions or the capture radius of the utilized receiving cone from the statistical results of dsu loads the twin barge system is greatly sensitive to the wave direction indicating that the twin barge system is more dangerous in the quartering seas although the response of the twin barge floatover installation is investigated by our extensive experimental tests this study only considers the docking phase further research is needed to be carried out for different load transfer stages to get insights into the entire load transfer process of the twin barge installation which is generally analyzed in the conventional single hull floatover installation another concern of the twin barge concept is the flexible connection efforts should be made on the influence of the flexible connection on the dynamics in addition the available numerical method for the twin barge floatover installation system is in the need investigating the motion characteristics and the impact load on mating units which is the critical issue for the floatover installation credit authorship

proposed recently such as the floatover installation method using the strand lifting scheme and the rapid jacking rigs to reduce the ballasting operation time wang et al 2018 bai et al 2020a b and the floatover installation by the dynamic positioning transport vessel bai et al 2014 although numerous studies on the floatover installation have been carried out most of the past studies have been limited to the rigidly connected two barges or a single hull barge considerable research efforts are required for extensions to problems involving the interaction of elastically connected twin barge floatover installation which has been rarely reported in the previous study to the best of the author s knowledge the articulated hinged connection between the topsides and the barges can efficiently reduce the bending loads on the topsides and the connection rigs from the engineering application point of view the flexible connections are much more convenient and efficient than the conventional rigid connection with the aim of investigating the hydrodynamic response of the elastically connected twin barge floatover installation system the twin barge hinged connected with the topsides by the hemisphere shaped deck support unit dsu at the docking phase is experimentally modeled in this study the hydrodynamic performance of the twin barge floatover installation system in heading beaming and quartering waves are analyzed as well as the loads on dsus the paper is organized as follows section 2 details the experimental set up in section 3 the dynamic response of the twin barge floatover installation in different wave conditions is analyzed section 4 presents the conclusions 2 experimental description 2 1 experimental model the twin barge of the floatover installation system designed by china national offshore oil corporation was the reference vessel the twin barge floatover system was designed to be applied in the potential site of the bohai sea of china with the water depth of 20 30 m to examine the hydrodynamic characteristic of the twin barge floatover installation system the physical model tests were conducted in the wave basin at the state key laboratory of hydraulic engineering simulation and safety tianjin university tianjin china the wave basin was 45 m length 50 m width 1 8 m depth with consideration of the prototype principal dimensions of the barge and the topside the scale was set as 1 40 the water depth d was 0 55 m in the experiments corresponding to 22 m in full scale the wavemakers were installed at one end of the wave basin and driven by a hydraulic system to generate the required waves at the end the absorbing beach was utilized for wave dissipation in the model test two identical barges were utilized to transport and transfer the mega topsides fig 1 shows the experimental model of the twin barge floatover installation in the basin the barges were ballasted for the specified inertial properties and displacement the main particulars of the twin barge model and the topsides model are listed as table 1 the configuration of the twin barge floatover installation is shown in fig 2 the twin barge model was positioned by 6 mooring lines and 4 spring hawsers the 6 mooring line lines were symmetrically spread and each line had a simple catenary mechanism the characteristics of the mooring lines are summarized in table 1 four spring hawsers were attached to the jacket legs the axial stiffness of the hawsers was set to be 11 25 kg m corresponding to 18 ton m in full scale in the model test the pretension of each hawser was set to be 20 ton one feature of the proposed twin barge floatover installation system is the elastic connection between the topsides and the barges the barges were connected with the topsides by the hemisphere shaped dsu compared to the rigid connections the flexible connection could effectively avoid the larger bending and shear forces and mitigate the large force on topsides and dsus the dsu which consists of the so called shock cell including the stabbing pin and a docking cone was designed to guide the stabbing pin into the docking cone and absorb the contact loads during the load transfer operations to facilitate the analysis the 6 dsus were marked as l1 3 and r1 3 as shown in fig 2 in the model test three hemisphere shaped dsus were installed at each barge to simulate the flexible connections the experimental model of the dsu is shown in fig 3 six traditional cone type lmus were installed at the jacket legs although the lmus were not subjected to the impact loads due to enough gaps the experimental model of the lmu is shown in fig 3 the stiffness and the capacity of the dsu are listed in table 1 the linear springs were utilized to simulate the stiffness of the dsu three different stiffness of the springs were used for 6 dsus this study focuses on the dynamic response at the docking phase of the twin barge floatover installation the topsides were lifted with a gap of 0 025 m between the jacket leg and the stabling pins corresponding to 1 0 m gap in full scale prior to the tests the topsides were aligned with the jacket legs 2 2 equipment and test matrix the non contact optical system equipped with three cameras was used to capture the 6 dof motions of the twin barge and the topsides the measurement system was installed on the top of the models and simultaneously records the positions of 12 tracking markers that were placed on decks of the twin barge and the topsides the barge and topside motions at the desired reference coordinate system were calculated by the tracking markers positions the coordinate system was defined as shown in fig 2 the sample frequency was 100 hz and the accuracy of the motion measurement system was 0 01 mm 0 01 to investigate the motion trajectories of the stabbing pins of the topsides the trajectories of all pins were calculated based on topside motions and the pins reference coordinates the loads on the mooring system were measured using a set of axial load cells located at the fairlead position the accuracy of the axial load cell was 0 05 n to measure the loads on dsus the load cells with an accuracy of 0 05 n were installed at the receiving cone the experimental tests were carried out in three different wave directions including heading quartering and beaming waves as defined in fig 2 the regular and random waves were simulated in the tests as listed in table 2 generally speaking the long wave condition should be avoided for the floatover installation to examine the workability of the twin barge floatover installation the twin barge floatover installation was also simulated in the long wave of 10 12 s the non uniform space of wave periods was utilized to capture resonance phenomena in adequate detail the jonswap spectrum with a peck enhancement factor of 3 3 was employed to simulate the targeted irregular wave 3 results and discussion 3 1 motions response 3 1 1 motion raos the raos for the topsides and the twin barge in three wave directions are obtained from a series of regular wave tests for the linear transfer function calculation the steady state motion values are extracted at the main incident wave frequency component by excluding the transient motions and drift motions 3 1 1 1 in heading waves the surge heave and pitch motions dominate the twin barge floatover installation system dynamics compared to the motions in other degrees of freedom for the heading wave condition the surge heave and pitch motions are therefore presented to demonstrate the hydrodynamics of the coupled system which are shown in fig 4 it is unsurprising that the twin barge motions are identical with each other in surge heave and pitch directions due to the symmetric configuration the topsides motions are largely synchronous with the twin barge in pitch direction and are slightly different from the twin barge in surge and heave motions the amplitude difference between the topsides and the twin barge is observed in both surge and heave directions the difference is mainly attributed to the elasticity of the dsu for the twin barge heave motions a peak occurs at the frequency range of 0 13 hz and corresponds to the natural heave frequency it is observed that the heave rao of the topsides generally decreases with the increase of the wave frequency for the twin barge and topsides pitch motions the peaks occur at the barge pitch natural frequency of 0 14 hz the surge raos of the barge and topsides generally decrease with the increasing of the wave frequency it is also found that the surge raos seems to be slightly coupled with the heave motion at the heave natural frequency of 0 13 hz 3 1 1 2 in beaming waves fig 5 shows rao of the roll motion which is one of the dominant motions in beam regular waves the significant difference of motions raos between barge 225 and barge 226 is observed which involved with the shielding effect and the interaction the twin barge because of the shielding effects the roll motion of barge 225 is always larger than barge 226 it is easily observed that the second peaks of the roll rao are closed to the roll resonance of the barge with the frequency of 0 133 hz it can be seen that a peak occurs at the relatively lower frequency and a peak occurs at the relatively higher frequency in the roll motion raos which are far from the roll resonance frequency the phenomenon would be associated with the mechanical and hydrodynamic interaction of the two barges as well as the disturbed free surface between the adjacent barges unlike the pumping mode of the wave resonance in a narrow gap occurred in the side by side offloading operation in which the free surface moves vertically with the surface remaining essentially horizontal wu 2007 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 li 2019 gao et al 2020 the twin barge configuration with a separation gap of 40 m may be associated with a fluid sloshing between the two barges extensive work on the so called sloshing phenomenon has been developed by molin 2001 lewandowski 2008 xu et al 2014 feng et al 2017 and chen et al 2018 the sloshing frequency depends much on the wavelength gap distance the breadth of the barge the draught and the curvature of the barge the different connections between the barges also contribute to different radiation wave field and thus result in different fluid motion modes in the interior free surface the natural modes are not so easily distinguishable and it is difficult to accurately estimate the frequency for the complex twin barge configuration according to lewandowski 2008 the sloshing frequencies can be roughly calculated as the function of the ratio of the gap distance to the wavelength ω n 2 gk tanh kd n λ n 2 d n 1 2 where d 40 m is the gap distance between the twin barges and λn is the wavelength associated with the nth sloshing mode ω n is the frequency of the nth sloshing mode g is the gravity acceleration k is the wavenumber based on the above equations the first three modes are elevated 0 136 hz for 1st sloshing mode 0 198 hz for 2nd sloshing mode and 0 242 hz for 3rd sloshing mode designers using the provided formulations need to keep in mind that the equations are derived based on the assumption of the box type barge with the vertical side wall and the horizontal bottom plate the shallow effect of the water and the shape of the barge will influence the estimations additionally the presence of the jackets installed in the gap also has impacts on the in between fluid motions from the roll motion results it is observed that the higher frequency peaks shown in the marked gray area of fig 5 are coincident with the 1st sloshing mode the peaks for both barge 225 and barge 226 in the roll direction can be attributed to the 1st sloshing resonance of the gap fluid from the plots the higher sloshing modes seem not to be activated and have less effect on the twin barge motions it is surprising to find the first peak of barge 225 roll motions at the relatively lower frequency one of the possible reasons may be the mechanical connection although the hinged connection will not transfer the moment the lateral force on the dsus will possibly result in the larger rotation moment and thus give rise to the large roll motion another possible reason may be the complex nonlinear near sloshing mode activated by the subharmonic excitation wang et al 2011 for the conventional rigid connected twin barge the roll motions are supposed to be synchronous in phase for the freely floating barges the motion phase difference will largely depend on the gap distance however for the hinged connected twin barge by the hemisphere shaped dsus different phase shifts of the roll motion between barge 225 and barge 226 are observed in the test fig 6 shows the roll phase difference between barge 225 and barge 226 for comparison the incident wave phase difference at the amidships is also plotted in fig 6 it is found that the phase difference varied with the frequency and the maximum phase differences are about 180 it can be observed that the phase difference between the twin barge is quite different from the wave the larger difference can be attributed to the shielding effect and the flexible connection for the topsides roll rao generally decreases with the increase of the wave frequency as shown in fig 5 for the hinged connected twin barge system the topside roll motions are dominated by both the amplitude and the phase difference of the twin barge heave motions fig 7 shows the heave raos and the phase difference it is found that although the amplitude of the twin barge heave motion is quite identical at the low frequency the topside roll motions almost reach its maximum the largest heave phase difference of 180 contributes to the larger topside roll motions it can be concluded that the phase difference will have great effects on the topsides motion and thus should be carefully designed to alleviate the large topsides motions fig 8 shows the sway motions of the twin barge floatover system it is observed that the 1st sloshing effect is significant for the twin barge it is also found that the sway and roll motions are slightly coupled at the roll resonant frequency fig 9 plots the yaw motions of the twin barge floatover installation the results indicate that the first sloshing resonance induced fewer yaw motions of barge 225 226 the yaw and roll motions are slightly coupled at the roll resonant frequency due to the shielding effect the leeward barge 225 motions is much smaller than the upwind barge 226 in yaw and sway directions special attention should be paid at the low frequency peaks which are also found in roll motions such larger motions at relative frequency range may be associated with the multi body hydrodynamic interaction the mechanical interaction caused by the elastic connection as well as the nonlinear sloshing fluid resonant in the interior free surface although for the target area of the designed twin barge floatover installation the long waves with the relatively small frequency are rare it is of practical interest to investigate the dynamics and interactions of the twin barge in the future work 3 1 1 3 in quartering waves fig 10 shows the six degree motions raos of the twin barge and the topsides the results reveal the quite complex motions response of the twin barge floatover installation there are so many factors that will induce the complex motion behavior of the twin barge floatover system including but not limited to the coupled motions the shielding effect as well as the sloshing behavior in the in between interior free surface from the plots it is found that the shielding effect is still significant in the quartering waves in which the leeward barge motions are to some extent smaller than the windward barge although it is much more difficult to distinguish the sloshing frequencies in quartering waves than the beaming waves the peaks at the relatively lower frequency that are possibly associated with the first order sloshing resonance occurs the results reveal that not only the lower frequency resulting in the larger drift motion but also the resonance frequency should be paid much attention as we focus on the performance and workability of the twin barge floatover system the three dimensional sloshing phenomenon in quartering waves is out of the scope of this study hence is not discussed further here 3 1 2 motions response spectral the most common load conditions hs 0 75 m tp 5 7 s for the target area is selected to analyze the motion responses the motion response spectra in frequency domain are calculated based on the fast fourier transform fig 11 shows the time series of the motions in quartering random waves fig 12 gives the corresponding motion response spectra of the twin barge and the topsides from the plots it can be seen that the low frequency motions are dominated in sway surge and yaw directions which is associated with the mooring and hawser lines the results indicate that the low frequency motions have a notable effect on the global response while the wave frequency responses have less influence in the surge sway and yaw directions the double peaks are found in heave directions the first peak is caused by the wave excitation and the second is induced by the natural frequency the results indicate the wave frequency and natural frequency motions contribute equally to the heave motions for the twin barge and the topsides it is of interest to observe that the roll motion spectral of barge 225 has two comparable peaks corresponding to the wave frequency and the natural frequency however the roll motion spectrum of barge 226 is observed to have the highest energy amplitude at the natural frequency due to the shielding effect of the twin barge the wave frequency motions of barge 226 was smaller further the pitch spectrums of the twin barge are quite different in the peak amplitudes and the peak frequency the pitch spectrum of barge 225 gets the peak at the wave frequency and the pitch spectrum of barge 226 gets the peak at the resonance frequency it is found that both the wave frequency motion and the resonance frequency motion contribute to the topside pitch motion it can be concluded that the shielding effect of the twin barge has great impacts on the heave roll and pitch motions and less effect on the surge sway and yaw motions 3 1 3 trajectory the motions of the topside stabbing pin which is associated with the collisions are of interest for the mating operation larger motions of the mating points than the capture radius of the stabbing pin will lead to larger impact loads and even result in the fail of the mating operation according to the guidelines dnv 2015 the minimum vertical clearance between the stabbing pins and the jacket legs should be 1 0 m the maximum vertical and horizontal motions of the stabbing pins are suggested not to be exceeded 0 5 m during the docking stage the suggestion is however without consideration of the radius of the receiving cone installed on the jacked legs in engineering practice the larger radius of the receiving cone will allow the larger motions of the topsides when the stabbing pins and the receiving cone are perfectly aligned vertically along the z axis the mating process will be smooth more often the topside stabbing pins move over time and are not always perfectly aligned with the receiving cone due to the environment induced motions if the deviation defined as the distance between the stabbing pins from the centre of the receiving cone is limited within the allowable distance the mating is likely to be successful although it may suffer from the collisions in this analysis the radius of the receiving cone i e 0 76 m is considered as the reference allowable distance fig 13 illustrates the trajectories of all stabbing pins in beam regular waves it can be observed that the trajectories of the stabbing pins generally are in form of the elliptic the motions of windward three stabbing pins i e b1 3 are to some extent identical although the motions of the stabbing pin b3 closed to the barge bow are slightly larger than the others in z direction which may be caused by the barge pitch motions it is observed that the amplitudes of the windward pin motions are almost equal to the leeward pin motions although the pattern of the trajectory is different detailed motions trajectories of the stabbing pins a3 are plotted in fig 14 from the right subplot the vertical trajectory of the stabbing pin tends to a sloped line due to the elliptical trajectory of the water particle in which the blue dotted lines denote the safe boundaries recommended by the dnv guidelines the maximum motion in z direction is much smaller than 0 5 m indicating that the gap of 1 0 m between the stabbing pin and the receiving cone can be enough to avoid the impact load for the trajectories in xy plane as plotted in the middle subplot the results indicate that the 0 5 m and 0 76 m limitations plotted as the blue and red dotted lines in fig 14 are not exceeded for the trajectories in beaming random waves as illustrated in fig 15 the trajectory results of the stabbing pins demonstrate that the weight transfer operation is safe from the perspective of the mating point traces the motion in xy plane is more crucial than the vertical motions judging by the two criteria the motion performance of all stabbing pins are checked demonstrating the twin barge floatover installation in heading and beaming waves are satisfactory the trajectories in the quartering wave conditions are considered as shown in fig 16 and fig 17 fig 16 plotted the trajectory of the stabbing pin a3 in regular waves with wave period t 11 s it can be clearly seen from the right subplot that the motion in z direction is not exceeded the limitations in contrast from the middle subplot it can be observed that the stabbing pin moves across the boundary for both the guideline recommendations and the radius of the receiving cone the outcrossing beyond the circular safety boundary will result in larger impact loads however it should be noted that it does not means the mating operation is not totally allowable as most times the traces are in the safe regions the results remind that if the mating in such long wave is carried out the onboard motion monitor system together with the assistant of the lash lines must be applied for the reliable mating timing for much more reliable floatover operations adding more lashing lines would be an alternative method to constraint the topsides motions for the floatover installation moreover the trajectory of a3 in random quartering waves is also examined as shown in fig 17 both the vertical motions and the in plane motions are smaller than the capture range it can be concluded that the long wave will result in larger in plane motions of the topside stabbing pin and is one of the most critical scenarios of the mating operation 3 2 dsu loads the dsu load is another concern in the design of the twin barge floatover installation the vertical loads on dsus in different wave directions are compared in this section figs 18 20 give r1 and l1 dsu loads in heading quartering and beaming random waves r1 load is quite close to l1 load in heading waves and is slightly larger than l1 load in beaming waves and quartering waves due to the roll rotation angle of the topsides both the largest r1 and l1 loads occur in the quartering waves to investigate the effect of the wave directions on dsu loads the statistical results including the significant value and the standard deviation of dsu r1 loads in different wave directions and different wave periods are evaluated and compared as shown in figs 21 and 22 it can be found from the statistical results that quartering waves induce the largest significant value and the standard deviation and heading wave results in the smallest values the largest differences of the significant value and the standard deviation between the quartering waves and the heading wave are even about 62 and 54 respectively it is also found that the statistical value generally decreases with the increase of the wave periods it can be concluded that the dsu loads are greatly sensitive to the wave directions from the perspective of the loads the quartering waves should be avoided for ensuring the safety of the floatover operation installation 4 conclusions the experimental investigation of the twin barge floatover installation is presented in this paper two identical barges elastically connected the topsides by the hemisphere shaped dsus are modeled with the goal of examining the performance and the workability of the twin barge floatover system the complicated dynamic response of the twin barge floatover system in heading beaming and quartering waves are investigated the statistical and spectrum analysis of the motion response as well as dsus loads in regular and random waves are carried out the motion results indicate that the motion raos revealed that the shielding effect and the interaction of the twin barge will greatly influence the motion behavior of the twin barge system for both the amplitude and the phase difference the first order resonance of the in between free surface will lead to the larger motion amplitude of the twin barge system it is found from the experimental results that the twin barge will experience large motions at the low frequency which is possibly caused by the hydrodynamic and mechanical interactions the twin barge floatover operation should be carefully carried out in the long wave as the trajectories will exceed the safety boundary either the guideline recommended regions or the capture radius of the utilized receiving cone from the statistical results of dsu loads the twin barge system is greatly sensitive to the wave direction indicating that the twin barge system is more dangerous in the quartering seas although the response of the twin barge floatover installation is investigated by our extensive experimental tests this study only considers the docking phase further research is needed to be carried out for different load transfer stages to get insights into the entire load transfer process of the twin barge installation which is generally analyzed in the conventional single hull floatover installation another concern of the twin barge concept is the flexible connection efforts should be made on the influence of the flexible connection on the dynamics in addition the available numerical method for the twin barge floatover installation system is in the need investigating the motion characteristics and the impact load on mating units which is the critical issue for the floatover installation credit authorship

21251,mooring systems are important structural components of very long floating bridges they effectively limit the transverse motions of the bridge under environmental loads they also add viscous hydrodynamic damping to the entire system the safe and economical design of mooring systems is thus important but also challenging especially when the wave conditions are inhomogeneous in this paper a computational study is carried out to investigate the responses of the mooring lines for a 4 6 km long fjord crossing floating bridge accounting for inhomogeneous wave conditions based on the structural responses this study also attempts to evaluate the fatigue damage in the mooring lines by using different fatigue analysis methods the accuracy of the spectral methods is examined by comparison with the conventional rainflow cycle counting algorithm numerical studies are conducted to obtain an indication of the effect of various wave inhomogeneities on the fatigue damage in the mooring lines keywords floating bridge mooring line wave inhomogeneity short crested fatigue damage 1 introduction floating bridges are sophisticated structures across waterbodies subjected to complex loading conditions they take advantage of the natural buoyancy to carry the gravity loads they also face fewer complications arising from large water depths and or soft seabed conditions that commonly hinder the adoption of bottom founded structures for transportation purposes owing to these distinct advantages floating bridges are recognised as a favourable and practical option in the e39 coastal highway project led by the norwegian public road administration statens vegvesen to replace the time consuming ferry trips across the wide and deep norwegian fjords cowi 2019 however the design and construction of a safe and cost effective floating bridge could still be technically challenging especially when the span is very long and the environmental conditions are complicated taking the bjørnafjord in norway as an example the very long crossing of up to 5 km results in inevitably slender and flexible floating bridge designs leading to significant hydroelastic responses of the bridge structure under wave actions cheng et al 2018a kvåle et al 2016 viuff et al 2018 2019 xiang and løken 2019 xiang et al 2018 in addition the wave conditions are observed to be nonhomogeneous owing to the complex topology and the large span of the crossing cheng et al 2019a this introduces further complexities to the proper modelling and detailed study of the dynamic responses of the floating bridge cheng et al 2018b dai et al 2020a in an attempt to effectively limit the transverse motions and bending moments of the bridge structure under environmental loads a design concept comprising a side anchored floating pontoon bridge was proposed and is currently under feasibility investigations dnv 2018a multiconsult 2017 four clusters of mooring lines are attached to selected bridge pontoons spaced about 1 km apart besides limiting the transverse response these mooring lines are also expected to add viscous hydrodynamic damping to the bridge structure therefore the mooring lines play a vital role in the structural behaviour of the floating bridge under complicated environmental conditions and the safe and economical design of these structural components is of great importance however to the best knowledge of the authors the effect of inhomogeneous wave conditions on the structural responses of the mooring systems for a very long floating bridge or similar slender marine structures has not been reported in the open literature besides the structural responses it is also important to examine the fatigue damage in the mooring lines due to the cyclic nature of the wave loads a preliminary study on the current floating bridge design concept considering homogeneous wave conditions reveals that the safe design of some mooring lines may be governed by their fatigue life multiconsult 2017 unfortunately in the context of inhomogeneous wave conditions the existing literature again lacks the information pertaining to the fatigue damage in the mooring lines for a very long floating bridge or similar structures in a typical fatigue analysis the conventional rainflow cycle counting method is commonly employed alternatively spectral methods that are computationally efficient may be advantageous especially at the stages of design conceptualisation and initial feasibility studies when the structural configuration is subjected to iterative changes and optimisations commonly used spectral methods include the method by dirlik 1985 the formula by benasciutti and tovo 2005 the bimodal method proposed by jiao and moan 1990 and the trimodal method by gao and moan 2008 these models were developed for gaussian processes when the processes are narrow band the classic rayleigh model is applicable bouyssy et al 1993 gao and moan 2009 miles 1954 the comparison of various spectral fatigue analysis methods was made by several researchers benasciutti and tovo 2006 chang et al 2017 han et al 2020 xu et al 2014 among these approaches the dirlik s method is found to perform quite well for both wide and narrow band gaussian processes by comparison with the rainflow cycle counting method arany et al 2014 bouyssy et al 1993 yeter et al 2016 this method has been extensively applied to the fatigue analysis of marine structures including wind turbines and offshore platforms under the action of complex environmental loads arany et al 2014 bouyssy et al 1993 chaudhury and dover 1985 chen and basu 2018 gao and moan 2009 yeter et al 2015 2016 methods also exist for non gaussian processes due to nonlinear structural behaviour or non gaussian excitations chang et al 2017 gao and moan 2007 winterstein 1988 thus it is interesting to assess the applicability of the spectral methods such as dirlik s method and the simple rayleigh model for fatigue damage estimation of the mooring lines for a very long floating bridge under the action of inhomogeneous wave loads the focus of the present study is therefore twofold first we study the structural responses of the mooring lines for a 4 6 km long floating bridge under the action of inhomogeneous wave conditions next the fatigue damage in the mooring lines is evaluated by using different fatigue analysis methods the applicability of closed form expressions of the fatigue damage based on spectral parameters is examined and the accuracy is tested by comparison with the conventional rainflow cycle counting algorithm numerical studies are carried out with the aim to obtain an indication of the effect of various wave inhomogeneities on the fatigue damage of mooring lines the remainder of the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the numerical model for the time domain response analysis of the floating bridge considering inhomogeneous wave loads section 3 examines the structural responses of the mooring lines section 4 investigates the various effects of wave inhomogeneity on the fatigue damage in the mooring lines finally section 5 concludes the findings of the study 2 numerical model and methodology 2 1 floating bridge model the current design concept for crossing of the bjørnafjord features a straight and side anchored floating bridge as shown in fig 1 the design concept comprises a cable stayed bridge segment at the south end with a main span of 470 m and a back span of 430 m the bridge deck is elevated 49 m above the mean sea level for navigation purposes this cable stayed bridge segment connects to the floating bridge segment which is composed of a 902 2 m long transitional high part and a 3296 3 m long low part pontoons spaced approximately 125 m apart are engaged in order to provide support to the floating bridge girder in the vertical direction to effectively limit the transverse motion under environmental loads the bridge is side anchored by four evenly spaced clusters of mooring lines in addition to the bridge abutments at the two ends as the low part of the floating bridge constitutes the primary segment of the bridge design concept an idealised numerical bridge model is therefore established by reasonably extending this low part to approximately the length of the entire crossing as shown in fig 2 besides the geometric parameters are also regularised for the sake of simplification for example the spacing between two adjacent pontoons labelled a1 to a35 is set to 125 m in view of the fact that the varying topography has little effect on the wave excitation forces cheng et al 2018a a constant water depth of 300 m which represents approximately the average water depth along the crossing is adopted consequently the four mooring clusters are standardised by employing an identical spread layout note that in each mooring cluster a number of eight mooring lines are attached to the sidewall of the moored pontoon at 3 m draught with an identical pretension the spread angles of line 1 to line 8 in each cluster are 75 80 100 105 255 260 280 and 285 respectively anticlockwise from the global x axis the mooring lines are for a relatively taut system based on a standard composition of a spiral strand segment with plastic sheathing of 11 mm thickness sandwiched by two studless chain segments of grade r4 two different pretensions namely 1500 kn and 1630 kn are applied to the end clusters clusters 1 and 4 and internal clusters clusters 2 and 3 respectively this is in order to match the transverse stiffness of the mooring clusters applied in the design concept multiconsult 2017 fig 3 shows the force displacement curves of the mooring clusters subjected to the two different pretensions table 1 summarises the cross sectional properties of the bridge girder and column table 2 lists the structural properties of the mooring lines note that the chain and wire segments were designed with different diameters to have the similar minimum breaking load of approximately 15 000 kn under corroded conditions dnv 2018a the parameters for the chain segments are based on vicinay s product catalogue vicinay 2020 whereas the parameters for the wire segments are based on bridon s product catalogue calverley 2004 the pontoon properties are given in table 3 the boundary conditions are as follows all six degrees of freedom are fully restrained at the bridge south end while the translation along the x axis and rotation about the z axis are allowed at the north end note that all the abovementioned parameters are adopted according to the design concept of the floating bridge dnv 2018a multiconsult 2017 also note that near the south end the length of the first span is purposely chosen to match the dynamic properties of the cable stayed bridge segment in the numerical model the bridge pontoons are treated as rigid bodies subjected to wave loads the hydrodynamic coefficients i e the added mass and potential damping properties and the wave excitation force transfer functions corresponding to the bridge pontoons are evaluated in the frequency domain by using the commercial tool wamit wamit 2019 fig 4 shows an example of the panel models of the wet surface of two typical pontoons constructed for use in wamit in view of the fact that the pontoon spacing is relatively large when compared with the length of the wind waves in the fjord statens vegvesen 2018 the effect of hydrodynamical coupling between pontoons is expected to be small and thus not accounted for then the governing equations of motion for the bridge pontoons in the time domain can be obtained in accordance with cummins theory cummins 1962 as 1 m p a p u p t k r t τ u p τ d τ k b k h u p t f 1 e x c t f 2 e x c t where m p

structural stiffness matrix that represents the restraining effect of the bridge k h is the hydrostatic restoring stiffness matrix u p is the displacement vector of the pontoon f 1 e x c t is the force vector containing the first order wave excitation load components and correspondingly f 2 e x c t is the force vector containing the second order difference frequency wave excitation load components the other structural components namely the girders columns and mooring lines are modelled by means of the finite element method in view of their slenderness the girders and columns are represented by using euler bernoulli beam elements while the mooring lines are discretised into bar elements considering their geometric stiffness besides their self weight the hydrodynamic loads acting on the mooring lines are considered according to the morison equation as 2 f m ρ w v u w ρ w c a v u w u m 1 2 ρ w c d d u w u m u w u m where ρ w denotes the density of seawater v is the volume per unit length of the mooring line d is the diameter of the mooring line c a 1 0 is the added mass coefficient and c d is the quadratic drag coefficient note that c d in the transverse direction is taken as 2 4 for the top and bottom chain segments while it is set to 1 2 for the intermediate wire segments for the longitudinal direction c d is taken as 1 15 and 0 1 respectively multiconsult 2017 u w denotes the flow velocity and u m is the corresponding velocity of the submerged mooring line by assemblage the governing equations of motion for the entire floating bridge model in the global coordinate system may be expressed in a compact matrix form as 3 m b u b c b u b k r t τ u b τ d τ k b u b f b where m b denotes the global mass matrix of the entire floating bridge model c b is the global damping matrix k b is the global stiffness matrix f b is the global external load vector k r is the global matrix containing retardation functions for the degrees of freedom of the pontoons only and u b is the global displacement vector note that the superscript dots denote partial derivatives with respect to the time t note that the global mass matrix m b contains both the structural mass and the hydrodynamic added mass likewise c b comprises the contributions from the structural damping and the quadratic damping for the modelling of the structural damping the rayleigh damping is adopted with a mass proportional coefficient of 0 001 and a stiffness proportional coefficient of 0 025 this results in a 0 5 damping ratio for the two lowest modes which complies with the requirement stated in the design basis for steel structures statens vegvesen 2018 the global stiffness matrix k b contains the bridge structural stiffness and the hydrostatic restoring stiffness the external load vector f b includes the gravitational forces buoyancy forces and wave excitation forces the commercial software package sima is employed for the numerical simulation of the floating bridge model through a coupled simo riflex task sintef ocean 2019a sintef ocean 2019b fig 5 presents the first five vibration modes of the floating bridge as it can be seen all these modes correspond to the transverse vibration of the bridge girder and they possess long natural periods that may be excited by the slow varying second order difference frequency wave load components these vibration modes are also found to be coupled with the torsional modes of the bridge girder as a result of the restraining effect of the mooring lines the lowest axial mode occurs at 11 s as for the vertical vibration modes they are found to be densely clustered near 7 s which is close to the local wind driven wave periods statens vegvesen 2018 therefore the vertical motion and bending moment of the floating bridge are expected to be excited by the first order wave load components in a wind sea more detailed information about the modal properties of the side anchored floating bridge was reported by dai et al 2020a 2 2 inhomogeneous wave conditions the combination of varying fjord topography and a very large span of up to 5 km has led to complicated wave conditions at the bjørnafjord crossing to characterise the local wave field three datawell wave riders dwrs were deployed along the planned bridge crossing to monitor the wave conditions at their respective locations these three dwrs are close to the pontoons a4 a13 and a27 respectively field monitoring results reveal that the wave field across the bjørnafjord is inhomogeneous cheng et al 2019a however the coherence between the dwrs is found to be rather low as the distance between them is more than 1300 m nevertheless the inhomogeneous wave field along the full length of the bridge span may still be reasonably modelled by assuming that 1 the wave field surrounding any bridge pontoon is homogeneous ding et al 2019 wei et al 2017 2018 and 2 the spatial variation of wave characteristics e g significant wave height h s peak period t p and principal wave direction θ p across the pontoons between the dwrs is linear cheng et al 2018b dai et al 2020a with reference to the design basis for the crossing of the bjørnafjord the local wind driven waves are short crested and they may be described by using the jonswap spectrum statens vegvesen 2018 consequently the directional spectrum s ζ j ω θ characterising the wave conditions near an arbitrary bridge pontoon aj where j is an integer between 1 and 35 may be expressed as 4 s ζ j ω θ s ζ j ω d ζ j θ 5 s ζ ω 5 16 a γ h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 e 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ e 1 2 ω ω p σ ω p 2 6 d ζ θ γ 1 n 2 π γ 1 2 n 2 cos n θ θ p where s ζ j ω denotes the unidirectional wave spectrum and d ζ j θ refers to the directional spreading function a γ 1 0 287 ln γ where γ 3 3 is the non dimensional peak shape parameter ω p 2π t p is the peak angular frequency and σ is the spectrum width parameter which equals 0 07 for ω ω p and 0 09 for ω ω p n is the spreading coefficient for the locally short crested wind waves in the bjørnafjord n may be taken as 4 statens vegvesen 2018 fig 6 shows the spatial variation of the significant wave height h s peak period t p and principal wave direction θ p corresponding to the 1 year homogeneous and inhomogeneous wave conditions at the bjørnafjord note that the 1 year homogeneous wave condition is chosen according to the design basis statens vegvesen 2018 two different inhomogeneous wave conditions are considered the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 is established by first scaling the harshest wave condition with the highest h s measured by the dwrs which occurs at a27 to match the selected homogeneous wave condition i e h s 1 3 m t p 4 6 s and θ p 288 this is in line with the common practice in an engineering design in which the most severe sea state is often applied to the entire length of the structure correspondingly the wave conditions measured by the other two dwrs at a4 and a13 are also adjusted with the same scaling factor then a linear interpolation is employed to describe the wave conditions at other pontoon locations besides a different type of wave inhomogeneity is considered in this study the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 described in fig 6 is adapted based on the wave inhomogeneity at the sulafjord lei et al 2016 it should be noted that the reported wave conditions at the sulafjord are much harsher in order to suit the wave conditions at the bjørnafjord the inhomogeneous wave condition at the sulafjord is scaled down in order to match the worst wave condition with the selected homogeneous wave condition this is in line with the treatment for the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 essentially the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 is characterised by a spatial variation of θ p the inhomogeneity in h s is small and t p remains unchanged throughout the entire bridge length as a contrast the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 represents a significant spatial variation of h s and t p while there is no change in θ p across the bridge span in addition to the abovementioned parameters characterising the directional wave spectra at individual pontoon locations the coherence and correlation between these wave spectra are also important in a time domain simulation this is represented by the random phase angles of the wave components in irregular seas due to the lack of information only two conditions pertaining to the wave correlation are considered the first condition refers to a fully coherent and correlated sea state where the random phase angles of each wave component are identical at all pontoon locations essentially this describes a fully continuous wave field the second condition refers to uncorrelated waves at different pontoons locations by assigning different random phase angles for various pontoon locations under such a circumstance the waves along the bridge length are completely independent and random in this study the following six wave load cases are considered in order to investigate the effect of wave inhomogeneity on the mooring lines load case 1 lc1 describes the homogeneous wave condition with h s 1 3 m t p 4 6 s and θ p 288 for the entire crossing the sea states along the bridge length are fully coherent and correlated load case 2 lc2 describes an inhomogeneous wave condition with constant h s 1 3 m t p 4 6 s and θ p 288 throughout the whole bridge length however the waves at different pontoon locations are completely uncorrelated by application of independent phase angles of wave components load case 3 1 lc3 1 describes the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 with varying significant wave height h s and principal wave direction θ p as shown in fig 6 the waves along the bridge length are fully coherent and correlated load case 3 2 lc3 2 describes the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 with varying significant wave height h s and wave peak period t p as shown in fig 6 similar to lc3 1 the waves are fully coherent and correlated load case 4 1 lc4 1 describes the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 with varying wave characteristics h s and θ p as shown in fig 6 but the waves at different pontoon locations are completely uncorrelated similarly load case 4 2 lc4 2 describes the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 with varying wave characteristics h s and t p as shown in fig 6 but the waves at different pontoon locations are completely uncorrelated it should be mentioned that the 1 year wave conditions are considered in this study due to the lack of available information regarding the long term variation of inhomogeneous waves at the bjørnafjord the analysis of the long term joint distribution of the environmental intensity parameters based on hindcast data shows that the wave periods of the selected wave conditions are fairly large cheng et al 2019b furthermore the information about the inhomogeneous wave 1 was based on field measurements over 1 year cheng et al 2019a thus it may be reasonable to employ the abovementioned wave conditions as representative annual maximum sea states for evaluating the structural responses of mooring lines due to the wave inhomogeneity the fatigue analysis presented in this paper is solely for the purpose of obtaining an indication of the inhomogeneous wave effect on the fatigue damage in view of the fact that comprehensive fatigue analysis depends on all possible wave conditions throughout the service life of the structure 2 3 numerical simulation the simulations are conducted in the time domain and the newmark constant acceleration scheme is adopted for solving the differential equations to ensure the convergence of the results the time interval δt may be determined according to the following condition 7 δ t t min 20 where t min refers to the smallest natural period of the floating bridge model that is of interest in view of the fact that the energy of the local waves with t 2 s is generally small statens vegvesen 2018 and they are far away from the lowest vibration modes of the floating bridge their effect on the dynamic responses of the bridge is expected to be insignificant as a result it is reasonable to adopt a time step size that is not exceeding 0 1 s for each of the abovementioned six wave load cases five independent wave realisations are employed to bring down the stochastic uncertainties in the results each simulation has a length of 4500 s in which the results for the initial 900 s contain transient responses and thus not used for the subsequent data analysis the statistical values and power spectra presented in the following sections are based on the average of the five independent simulations for each wave load case as the focus of the study is on the inhomogeneous wave effect other environmental effects such as wind and current as well as traffic loads are excluded it should be highlighted that wind loads may have a considerable contribution to the low frequency responses of the mooring lines for fatigue analysis it may be more appropriate to consider concurrent environmental loads in time domain simulations nevertheless simplified methods exist for combining the fatigue damage from different load effect processes han et al 2016 2020 huang and moan 2006 lotsberg 2005 van der tempel 2006 besides steady wind and current loads have an effect on the mooring tension which may alter the mooring stiffness and thus the stress ranges due to wave loads the results from separate studies indicate that the maximum transverse displacements along y axis at moored pontoons induced by 1 year steady environmental loads and wave loads are less than 1 m and 0 5 m respectively dai et al 2020b multiconsult 2017 within the relatively small range of displacement the stiffness of the mooring clusters is virtually constant see fig 3 thereby implying that the effect of neglecting steady wind and current loads on the fatigue damage of mooring lines is quite limited 2 4 fatigue analysis methods it is commonly accepted that the rainflow cycle counting method predicts the fatigue damage most accurately when compared with its alternatives in this method a variable amplitude cyclic stress time series is first decomposed into individual stress cycles s i it is assumed that these stress cycles s i may be superimposed upon one another then the accumulated fatigue damage d f can be computed according to the palmgren miner sum as 8 d f i 1 n n i c s i m where n i is the number of cycles counted for stress range s i and c and m are the material parameters characterising the s n curve of the material for studless chain segments considered in this study these material parameters are taken as c 6 1010 and m 3 respectively dnv 2018b for the wire segments c 1 7 1017 and m 4 8 dnv 2018b instead of decomposing a cyclic stress time series into individual stress cycles as used in the rainflow cycle counting algorithm dirlik proposed a spectral approach to estimate the probability density function pdf of stress ranges s directly from the power spectrum of the time series dirlik 1985 the pdf is expressed in terms of an exponential term and two rayleigh terms as 9 p s g 1 q e s q g 2 s r 2 e s 2 2 r 2 g 3 s e s 2 2 2 m 0 where s s 2 m 0 denotes the normalised stress range g 1 g 2 g 3 q and r are empirical distribution weight factors to be determined from the power spectral moments dirlik 1985 the ith spectral moment of a stress time series p s is given by 10 m i 0 f i p s d f where f is the frequency in hz then the expected fatigue damage per unit time can be computed by using the following closed form equation 11 e d v p 2 m 0 m g 1 q m γ 1 v 2 m 2 γ 1 m 2 g 2 r m g 3 c herein v p is defined as 12 v p m 4 m 2 finally the expected amount of fatigue damage d f accumulated in a duration t can be computed as 13 e d f t e d note that this approach was developed for both wide band and narrow band gaussian processes if the time series is expected to be a narrow band gaussian process the pdf can be described by a rayleigh distribution then the expected fatigue damage can be written as bouyssy et al 1993 miles 1954 14 e d f v 0 t c 2 2 σ s m γ 1 m 2 where v 0 and σ s are to be computed from the spectral moments as 15 v 0 m 2 m 0 16 σ s m 0 3 structural responses of mooring lines figs 7 and 8 show the maximum mooring tension developed at the fairlead and anchor points respectively under the action of homogeneous and inhomogeneous wave loads as expected the fairlead points are subjected to an average of 22 higher tensile loads than the anchor points owing to the buoyancy effect of the seawater however it appears that the inhomogeneous waves have little effect on the maximum mooring tension this is due to the fact that the initial pretension in the mooring lines is much larger than the wave induced mooring loads a close inspection shows that the pretension contributes more than 90 of the total mooring tension nevertheless the wave load cases lc3 1 and lc4 1 corresponding to the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 generally tend to induce slightly larger tension than the homogeneous wave load case lc1 especially for mooring clusters 1 to 3 this could be explained as being due to the fact that oblique inhomogeneous wave loads lead to higher excitation of the bridge responses dai et al 2020a on the contrary the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 lc3 2 and lc4 2 leads to slightly lower mooring tension as a result of the locally smaller significant wave height h s and peak period t p at the location of mooring cluster 4 all six wave load cases have very similar wave conditions consequently the maximum mooring line tensions are virtually the same for all six wave load cases figs 9 and 10 plot the standard deviations of tension in the mooring lines which characterise the dynamic variation due to wave loads in contrast to the maximum responses shown in figs 7 and 8 the difference between the fairlead and anchor points is below 2 which is negligible furthermore the standard deviations are found to be substantially affected by the inhomogeneities in the wave field more specifically the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 induces much higher dynamic responses of the mooring tension especially for mooring clusters 1 and 2 this could be explained as due to the fact that the inhomogeneous waves considered in lc3 1 and lc4 1 are more oblique and thus higher excitation forces are acting on pontoons than homogeneous waves near these two mooring clusters dai et al 2020a the obliquity of inhomogeneous waves reduces when approaching mooring cluster 4 where it closely resembles a beam sea consequently homogeneous wave loads are found to induce higher standard deviations of the mooring line tension than inhomogeneous wave loads particularly for the mooring lines at the weather side i e mooring lines 1 to 4 as for the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 all the induced standard deviations of mooring tension are smaller than the homogeneous wave condition even for mooring cluster 4 where the inhomogeneous wave condition is identical to the homogeneous wave condition apparently the lower h s and t p between the bridge south end and the pontoon location a27 also affect the responses of the bridge segment in the vicinity of the bridge north end the wave correlation is found to have some effects when there is no spatial variation of h s t p and θ p for the two inhomogeneous wave conditions the effect of wave correlation is rather small table 4 lists the standard deviations sd mean and maximum max values of the mooring tension at the fairlead point of mooring line 2 in cluster 2 under the inhomogeneous wave load case lc4 1 this point is purposely chosen in view of the fact that the largest tension among all four clusters of mooring lines occur at this particular location the statistical values computed from each of the five 1 h simulations and their averages are compared with the compiled equivalent 5 h simulation note that the equivalent 5 h simulation is a compilation of the data from the five 1 h simulations as it can be seen the relative differences due to 1 h simulations are limited and the use of their averages can effectively reduce the statistical uncertainties to further examine the effect of inhomogeneous waves on the mooring line responses power spectral and wavelet analyses are carried out with regard to the tension at the fairlead point of mooring line 2 in cluster 2 as shown in fig 11 estimation of the power spectral density psd is conducted by using the welch method with 8 hamming windows together with a 50 overlap ragan and manuel 2007 the time frequency scalogram presented is for a duration of 1 h as seen in fig 11 most energy of mooring tension is concentrated between 0 15 hz and 0 23 hz which is about the wave frequency range in general the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 with a spatial variation of the wave parameters h s and θ p is found to result in a higher psd of mooring tension for this frequency range accordingly inhomogeneous load cases lc3 1 and lc4 1 induce larger tension in this mooring line in contrast the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 leads to a much lower psd in general although a slightly higher psd is observed for the frequency range between 0 3 hz and 0 35 hz the low frequency second order difference frequency wave load components in a homogeneous wave condition induce higher responses than for inhomogeneous wave conditions near 0 03 hz nevertheless the energy in the low frequency range is much lower when compared to the wave frequency range for all the six wave load cases 4 fatigue damage in mooring lines the structural response analysis of the mooring lines shows that inhomogeneous waves have a substantial effect on the dynamic component of mooring tension despite that the maximum tensile forces virtually remain the same regardless of the wave inhomogeneity this implies that the inhomogeneous wave conditions could strongly affect the fatigue damage in the mooring lines which should be properly accounted for to ensure a safe and economical design therefore it is important to evaluate the amount of fatigue damage in the mooring lines caused by inhomogeneous waves it should be highlighted that a typical fatigue analysis includes all possible load cases throughout the service life of the structure under consideration however this is not possible for the current study due to the lack of sufficient information on inhomogeneous wave conditions still the response time series for a single sea state may be used for the purpose of solely estimating the effect of inhomogeneous waves on fatigue damage as compared with results for the corresponding homogeneous wave load case the purpose of this study is thus to obtain an indication of the effect of wave inhomogeneity on fatigue damage based on a limited number of sea states note that the methods for fatigue analysis described in section 2 4 especially the spectral approaches were developed mainly for gaussian processes therefore it is important to check the gaussianity of the mooring tension time series before commencing fatigue damage estimations fig 12 shows the histograms and gaussian probability plots of the mooring tension at the fairlead point in line 2 cluster 2 in general the data fit a gaussian distribution quite well although inhomogeneous wave load cases tend to introduce some nongaussianities at the tails table 5 lists the skewness and kurtosis as well as the vanmarcke s bandwidth of the data for all six wave load cases as it can be seen the skewness is rather small 0 1 in absolute magnitude and the kurtosis is very close to 3 the vanmarcke s bandwidth of the mooring tension due to the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 is slightly higher this may be because the second order difference frequency wave components have a relatively higher contribution to the bandwidth as compared to the other wave conditions see fig 11 a nevertheless the bandwidth is not exceeding 0 25 for all six load cases therefore it may be reasonable to regard the mooring tension time series as a narrow band gaussian process this implies that the analytical approach based on the rayleigh model by using eq 14 may also be appropriate for predicting the fatigue damage in the mooring lines for narrow band gaussian processes the stress range is known to have a rayleigh distribution for wide band gaussian processes dirlik s empirical closed form expression is commonly applied both these approaches are used to estimate the fatigue damage together with direct rainflow cycle counting in a fatigue damage calculation the computed mooring tension f x is first converted to a nominal stress σ n as 17 σ n f x a n where a n is the nominal cross sectional area of the mooring line note that the nominal diameter of the chain which is 147 mm as listed in table 2 also comprises a 20 mm corrosion allowance for stress calculations a 50 reduction in the corrosion allowance is accounted for dnv 2018a multiconsult 2017 also note that the effect of mean stress is neglected for the sake of simplicity fig 13 plots the stress range histogram by using the rainflow cycle counting algorithm for inhomogeneous wave load case lc4 1 also plotted in this figure is the pdf of the stress range predicted by using dirlik s method and the classic rayleigh model again the fairlead point in mooring line 2 cluster 2 is chosen as the point of investigation as it can be seen dirlik s approach is able to approximate the distribution of the histogram based on rainflow counting quite well the rayleigh model fails to capture smaller stress ranges when compared with the rainflow cycle counts consequently it tends to slightly overestimate the probability of the occurrence of stress range above 1 mpa however stress cycles at low stress ranges may not contribute much to the fatigue damage fig 14 presents the error of spectral methods in predicting fatigue damage at the fairlead points relative to the results obtained by using the rainflow cycle counting algorithm in general the relative error for all load cases studied is found to be less than 6 such a small error is commonly deemed acceptable in engineering applications and it implies that both dirlik s method and the rayleigh model are able to yield results with a sufficient degree of accuracy the rayleigh model based on narrow band assumption tends to slightly overestimate the fatigue damage both methods give predictions with comparable degrees of accuracy although the error by using the rayleigh model increases for the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 in which the bandwidth is slightly larger fig 15 shows the estimated fatigue damage at various critical points of mooring 2 in cluster 2 due to homogeneous and inhomogeneous waves for a duration of 3 h note that the fatigue damage is computed by using the direct rainflow cycle counting algorithm for the chain segments the fatigue damage at different locations is very similar for all wave load cases in general the fairlead point tends to experience the largest fatigue damage for some load cases however it appears that the largest fatigue damage occurs at the top of the bottom segment this coincides with the finding reported by xue and chen 2017 for a similar taut mooring system the variation of the fatigue damage along the chain segments could be due to the longitudinal drag which tends to reduce the dynamic tension in the mooring lines for the bottom segment which is close to the seabed the relative motion between the chain and seawater is expected to be small consequently the drag effect is smaller and the fatigue damage at the top of the bottom segment becomes slightly higher than the anchor point nevertheless the difference in fatigue damage at various locations is very small and may be neglected for the wire segment the fatigue damage is much lower than the chain segments however due to the lack of long term experience using the wire segments the possible replacement of all wire segments throughout the service life has been accounted for in the preliminary engineering design multiconsult 2017 fig 16 shows the fatigue damage at the fairlead points of all mooring lines note that this figure plots the normalised fatigue damage d f with respect to the maximum d f 1 21 10 6 which is found to occur at the fairlead point of mooring line 2 cluster 2 for inhomogeneous load case lc4 1 the fatigue damage at other locations along a mooring line may be approximated in conjunction with the results presented in fig 15 as it can be seen from fig 16 the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 significantly amplifies the fatigue damage in the mooring lines especially for clusters 1 3 where the obliquity of the waves is large the maximum increase in the fatigue damage at the fairlead points due to inhomogeneous wave load cases lc3 1 and lc4 1 as compared to lc1 is found to be 80 77 and 36 for clusters 1 2 and 3 respectively apparently the adoption of homogeneous wave conditions to simplify the analysis and design may lead to severe underestimations of the fatigue damage in the mooring lines however at the location of mooring cluster 4 the effect of inhomogeneous wave condition 1 on fatigue damage is observed to be quite small due to the fact that both local homogeneous and inhomogeneous waves form a near beam sea condition the discrepancies are below 9 the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 is found to induce much lower fatigue damage for all mooring lines than the homogeneous wave condition the largest discrepancy of 90 between homogeneous and inhomogeneous wave load cases is observed at mooring line 4 in cluster 1 the discrepancy is reduced when moving toward mooring cluster 4 where the maximum difference is 33 under such circumstances application of homogeneous wave conditions may lead to overly conservative estimations of the fatigue damage in the mooring lines it is also found that the correlation of sea states along the length of the floating bridge strongly affects the fatigue damage in the mooring lines when the wave characteristics h s t p and θ p are constant throughout the length of the bridge the discrepancies are up to 20 for the inhomogeneous wave conditions 1 and 2 however this effect reduces to 10 and 17 respectively this may be explained as being due to the fact that the inhomogeneity in wave characteristics already introduces some effects similar to uncorrelated waves 5 conclusions in this paper a computational study of the mooring lines for a floating bridge under the action of wave loads is presented the bridge considered in the study is a 4 6 km long straight and side anchored floating pontoon bridge for crossing of the bjørnafjord due to the large span of the crossing and a complex topography the wave field is inhomogeneous in the numerical studies one homogeneous wave condition typically an annual maximum sea state and two modified inhomogeneous wave conditions accounting for different spatial variations of wave characteristics h s t p and θ p are considered for each wave condition a fully coherent and correlated wave load case and a completely uncorrelated wave load case are established an analysis of the mooring tension reveals that the time series follows a narrow band gaussian distribution quite well time domain simulation results show that the extreme values of the tension in the mooring lines are mainly governed by the pretension and thus they are virtually unaffected by the inhomogeneity in the wave conditions however inhomogeneous wave loads have a considerable effect on the standard deviations of mooring line tension which characterise the dynamic components of the responses especially for mooring clusters 1 3 where the spatial variation of the wave characteristics is largely different from the homogeneous wave condition the fatigue damage of mooring lines due to selected wave load cases is evaluated by using the spectral methods together with the conventional rainflow cycle counting algorithm a comparison shows that the error associated with dirlik s method and the rayleigh model relative to the direct rainflow cycle counting is below 6 for all the six wave load cases that were studied results of short term fatigue analysis reveal that the spatial variation of wave characteristics h s t p and θ p throughout the entire length of the bridge strongly affect the fatigue damage in the mooring lines for the two inhomogeneous wave conditions described in the study the adoption of corresponding homogeneous wave conditions to simplify the analysis and design may lead to either significantly underestimated or overly conservative predictions that would challenge the safety or cost effectiveness of the design the correlation of sea states along the length of the floating bridge is also found to affect the fatigue damage in the mooring lines however its effect reduces when wave inhomogeneities are present due to the lack of more detailed information related to the wave inhomogeneity the fatigue analysis presented in this paper is solely for the purpose of obtaining an indication of the inhomogeneous wave effect on the fatigue damage in mooring lines it should be highlighted that all possible wave conditions throughout the service life of the structure should be taken into consideration as part of a comprehensive fatigue analysis therefore it is highly important that comprehensive numerical simulations or field measurements are conducted such that realistic description and modelling of the inhomogeneous wave conditions are available to achieve a safe and economical design of the mooring systems for very long

21251,mooring systems are important structural components of very long floating bridges they effectively limit the transverse motions of the bridge under environmental loads they also add viscous hydrodynamic damping to the entire system the safe and economical design of mooring systems is thus important but also challenging especially when the wave conditions are inhomogeneous in this paper a computational study is carried out to investigate the responses of the mooring lines for a 4 6 km long fjord crossing floating bridge accounting for inhomogeneous wave conditions based on the structural responses this study also attempts to evaluate the fatigue damage in the mooring lines by using different fatigue analysis methods the accuracy of the spectral methods is examined by comparison with the conventional rainflow cycle counting algorithm numerical studies are conducted to obtain an indication of the effect of various wave inhomogeneities on the fatigue damage in the mooring lines keywords floating bridge mooring line wave inhomogeneity short crested fatigue damage 1 introduction floating bridges are sophisticated structures across waterbodies subjected to complex loading conditions they take advantage of the natural buoyancy to carry the gravity loads they also face fewer complications arising from large water depths and or soft seabed conditions that commonly hinder the adoption of bottom founded structures for transportation purposes owing to these distinct advantages floating bridges are recognised as a favourable and practical option in the e39 coastal highway project led by the norwegian public road administration statens vegvesen to replace the time consuming ferry trips across the wide and deep norwegian fjords cowi 2019 however the design and construction of a safe and cost effective floating bridge could still be technically challenging especially when the span is very long and the environmental conditions are complicated taking the bjørnafjord in norway as an example the very long crossing of up to 5 km results in inevitably slender and flexible floating bridge designs leading to significant hydroelastic responses of the bridge structure under wave actions cheng et al 2018a kvåle et al 2016 viuff et al 2018 2019 xiang and løken 2019 xiang et al 2018 in addition the wave conditions are observed to be nonhomogeneous owing to the complex topology and the large span of the crossing cheng et al 2019a this introduces further complexities to the proper modelling and detailed study of the dynamic responses of the floating bridge cheng et al 2018b dai et al 2020a in an attempt to effectively limit the transverse motions and bending moments of the bridge structure under environmental loads a design concept comprising a side anchored floating pontoon bridge was proposed and is currently under feasibility investigations dnv 2018a multiconsult 2017 four clusters of mooring lines are attached to selected bridge pontoons spaced about 1 km apart besides limiting the transverse response these mooring lines are also expected to add viscous hydrodynamic damping to the bridge structure therefore the mooring lines play a vital role in the structural behaviour of the floating bridge under complicated environmental conditions and the safe and economical design of these structural components is of great importance however to the best knowledge of the authors the effect of inhomogeneous wave conditions on the structural responses of the mooring systems for a very long floating bridge or similar slender marine structures has not been reported in the open literature besides the structural responses it is also important to examine the fatigue damage in the mooring lines due to the cyclic nature of the wave loads a preliminary study on the current floating bridge design concept considering homogeneous wave conditions reveals that the safe design of some mooring lines may be governed by their fatigue life multiconsult 2017 unfortunately in the context of inhomogeneous wave conditions the existing literature again lacks the information pertaining to the fatigue damage in the mooring lines for a very long floating bridge or similar structures in a typical fatigue analysis the conventional rainflow cycle counting method is commonly employed alternatively spectral methods that are computationally efficient may be advantageous especially at the stages of design conceptualisation and initial feasibility studies when the structural configuration is subjected to iterative changes and optimisations commonly used spectral methods include the method by dirlik 1985 the formula by benasciutti and tovo 2005 the bimodal method proposed by jiao and moan 1990 and the trimodal method by gao and moan 2008 these models were developed for gaussian processes when the processes are narrow band the classic rayleigh model is applicable bouyssy et al 1993 gao and moan 2009 miles 1954 the comparison of various spectral fatigue analysis methods was made by several researchers benasciutti and tovo 2006 chang et al 2017 han et al 2020 xu et al 2014 among these approaches the dirlik s method is found to perform quite well for both wide and narrow band gaussian processes by comparison with the rainflow cycle counting method arany et al 2014 bouyssy et al 1993 yeter et al 2016 this method has been extensively applied to the fatigue analysis of marine structures including wind turbines and offshore platforms under the action of complex environmental loads arany et al 2014 bouyssy et al 1993 chaudhury and dover 1985 chen and basu 2018 gao and moan 2009 yeter et al 2015 2016 methods also exist for non gaussian processes due to nonlinear structural behaviour or non gaussian excitations chang et al 2017 gao and moan 2007 winterstein 1988 thus it is interesting to assess the applicability of the spectral methods such as dirlik s method and the simple rayleigh model for fatigue damage estimation of the mooring lines for a very long floating bridge under the action of inhomogeneous wave loads the focus of the present study is therefore twofold first we study the structural responses of the mooring lines for a 4 6 km long floating bridge under the action of inhomogeneous wave conditions next the fatigue damage in the mooring lines is evaluated by using different fatigue analysis methods the applicability of closed form expressions of the fatigue damage based on spectral parameters is examined and the accuracy is tested by comparison with the conventional rainflow cycle counting algorithm numerical studies are carried out with the aim to obtain an indication of the effect of various wave inhomogeneities on the fatigue damage of mooring lines the remainder of the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes the numerical model for the time domain response analysis of the floating bridge considering inhomogeneous wave loads section 3 examines the structural responses of the mooring lines section 4 investigates the various effects of wave inhomogeneity on the fatigue damage in the mooring lines finally section 5 concludes the findings of the study 2 numerical model and methodology 2 1 floating bridge model the current design concept for crossing of the bjørnafjord features a straight and side anchored floating bridge as shown in fig 1 the design concept comprises a cable stayed bridge segment at the south end with a main span of 470 m and a back span of 430 m the bridge deck is elevated 49 m above the mean sea level for navigation purposes this cable stayed bridge segment connects to the floating bridge segment which is composed of a 902 2 m long transitional high part and a 3296 3 m long low part pontoons spaced approximately 125 m apart are engaged in order to provide support to the floating bridge girder in the vertical direction to effectively limit the transverse motion under environmental loads the bridge is side anchored by four evenly spaced clusters of mooring lines in addition to the bridge abutments at the two ends as the low part of the floating bridge constitutes the primary segment of the bridge design concept an idealised numerical bridge model is therefore established by reasonably extending this low part to approximately the length of the entire crossing as shown in fig 2 besides the geometric parameters are also regularised for the sake of simplification for example the spacing between two adjacent pontoons labelled a1 to a35 is set to 125 m in view of the fact that the varying topography has little effect on the wave excitation forces cheng et al 2018a a constant water depth of 300 m which represents approximately the average water depth along the crossing is adopted consequently the four mooring clusters are standardised by employing an identical spread layout note that in each mooring cluster a number of eight mooring lines are attached to the sidewall of the moored pontoon at 3 m draught with an identical pretension the spread angles of line 1 to line 8 in each cluster are 75 80 100 105 255 260 280 and 285 respectively anticlockwise from the global x axis the mooring lines are for a relatively taut system based on a standard composition of a spiral strand segment with plastic sheathing of 11 mm thickness sandwiched by two studless chain segments of grade r4 two different pretensions namely 1500 kn and 1630 kn are applied to the end clusters clusters 1 and 4 and internal clusters clusters 2 and 3 respectively this is in order to match the transverse stiffness of the mooring clusters applied in the design concept multiconsult 2017 fig 3 shows the force displacement curves of the mooring clusters subjected to the two different pretensions table 1 summarises the cross sectional properties of the bridge girder and column table 2 lists the structural properties of the mooring lines note that the chain and wire segments were designed with different diameters to have the similar minimum breaking load of approximately 15 000 kn under corroded conditions dnv 2018a the parameters for the chain segments are based on vicinay s product catalogue vicinay 2020 whereas the parameters for the wire segments are based on bridon s product catalogue calverley 2004 the pontoon properties are given in table 3 the boundary conditions are as follows all six degrees of freedom are fully restrained at the bridge south end while the translation along the x axis and rotation about the z axis are allowed at the north end note that all the abovementioned parameters are adopted according to the design concept of the floating bridge dnv 2018a multiconsult 2017 also note that near the south end the length of the first span is purposely chosen to match the dynamic properties of the cable stayed bridge segment in the numerical model the bridge pontoons are treated as rigid bodies subjected to wave loads the hydrodynamic coefficients i e the added mass and potential damping properties and the wave excitation force transfer functions corresponding to the bridge pontoons are evaluated in the frequency domain by using the commercial tool wamit wamit 2019 fig 4 shows an example of the panel models of the wet surface of two typical pontoons constructed for use in wamit in view of the fact that the pontoon spacing is relatively large when compared with the length of the wind waves in the fjord statens vegvesen 2018 the effect of hydrodynamical coupling between pontoons is expected to be small and thus not accounted for then the governing equations of motion for the bridge pontoons in the time domain can be obtained in accordance with cummins theory cummins 1962 as 1 m p a p u p t k r t τ u p τ d τ k b k h u p t f 1 e x c t f 2 e x c t where m p refers to the pontoon s structural mass matrix a p denotes the matrix of added mass at infinite frequency k r t τ is the retardation function which represents the fluid s memory effect k b is a structural stiffness matrix that represents the restraining effect of the bridge k h is the hydrostatic restoring stiffness matrix u p is the displacement vector of the pontoon f 1 e x c t is the force vector containing the first order wave excitation load components and correspondingly f 2 e x c t is the force vector containing the second order difference frequency wave excitation load components the other structural components namely the girders columns and mooring lines are modelled by means of the finite element method in view of their slenderness the girders and columns are represented by using euler bernoulli beam elements while the mooring lines are discretised into bar elements considering their geometric stiffness besides their self weight the hydrodynamic loads acting on the mooring lines are considered according to the morison equation as 2 f m ρ w v u w ρ w c a v u w u m 1 2 ρ w c d d u w u m u w u m where ρ w denotes the density of seawater v is the volume per unit length of the mooring line d is the diameter of the mooring line c a 1 0 is the added mass coefficient and c d is the quadratic drag coefficient note that c d in the transverse direction is taken as 2 4 for the top and bottom chain segments while it is set to 1 2 for the intermediate wire segments for the longitudinal direction c d is taken as 1 15 and 0 1 respectively multiconsult 2017 u w denotes the flow velocity and u m is the corresponding velocity of the submerged mooring line by assemblage the governing equations of motion for the entire floating bridge model in the global coordinate system may be expressed in a compact matrix form as 3 m b u b c b u b k r t τ u b τ d τ k b u b f b where m b denotes the global mass matrix of the entire floating bridge model c b is the global damping matrix k b is the global stiffness matrix f b is the global external load vector k r is the global matrix containing retardation functions for the degrees of freedom of the pontoons only and u b is the global displacement vector note that the superscript dots denote partial derivatives with respect to the time t note that the global mass matrix m b contains both the structural mass and the hydrodynamic added mass likewise c b comprises the contributions from the structural damping and the quadratic damping for the modelling of the structural damping the rayleigh damping is adopted with a mass proportional coefficient of 0 001 and a stiffness proportional coefficient of 0 025 this results in a 0 5 damping ratio for the two lowest modes which complies with the requirement stated in the design basis for steel structures statens vegvesen 2018 the global stiffness matrix k b contains the bridge structural stiffness and the hydrostatic restoring stiffness the external load vector f b includes the gravitational forces buoyancy forces and wave excitation forces the commercial software package sima is employed for the numerical simulation of the floating bridge model through a coupled simo riflex task sintef ocean 2019a sintef ocean 2019b fig 5 presents the first five vibration modes of the floating bridge as it can be seen all these modes correspond to the transverse vibration of the bridge girder and they possess long natural periods that may be excited by the slow varying second order difference frequency wave load components these vibration modes are also found to be coupled with the torsional modes of the bridge girder as a result of the restraining effect of the mooring lines the lowest axial mode occurs at 11 s as for the vertical vibration modes they are found to be densely clustered near 7 s which is close to the local wind driven wave periods statens vegvesen 2018 therefore the vertical motion and bending moment of the floating bridge are expected to be excited by the first order wave load components in a wind sea more detailed information about the modal properties of the side anchored floating bridge was reported by dai et al 2020a 2 2 inhomogeneous wave conditions the combination of varying fjord topography and a very large span of up to 5 km has led to complicated wave conditions at the bjørnafjord crossing to characterise the local wave field three datawell wave riders dwrs were deployed along the planned bridge crossing to monitor the wave conditions at their respective locations these three dwrs are close to the pontoons a4 a13 and a27 respectively field monitoring results reveal that the wave field across the bjørnafjord is inhomogeneous cheng et al 2019a however the coherence between the dwrs is found to be rather low as the distance between them is more than 1300 m nevertheless the inhomogeneous wave field along the full length of the bridge span may still be reasonably modelled by assuming that 1 the wave field surrounding any bridge pontoon is homogeneous ding et al 2019 wei et al 2017 2018 and 2 the spatial variation of wave characteristics e g significant wave height h s peak period t p and principal wave direction θ p across the pontoons between the dwrs is linear cheng et al 2018b dai et al 2020a with reference to the design basis for the crossing of the bjørnafjord the local wind driven waves are short crested and they may be described by using the jonswap spectrum statens vegvesen 2018 consequently the directional spectrum s ζ j ω θ characterising the wave conditions near an arbitrary bridge pontoon aj where j is an integer between 1 and 35 may be expressed as 4 s ζ j ω θ s ζ j ω d ζ j θ 5 s ζ ω 5 16 a γ h s 2 ω p 4 ω 5 e 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ e 1 2 ω ω p σ ω p 2 6 d ζ θ γ 1 n 2 π γ 1 2 n 2 cos n θ θ p where s ζ j ω denotes the unidirectional wave spectrum and d ζ j θ refers to the directional spreading function a γ 1 0 287 ln γ where γ 3 3 is the non dimensional peak shape parameter ω p 2π t p is the peak angular frequency and σ is the spectrum width parameter which equals 0 07 for ω ω p and 0 09 for ω ω p n is the spreading coefficient for the locally short crested wind waves in the bjørnafjord n may be taken as 4 statens vegvesen 2018 fig 6 shows the spatial variation of the significant wave height h s peak period t p and principal wave direction θ p corresponding to the 1 year homogeneous and inhomogeneous wave conditions at the bjørnafjord note that the 1 year homogeneous wave condition is chosen according to the design basis statens vegvesen 2018 two different inhomogeneous wave conditions are considered the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 is established by first scaling the harshest wave condition with the highest h s measured by the dwrs which occurs at a27 to match the selected homogeneous wave condition i e h s 1 3 m t p 4 6 s and θ p 288 this is in line with the common practice in an engineering design in which the most severe sea state is often applied to the entire length of the structure correspondingly the wave conditions measured by the other two dwrs at a4 and a13 are also adjusted with the same scaling factor then a linear interpolation is employed to describe the wave conditions at other pontoon locations besides a different type of wave inhomogeneity is considered in this study the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 described in fig 6 is adapted based on the wave inhomogeneity at the sulafjord lei et al 2016 it should be noted that the reported wave conditions at the sulafjord are much harsher in order to suit the wave conditions at the bjørnafjord the inhomogeneous wave condition at the sulafjord is scaled down in order to match the worst wave condition with the selected homogeneous wave condition this is in line with the treatment for the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 essentially the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 is characterised by a spatial variation of θ p the inhomogeneity in h s is small and t p remains unchanged throughout the entire bridge length as a contrast the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 represents a significant spatial variation of h s and t p while there is no change in θ p across the bridge span in addition to the abovementioned parameters characterising the directional wave spectra at individual pontoon locations the coherence and correlation between these wave spectra are also important in a time domain simulation this is represented by the random phase angles of the wave components in irregular seas due to the lack of information only two conditions pertaining to the wave correlation are considered the first condition refers to a fully coherent and correlated sea state where the random phase angles of each wave component are identical at all pontoon locations essentially this describes a fully continuous wave field the second condition refers to uncorrelated waves at different pontoons locations by assigning different random phase angles for various pontoon locations under such a circumstance the waves along the bridge length are completely independent and random in this study the following six wave load cases are considered in order to investigate the effect of wave inhomogeneity on the mooring lines load case 1 lc1 describes the homogeneous wave condition with h s 1 3 m t p 4 6 s and θ p 288 for the entire crossing the sea states along the bridge length are fully coherent and correlated load case 2 lc2 describes an inhomogeneous wave condition with constant h s 1 3 m t p 4 6 s and θ p 288 throughout the whole bridge length however the waves at different pontoon locations are completely uncorrelated by application of independent phase angles of wave components load case 3 1 lc3 1 describes the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 with varying significant wave height h s and principal wave direction θ p as shown in fig 6 the waves along the bridge length are fully coherent and correlated load case 3 2 lc3 2 describes the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 with varying significant wave height h s and wave peak period t p as shown in fig 6 similar to lc3 1 the waves are fully coherent and correlated load case 4 1 lc4 1 describes the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 with varying wave characteristics h s and θ p as shown in fig 6 but the waves at different pontoon locations are completely uncorrelated similarly load case 4 2 lc4 2 describes the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 with varying wave characteristics h s and t p as shown in fig 6 but the waves at different pontoon locations are completely uncorrelated it should be mentioned that the 1 year wave conditions are considered in this study due to the lack of available information regarding the long term variation of inhomogeneous waves at the bjørnafjord the analysis of the long term joint distribution of the environmental intensity parameters based on hindcast data shows that the wave periods of the selected wave conditions are fairly large cheng et al 2019b furthermore the information about the inhomogeneous wave 1 was based on field measurements over 1 year cheng et al 2019a thus it may be reasonable to employ the abovementioned wave conditions as representative annual maximum sea states for evaluating the structural responses of mooring lines due to the wave inhomogeneity the fatigue analysis presented in this paper is solely for the purpose of obtaining an indication of the inhomogeneous wave effect on the fatigue damage in view of the fact that comprehensive fatigue analysis depends on all possible wave conditions throughout the service life of the structure 2 3 numerical simulation the simulations are conducted in the time domain and the newmark constant acceleration scheme is adopted for solving the differential equations to ensure the convergence of the results the time interval δt may be determined according to the following condition 7 δ t t min 20 where t min refers to the smallest natural period of the floating bridge model that is of interest in view of the fact that the energy of the local waves with t 2 s is generally small statens vegvesen 2018 and they are far away from the lowest vibration modes of the floating bridge their effect on the dynamic responses of the bridge is expected to be insignificant as a result it is reasonable to adopt a time step size that is not exceeding 0 1 s for each of the abovementioned six wave load cases five independent wave realisations are employed to bring down the stochastic uncertainties in the results each simulation has a length of 4500 s in which the results for the initial 900 s contain transient responses and thus not used for the subsequent data analysis the statistical values and power spectra presented in the following sections are based on the average of the five independent simulations for each wave load case as the focus of the study is on the inhomogeneous wave effect other environmental effects such as wind and current as well as traffic loads are excluded it should be highlighted that wind loads may have a considerable contribution to the low frequency responses of the mooring lines for fatigue analysis it may be more appropriate to consider concurrent environmental loads in time domain simulations nevertheless simplified methods exist for combining the fatigue damage from different load effect processes han et al 2016 2020 huang and moan 2006 lotsberg 2005 van der tempel 2006 besides steady wind and current loads have an effect on the mooring tension which may alter the mooring stiffness and thus the stress ranges due to wave loads the results from separate studies indicate that the maximum transverse displacements along y axis at moored pontoons induced by 1 year steady environmental loads and wave loads are less than 1 m and 0 5 m respectively dai et al 2020b multiconsult 2017 within the relatively small range of displacement the stiffness of the mooring clusters is virtually constant see fig 3 thereby implying that the effect of neglecting steady wind and current loads on the fatigue damage of mooring lines is quite limited 2 4 fatigue analysis methods it is commonly accepted that the rainflow cycle counting method predicts the fatigue damage most accurately when compared with its alternatives in this method a variable amplitude cyclic stress time series is first decomposed into individual stress cycles s i it is assumed that these stress cycles s i may be superimposed upon one another then the accumulated fatigue damage d f can be computed according to the palmgren miner sum as 8 d f i 1 n n i c s i m where n i is the number of cycles counted for stress range s i and c and m are the material parameters characterising the s n curve of the material for studless chain segments considered in this study these material parameters are taken as c 6 1010 and m 3 respectively dnv 2018b for the wire segments c 1 7 1017 and m 4 8 dnv 2018b instead of decomposing a cyclic stress time series into individual stress cycles as used in the rainflow cycle counting algorithm dirlik proposed a spectral approach to estimate the probability density function pdf of stress ranges s directly from the power spectrum of the time series dirlik 1985 the pdf is expressed in terms of an exponential term and two rayleigh terms as 9 p s g 1 q e s q g 2 s r 2 e s 2 2 r 2 g 3 s e s 2 2 2 m 0 where s s 2 m 0 denotes the normalised stress range g 1 g 2 g 3 q and r are empirical distribution weight factors to be determined from the power spectral moments dirlik 1985 the ith spectral moment of a stress time series p s is given by 10 m i 0 f i p s d f where f is the frequency in hz then the expected fatigue damage per unit time can be computed by using the following closed form equation 11 e d v p 2 m 0 m g 1 q m γ 1 v 2 m 2 γ 1 m 2 g 2 r m g 3 c herein v p is defined as 12 v p m 4 m 2 finally the expected amount of fatigue damage d f accumulated in a duration t can be computed as 13 e d f t e d note that this approach was developed for both wide band and narrow band gaussian processes if the time series is expected to be a narrow band gaussian process the pdf can be described by a rayleigh distribution then the expected fatigue damage can be written as bouyssy et al 1993 miles 1954 14 e d f v 0 t c 2 2 σ s m γ 1 m 2 where v 0 and σ s are to be computed from the spectral moments as 15 v 0 m 2 m 0 16 σ s m 0 3 structural responses of mooring lines figs 7 and 8 show the maximum mooring tension developed at the fairlead and anchor points respectively under the action of homogeneous and inhomogeneous wave loads as expected the fairlead points are subjected to an average of 22 higher tensile loads than the anchor points owing to the buoyancy effect of the seawater however it appears that the inhomogeneous waves have little effect on the maximum mooring tension this is due to the fact that the initial pretension in the mooring lines is much larger than the wave induced mooring loads a close inspection shows that the pretension contributes more than 90 of the total mooring tension nevertheless the wave load cases lc3 1 and lc4 1 corresponding to the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 generally tend to induce slightly larger tension than the homogeneous wave load case lc1 especially for mooring clusters 1 to 3 this could be explained as being due to the fact that oblique inhomogeneous wave loads lead to higher excitation of the bridge responses dai et al 2020a on the contrary the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 lc3 2 and lc4 2 leads to slightly lower mooring tension as a result of the locally smaller significant wave height h s and peak period t p at the location of mooring cluster 4 all six wave load cases have very similar wave conditions consequently the maximum mooring line tensions are virtually the same for all six wave load cases figs 9 and 10 plot the standard deviations of tension in the mooring lines which characterise the dynamic variation due to wave loads in contrast to the maximum responses shown in figs 7 and 8 the difference between the fairlead and anchor points is below 2 which is negligible furthermore the standard deviations are found to be substantially affected by the inhomogeneities in the wave field more specifically the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 induces much higher dynamic responses of the mooring tension especially for mooring clusters 1 and 2 this could be explained as due to the fact that the inhomogeneous waves considered in lc3 1 and lc4 1 are more oblique and thus higher excitation forces are acting on pontoons than homogeneous waves near these two mooring clusters dai et al 2020a the obliquity of inhomogeneous waves reduces when approaching mooring cluster 4 where it closely resembles a beam sea consequently homogeneous wave loads are found to induce higher standard deviations of the mooring line tension than inhomogeneous wave loads particularly for the mooring lines at the weather side i e mooring lines 1 to 4 as for the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 all the induced standard deviations of mooring tension are smaller than the homogeneous wave condition even for mooring cluster 4 where the inhomogeneous wave condition is identical to the homogeneous wave condition apparently the lower h s and t p between the bridge south end and the pontoon location a27 also affect the responses of the bridge segment in the vicinity of the bridge north end the wave correlation is found to have some effects when there is no spatial variation of h s t p and θ p for the two inhomogeneous wave conditions the effect of wave correlation is rather small table 4 lists the standard deviations sd mean and maximum max values of the mooring tension at the fairlead point of mooring line 2 in cluster 2 under the inhomogeneous wave load case lc4 1 this point is purposely chosen in view of the fact that the largest tension among all four clusters of mooring lines occur at this particular location the statistical values computed from each of the five 1 h simulations and their averages are compared with the compiled equivalent 5 h simulation note that the equivalent 5 h simulation is a compilation of the data from the five 1 h simulations as it can be seen the relative differences due to 1 h simulations are limited and the use of their averages can effectively reduce the statistical uncertainties to further examine the effect of inhomogeneous waves on the mooring line responses power spectral and wavelet analyses are carried out with regard to the tension at the fairlead point of mooring line 2 in cluster 2 as shown in fig 11 estimation of the power spectral density psd is conducted by using the welch method with 8 hamming windows together with a 50 overlap ragan and manuel 2007 the time frequency scalogram presented is for a duration of 1 h as seen in fig 11 most energy of mooring tension is concentrated between 0 15 hz and 0 23 hz which is about the wave frequency range in general the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 with a spatial variation of the wave parameters h s and θ p is found to result in a higher psd of mooring tension for this frequency range accordingly inhomogeneous load cases lc3 1 and lc4 1 induce larger tension in this mooring line in contrast the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 leads to a much lower psd in general although a slightly higher psd is observed for the frequency range between 0 3 hz and 0 35 hz the low frequency second order difference frequency wave load components in a homogeneous wave condition induce higher responses than for inhomogeneous wave conditions near 0 03 hz nevertheless the energy in the low frequency range is much lower when compared to the wave frequency range for all the six wave load cases 4 fatigue damage in mooring lines the structural response analysis of the mooring lines shows that inhomogeneous waves have a substantial effect on the dynamic component of mooring tension despite that the maximum tensile forces virtually remain the same regardless of the wave inhomogeneity this implies that the inhomogeneous wave conditions could strongly affect the fatigue damage in the mooring lines which should be properly accounted for to ensure a safe and economical design therefore it is important to evaluate the amount of fatigue damage in the mooring lines caused by inhomogeneous waves it should be highlighted that a typical fatigue analysis includes all possible load cases throughout the service life of the structure under consideration however this is not possible for the current study due to the lack of sufficient information on inhomogeneous wave conditions still the response time series for a single sea state may be used for the purpose of solely estimating the effect of inhomogeneous waves on fatigue damage as compared with results for the corresponding homogeneous wave load case the purpose of this study is thus to obtain an indication of the effect of wave inhomogeneity on fatigue damage based on a limited number of sea states note that the methods for fatigue analysis described in section 2 4 especially the spectral approaches were developed mainly for gaussian processes therefore it is important to check the gaussianity of the mooring tension time series before commencing fatigue damage estimations fig 12 shows the histograms and gaussian probability plots of the mooring tension at the fairlead point in line 2 cluster 2 in general the data fit a gaussian distribution quite well although inhomogeneous wave load cases tend to introduce some nongaussianities at the tails table 5 lists the skewness and kurtosis as well as the vanmarcke s bandwidth of the data for all six wave load cases as it can be seen the skewness is rather small 0 1 in absolute magnitude and the kurtosis is very close to 3 the vanmarcke s bandwidth of the mooring tension due to the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 is slightly higher this may be because the second order difference frequency wave components have a relatively higher contribution to the bandwidth as compared to the other wave conditions see fig 11 a nevertheless the bandwidth is not exceeding 0 25 for all six load cases therefore it may be reasonable to regard the mooring tension time series as a narrow band gaussian process this implies that the analytical approach based on the rayleigh model by using eq 14 may also be appropriate for predicting the fatigue damage in the mooring lines for narrow band gaussian processes the stress range is known to have a rayleigh distribution for wide band gaussian processes dirlik s empirical closed form expression is commonly applied both these approaches are used to estimate the fatigue damage together with direct rainflow cycle counting in a fatigue damage calculation the computed mooring tension f x is first converted to a nominal stress σ n as 17 σ n f x a n where a n is the nominal cross sectional area of the mooring line note that the nominal diameter of the chain which is 147 mm as listed in table 2 also comprises a 20 mm corrosion allowance for stress calculations a 50 reduction in the corrosion allowance is accounted for dnv 2018a multiconsult 2017 also note that the effect of mean stress is neglected for the sake of simplicity fig 13 plots the stress range histogram by using the rainflow cycle counting algorithm for inhomogeneous wave load case lc4 1 also plotted in this figure is the pdf of the stress range predicted by using dirlik s method and the classic rayleigh model again the fairlead point in mooring line 2 cluster 2 is chosen as the point of investigation as it can be seen dirlik s approach is able to approximate the distribution of the histogram based on rainflow counting quite well the rayleigh model fails to capture smaller stress ranges when compared with the rainflow cycle counts consequently it tends to slightly overestimate the probability of the occurrence of stress range above 1 mpa however stress cycles at low stress ranges may not contribute much to the fatigue damage fig 14 presents the error of spectral methods in predicting fatigue damage at the fairlead points relative to the results obtained by using the rainflow cycle counting algorithm in general the relative error for all load cases studied is found to be less than 6 such a small error is commonly deemed acceptable in engineering applications and it implies that both dirlik s method and the rayleigh model are able to yield results with a sufficient degree of accuracy the rayleigh model based on narrow band assumption tends to slightly overestimate the fatigue damage both methods give predictions with comparable degrees of accuracy although the error by using the rayleigh model increases for the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 in which the bandwidth is slightly larger fig 15 shows the estimated fatigue damage at various critical points of mooring 2 in cluster 2 due to homogeneous and inhomogeneous waves for a duration of 3 h note that the fatigue damage is computed by using the direct rainflow cycle counting algorithm for the chain segments the fatigue damage at different locations is very similar for all wave load cases in general the fairlead point tends to experience the largest fatigue damage for some load cases however it appears that the largest fatigue damage occurs at the top of the bottom segment this coincides with the finding reported by xue and chen 2017 for a similar taut mooring system the variation of the fatigue damage along the chain segments could be due to the longitudinal drag which tends to reduce the dynamic tension in the mooring lines for the bottom segment which is close to the seabed the relative motion between the chain and seawater is expected to be small consequently the drag effect is smaller and the fatigue damage at the top of the bottom segment becomes slightly higher than the anchor point nevertheless the difference in fatigue damage at various locations is very small and may be neglected for the wire segment the fatigue damage is much lower than the chain segments however due to the lack of long term experience using the wire segments the possible replacement of all wire segments throughout the service life has been accounted for in the preliminary engineering design multiconsult 2017 fig 16 shows the fatigue damage at the fairlead points of all mooring lines note that this figure plots the normalised fatigue damage d f with respect to the maximum d f 1 21 10 6 which is found to occur at the fairlead point of mooring line 2 cluster 2 for inhomogeneous load case lc4 1 the fatigue damage at other locations along a mooring line may be approximated in conjunction with the results presented in fig 15 as it can be seen from fig 16 the inhomogeneous wave condition 1 significantly amplifies the fatigue damage in the mooring lines especially for clusters 1 3 where the obliquity of the waves is large the maximum increase in the fatigue damage at the fairlead points due to inhomogeneous wave load cases lc3 1 and lc4 1 as compared to lc1 is found to be 80 77 and 36 for clusters 1 2 and 3 respectively apparently the adoption of homogeneous wave conditions to simplify the analysis and design may lead to severe underestimations of the fatigue damage in the mooring lines however at the location of mooring cluster 4 the effect of inhomogeneous wave condition 1 on fatigue damage is observed to be quite small due to the fact that both local homogeneous and inhomogeneous waves form a near beam sea condition the discrepancies are below 9 the inhomogeneous wave condition 2 is found to induce much lower fatigue damage for all mooring lines than the homogeneous wave condition the largest discrepancy of 90 between homogeneous and inhomogeneous wave load cases is observed at mooring line 4 in cluster 1 the discrepancy is reduced when moving toward mooring cluster 4 where the maximum difference is 33 under such circumstances application of homogeneous wave conditions may lead to overly conservative estimations of the fatigue damage in the mooring lines it is also found that the correlation of sea states along the length of the floating bridge strongly affects the fatigue damage in the mooring lines when the wave characteristics h s t p and θ p are constant throughout the length of the bridge the discrepancies are up to 20 for the inhomogeneous wave conditions 1 and 2 however this effect reduces to 10 and 17 respectively this may be explained as being due to the fact that the inhomogeneity in wave characteristics already introduces some effects similar to uncorrelated waves 5 conclusions in this paper a computational study of the mooring lines for a floating bridge under the action of wave loads is presented the bridge considered in the study is a 4 6 km long straight and side anchored floating pontoon bridge for crossing of the bjørnafjord due to the large span of the crossing and a complex topography the wave field is inhomogeneous in the numerical studies one homogeneous wave condition typically an annual maximum sea state and two modified inhomogeneous wave conditions accounting for different spatial variations of wave characteristics h s t p and θ p are considered for each wave condition a fully coherent and correlated wave load case and a completely uncorrelated wave load case are established an analysis of the mooring tension reveals that the time series follows a narrow band gaussian distribution quite well time domain simulation results show that the extreme values of the tension in the mooring lines are mainly governed by the pretension and thus they are virtually unaffected by the inhomogeneity in the wave conditions however inhomogeneous wave loads have a considerable effect on the standard deviations of mooring line tension which characterise the dynamic components of the responses especially for mooring clusters 1 3 where the spatial variation of the wave characteristics is largely different from the homogeneous wave condition the fatigue damage of mooring lines due to selected wave load cases is evaluated by using the spectral methods together with the conventional rainflow cycle counting algorithm a comparison shows that the error associated with dirlik s method and the rayleigh model relative to the direct rainflow cycle counting is below 6 for all the six wave load cases that were studied results of short term fatigue analysis reveal that the spatial variation of wave characteristics h s t p and θ p throughout the entire length of the bridge strongly affect the fatigue damage in the mooring lines for the two inhomogeneous wave conditions described in the study the adoption of corresponding homogeneous wave conditions to simplify the analysis and design may lead to either significantly underestimated or overly conservative predictions that would challenge the safety or cost effectiveness of the design the correlation of sea states along the length of the floating bridge is also found to affect the fatigue damage in the mooring lines however its effect reduces when wave inhomogeneities are present due to the lack of more detailed information related to the wave inhomogeneity the fatigue analysis presented in this paper is solely for the purpose of obtaining an indication of the inhomogeneous wave effect on the fatigue damage in mooring lines it should be highlighted that all possible wave conditions throughout the service life of the structure should be taken into consideration as part of a comprehensive fatigue analysis therefore it is highly important that comprehensive numerical simulations or field measurements are conducted such that realistic description and modelling of the inhomogeneous wave conditions are available to achieve a safe and economical design of the mooring systems for very long

21252,an estimation of the statistical properties of a met ocean environment is extremely important in the design and risk assessment of marine structures an adequate description of the joint distribution of met ocean variables can be utilised for structural reliability analyses this study focuses on the joint distribution of significant wave height and zero up crossing wave period with a mixture copula distribution model for total sea data each component of the mixture model is constructed using a weibull distribution for the significant wave height a lognormal distribution for the wave period and a gaussian copula function a commonly used conditional model is used for a comparison with the proposed model several evaluation strategies are defined for an assessment of the performance of two fitted models utilising simulated bivariate samples the results suggest that the conditional model is unsuitable for a description of the pattern of the joint distribution notably by seriously underestimating the return levels by contrast the mixture copula is capable of providing an improved performance and thus provides extremely reliable environmental contours furthermore the effects of seasonality and short term dependency on the joint behaviour of the spectral parameters are investigated and discussed based on the environmental contours keywords met ocean variables joint distribution mixture copula model extreme wave statistics environmental contour 1 introduction knowledge of a probability based design of a marine structure requires a reliable description of the long term wave environment which covers a broad range of meteorological factors it is widely recognised that a multivariate version is necessary for an accurate understanding of the probability of extreme events as a minimum the joint probability of significant wave height and zero up crossing wave period is therefore indispensable to most marine engineering applications some simple formulations have been proposed to make a gross estimate of the relation between significant wave height and period goda 2003 callaghan et al 2008 still it is well known that the significant wave height and zero up crossing wave period should be considered as dependent random variables from a stochastic perspective thus far there have been different parametric distribution models fitting the bivariate distribution which can be broadly classified into three approaches the first approach to bivariate modelling is to adopt parametric bivariate distribution functions ochi 1978 discovered that the joint distribution of the wave height and period can be roughly characterised by the bivariate lognormal probability law this model was later improved by fang and hogben 1982 although such parametric models are extremely simple they usually do not fit the data very well the second method is the conditional modelling approach cma which has been recommended in the design of marine structures dnv 2017 mathiesen and bitner gregersen 1990 suggested that a combination of the three parameter weibull distribution for the wave height and conditional lognormal distribution for the wave period can be used to model the pattern adequately after comparing it with other bivariate probability distributions this distribution is different from the haver 1985 model which applies the lonowe model to fit the wave height distribution later a modified version of the hybrid model for a significant wave height was proposed by choi et al 2019 the improved model provides a comparable accuracy to that of the three parameter weibull distribution but less calculational difficulty based on the model by heffernan and tawn 2004 jonathan et al 2010 presented a conditional approach which follows the asymptotic theory to fit the wave climate parameters for extreme sea states this novel approach provides an adequate fitness for simulated measured and hindcast data dong et al 2013 built up a bivariate maximum entropy distribution based on the bivariate equivalent normal distribution and cma they indicated that the maximum entropy distribution can fit the data better than the weibull and lognormal distributions lucas and guedes soares 2015 investigated the distributions in mixed sea states with the implementation of the cma plackett model and box cox transformations the comparative results showed that the cma model appears to be more accurate the authors also pointed out that the statistical properties of the wind sea and swell components are quite different the third approach to modelling draws support from copula functions as the main advantage of this model it allows any type of marginal density which can be determined independently from the correlation between variables therefore an estimation of the marginals and copula function can be carried out separately de michele et al 2007 utilised copula models to analyse multivariate events in sea storms montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 provided a scheme for constructing the environmental contours based on some frequently used copulas notwithstanding the wide application of archimedean copulas in environmental sciences owing to their mathematical tractability corbella and stretch 2013 bhatti and do 2019 some new types of copulas have been adopted to calculate the distribution in recent publications jäger and nápoles 2017 and lin and dong 2019 characterised the wave climate based on the vine copula theory owing to the asymmetric behaviour displayed in most ocean data vanem 2016 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 and zhang et al 2018 suggested that the joint probability distribution of met ocean variables can be established through asymmetric copulas which can be constructed based on other commonly used copulas compared to traditional copulas the asymmetric copula models have significant advantages in describing the statistics of ocean parameters with asymmetric dependencies it has been well recognised that real sea states consist of various wave systems in particular a mix of wind sea and swells aranuvachapun 1987 myrhaug and slaattelid 1999 it is natural to meet with more difficulties when modelling the statistical distribution of the spectral parameters under a combined sea state lucas and guedes soares 2015 indicated that the conventional parametric models are incapable of fitting the bivariate distributions of the total combined sea state accurately bitner gregersen 2015 presented a joint met ocean model which considers the presence of the wind sea and swell for the design and operability of offshore structures based on the cma method the results showed that the empirical distribution of the wave period in a sea state involving the mixture of various wave systems cannot be fitted well by a single mode lognormal distribution what is needed in such cases is a bimodal distribution that is the mode of such distribution might be captured by a mixture model rather than some simple parametric model vanem 2016 mixture distributions have received growing attention in recent years as a flexible method of statistical modelling a finite mixture model is capable of providing an adequate description for some complex patterns whose shapes are unable to be captured by simple conventional parametric models as the advantage of a mixture model the fitting data contain several separate subpopulations allowing its considerable widespread use in the field of engineering the construction of a mixture can be pursued with a linear combination of traditional models of which the normal distribution is the most prevalent pearson 1894 mclachlan and basford 1988 everitt 1996 reynolds 2015 nevertheless other forms of mixtures are increasingly applied the von mises mixture model known as a suitable model for circular data has been applied to the distributions of wind and wave directions carta et al 2008 masseran et al 2013 soukissian 2014 haghayeghi and ketabdari 2018 horn et al 2018 li et al 2016 established a mixed distribution model mixed lognormal weibull mixed lognormal rayleigh and mixed rayleigh weibull to fit the significant wave height distribution the mixture model fits the distribution with greater accuracy providing more reliable information for a wave energy assessment huang and dong 2019 predicted the patterns of individual wave periods in mixed sea states with a mixture of lognormal and weibull distributions the number of components of the mixture distributions were assessed using the bayesian information criterion bic it is worth mentioning that in the field of wind energy different types of mixture models have emerged for a description of the bimodal structure of the distribution of wind speed over the past decades akpinar and akpinar 2009 chang 2011 kollu et al 2012 the flexibility of the mixture model inevitably brings about more unknown parameters thus complicating the parametric estimation an iterative algorithm the expectation maximisation em method which is able to provide reliable maximum likelihood estimates for the mixture models redner and walker 1984 lin ye et al 2016 is adopted to serve as a remedy to this problem to gain a more detailed procedure of the em approach for use in a mixture model refer to mclachlan and peel 2000 and gupta and chen 2011 giving an accurate description of the met ocean environment is quite a challenging task owing to the complex climate systems involved in real sea states in an effort to provide a satisfactory fit and reliable guidance for an engineering design in this study an attempt is made to establish mixture copulas to model the bivariate distribution of significant wave heights and zero up crossing periods in combined seas states the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a construction of the joint distribution models including a mixture copula model and a conditional model the background information of the wave data used in the analyses are briefly described in section 3 in section 4 joint distributions established by two parametric models are presented several evaluation schemes are defined for an assessment of the performance of the joint models in the same section the seasonal effect and serial dependency on the joint behaviour of the met ocean variables are discussed in section 5 this is followed by some major findings in section 6 2 joint distribution models 2 1 conditional modelling approach in the present study we used x and y to represent a significant wave height h s and a zero up crossing period t z respectively the conditional modelling approach constructs a bivariate distribution as a product of a marginal distribution for h s and a conditional distribution for t z 1 f x y x y f x x f y x y x as advocated by mathiesen and bitner gregersen 1990 a three parameter weibull distribution is adopted as the marginal distribution of h s and a lognormal distribution is assumed as the conditional distribution for t z 2 f x x β α x γ α β 1 exp x γ α β x γ 0 otherwise and 3 f y x y x 1 2 π σ x y exp ln y μ x 2 2 σ 2 x y 0 where γ α and β are the location scale and shape parameters respectively and σ and μ are the standard deviation and the mathematical expectation of lny which are expressed as smooth functions of x 4 μ x a 1 a 2 x a 3 σ x b 1 b 2 exp b 3 x the coefficients a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 and b 3 are estimated using a nonlinear least squares according to the parameters of the conditional lognormal distribution of t z in each shorter interval of h s it is clear that eq 4 reflects the conditionality of the zero up crossing period on a significant wave height 2 2 mixture copula model as the distinctive feature of a copula function it combines the marginals to form a multivariate distribution according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 the bivariate distribution of x and y can be established after the univariate marginal distributions are known 5 f x y x y c f x x f y y where f xy x y is the joint cumulative distribution function of x and y f x x and f y y are the cumulative probability functions of x and y respectively and c is a copula function equation 5 demonstrates that c is a bivariate cumulative probability function a bivariate probability density function f xy x y can then be obtained by taking the derivative of eq 5 6 f x y x y c f x x f y y f x x f y y where f x x and f y y are the univariate probability density functions of x and y respectively and c is the copula density which is given by 7 c f x x f y y c f x x f y y f x x f y y equation 6 clearly indicates that the copula function couples x and y thus the dependence structure of the variables is described by the chosen copula numerous types of copula families have been applied to construct a multivariate distribution nelson 2006 joe 2014 as suggested by lin et al 2020 the gaussian copula can provide satisfactory description of the joint modelling of h s and t z accordingly in the present application the gaussian copula is adopted owing to its widespread use in coastal and ocean engineering wist et al 2004 dong et al 2015 thus eq 5 can be rewritten as follows 8 f x y x y φ φ 1 f x x φ 1 f y y where φ is a standard gaussian distribution the marginal distribution of h s and t z should be determined before applying eq 8 here a weibull distribution and lognormal distribution are adopted to describe the univariate statistics of h s and t z respectively separating the data and fitting the distributions of different wave components is one way of describing the patterns of combined sea states bitner gregersen 2010 sagrilo et al 2011 however fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 reported that a separate modelling will not always provide a better fit hence models for using all data are considered here as stated by vanem 2016 the effect of the total combined sea data might be captured by certain mixture models which can be constructed through a linear combination of simple statistical models in this study the mixture model will be established using a linear mixture of gaussian copulas a bivariate mixture probability function consisting of d components is given as follows 9 f x y x y ζ j 1 d ω j f x y j x y θ j where ω j is the mixing proportion of the jth bivariate copula model f xyj x y θ j satisfying j 1 d ω j 1 0 ω j 1 θ j is the parameters of the j th component and ζ denotes the vector of all unknown parameters of the mixture model which is given as follows 10 ζ ω 1 ω 2 ω d θ 1 θ 2 θ d the probability density function can be expressed in the following manner 11 f x y x y ζ j 1 d ω j f x y j x y θ j j 1 d ω j c j f x j f y j f x j x f y j y whereas the marginal distributions of x and y can be written as below 12 f x x j 1 d ω j f x j x and 13 f y x j 1 d ω j f y j y respectively the number of components d to include in a mixture should be assessed before a finite mixture distribution is applied to the modelling which has remained an intractable issue to date several approaches for resolving this problem have been developed fischer et al 1994 vlassis and likas 1999 crainiceanu and ruppert 2004 wong et al 2018 among which the use of a penalised likelihood is the primary method of estimating the order of a mixture distribution one way of determining the number of components based on the likelihood is to utilise some information criteria which appears to be a simple and highly practical approach campbell et al 1997 fonseca and cardoso 2007 the bic is applied in the present application to determine the optimal order as suggested by dziak et al 2018 14 b i c 2 l ζ n ζ log n where n denotes the total number of observations and n ζ is the size of ζ in addition l ζ is the log likelihood of the mixture model which is given as follows 15 l ζ i 1 n log f x y x i y i ζ i 1 n log j 1 d ω j f x y j x i y i θ j thus the optimal number of orders can be obtained by minimising the bic value please note that the dependence of data is disregarded in the estimation of eq 15 when the totality of the data is used the maximum likelihood approach is likely one of the most commonly used methods for estimating the parametric distributions traditionally the maximum likelihood estimation of ζ in a probability function f xy x y ζ can be obtained by differentiating the logarithm of the likelihood function as given through the following 16 l ζ ζ 0 however in some instances the maximum likelihood estimates of a mixture model cannot be calculated analytically owing to the nonlinearity and complexity of the likelihood function more components bring about more flexibility of the distribution model as well as additional difficulty in resolving the parameters an iterative method called the em algorithm is applied to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the mixture models in this study instead of seeking a value of ζ that maximises the log likelihood function the em approach aims to calculate ζ that maximises the expected log likelihood function 17 ζ ˆ argmax l ζ ζ ˆ argmaxe l ζ the implementation of the em algorithm can be divided into two steps an e step and an m step an e step during the rth iteration is used to calculate the conditional expected log likelihood function of the mixture model called a q function on the r 1 th iteration calculation which is given as follows 18 q ζ ζ r 1 e ζ r 1 l ζ then the m step during the rth iteration seeks the extreme value of q ζ ζ r 1 and updates the estimation of ζ r 1 to ζ r some initial values of ζ should be specified before applying the em algorithm here the iterative procedure is initialised with random starting values in this way the observations are randomly separated into d groups and the initial values of each θ j 0 can be estimated using the corresponding subsample assigned to the jth class with this approach the initial ω 0 can be initialised as the weights of each group the em algorithm can solve for ζ by iteratively executing the e and m steps until the difference in successive log likelihood values changes by a sufficiently small amount 19 l ζ r 1 l ζ r ε ε 0 one nice feature of this maximum likelihood solver is that the log likelihood function will not decrease for every em algorithm which has been proven by dempster et al 1977 therefore the em method can guarantee that the estimates will never become worse after an em iteration the convergence of the em algorithm can be affected by the properties of the log likelihood function q function and the choice of the starting point gupta and chen 2011 it should be noted that a convergence to a stationary point can occur when performing the technique that is a global maximum may not be found after a single execution in practice a global optimiser can be applied pardalos and romeijn 2002 ali et al 2005 or the em method can be run several times with different initial points wu 1983 3 wave data description one purpose of this study is to participate in the benchmarking exercise launched by haselsteiner et al 2019 and carry out a comparative study of the statistical bivariate modelling only three real datasets from wave buoys collected by the national data buoy center available at https www ndbc noaa gov are analysed in the present study the coordinates of the locations which are along the eastern coast of the united states are 43 525 n 70 141 w location a 28 508 n 80 185 w location b and 29 700 n 93 400 w location c respectively fig 1 these hourly wave data cover a 10 year period from 1996 to 2005 the significant wave height h s and zero up crossing period t z combining the wind sea and swell systems were extracted from the original datasets for the investigation further details can be found in haselsteiner et al 2019 please note that the missing values have been excluded from the initial datasets as mentioned above the total ocean data will be used for statistical modelling and no isolation measures will be taken table 1 summarises the statistics of the three datasets scatterplots of which are shown in fig 2 the ocean data are of course affected by the seasonality and short term dependencies as discussed in section 5 nevertheless for the purpose of comparison with the results of haselsteiner et al 2019 the bulk of the data will be fitted and analysed in section 4 it is worth noting that the values of kurtosis which is related to the tail extremity westfall 2014 of the significant wave height data are considerably high for all three datasets that is the tails of the distribution of h s will asymptotically approach zero much more slowly and thus more outliers will exist in the series in addition the relatively higher values of skewness indicate longer upper tails strong tail dependencies can also be seen in fig 2 therefore tail dependencies in the extremes should be accounted for in the construction of the bivariate distributions moreover special attention should be given to the extreme value analysis of h s which is regarded as a significantly important parameter in ocean and coastal engineering 4 bivariate distribution of significant wave height and zero up crossing period the establishment of the joint distributions of the significant wave height and zero up crossing period is difficult in particular when the data account for a combination of wind sea and swell components the main objective of the present study is to apply the global method to describe the joint behaviour of these two spectral parameters a mixture copula model as well as a conditional approach is used to establish the bivariate distributions for the measured ocean data in a bid to carry out a comparative study several error metrics are defined for an evaluation of these two models 4 1 conditional distributions when adopting the conditional modelling approach the bivariate distribution of h s and t z can be constructed based on the product of the probability distribution of h s and a series of conditional distributions of t z given h s we fit the significant wave height using a three parameter weibull distribution the fitting curves of which are shown in fig 3 please note that the cumulative probabilities have been transformed into standard normal variables and thus the fitness near the tail area can be clearly displayed the anderson darling statistic which places more emphasis on the tails of a distribution is calculated for all datasets 20 a d n 1 n i 1 n 2 i 1 ln f x x i ln 1 f x x n 1 i large deviations can be observed in the tail for all cases from fig 3 clearly the three parameter weibull distribution is unable to provide a satisfactory fit for the tail of the marginal distribution of h s as this model significantly overestimates the return period the situation worsens as the return period increases leading to a serious underestimation of the risk and thus threatening the structural safety it is acknowledged that the extrapolation of the distribution is the foundation of the estimation of the probabilities of extreme loadings an inadequate distribution model for such an important design parameter may have tremendous consequences for disaster protection engineering the conditional t z associated with h s can be estimated by separating h s into smaller groups with a reasonable amount of data the expectation and standard deviation of the logarithm of t z in each group are calculated and the unknown parameters of the continuous functions in eq 4 can be estimated the parameter estimates for the conditional model were presented by haselsteiner et al 2019 the bivariate distribution can be constructed through eq 1 fig 4 shows the contour plots of the conditional model for the observed data the space of significant wave height and zero up crossing period was divided into cells with size 0 2 m 0 2 s and the frequency of the empirical data falling in each cell were calculated the empirical distributions which were obtained by aggregating the observations into a joint histogram were also plotted in fig 4 for comparison the contours indicate that the conditional model provides poorer fitness with a decrease in the probability density values which might be caused by a poor agreement for the tail of the h s distribution the lower contour levels representing the extreme events are underestimated for the three datasets in addition the conditional model underestimates the probabilities of longer periods for location b the poor characterisation of the tail area indicates that the conditional model is unable to predict the probability of the extremes 4 2 mixture copula model the conditional model cannot describe the pattern of all sea data with sufficient quality an alternative approach namely a mixture model based on a gaussian copula is used to establish the bivariate distributions each component of the mixture distribution is constructed using a combination of a weibull distribution for h s a lognormal distribution for t z and a gaussian copula function in this way the marginal distribution of h s and t z becomes a mixture of weibull and lognormal distributions respectively figs 5 and 6 show the univariate distribution of h s and bivariate distributions by a mixture copula the parameters of which are calculated using the em algorithm the number of orders is accessed through the bic criteria the results of which are listed in table 2 both figs 5 and 6 indicate that the present distributions are compatible with the empirical data revealing that the mixture model does a much better job than the conditional model in fitting the bivariate distribution particularly within the tail range the mixture weibull distributions capture the tail shape of the probability distributions of h s well and give lower values of the anderson darling statistic the patterns of the joint distribution as expected are adequately characterised through the mixture copula unlike a conditional model the quality reduction problem does not appear when the probability densities decrease that is the tails of the distribution are well predicted by the proposed statistical model please note that both the correct calculations of the univariate distributions of the individual parameters and the joint behaviour of the relevant valuables are required in the estimation of extreme events zachary et al 1998 the extraordinary accuracy in the extreme region permits a reliable extrapolation in the engineering design process 4 3 model assessment in this section the performances of the conditional model and the mixture copula model are evaluated and compared in the application of the simulated data for this purpose a set of bivariate samples with a size of 800 000 are simulated from the two statistical models here the joint pseudo random numbers are generated by the conditional inversion method nelson 2006 lin and dong 2019 in this way the h s values are simulated by its marginal distribution and the corresponding t z values are calculated based on the conditional distribution f y x y x figs 7 and 8 show scatterplots of the simulated data from the conditional distributions and mixture models the original data are also plotted in these two figures to indicate the fitness of the models visually it can be easily observed that the mixture distribution models provide reasonable simulations for the empirical data whereas the simulated data generated by the conditional joint models have fewer points with higher wave height values in addition for datasets a and b waves with lower wave period values can be found in the simulated data implying that the conditional models produce extra waves with a larger steepness the simulated data generated by the two statistical models echo the joint probability densities shown in figs 4 and 6 however as remarked above the main concern of the estimation of the distribution model is the quality of fit in the tail area neither the contours of the probability densities nor the scatterplots can examine the tail performance some error metrics are required for an assessment of the statistical models 4 3 1 root mean square error the root mean square error rmse is a commonly used accuracy measure that represents the differences between the observations and estimated values predicted through a distribution model in general this can be achieved by dividing h s and t z into several shorter intervals and calculating the frequencies of the data points that fall in one cell for both the field and predicted data the magnitudes of the deviations expressed as the root of the squared errors can then be aggregated to demonstrate the forecast accuracy please note that the rmse defined in this way treats all cells equally nevertheless we would like an indicator that focuses on the aspects of the tail fitness in an effort to place more emphasis on extreme events a weight function will be introduced according to vanem 2016 and fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 the improved rmse can be given as follows 21 r m s e i 1 l j 1 m w i j 1 e e i j 1 s s i j 2 where e ij is the number of observed data points that satisfies x i x x i 1 i 1 2 l y j y y j 1 j 1 2 m s ij is the number of simulated data points falling in the same cell e and s are the sample sizes of the observations and predicted data respectively and w ij represents the weight of the corresponding cell if w ij 1 for any values of i and j eq 21 will turn into a conventional rmse considering the important role of the upper tail of the dominate variable h s in a marine and coastal design stronger penalties will be applied for larger h s values the criteria defined by fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 will be applied here 22 w i j 0 0 33 0 67 1 h s 2 m 2 m h s 4 m 4 m h s 6 m h s 6 m in general a model with a lower rmse value is better than that with a larger value note that the magnitude of this fit index depends on the sample size of the observations meaning that the rmse can only be used to access the performance of different models for the same dataset in addition different sized intervals of h s and t z might lead to different outcomes in the present application cells with size of 0 1 m 0 1 s are chosen the results of the rmse for the conditional distributions and mixture copula model are summarised in table 3 it seems obvious that the mixture models with lower rmse values score better than the conditional distributions for all datasets compared to the conditional modelling approach the mixture copula represents an improvement in the description of the bivariate modes in combined sea states particularly in terms of an extreme value prediction 4 3 2 forecast accuracy of quantiles in practice the return values associated with extreme environmental loadings that offshore structures are required to withstand must be estimated the predictions of these designed values which correspond to the extrapolation of some particular frequencies are dependent on the tail characterisation of the statistical models a scheme to measure the forecast accuracy of the fitted models is carried based on the approach by jonathan et al 2010 the programme is applied on the basis of 1000 realisations of 800 000 bivariate samples drawn from the two joint distributions which allows us to investigate the return values obtained from the adopted models for the purpose of this study only the data points whose cumulative probabilities of the marginal distribution of h s are larger than 0 9 are utilised to access the predictive ability of the models the quality index is defined as the differences between the true quantiles and predicted values which are given as follows 23 d c p c q c where p c and q c are the quantile of order c of the empirical and predicted data respectively four quantiles corresponding to the 0 60 0 70 0 80 and 0 90 orders are calculated apparently a negative value of d c indicates that the return value is underestimated by the statistical model and vice versa tables 4 and 5 illustrate the average values of d c of all realisations for h s and t z respectively the values in the brackets following each quantile represent the minimum and maximum bias for the 1000 simulated series there is no doubt that the mixture copula distributions with a much smaller bias of the quantiles predict the return values of h s and t z more accurately regardless of h s or t z almost all quantiles predicted by the mixture models vary from a negative value to a positive value implying that the estimates fluctuate slightly around the true values nevertheless the conditional models underestimate all quantiles of h s and most of those of t z according to the negative values in tables 4 and 5 worse still for the conditional distributions the deviations surge with an increase in the cumulative frequency which does not appear in the case of mixture models the return values particularly those associated with larger cumulative probabilities will of course have a significant impact on the structural design the drawback of the conditional model might lead to an over underestimation of the extreme environmental loadings by contrast the mixture model is capable of predicting the return values more accurately and reliably thus providing reasonable design parameters 3 4 3 kendall s distribution the return period which serves to identify extreme events is frequently used in a structural reliability analysis it is extremely common to define a return period for a univariate problem however the return period in a multivariate environment is ambiguously understood and has yet to be completely resolved the structural safety indeed depends on the probabilistic combinations of the environmental variables which is not uniquely defined and is much more complicated to determine serinaldi 2015 salvadori et al 2011 attempted to define the return period within a consistent theoretical framework based on kendall s measure 24 t r t s s 1 p f x y x y u t s s 1 k u here t r is the return period t ss denotes the average time elapsing between two consecutive observations and k u is kendall s distribution function which is given as follows 25 k u p f x y x y u it is clear that k u measures the probability of x y falling within the region specified by f xy x y u therefore this probability measure induced by the joint probability of h s and t z can be utilised to calculate the return period in a multi dimensional case it should be noted that the cumulative probability of the bivariate distribution u is not equal to k u owing to the nonlinearity of kendall s function in this study k u will be calculated using the simulation based algorithm proposed by salvadori et al 2011 and treated as a tool for testing the predictive power of the fitted models in the tail region fig 9 shows kendall s distribution function estimated using the conditional models and mixture distribution models for all datasets the empirical estimates derived directly from the available observations are plotted as a frame of reference only joint probabilities of larger than 0 9 are presented and thus the variations of k u in the tail area can be exhibited more visibly it is clear that a gap exists between these two parametric models the value of k u derived from the mixture model matches the empirical data fairly well whereas the other model fails to describe the intrinsic characteristics of the measurements the conditional joint distributions always overestimate the k u values for a larger u resulting in an overestimation of the joint return period accordingly this model will yield less severe conditions during the design process the findings mirror those found in the analysis of the predictive accuracy of quantiles associated with large frequencies 3 5 environmental contour as a tool for describing the tail of the joint behaviour of met ocean parameters environmental contours for a given return period are often used in an ocean engineering design thus several methods have been explored to calculate the contour lines by engineers the most popular is the inverse first order reliability method iform based on the inverse rosenblatt transformation winterstein et al 1993 applications applied to various engineering problems can be found in saranyasoontorn and manuel 2004 myers et al 2015 and eckert gallup et al 2016 without a required transformation a method applying a monte carlo simulation was proposed by huseby et al 2013 although this new approach is computationally more expensive it can provide satisfactory estimates of an extreme structural response similar to the iform method vanem 2017 therefore this technique has been newly applied by numerous researchers vanem 2016 huseby et al 2015 more recently haselsteiner et al 2017 presented environmental contours enclosing the highest density regions this alternative to the iform method generates more reasonable contours when the pattern has two distinct density maxima chai and leira 2018 proposed a more conservative scheme based on the inverse second order reliability method for a comparison with haselsteiner et al 2019 the iform approach is applied in the present study in the context of this method the return value of the combination of a significant wave height and zero up crossing period is defined based on h s which is the most significant parameters affecting the design conditions for form purposes h s and t z were transformed to two standard normal variables by a standard normal quantile transform given by 26 h s f h s 1 φ u 1 t z f t z h s 1 φ u 2 where u 1 and u 2 are two standard normal variables for a given return period t r the associated reliability λ can be given by 27 λ φ 1 1 1 365 24 t r in this way an environmental contour with return period t r can be obtained by varying the two standard normal variables in eq 26 along the circle 28 u 1 2 u 2 2 λ the baseline environmental contours derived by the conditional distributions and mixture copula models are presented in figs 10 and 11 four levels of return period 1 5 20 and 100 year are combined and plotted in the figures note that the 10 year data series might not be sufficiently long due to the climatic variability especially for longer return periods compared to the time duration of the observations one should always keep enough datasets in the practical design process as reported above the conditional models will underestimate the return values in the tail region and the gaps between the true values and predictions widen with an increase in the return levels by contrast the mixture models provide reasonable estimates these findings corroborate the environmental contours in which the maximum value of h s of each contour level obtained by the mixture model is larger than that by a conditional distribution the present statistical models provide completely different shapes of environmental contours indicating a contrasting dependence structure of h s and t z to a certain extent overall very few multiple data points fall outside the 20 year contours calculated by the mixture copula distributions for all datasets nevertheless the conditional distributions permit excessive bivariate samples to exceed the 100 year contour lines the return period of which is much longer than the duration of the observations the major regions where these contour lines are exceeded are those with higher h s values for all datasets in addition for dataset b out crossings of the contours also appear in the region of lower h s values given higher t z values in this regard the environmental contours can be represented more adequately by the mixture model than the conditional model please note that this is not the sole criterion for testing the validity of the distribution model further investigations are needed to access the availability and effectiveness of the environmental contours calculated by the proposed model to further analyse the behaviour of the upper tail as well as the extrapolations to high return period the peak over threshold pot approach combined with generalised pareto distribution gpd was employed to estimate the return levels of significant wave height an automated threshold selection method proposed by liang et al 2019 was used to determine the threshold parameter of pot fig 12 presented the univariate distribution of h s modelled by the pot gpd model fig 13 illustrates a comparison of the return levels for h s using the pot gpd three parameter weibull and mixture weibull models clearly the three parameter weibull distribution provides much lower return level for each return period compared to the pot gpd and mixture weibull methods however obvious distinctions between these two approaches are revealed in fig 13 the mixture weibull model has higher estimated values for locations a and b while lower estimated values for location c such differences can be mainly caused by the adoption of different sampling schemes the uncertainty due to the sampling variability deserved more attention in the practical design 4 seasonality and short term dependence the present met ocean data certainly contain the seasonal variation and short term dependency which might seriously affect the pattern of the joint distribution for the purpose of assessing the effect of these factors the bivariate distributions will be investigated after the original data are processed in this study the seasonality is removed by a moving average method horn et al 2018 that is the moving average sequence of the significant wave heights is extracted and separated from the raw data the serial dependencies are reduced by subsampling the raw data an appropriate period length should be chosen to make sure that the observations can be treated as independent when eliminating the serial dependence as recommended by zachary et al 1998 a period length of 48 h for all the datasets is selected through an investigation of the serial autocorrelation structure of both the h s and t z sequences in this way the processed samples are 48 h apart from the original series for each period the maximum observed value is selected fig 14 shows the scatters of the processed data it seems that the data before and after altering share the similar joint behaviour structure the serial dependencies are examined by the autocorrelation functions of h s and t z shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively the small values of autocorrelation suggest that there is little evidence of significant serial dependence in the three processed series illustrating that the short term dependencies are lessened effectively the joint distributions of h s and t z for the three processed datasets are established by the mixture copula models the number of components and the corresponding bic are listed in table 6 the environmental contours of the processed data presented in fig 17 are calculated using the iform approach obviously the mixture models give reasonable results since the data points almost lie inside the 20 year contours for all datasets similar to the scatters the main characteristics of the environmental contours are somewhat preserved after processing however differences still can be observed in the shapes of the contour lines between the raw data and processed data especially in the regions of tail the contour lines appear to be flatter and more round in the regions of higher h s values for datasets a and c while in the regions of lower values of h s given higher values of t z for dataset b comparable discoveries can be found in vanem 2018 which reported that stronger autocorrelation in the variables can cause higher cross correlation between h s and t z and thus lead to narrower and steeper environmental contours please note that the quantities of the processed data are incompatible with those of the bulk of the data which is caused by the de seasoning process therefore it would be unreasonable to compare the quantities of the environmental contours derived by the original data and processed data vanem 2018 notwithstanding it should be realised that the analysis of observations with strong serial dependency in the variables can excessively overestimate the risk and thus give conservative estimates of the return levels zachary et al 1998 5 conclusions in the present study the joint distribution of a significant wave height and zero up crossing wave period is established with a mixture copula model the em algorithm is applied to calculate the parameters of the mixture model and the number of components is determined based on the bic criteria observations containing both the wind sea and swell components collected from three specific locations are utilised to verify the proposed model for comparison a conditional distribution model is adopted to construct the bivariate distribution the assessment of the fitted models in the tail region is evaluated using the rmse the forecast accuracy of the return levels and kendall s distribution function the single three parameter weibull model is unsuitable to fit the significant wave height for the total sea data because it seriously underestimates the return values in particular when the corresponding return periods are larger the quality of the estimation of the return values decreases with an increase in the joint cumulative probabilities leading to an over underestimation of the risk and a threat to the structural safety by contrast the mixture copula model is suitable for fitting the joint distribution of h s and t z for all sea data the proposed model is able to provide a reasonable description of the pattern and reliable predictions of the return levels furthermore the joint distributions of the processed data are fitted in an effort to examine the seasonal effect and short term dependency the results show that the cross correlation between h s and t z become lower after reducing the seasonality and serial dependency of the ocean data represented by the flatter and more round environmental contours in the tail region further analyses of the effect of these two factors on the practical design and operation process are required declaration of competing interest

21252,an estimation of the statistical properties of a met ocean environment is extremely important in the design and risk assessment of marine structures an adequate description of the joint distribution of met ocean variables can be utilised for structural reliability analyses this study focuses on the joint distribution of significant wave height and zero up crossing wave period with a mixture copula distribution model for total sea data each component of the mixture model is constructed using a weibull distribution for the significant wave height a lognormal distribution for the wave period and a gaussian copula function a commonly used conditional model is used for a comparison with the proposed model several evaluation strategies are defined for an assessment of the performance of two fitted models utilising simulated bivariate samples the results suggest that the conditional model is unsuitable for a description of the pattern of the joint distribution notably by seriously underestimating the return levels by contrast the mixture copula is capable of providing an improved performance and thus provides extremely reliable environmental contours furthermore the effects of seasonality and short term dependency on the joint behaviour of the spectral parameters are investigated and discussed based on the environmental contours keywords met ocean variables joint distribution mixture copula model extreme wave statistics environmental contour 1 introduction knowledge of a probability based design of a marine structure requires a reliable description of the long term wave environment which covers a broad range of meteorological factors it is widely recognised that a multivariate version is necessary for an accurate understanding of the probability of extreme events as a minimum the joint probability of significant wave height and zero up crossing wave period is therefore indispensable to most marine engineering applications some simple formulations have been proposed to make a gross estimate of the relation between significant wave height and period goda 2003 callaghan et al 2008 still it is well known that the significant wave height and zero up crossing wave period should be considered as dependent random variables from a stochastic perspective thus far there have been different parametric distribution models fitting the bivariate distribution which can be broadly classified into three approaches the first approach to bivariate modelling is to adopt parametric bivariate distribution functions ochi 1978 discovered that the joint distribution of the wave height and period can be roughly characterised by the bivariate lognormal probability law this model was later improved by fang and hogben 1982 although such parametric models are extremely simple they usually do not fit the data very well the second method is the conditional modelling approach cma which has been recommended in the design of marine structures dnv 2017 mathiesen and bitner gregersen 1990 suggested that a combination of the three parameter weibull distribution for the wave height and conditional lognormal distribution for the wave period can be used to model the pattern adequately after comparing it with other bivariate probability distributions this distribution is different from the haver 1985 model which applies the lonowe model to fit the wave height distribution later a modified version of the hybrid model for a significant wave height was proposed by choi et al 2019 the improved model provides a comparable accuracy to that of the three parameter weibull distribution but less calculational difficulty based on the model by heffernan and tawn 2004 jonathan et al 2010 presented a conditional approach which follows the asymptotic theory to fit the wave climate parameters for extreme sea states this novel approach provides an adequate fitness for simulated measured and hindcast data dong et al 2013 built up a bivariate maximum entropy distribution based on the bivariate equivalent normal distribution and cma they indicated that the maximum entropy distribution can fit the data better than the weibull and lognormal distributions lucas and guedes soares 2015 investigated the distributions in mixed sea states with the implementation of the cma plackett model and box cox transformations the comparative results showed that the cma model appears to be more accurate the authors also pointed out that the statistical properties of the wind sea and swell components are quite different the third approach to modelling draws support from copula functions as the main advantage of this model it allows any type of marginal density which can be determined independently from the correlation between variables therefore an estimation of the marginals and copula function can be carried out separately de michele et al 2007 utilised copula models to analyse multivariate events in sea storms montes iturrizaga and heredia zavoni 2015 provided a scheme for constructing the environmental contours based on some frequently used copulas notwithstanding the wide application of archimedean copulas in environmental sciences owing to their mathematical tractability corbella and stretch 2013 bhatti and do 2019 some new types of copulas have been adopted to calculate the distribution in recent publications jäger and nápoles 2017 and lin and dong 2019 characterised the wave climate based on the vine copula theory owing to the asymmetric behaviour displayed in most ocean data vanem 2016 fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 and zhang et al 2018 suggested that the joint probability distribution of met ocean variables can be established through asymmetric copulas which can be constructed based on other commonly used copulas compared to traditional copulas the asymmetric copula models have significant advantages in describing the statistics of ocean parameters with asymmetric dependencies it has been well recognised that real sea states consist of various wave systems in particular a mix of wind sea and swells aranuvachapun 1987 myrhaug and slaattelid 1999 it is natural to meet with more difficulties when modelling the statistical distribution of the spectral parameters under a combined sea state lucas and guedes soares 2015 indicated that the conventional parametric models are incapable of fitting the bivariate distributions of the total combined sea state accurately bitner gregersen 2015 presented a joint met ocean model which considers the presence of the wind sea and swell for the design and operability of offshore structures based on the cma method the results showed that the empirical distribution of the wave period in a sea state involving the mixture of various wave systems cannot be fitted well by a single mode lognormal distribution what is needed in such cases is a bimodal distribution that is the mode of such distribution might be captured by a mixture model rather than some simple parametric model vanem 2016 mixture distributions have received growing attention in recent years as a flexible method of statistical modelling a finite mixture model is capable of providing an adequate description for some complex patterns whose shapes are unable to be captured by simple conventional parametric models as the advantage of a mixture model the fitting data contain several separate subpopulations allowing its considerable widespread use in the field of engineering the construction of a mixture can be pursued with a linear combination of traditional models of which the normal distribution is the most prevalent pearson 1894 mclachlan and basford 1988 everitt 1996 reynolds 2015 nevertheless other forms of mixtures are increasingly applied the von mises mixture model known as a suitable model for circular data has been applied to the distributions of wind and wave directions carta et al 2008 masseran et al 2013 soukissian 2014 haghayeghi and ketabdari 2018 horn et al 2018 li et al 2016 established a mixed distribution model mixed lognormal weibull mixed lognormal rayleigh and mixed rayleigh weibull to fit the significant wave height distribution the mixture model fits the distribution with greater accuracy providing more reliable information for a wave energy assessment huang and dong 2019 predicted the patterns of individual wave periods in mixed sea states with a mixture of lognormal and weibull distributions the number of components of the mixture distributions were assessed using the bayesian information criterion bic it is worth mentioning that in the field of wind energy different types of mixture models have emerged for a description of the bimodal structure of the distribution of wind speed over the past decades akpinar and akpinar 2009 chang 2011 kollu et al 2012 the flexibility of the mixture model inevitably brings about more unknown parameters thus complicating the parametric estimation an iterative algorithm the expectation maximisation em method which is able to provide reliable maximum likelihood estimates for the mixture models redner and walker 1984 lin ye et al 2016 is adopted to serve as a remedy to this problem to gain a more detailed procedure of the em approach for use in a mixture model refer to mclachlan and peel 2000 and gupta and chen 2011 giving an accurate description of the met ocean environment is quite a challenging task owing to the complex climate systems involved in real sea states in an effort to provide a satisfactory fit and reliable guidance for an engineering design in this study an attempt is made to establish mixture copulas to model the bivariate distribution of significant wave heights and zero up crossing periods in combined seas states the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a construction of the joint distribution models including a mixture copula model and a conditional model the background information of the wave data used in the analyses are briefly described in section 3 in section 4 joint distributions established by two parametric models are presented several evaluation schemes are defined for an assessment of the performance of the joint models in the same section the seasonal effect and serial dependency on the joint behaviour of the met ocean variables are discussed in section 5 this is followed by some major findings in section 6 2 joint distribution models 2 1 conditional modelling approach in the present study we used x and y to represent a significant wave height h s and a zero up crossing period t z respectively the conditional modelling approach constructs a bivariate distribution as a product of a marginal distribution for h s and a conditional distribution for t z 1 f x y x y f x x f y x y x as advocated by mathiesen and bitner gregersen 1990 a three parameter weibull distribution is adopted as the marginal distribution of h s and a lognormal distribution is assumed as the conditional distribution for t z 2 f x x β α x γ α β 1 exp x γ α β x γ 0 otherwise and 3 f y x y x 1 2 π σ x y exp ln y μ x 2 2 σ 2 x y 0 where γ α and β are the location scale and shape parameters respectively and σ and μ are the standard deviation and the mathematical expectation of lny which are expressed as smooth functions of x 4 μ x a 1 a 2 x a 3 σ x b 1 b 2 exp b 3 x the coefficients a 1 a 2 a 3 b 1 b 2 and b 3 are estimated using a nonlinear least squares according to the parameters of the conditional lognormal distribution of t z in each shorter interval of h s it is clear that eq 4 reflects the conditionality of the zero up crossing period on a significant wave height 2 2 mixture copula model as the distinctive feature of a copula function it combines the marginals to form a multivariate distribution according to sklar s theorem sklar 1959 the bivariate distribution of x and y can be established after the univariate marginal distributions are known 5 f x y x y c f x x f y y where f xy x y is the joint cumulative distribution function of x and y f x x and f y y are the cumulative probability functions of x and y respectively and c is a copula function equation 5 demonstrates that c is a bivariate cumulative probability function a bivariate probability density function f xy x y can then be obtained by taking the derivative of eq 5 6 f x y x y c f x x f y y f x x f y y where f x x and f y y are the univariate probability density functions of x and y respectively and c is the copula density which is given by 7 c f x x f y y c f x x f y y f x x f y y equation 6 clearly indicates that the copula function couples x and y thus the dependence structure of the variables is described by the chosen copula numerous types of copula families have been applied to construct a multivariate distribution nelson 2006 joe 2014 as suggested by lin et al 2020 the gaussian copula can provide satisfactory description of the joint modelling of h s and t z accordingly in the present application the gaussian copula is adopted owing to its widespread use in coastal and ocean engineering wist et al 2004 dong et al 2015 thus eq 5 can be rewritten as follows 8 f x y x y φ φ 1 f x x φ 1 f y y where φ is a standard gaussian distribution the marginal distribution of h s and t z should be determined before applying eq 8 here a weibull distribution and lognormal distribution are adopted to describe the univariate statistics of h s and t z respectively separating the data and fitting the distributions of different wave components is one way of describing the patterns of combined sea states bitner gregersen 2010 sagrilo et al 2011 however fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 reported that a separate modelling will not always provide a better fit hence models for using all data are considered here as stated by vanem 2016 the effect of the total combined sea data might be captured by certain mixture models which can be constructed through a linear combination of simple statistical models in this study the mixture model will be established using a linear mixture of gaussian copulas a bivariate mixture probability function consisting of d components is given as follows 9 f x y x y ζ j 1 d ω j f x y j x y θ j where ω j is the mixing proportion of the jth bivariate copula model f xyj x y θ j satisfying j 1 d ω j 1 0 ω j 1 θ j is the parameters of the j th component and ζ denotes the vector of all unknown parameters of the mixture model which is given as follows 10 ζ ω 1 ω 2 ω d θ 1 θ 2 θ d the probability density function can be expressed in the following manner 11 f x y x y ζ j 1 d ω j f x y j x y θ j j 1 d ω j c j f x j f y j f x j x f y j y whereas the marginal distributions of x and y can be written as below 12 f x x j 1 d ω j f x j x and 13 f y x j 1 d ω j f y j y respectively the number of components d to include in a mixture should be assessed before a finite mixture distribution is applied to the modelling which has remained an intractable issue to date several approaches for resolving this problem have been developed fischer et al 1994 vlassis and likas 1999 crainiceanu and ruppert 2004 wong et al 2018 among which the use of a penalised likelihood is the primary method of estimating the order of a mixture distribution one way of determining the number of components based on the likelihood is to utilise some information criteria which appears to be a simple and highly practical approach campbell et al 1997 fonseca and cardoso 2007 the bic is applied in the present application to determine the optimal order as suggested by dziak et al 2018 14 b i c 2 l ζ n ζ log n where n denotes the total number of observations and n ζ is the size of ζ in addition l ζ is the log likelihood of the mixture model which is given as follows 15 l ζ i 1 n log f x y x i y i ζ i 1 n log j 1 d ω j f x y j x i y i θ j thus the optimal number of orders can be obtained by minimising the bic value please note that the dependence of data is disregarded in the estimation of eq 15 when the totality of the data is used the maximum likelihood approach is likely one of the most commonly used methods for estimating the parametric distributions traditionally the maximum likelihood estimation of ζ in a probability function f xy x y ζ can be obtained by differentiating the logarithm of the likelihood function as given through the following 16 l ζ ζ 0 however in some instances the maximum likelihood estimates of a mixture model cannot be calculated analytically owing to the nonlinearity and complexity of the likelihood function more components bring about more flexibility of the distribution model as well as additional difficulty in resolving the parameters an iterative method called the em algorithm is applied to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the mixture models in this study instead of seeking a value of ζ that maximises the log likelihood function the em approach aims to calculate ζ that maximises the expected log likelihood function 17 ζ ˆ argmax l ζ ζ ˆ argmaxe l ζ the implementation of the em algorithm can be divided into two steps an e step and an m step an e step during the rth iteration is used to calculate the conditional expected log likelihood function of the mixture model called a q function on the r 1 th iteration calculation which is given as follows 18 q ζ ζ r 1 e ζ r 1 l ζ then the m step during the rth iteration seeks the extreme value of q ζ ζ r 1 and updates the estimation of ζ r 1 to ζ r some initial values of ζ should be specified before applying the em algorithm here the iterative procedure is initialised with random starting values in this way the observations are randomly separated into d groups and the initial values of each θ j 0 can be estimated using the corresponding subsample assigned to the jth class with this approach the initial ω 0 can be initialised as the weights of each group the em algorithm can solve for ζ by iteratively executing the e and m steps until the difference in successive log likelihood values changes by a sufficiently small amount 19 l ζ r 1 l ζ r ε ε 0 one nice feature of this maximum likelihood solver is that the log likelihood function will not decrease for every em algorithm which has been proven by dempster et al 1977 therefore the em method can guarantee that the estimates will never become worse after an em iteration the convergence of the em algorithm can be affected by the properties of the log likelihood function q function and the choice of the starting point gupta and chen 2011 it should be noted that a convergence to a stationary point can occur when performing the technique that is a global maximum may not be found after a single execution in practice a global optimiser can be applied pardalos and romeijn 2002 ali et al 2005 or the em method can be run several times with different initial points wu 1983 3 wave data description one purpose of this study is to participate in the benchmarking exercise launched by haselsteiner et al 2019 and carry out a comparative study of the statistical bivariate modelling only three real datasets from wave buoys collected by the national data buoy center available at https www ndbc noaa gov are analysed in the present study the coordinates of the locations which are along the eastern coast of the united states are 43 525 n 70 141 w location a 28 508 n 80 185 w location b and 29 700 n 93 400 w location c respectively fig 1 these hourly wave data cover a 10 year period from 1996 to 2005 the significant wave height h s and zero up crossing period t z combining the wind sea and swell systems were extracted from the original datasets for the investigation further details can be found in haselsteiner et al 2019 please note that the missing values have been excluded from the initial datasets as mentioned above the total ocean data will be used for statistical modelling and no isolation measures will be taken table 1 summarises the statistics of the three datasets scatterplots of which are shown in fig 2 the ocean data are of course affected by the seasonality and short term dependencies as discussed in section 5 nevertheless for the purpose of comparison with the results of haselsteiner et al 2019 the bulk of the data will be fitted and analysed in section 4 it is worth noting that the values of kurtosis which is related to the tail extremity westfall 2014 of the significant wave height data are considerably high for all three datasets that is the tails of the distribution of h s will asymptotically approach zero much more slowly and thus more outliers will exist in the series in addition the relatively higher values of skewness indicate longer upper tails strong tail dependencies can also be seen in fig 2 therefore tail dependencies in the extremes should be accounted for in the construction of the bivariate distributions moreover special attention should be given to the extreme value analysis of h s which is regarded as a significantly important parameter in ocean and coastal engineering 4 bivariate distribution of significant wave height and zero up crossing period the establishment of the joint distributions of the significant wave height and zero up crossing period is difficult in particular when the data account for a combination of wind sea and swell components the main objective of the present study is to apply the global method to describe the joint behaviour of these two spectral parameters a mixture copula model as well as a conditional approach is used to establish the bivariate distributions for the measured ocean data in a bid to carry out a comparative study several error metrics are defined for an evaluation of these two models 4 1 conditional distributions when adopting the conditional modelling approach the bivariate distribution of h s and t z can be constructed based on the product of the probability distribution of h s and a series of conditional distributions of t z given h s we fit the significant wave height using a three parameter weibull distribution the fitting curves of which are shown in fig 3 please note that the cumulative probabilities have been transformed into standard normal variables and thus the fitness near the tail area can be clearly displayed the anderson darling statistic which places more emphasis on the tails of a distribution is calculated for all datasets 20 a d n 1 n i 1 n 2 i 1 ln f x x i ln 1 f x x n 1 i large deviations can be observed in the tail for all cases from fig 3 clearly the three parameter weibull distribution is unable to provide a satisfactory fit for the tail of the marginal distribution of h s as this model significantly overestimates the return period the situation worsens as the return period increases leading to a serious underestimation of the risk and thus threatening the structural safety it is acknowledged that the extrapolation of the distribution is the foundation of the estimation of the probabilities of extreme loadings an inadequate distribution model for such an important design parameter may have tremendous consequences for disaster protection engineering the conditional t z associated with h s can be estimated by separating h s into smaller groups with a reasonable amount of data the expectation and standard deviation of the logarithm of t z in each group are calculated and the unknown parameters of the continuous functions in eq 4 can be estimated the parameter estimates for the conditional model were presented by haselsteiner et al 2019 the bivariate distribution can be constructed through eq 1 fig 4 shows the contour plots of the conditional model for the observed data the space of significant wave height and zero up crossing period was divided into cells with size 0 2 m 0 2 s and the frequency of the empirical data falling in each cell were calculated the empirical distributions which were obtained by aggregating the observations into a joint histogram were also plotted in fig 4 for comparison the contours indicate that the conditional model provides poorer fitness with a decrease in the probability density values which might be caused by a poor agreement for the tail of the h s distribution the lower contour levels representing the extreme events are underestimated for the three datasets in addition the conditional model underestimates the probabilities of longer periods for location b the poor characterisation of the tail area indicates that the conditional model is unable to predict the probability of the extremes 4 2 mixture copula model the conditional model cannot describe the pattern of all sea data with sufficient quality an alternative approach namely a mixture model based on a gaussian copula is used to establish the bivariate distributions each component of the mixture distribution is constructed using a combination of a weibull distribution for h s a lognormal distribution for t z and a gaussian copula function in this way the marginal distribution of h s and t z becomes a mixture of weibull and lognormal distributions respectively figs 5 and 6 show the univariate distribution of h s and bivariate distributions by a mixture copula the parameters of which are calculated using the em algorithm the number of orders is accessed through the bic criteria the results of which are listed in table 2 both figs 5 and 6 indicate that the present distributions are compatible with the empirical data revealing that the mixture model does a much better job than the conditional model in fitting the bivariate distribution particularly within the tail range the mixture weibull distributions capture the tail shape of the probability distributions of h s well and give lower values of the anderson darling statistic the patterns of the joint distribution as expected are adequately characterised through the mixture copula unlike a conditional model the quality reduction problem does not appear when the probability densities decrease that is the tails of the distribution are well predicted by the proposed statistical model please note that both the correct calculations of the univariate distributions of the individual parameters and the joint behaviour of the relevant valuables are required in the estimation of extreme events zachary et al 1998 the extraordinary accuracy in the extreme region permits a reliable extrapolation in the engineering design process 4 3 model assessment in this section the performances of the conditional model and the mixture copula model are evaluated and compared in the application of the simulated data for this purpose a set of bivariate samples with a size of 800 000 are simulated from the two statistical models here the joint pseudo random numbers are generated by the conditional inversion method nelson 2006 lin and dong 2019 in this way the h s values are simulated by its marginal distribution and the corresponding t z values are calculated based on the conditional distribution f y x y x figs 7 and 8 show scatterplots of the simulated data from the conditional distributions and mixture models the original data are also plotted in these two figures to indicate the fitness of the models visually it can be easily observed that the mixture distribution models provide reasonable simulations for the empirical data whereas the simulated data generated by the conditional joint models have fewer points with higher wave height values in addition for datasets a and b waves with lower wave period values can be found in the simulated data implying that the conditional models produce extra waves with a larger steepness the simulated data generated by the two statistical models echo the joint probability densities shown in figs 4 and 6 however as remarked above the main concern of the estimation of the distribution model is the quality of fit in the tail area neither the contours of the probability densities nor the scatterplots can examine the tail performance some error metrics are required for an assessment of the statistical models 4 3 1 root mean square error the root mean square error rmse is a commonly used accuracy measure that represents the differences between the observations and estimated values predicted through a distribution model in general this can be achieved by dividing h s and t z into several shorter intervals and calculating the frequencies of the data points that fall in one cell for both the field and predicted data the magnitudes of the deviations expressed as the root of the squared errors can then be aggregated to demonstrate the forecast accuracy please note that the rmse defined in this way treats all cells equally nevertheless we would like an indicator that focuses on the aspects of the tail fitness in an effort to place more emphasis on extreme events a weight function will be introduced according to vanem 2016 and fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 the improved rmse can be given as follows 21 r m s e i 1 l j 1 m w i j 1 e e i j 1 s s i j 2 where e ij is the number of observed data points that satisfies x i x x i 1 i 1 2 l y j y y j 1 j 1 2 m s ij is the number of simulated data points falling in the same cell e and s are the sample sizes of the observations and predicted data respectively and w ij represents the weight of the corresponding cell if w ij 1 for any values of i and j eq 21 will turn into a conventional rmse considering the important role of the upper tail of the dominate variable h s in a marine and coastal design stronger penalties will be applied for larger h s values the criteria defined by fazeres ferradosa et al 2018 will be applied here 22 w i j 0 0 33 0 67 1 h s 2 m 2 m h s 4 m 4 m h s 6 m h s 6 m in general a model with a lower rmse value is better than that with a larger value note that the magnitude of this fit index depends on the sample size of the observations meaning that the rmse can only be used to access the performance of different models for the same dataset in addition different sized intervals of h s and t z might lead to different outcomes in the present application cells with size of 0 1 m 0 1 s are chosen the results of the rmse for the conditional distributions and mixture copula model are summarised in table 3 it seems obvious that the mixture models with lower rmse values score better than the conditional distributions for all datasets compared to the conditional modelling approach the mixture copula represents an improvement in the description of the bivariate modes in combined sea states particularly in terms of an extreme value prediction 4 3 2 forecast accuracy of quantiles in practice the return values associated with extreme environmental loadings that offshore structures are required to withstand must be estimated the predictions of these designed values which correspond to the extrapolation of some particular frequencies are dependent on the tail characterisation of the statistical models a scheme to measure the forecast accuracy of the fitted models is carried based on the approach by jonathan et al 2010 the programme is applied on the basis of 1000 realisations of 800 000 bivariate samples drawn from the two joint distributions which allows us to investigate the return values obtained from the adopted models for the purpose of this study only the data points whose cumulative probabilities of the marginal distribution of h s are larger than 0 9 are utilised to access the predictive ability of the models the quality index is defined as the differences between the true quantiles and predicted values which are given as follows 23 d c p c q c where p c and q c are the quantile of order c of the empirical and predicted data respectively four quantiles corresponding to the 0 60 0 70 0 80 and 0 90 orders are calculated apparently a negative value of d c indicates that the return value is underestimated by the statistical model and vice versa tables 4 and 5 illustrate the average values of d c of all realisations for h s and t z respectively the values in the brackets following each quantile represent the minimum and maximum bias for the 1000 simulated series there is no doubt that the mixture copula distributions with a much smaller bias of the quantiles predict the return values of h s and t z more accurately regardless of h s or t z almost all quantiles predicted by the mixture models vary from a negative value to a positive value implying that the estimates fluctuate slightly around the true values nevertheless the conditional models underestimate all quantiles of h s and most of those of t z according to the negative values in tables 4 and 5 worse still for the conditional distributions the deviations surge with an increase in the cumulative frequency which does not appear in the case of mixture models the return values particularly those associated with larger cumulative probabilities will of course have a significant impact on the structural design the drawback of the conditional model might lead to an over underestimation of the extreme environmental loadings by contrast the mixture model is capable of predicting the return values more accurately and reliably thus providing reasonable design parameters 3 4 3 kendall s distribution the return period which serves to identify extreme events is frequently used in a structural reliability analysis it is extremely common to define a return period for a univariate problem however the return period in a multivariate environment is ambiguously understood and has yet to be completely resolved the structural safety indeed depends on the probabilistic combinations of the environmental variables which is not uniquely defined and is much more complicated to determine serinaldi 2015 salvadori et al 2011 attempted to define the return period within a consistent theoretical framework based on kendall s measure 24 t r t s s 1 p f x y x y u t s s 1 k u here t r is the return period t ss denotes the average time elapsing between two consecutive observations and k u is kendall s distribution function which is given as follows 25 k u p f x y x y u it is clear that k u measures the probability of x y falling within the region specified by f xy x y u therefore this probability measure induced by the joint probability of h s and t z can be utilised to calculate the return period in a multi dimensional case it should be noted that the cumulative probability of the bivariate distribution u is not equal to k u owing to the nonlinearity of kendall s function in this study k u will be calculated using the simulation based algorithm proposed by salvadori et al 2011 and treated as a tool for testing the predictive power of the fitted models in the tail region fig 9 shows kendall s distribution function estimated using the conditional models and mixture distribution models for all datasets the empirical estimates derived directly from the available observations are plotted as a frame of reference only joint probabilities of larger than 0 9 are presented and thus the variations of k u in the tail area can be exhibited more visibly it is clear that a gap exists between these two parametric models the value of k u derived from the mixture model matches the empirical data fairly well whereas the other model fails to describe the intrinsic characteristics of the measurements the conditional joint distributions always overestimate the k u values for a larger u resulting in an overestimation of the joint return period accordingly this model will yield less severe conditions during the design process the findings mirror those found in the analysis of the predictive accuracy of quantiles associated with large frequencies 3 5 environmental contour as a tool for describing the tail of the joint behaviour of met ocean parameters environmental contours for a given return period are often used in an ocean engineering design thus several methods have been explored to calculate the contour lines by engineers the most popular is the inverse first order reliability method iform based on the inverse rosenblatt transformation winterstein et al 1993 applications applied to various engineering problems can be found in saranyasoontorn and manuel 2004 myers et al 2015 and eckert gallup et al 2016 without a required transformation a method applying a monte carlo simulation was proposed by huseby et al 2013 although this new approach is computationally more expensive it can provide satisfactory estimates of an extreme structural response similar to the iform method vanem 2017 therefore this technique has been newly applied by numerous researchers vanem 2016 huseby et al 2015 more recently haselsteiner et al 2017 presented environmental contours enclosing the highest density regions this alternative to the iform method generates more reasonable contours when the pattern has two distinct density maxima chai and leira 2018 proposed a more conservative scheme based on the inverse second order reliability method for a comparison with haselsteiner et al 2019 the iform approach is applied in the present study in the context of this method the return value of the combination of a significant wave height and zero up crossing period is defined based on h s which is the most significant parameters affecting the design conditions for form purposes h s and t z were transformed to two standard normal variables by a standard normal quantile transform given by 26 h s f h s 1 φ u 1 t z f t z h s 1 φ u 2 where u 1 and u 2 are two standard normal variables for a given return period t r the associated reliability λ can be given by 27 λ φ 1 1 1 365 24 t r in this way an environmental contour with return period t r can be obtained by varying the two standard normal variables in eq 26 along the circle 28 u 1 2 u 2 2 λ the baseline environmental contours derived by the conditional distributions and mixture copula models are presented in figs 10 and 11 four levels of return period 1 5 20 and 100 year are combined and plotted in the figures note that the 10 year data series might not be sufficiently long due to the climatic variability especially for longer return periods compared to the time duration of the observations one should always keep enough datasets in the practical design process as reported above the conditional models will underestimate the return values in the tail region and the gaps between the true values and predictions widen with an increase in the return levels by contrast the mixture models provide reasonable estimates these findings corroborate the environmental contours in which the maximum value of h s of each contour level obtained by the mixture model is larger than that by a conditional distribution the present statistical models provide completely different shapes of environmental contours indicating a contrasting dependence structure of h s and t z to a certain extent overall very few multiple data points fall outside the 20 year contours calculated by the mixture copula distributions for all datasets nevertheless the conditional distributions permit excessive bivariate samples to exceed the 100 year contour lines the return period of which is much longer than the duration of the observations the major regions where these contour lines are exceeded are those with higher h s values for all datasets in addition for dataset b out crossings of the contours also appear in the region of lower h s values given higher t z values in this regard the environmental contours can be represented more adequately by the mixture model than the conditional model please note that this is not the sole criterion for testing the validity of the distribution model further investigations are needed to access the availability and effectiveness of the environmental contours calculated by the proposed model to further analyse the behaviour of the upper tail as well as the extrapolations to high return period the peak over threshold pot approach combined with generalised pareto distribution gpd was employed to estimate the return levels of significant wave height an automated threshold selection method proposed by liang et al 2019 was used to determine the threshold parameter of pot fig 12 presented the univariate distribution of h s modelled by the pot gpd model fig 13 illustrates a comparison of the return levels for h s using the pot gpd three parameter weibull and mixture weibull models clearly the three parameter weibull distribution provides much lower return level for each return period compared to the pot gpd and mixture weibull methods however obvious distinctions between these two approaches are revealed in fig 13 the mixture weibull model has higher estimated values for locations a and b while lower estimated values for location c such differences can be mainly caused by the adoption of different sampling schemes the uncertainty due to the sampling variability deserved more attention in the practical design 4 seasonality and short term dependence the present met ocean data certainly contain the seasonal variation and short term dependency which might seriously affect the pattern of the joint distribution for the purpose of assessing the effect of these factors the bivariate distributions will be investigated after the original data are processed in this study the seasonality is removed by a moving average method horn et al 2018 that is the moving average sequence of the significant wave heights is extracted and separated from the raw data the serial dependencies are reduced by subsampling the raw data an appropriate period length should be chosen to make sure that the observations can be treated as independent when eliminating the serial dependence as recommended by zachary et al 1998 a period length of 48 h for all the datasets is selected through an investigation of the serial autocorrelation structure of both the h s and t z sequences in this way the processed samples are 48 h apart from the original series for each period the maximum observed value is selected fig 14 shows the scatters of the processed data it seems that the data before and after altering share the similar joint behaviour structure the serial dependencies are examined by the autocorrelation functions of h s and t z shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively the small values of autocorrelation suggest that there is little evidence of significant serial dependence in the three processed series illustrating that the short term dependencies are lessened effectively the joint distributions of h s and t z for the three processed datasets are established by the mixture copula models the number of components and the corresponding bic are listed in table 6 the environmental contours of the processed data presented in fig 17 are calculated using the iform approach obviously the mixture models give reasonable results since the data points almost lie inside the 20 year contours for all datasets similar to the scatters the main characteristics of the environmental contours are somewhat preserved after processing however differences still can be observed in the shapes of the contour lines between the raw data and processed data especially in the regions of tail the contour lines appear to be flatter and more round in the regions of higher h s values for datasets a and c while in the regions of lower values of h s given higher values of t z for dataset b comparable discoveries can be found in vanem 2018 which reported that stronger autocorrelation in the variables can cause higher cross correlation between h s and t z and thus lead to narrower and steeper environmental contours please note that the quantities of the processed data are incompatible with those of the bulk of the data which is caused by the de seasoning process therefore it would be unreasonable to compare the quantities of the environmental contours derived by the original data and processed data vanem 2018 notwithstanding it should be realised that the analysis of observations with strong serial dependency in the variables can excessively overestimate the risk and thus give conservative estimates of the return levels zachary et al 1998 5 conclusions in the present study the joint distribution of a significant wave height and zero up crossing wave period is established with a mixture copula model the em algorithm is applied to calculate the parameters of the mixture model and the number of components is determined based on the bic criteria observations containing both the wind sea and swell components collected from three specific locations are utilised to verify the proposed model for comparison a conditional distribution model is adopted to construct the bivariate distribution the assessment of the fitted models in the tail region is evaluated using the rmse the forecast accuracy of the return levels and kendall s distribution function the single three parameter weibull model is unsuitable to fit the significant wave height for the total sea data because it seriously underestimates the return values in particular when the corresponding return periods are larger the quality of the estimation of the return values decreases with an increase in the joint cumulative probabilities leading to an over underestimation of the risk and a threat to the structural safety by contrast the mixture copula model is suitable for fitting the joint distribution of h s and t z for all sea data the proposed model is able to provide a reasonable description of the pattern and reliable predictions of the return levels furthermore the joint distributions of the processed data are fitted in an effort to examine the seasonal effect and short term dependency the results show that the cross correlation between h s and t z become lower after reducing the seasonality and serial dependency of the ocean data represented by the flatter and more round environmental contours in the tail region further analyses of the effect of these two factors on the practical design and operation process are required declaration of competing interest

21253,the gas phase in the gassy sand is in the form of occluded bubbles which are surrounded by water within the void space due to the high compressibility of the gas bubbles it has a significant impact on the shear strength volume change and other engineering properties of gassy sand based on the thermodynamic theory of granular matter combined with the dilatancy equation considering the state parameter and the relationship between pore gas pressure and pore gas volume change a thermodynamic constitutive model is developed to describe the undrained shear behavior of gassy sand the model considers the dissipation at the mesoscopic level and the concept of granular temperature is introduced to describe the irreversible deformation of gassy sand the relationship between the dissipation mechanism of gassy sand and the macroscopic mechanical behavior is established through the migration coefficients and energy density functions the ability of the model to describe the undrained shear behavior of gassy sand is verified by the numerical simulation of the undrained triaxial shear tests of the remolded ottawa sand with different degrees of saturation keywords gassy sand undrained shear dilatancy mesoscopic energy dissipation thermodynamic constitutive model 1 introduction in the engineering construction near the ocean or rivers and lakes a special gas is often encountered in some soil layers which is called shallow gas in engineering geology the main component of the gas is methane and the sand layer is the main occurrence environment of shallow gas which is also known as gassy sand in the era of advocating the use of new energy shallow gas is an important resource but it is also a kind of potential geological disaster in engineering construction zhang et al 2016 li et al 2018 liu et al 2018 found that the gas in the gassy sand is in the form of occluded bubbles which are surrounded by water within the void space through high resolution x ray scanning technology due to the high compressibility of the gas it will have a significant impact on the engineering properties of gassy sand such as deformation strength stability seepage and so on and even lead to ocean engineering accidents in serious cases amaratunga and grozie 2009 grozic et al 2005 li and huang 2016 mabrouk and rowe 2011 robert and thusyanthan 2018 zhang et al 2015 at present the research on the gassy sand is mainly based on the experimental research the existence of a small number of gas bubbles in sand can significantly affect its stress strain behavior which has been confirmed by some different testing techniques including triaxial tests he and chu 2014 and torsional shear tests altun and goktepe 2006 the pros and cons of the gas bubbles depend on the loading paths and drainage conditions amaratunga and grozie 2009 bouferra et al 2007 grozic et al 1999 he and chu 2014 pietruszczak et al 2003 tamura et al 2002 tsukamoto et al 2002 vega posada et al 2014 under the drained conditions the shear strength of gassy sand is almost the same as that of saturated sand while under undrained conditions gassy sand is easier to compress than saturated sand and it is difficult to generate excess pore water pressure vega posada et al 2014 the undrained shear properties of gassy sand show strain softening or strain hardening behavior depending on the degree of saturation and the decrease of saturation degree of gassy sand makes the undrained shear strength increase greatly grozic et al 1999 he and chu 2014 the reduction in the degree of saturation also leads to a transition from strain softening to strain hardening in the stress strain behavior during compression extension tests he and chu 2014 in the study of theoretical model of gassy sand the general assumption is as follows the surface tension of gas bubbles is ignored the gas pressure is equal to the sum of external atmospheric pressure and pore water pressure the gas phase follows boyle s law and henry s law based on the above assumptions and some existing models for saturated sand the constitutive model of gassy sand can be established considering the effect of gas bubbles the increase of fluid compressibility for example grozic et al 2005 developed a constitutive model which can reflect the mechanical properties of gassy sand based on the existing model and considering the compression and dissolution characteristics of gas bubbles liu et al 2016 established a mathematical model to describe the consolidation characteristics of geotechnical material containing organic matter and small gas bubbles the consolidation of materials is regarded as the coupling process of pore water discharge and volume change of gas bubbles and organic matter lü et al 2018 developed a theoretical model to predict the static liquefaction of gassy sand under the triaxial undrained condition by improving the deviatoric hardening plasticity model zapata medina et al 2018 simulated the stress strain strength response of gassy sand under various loading conditions based on a hypoplastic constitutive sand model and the fredlund gas fluid compressibility relationship at present the existing models of gassy sand are mainly based on the classical elastic plastic theory liu et al 2016 lü et al 2018 or based on the thermodynamics theory to establish the hyper plasticity constitutive model through the definition of free energy function and dissipation potential function houlsby and puzrin 2000 zapata medina et al 2018 energy dissipation has a great influence on the mechanical behavior of soil it is most convenient and reliable to describe these contents with entropy and thermodynamic language and it can also ensure that the model does not conflict with the basic physical principles in this paper based on the thermodynamic theory of granular matter combined with the dilatancy equation considering the state parameter and the relationship between pore gas pressure and pore gas volume change established by hilf 1948 a thermodynamic constitutive model is developed to describe the undrained shear behavior of gassy sand the model considers the dissipation at the mesoscopic level and the concept of granular temperature is introduced to describe the irreversible deformation of gassy sand which is similar to the method of introducing the concept of internal variable to reflect the internal structure reorganization in hyper plasticity theory the difference is that the evolution of granular entropy can be expressed quantitatively and it can be connected with the macroscopic behavior the relationship between the dissipation mechanism of gassy sand and the macroscopic mechanical behavior is established through the migration coefficients and energy density function thus the model can describe the effect of gas bubbles on strength and deformation characteristics of gassy sand during undrained shear process 2 basic characteristics of gassy sand 2 1 effective stress of gassy sand generally the effective stress in gassy sand is the same as that in saturated soil liu et al 2016 finno et al 2017 i e terzaghi s effective stress the existence of gas bubbles mainly increases the compressibility of pore fluid and has little effect on the deformation of soil skeleton the applicability of terzaghi s effective stress principle in gassy sand can be derived theoretically by means of force equilibrium analysis as shown in fig 1 the force equilibrium on the cut plane implies 1 σ a σ s i a s i u l a l u g i a g i t s l g i sin θ i where σ is the applied total stress a is total area a s is the area of intercepted soil grains σ s is the stress on intercepted soil grains σ s i u l p s v i a s where p s v i is the vertical component of resultant contact force between particles u l is pore water pressure a l is the area of pore fluid u g i is pore gas pressure a g i is the area of intercepted gas bubble t s is surface tension l g i is circumference of the intercepted bubble the relationship between pore water pressure and gas pressure is 2 u g i u l 2 t s r i where r i is the radius of curvature of the gas bubble the last two items in eq 1 can be simplified as follows u g i a g i t s l g i sin θ i u l 2 t s r i a g i t s 2 π r i sin θ i 3 u l a g i t s 2 π r i 2 r i 2 π r i sin θ i u l a g it can be seen that surface tension t s has no effect here substitute eq 3 into eq 1 divide both sides by the total area a there is 4 σ p s v i a u l where p s v i a is the average stress of the contact stress between soil particles on the cross sectional area a i e terzaghi s effective stress σ therefore eq 4 can be simplified to σ σ u l which shows that the terzaghi s effective stress principle is still applicable in gassy sand 2 2 characteristics of pore fluid the mechanical properties of gassy sand are affected by pore water pressure and pore gas pressure together the external load is an important factor that causes the change of pore pressure especially under undrained condition the applied stress is shared by soil skeleton void gas and void water and the proportion of bearing depends on their relative compressibility the void gas ratio e g void water ratio e l and total void ratio e are defined as 5a e g v g v s 1 s r e 5b e l v l v s s r e 5c e e l e g where v g v l v s are the volume of gas liquid and solid phase respectively and s r is the degree of saturation there are three forms of liquid and gas phases in pore fluid of gassy sand completely miscible completely immiscible and partially miscible the existence of gas bubbles will increase the compressibility of gassy sand if the liquid and gas phases are miscible with each other to a certain extent the compressibility will be the function of pore pressure gas compression coefficient and dissolution coefficient however the effect of surface tension on soil skeleton can be ignored due to the existence form of gas bubbles in the void space and the mixture of liquid and gas can be regarded as a homogeneous medium assuming that the gas phase free and dissolved gas meets boyle s law and henry s law fredlund and rahardjo 1993 and the pore gas pressure absolute pressure is equal to the pore water pressure gauge pressure plus the atmospheric pressure according to the volume change of the gassy sand after loading there is 6 p a t m u l 0 v g 0 h v l 0 p a t m u l v g h v l where p a t m 101 325 kpa is a standard atmospheric pressure h is the solubility coefficient henry constant which can be taken as 0 02 for water gas fluid mixture rad et al 1994 under undrained condition pore gas and water are not allowed to be discharged so any applied stress will cause the increase of pore pressure for gassy sand the applied stress will also cause volume change due to the large compressibility of the gas bubbles hilf established a relationship between pore gas pressure and gas volume change under the undrained loading condition based on boyle s law and henry s law 7 δ u g δ n 1 s r 0 h s r 0 n 0 δ n u g 0 where u g 0 is the initial absolute gas pressure s r 0 is the initial degree of saturation n 0 is the initial porosity eq 7 describes the relationship between pore gas pressure and gas volume in the process of undrained loading by transforming the form of eq 7 the volume change of gassy sand under loading can be obtained 8 δ v g v 0 δ u g u g 0 δ u g 1 s r 0 h s r 0 n 0 where δ v g v 0 is the change of void gas volume relative to the initial volume eq 8 describes the change of volume strain caused by gas compression after each loading the degree of saturation and void ratio will be updated once and the newly generated void ratio and degree of saturation will participate in the next calculation hilf assumed that the change of pore gas pressure is equal to the change of pore water pressure in establishing eq 7 for gassy sand the effect of gas bubbles on soil skeleton can be ignored and the change of pore gas pressure can be regarded as the same as that of pore water pressure liu et al 2016 which meets the assumption of hilf thus eq 8 can be expressed in the incremental form 9 u l u l p a t m 1 s r 0 h s r

only have macro and micro spatial levels but also a mesoscopic level or granular level the interaction at this level is the contact force between soil particles that is to say for geotechnical materials in addition to the thermal movement of molecules at the micro level there is also irregular movement at the mesoscopic level such as particle sliding collision and rolling also known as granular fluctuation in thermodynamics the irregular movement of molecules at the micro level is represented as thermodynamic entropy s or temperature t at the macro level condensed matter physicists use the concept of granular entropy s g or granular temperature t g to describe the fluctuation motion at the mesoscopic level by analogy with the irregular movement of molecules at the micro level jiang and liu 2009 different from the micro molecular irregular movement the interaction at the mesoscopic level is generally inelastic which can produce energy dissipation granular fluctuation is the main mechanism that causes energy dissipation of soil at granular level and it reflects the magnitude of inelastic interaction between soil particles i e plastic deformation granular temperature and granular entropy are introduced to describe the intensity of granular fluctuation macroscopically and they can be quantitatively related to macroscopic dissipation jiang and liu 2009 if there is no continuous excitation the granular fluctuation will decay to the macroscopic thermodynamic entropy until the fluctuation disappears and reaches the equilibrium state again for multi scale geotechnical materials the essential characteristics of multi scale behavior can be easily and effectively grasped from the perspective of energy dissipation entropy is similar to the conserved quantity with superposition and non vanishing properties but the difference is that it can be produced also called entropy production although equilibrium is strictly required as a prerequisite the behavior of entropy is often found to be effective when it deviates from thermal equilibrium landau and lifshitz 1987 defining the specific entropy as the entropy balance equation can be obtained landau and lifshitz 1987 ρ ϑ r t k f k where ρ is the density is entropy flow r t is entropy production following the thermodynamic habits and is the heat production rate the behavior of granular entropy is basically similar to that of thermodynamic entropy due to the inelastic motion between particles the s g will decay to s similar to the motion equation of entropy s the motion equation of granular entropy s g can be expressed as follows 10 ρ s ϑ g r g t g i g where ρ s is bulk density ϑ g s g ρ s is specific entropy i g is granular entropy decay rate which is the entropy production of the system caused by the granular temperature t g the energy dissipation of soil is generally caused by the recombination of soil internal structure which will lead to the plastic deformation the forces that cause energy dissipation are called dissipative forces and its energy work is generally closely related to thermal motion the physical quantity conjugated with dissipative force is called dissipative flow as an energy dissipation mechanism granular entropy motion will cause energy dissipation and entropy increase of the system that is to say t g is one of the dissipative forces that causes entropy increase of the system and i g is the corresponding dissipative flow there is a linear relationship between dissipative flow and dissipative force de groot and mazur 1984 i g γ t g where γ is the migration coefficient according to onsager relation entropy production rate r can be expressed as the sum of the product of dissipative force and dissipation flow if only the dissipation caused by viscosity at the mesoscopic level is considered the granular entropy production rate r g can be expressed as 11 r g σ i j v g ε i j where ε i j is the strain rate of the soil skeleton as the dissipation force and σ i j v g is the viscous stress at the mesoscopic level similarly there is a linear relationship between them 12 σ i j v g λ i j k l g ε k l where λ i j k l g is the migration coefficient at the mesoscopic level which is related to the granular temperature under isotropic conditions it can be expressed as 13 λ i j k l g λ s g t g δ i l δ j k λ v g λ s g 3 t g δ i j δ l k where λ v g and λ s g are migration coefficients at the mesoscopic level the total equilibrium thermodynamics differential form of granular materials can be expressed as follows 14 d w π i j d ε i j e t g d s g t d s μ c d ρ s v i d m i where w is total energy density m i is momentum ε i j e is elastic strain π i j is effective stress μ c is chemical potential in addition the energy density related to granular fluctuation w g can be expressed as a function of bulk density and granular temperature jiang and liu 2009 15 w g b ρ s t g 2 2 where b is the material parameter according to the thermodynamics conjugate relationship in eq 14 there is 16 s g ρ s ϑ g w g t g ρ s b t g therefore it can be concluded that ϑ g b t g and the motion equation of granular temperature can be obtained by combining the above equations 17 t g λ s g b e i j e i j ρ s λ v g b ε v ε v ρ s γ b t g ρ s where ε v ε k k is volume strain and e i j ε i j 1 3 ε k k δ i j is deviator strain defining c 2 η s 2 λ s g γ c 3 η s 2 λ v g γ c 4 γ b t g g η s 2 t g then eq 17 can be expressed as 18 t g g c 2 c 4 e i j e i j ρ s c 3 c 4 ε v ε v ρ s c 4 t g g ρ s where t g g is the representation of granular temperature defined to simplify the expression granular temperature is introduced to describe the intensity of granular fluctuation macroscopically and it can be quantitatively related to macroscopic dissipation such as plastic deformation compared with the internal variable of hyper plasticity theory collins and kelly 2002 or the endochronic variable of endochronic theory valanis 1971 which are used to reflect the change of internal structure of soil plastic strain the definition of granular temperature is more intuitive and clear and its motion equation can be described quantitatively 3 2 expression of stress for multi phase geotechnical materials the elastic potential energy density function can be expressed as follows zhang and cheng 2016 19 w e b ε v e c 1 5 ε v e

compression curve of sand the void ratio e is approximately linear with ln p p a 27 γ e λ ln p p a where λ is the slope of the compression curve p a is reference pressure γ is the special void ratio when p p a taking logarithm on both sides of eq 25 after dimensionless it can be concluded that ln p p a ln b p a ln a where a 3 5 ε v e 2 5 assuming that b can be expressed in the form of b 0 exp ξ and b 0 is the material constant then 28 ln p p a ξ ln b 0 p a ln a by comparing eq 28 and eq 27 it can be approximately concluded that b b 0 exp e λ since b is the parameter describing the hardness of the material the more dense the material is the greater the value of b will be the expression of b obtained above can reflect this characteristic 3 3 expression of strain the introduction of granular temperature t g can describe the intensity of inelastic interaction between soil particles which will result in irreversible deformation then the relationship between the dissipation mechanism and the macroscopic deformation can be established so as to determine the irreversible deformation of soil the inelastic interaction between soil particles will produce dissipation and the effective stress π i j is the dissipation force and the corresponding dissipation flow is the irreversible deformation rate i e plastic deformation rate ε i j p since there is a linear relationship between dissipative flow and dissipative force there is 29 ε i j p η i j k l π k l where η i j k l is the migration coefficient which is related to the granular temperature similarly under isotropic conditions its form can be expressed as 30 η i j k l t g α η s 2 g e δ i l δ j k t g α η v 3 k e η s 6 g e δ i j δ l k where η v and η s are the corresponding migration coefficients α is the index parameter related to the shear strain rate and when α 0 5 it is shear rate independent zhang and cheng 2016 substituting eq 24 and eq 30 into eq 29 the expression of plastic strain rate can be obtained as follows 31 ε i j p η v t g 0 5 ε v e δ i j η s t g 0 5 ε s e defining c 1 η v η s the elastic volumetric strain rate and elastic shear strain rate can be expressed as 32 ε v e ε v 3 c 1 t

state is it will eventually reach a critical state based on the critical state theory some scholars establish the constitutive model of sand by introducing state parameters li 2002 qian et al 2019 shen et al 2016 woo et al 2017 yao et al 2019 the state parameters are determined by the relative density and confining pressure which can reflect the loose or dense state of the sand so that the established constitutive model can consider the mechanical behavior caused by the change of the state during the loading process according to the critical state soil mechanics when the critical state is reached the volume strain will not change any more and there is a unique relationship between the void ratio and the effective stress a large number of test results grozic et al 2005 sasitharan et al 1994 show that the critical state line of sand is approximately linear in the e lnp plane as follows 34 e c e γ λ c ln p p 0 where λ c is the slope of the curve e c is critical void ratio e γ is the related parameter of the curve p 0 is reference pressure the experimental data show that the change of degree of saturation has little effect on the value of λ c but has a certain effect on e γ cui and delage 1996 zhang and ikariya 2011 the effect on e γ is more pronounced in the lower saturation range and less so in the higher saturation range generally more than 80 been and jefferies 1985 introduced a state parameter ψ to describe the loose and dense state of sand which is defined as the difference between the current void ratio e and the critical state void ratio e c with the same effective stress ψ e e c as shown in fig 2 when ψ 0 the sand is in loose state otherwise it is in dense state the definition of state parameters includes two factors relative density and pressure which can reflect the state change of sand during loading dilatancy is one of the basic characteristics of geotechnical materials the reasonable description of dilatancy equation plays a decisive role in establishing constitutive model of sand generally the ratio of plastic volume strain increment to plastic shear strain increment is defined as the rate of dilatancy d d ε v p ε s p there are many different forms of dilatancy equation li and dafalias 2000 wan and guo 1998 li and dafalias 2000 established a dilatancy equation with state parameter as follows 35 d d 0 e m ψ η m d 0 m m e m ψ η where η q p is the stress ratio m is the critical state stress ratio d 0 and m are non negative constants which can be determined by laboratory tests and when m 0 d 0 m eq 35 degenerates to cam clay dilatancy equation d m η according to eq 32 and eq 33 it can be concluded that ε v p 3 c 1 t g g 0 5 ε v e ε s p t g g 0 5 ε s e combining with the dilatancy eq 35 the expression of c 1 can be obtained as follows 36 c 1 d 0 3 m ε v e m e m ψ η ε s e 3 5 calibration of model parameters the parameters involved in the proposed model are as follows parameters related to the elastic potential energy density function including b 0 ζ λ migration coefficients related to the motion equation of granular temperature including η v η s λ v g λ s g b γ parameters related to the dilatancy equation including e γ λ c m d 0 however the migration coefficients related to the motion equation of granular temperature do not need to be calibrated one by one because the parameters needed for model calculation are c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 which should be calibrated it can be seen that granular temperature plays a decisive role in describing the mechanical properties of gassy sand thus the related parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 are also the key parameters of the model the specific calibration methods are as follows 1 the calibration of parameters related to dilation equation can be referred to the method in reference li and dafalias 2000 m is the critical state stress ratio e γ and λ c can be obtained by fitting the test results of critical state line m can be determined according to the phase transition state at d 0 d 0 can be determined by triaxial shear test 2 b 0 and λ can be determined by the isotropic compression curve and ζ can be determined by critical state stress ratio and the stress strain curve 3 c 4 can be calibrated by stress relaxation test ε i j 0 and t g g t g g 0 exp c 4 t ρ s can be obtained by eq 18 where t g g 0 is the granular temperature at the beginning of relaxation test after a certain period of time δ t t g g will gradually tend to 0 such as then the value of c 4 can be determined the effect of the value of c 4 on undrained shear properties of gassy sand is shown in fig 3 it can be seen c 4 has an effect on the maximum shear stress 4 c 3 is related to the consolidation compression curve which can be obtained by the isotropic consolidation compression test as shown in fig 4 5 c 1 is related to strain evolution which can be determined by eq 36 d 0 has a great influence on the value of c 1 the effect of the value of d 0 on undrained shear properties of gassy sand is shown in fig 5 which reflects the influence of c 1 to some extent 6 c 2 is related to the elastic shear strain at the critical state when the critical state is reached ε s e c r c 2 0 5 can be obtained by eq 18 and eq 33 and the expression of c 2 can be obtained by combining the critical state stress ratio eq 25 and eq 26 c 2 is mainly determined by ζ and fig 6 shows the effect of the value of ζ on undrained shear properties of gassy sand 4 simulation analysis of undrained shear behavior of gassy sand through the calibration of the model parameters of the actual foundation soil the proposed model can be used to describe and predict the consolidation compression and undrained shear properties of gassy sand grozic et al 1999 studied the undrained shear properties of gassy sand through triaxial undrained shear tests of remolded ottawa sand with different degrees of saturation the ottawa sand is a uniform medium sand comprised of round to subrounded quartz grains and has a specific gravity of 2 65 and a mean grain size of 0 34 mm the maximum and minimum void ratios are 0 82 and 0 50 respectively the test results show that the gassy sand shows strain softening or strain hardening during undrained shear which depends on the initial degree of saturation and void ratio when the initial void ratio of gassy sand is large it generally shows strain softening and even liquefaction when the degree of saturation is small 80 the gassy sand generally shows strain hardening several groups of representative sample results with different degrees of saturation are selected to verify the ability of the proposed model to describe the undrained shear characteristics of gassy sand as shown in table 1 sample 11 and 12 are saturated samples and some model parameters are calibrated by the test results of them others are samples with different initial degree of saturation and void ratio model parameters are listed in table 2 the critical state line of gassy ottawa sand can be expressed as grozic et al 2005 37 e c 0 92 0 0159 ln p p 0 the influence of critical state on the undrained behavior of gassy sand can be reflected by changing the value of e γ while keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 7 it can be seen that e γ has a slight effect on the peak and critical shear stress values but it doesn t affect the shape of the stress strain curve and effective stress path since the degree of saturation of gassy sand is very high generally more than 80 the variation range of saturation is very small so the change of critical state line and state parameters under different saturation is not obvious for simplicity eq 37 is used to characterize the critical state line of gassy ottawa sand consolidation compression test of the ottawa sand soil in literature pestana and whittle 1995 was selected to calibrate some model parameters b 0 λ c 3 and verify the ability of the model to simulate consolidation compression behavior as shown in fig 8 the test results with the initial void ratio e 0 0 818 are used to calibrate the model parameters and the test results with e 0 0 746 and 0 662 are used for model verification it can be seen that the slopes of compression curves with different initial void ratios are approximately the same and the simulation results are in good agreement with the test results the results of undrained saturated triaxial shear tests were predicted in order to calibrate the model parameters ζ d 0 fig 9 presents the test results of saturated sample s11 along with the model parameters calibration the peak deviator stress and the subsequent strain softening behavior of the test results are matched well by the model fig 10 shows the simulation results of gassy sample 10 s10 including the stress strain curve effective stress path variation of void ratio and degree of saturation the degree of saturation is about 0 91 and the initial void ratio is 0 981 as can be seen from fig 10 s10 shows strain softening and the peak and final deviator stresses predicted by the model are approximately the same as in the test results however in the model responses the sample reached a peak and then experienced subsequent strain softening faster than the test the undrained shear process results in the increase of pore water pressure which leads to the compression of internal bubbles the decrease of void ratio and the increase of degree of saturation the simulation results are consistent with the test results grozic et al 1999 found that if the samples are loose enough and the initial degree of saturation is sufficiently high greater than 90 then the samples can strain soften and experience similar to that of saturated samples fig 11 shows the model simulations for a collapsible strain softening gassy sample 25 s25 it can be seen that flow liquefaction occurs i e after the shear stress reaches the peak value the mean effective stress decreases to almost zero and then remains at a constant value even though the shear stress has softened to zero this behavior may be due to lagging pore pressure readings grozic et al 1999 and therefore not simulated well by the model also the void ratio decreases the degree of saturation increases and the amplitude of the simulation results is slightly larger than the test results although the exact path followed by the model and test results is not exactly the same the model captures the general trends of test results fig 12 presents the behavior of a strain hardening gassy sample 21 s21 predicted using the modified model the degree of saturation of the sample 21 is low about 0 8 that is to say the internal gas content is large so that the volume strain of the sample changes more easily which will increase the drainage trend of the sample during undrained shear it can be seen that a continual increase in deviator stress with increasing axial strain whereas the simulation results shows a slowly increase in deviator stress after approximately 25 strain the simulation results of the stress path are different from the test results to some extent due to the large amount of gas bubbles the stress path is closer to the drained path and then gradually close to the critical state line the simulation results tend to the drained path to a greater extent than the test results although there is a certain deviation between the simulation results and the test results for the gassy sand sample with low degree of saturation the general trend of the undrained strain hardening can be reflected fig 13 shows a summary of the stress strain curves and stress path simulation results of the samples in table 1 in addition to the above samples sample 12 is a saturated sample and its undrained shear characteristic is similar to the saturated sample 11 the degree of saturation of sample 16 is 0 816 which is similar to sample 21 and also shows strain hardening it can be seen that when the degree of saturation is low less than 0 8 the gassy sand mainly shows strain hardening while when the degree of saturation is high it mainly shows strain softening and even shear failure conclusions based on the thermodynamic theory of granular matter considering the energy dissipation at the mesoscopic level combined with the dilatancy equation considering the state parameters and the relationship between pore gas pressure and pore gas volume change a thermodynamic constitutive model is developed to describe the undrained shear behavior of gassy sand for the gassy sand it is considered that the existence of gas bubbles only increases the compressibility and does not affect the deformation of the soil skeleton and terzaghi s effective stress is still applicable the form of the model is relatively simple which does not involve the concepts of yield criterion and flow law but introduces the concepts of granular temperature to reflect the constitutive relationship of the nonelastic deformation of gassy sand the dissipation mechanism of gassy sand is related to the macroscopic mechanical behavior by the model of migration coefficients and energy functions the proposed model is calibrated and verified using laboratory saturated and gassy samples of ottawa sand model simulation responses of the saturated and gassy samples during undrained shear tests which show a strain softening or strain hardening depending on the degree of saturation behavior match the observed test results reasonably well and the increase in void ratio and decrease in degree of saturation are also well simulated however the simulations of collapsible strain softening and strain hardening behavior are not entirely accurate but the general trend is simulated correctly the model can be further strengthened and extended to improve the simulation ability and application such as considering the influence of the intermediate principal stress and applying to practical engineering although the model involves many thermodynamic concepts and variables which may be difficult to understand and accept from the perspective of practical application it can provide some reference value for the analysis of practical geotechnical engineering problems from the perspective of basic science it is also an attempt and communication of interdisciplinary communication between granular physics and soil mechanics credit

21253,the gas phase in the gassy sand is in the form of occluded bubbles which are surrounded by water within the void space due to the high compressibility of the gas bubbles it has a significant

sand undrained shear dilatancy mesoscopic energy dissipation thermodynamic constitutive model 1 introduction in the engineering construction near the ocean or rivers and lakes a special gas is often encountered in some soil layers which is called shallow gas in engineering geology the main component of the gas is methane and the sand layer is the main occurrence environment of shallow gas which is also known as gassy sand in the era of advocating the use of new energy shallow gas is an important resource but it is also a kind of potential geological disaster in engineering construction zhang et al 2016 li et al 2018 liu et al 2018 found that the gas in the gassy sand is in the form of occluded bubbles which are surrounded by water within the void space through high resolution x ray scanning technology due to the high compressibility of the gas it will have a significant impact on the engineering properties of gassy sand such as deformation strength stability seepage and so on and even lead to ocean engineering accidents in serious cases amaratunga and grozie 2009 grozic et al 2005 li and huang 2016 mabrouk and rowe 2011 robert and thusyanthan 2018 zhang et al 2015 at present the research on the gassy sand is mainly based on the experimental research the existence of a small number of gas bubbles in sand can significantly affect its stress strain behavior which has been confirmed by some different testing techniques including triaxial tests he and chu 2014 and torsional shear tests altun and goktepe 2006 the pros and cons of the gas bubbles depend on the loading paths and drainage conditions amaratunga and grozie 2009 bouferra et al 2007 grozic et al 1999 he and chu 2014 pietruszczak et al 2003 tamura et al 2002 tsukamoto et al 2002 vega posada et al 2014 under the drained conditions the shear strength of gassy sand is almost the same as that of saturated sand while under undrained conditions gassy sand is easier to compress than saturated sand and it is difficult to generate excess pore water pressure vega posada et al 2014 the undrained shear properties of gassy sand show strain softening or strain hardening behavior depending on the degree of saturation and the decrease of saturation degree of gassy sand makes the undrained shear strength increase greatly grozic et al 1999 he and chu 2014 the reduction in the degree of saturation also leads to a transition from strain softening to strain hardening in the stress strain behavior during compression extension tests he and chu 2014 in the study of theoretical model of gassy sand the general assumption is as follows the surface tension of gas bubbles is ignored the gas pressure is equal to the sum of external atmospheric pressure and pore water pressure the gas phase follows boyle s law and henry s law based on the above assumptions and some existing models for saturated sand the constitutive model of gassy sand can be established considering the effect of gas bubbles the increase of fluid compressibility for example grozic et al 2005 developed a constitutive model which can reflect the mechanical properties of gassy sand based on the existing model and considering the compression and dissolution characteristics of gas bubbles liu et al 2016 established a mathematical model to describe the consolidation characteristics of geotechnical material containing organic matter and small gas bubbles the consolidation of materials is regarded as the coupling process of pore water discharge and volume change of gas bubbles and organic matter lü et al 2018 developed a theoretical model to predict the static liquefaction of gassy sand under the triaxial undrained condition by improving the deviatoric hardening plasticity model zapata medina et al 2018 simulated the stress strain strength response of gassy sand under various loading conditions based on a hypoplastic constitutive sand model and the fredlund gas fluid compressibility relationship at present the existing models of gassy sand are mainly based on the classical elastic plastic theory liu et al 2016 lü et al 2018 or based on the thermodynamics theory to establish the hyper plasticity constitutive model through the definition of free energy function and dissipation potential function houlsby and puzrin 2000 zapata medina et al 2018 energy dissipation has a great influence on the mechanical behavior of soil it is most convenient and reliable to describe these contents with entropy and thermodynamic language and it can also ensure that the model does not conflict with the basic physical principles in this paper based on the thermodynamic theory of granular matter combined with the dilatancy equation considering the state parameter and the relationship between pore gas pressure and pore gas volume change established by hilf 1948 a thermodynamic constitutive model is developed to describe the undrained shear behavior of gassy sand the model considers the dissipation at the mesoscopic level and the concept of granular temperature is introduced to describe the irreversible deformation of gassy sand which is similar to the method of introducing the concept of internal variable to reflect the internal structure reorganization in hyper plasticity theory the difference is that the evolution of granular entropy can be expressed quantitatively and it can be connected with the macroscopic behavior the relationship between the dissipation mechanism of gassy sand and the macroscopic mechanical behavior is established through the migration coefficients and energy density function thus the model can describe the effect of gas bubbles on strength and deformation characteristics of gassy sand during undrained shear process 2 basic characteristics of gassy sand 2 1 effective stress of gassy sand generally the effective stress in gassy sand is the same as that in saturated soil liu et al 2016 finno et al 2017 i e terzaghi s effective stress the existence of gas bubbles mainly increases the compressibility of pore fluid and has little effect on the deformation of soil skeleton the applicability of terzaghi s effective stress principle in gassy sand can be derived theoretically by means of force equilibrium analysis as shown in fig 1 the force equilibrium on the cut plane implies 1 σ a σ s i a s i u l a l u g i a g i t s l g i sin θ i where σ is the applied total stress a is total area a s is the area of intercepted soil grains σ s is the stress on intercepted soil grains σ s i u l p s v i a s where p s v i is the vertical component of resultant contact force between particles u l is pore water pressure a l is the area of pore fluid u g i is pore gas pressure a g i is the area of intercepted gas bubble t s is surface tension l g i is circumference of the intercepted bubble the relationship between pore water pressure and gas pressure is 2 u g i u l 2 t s r i where r i is the radius of curvature of the gas bubble the last two items in eq 1 can be simplified as follows u g i a g i t s l g i sin θ i u l 2 t s r i a g i t s 2 π r i sin θ i 3 u l a g i t s 2 π r i 2 r i 2 π r i sin θ i u l a g it can be seen that surface tension t s has no effect here substitute eq 3 into eq 1 divide both sides by the total area a there is 4 σ p s v i a u l where p s v i a is the average stress of the contact stress between soil particles on the cross sectional area a i e terzaghi s effective stress σ therefore eq 4 can be simplified to σ σ u l which shows that the terzaghi s effective stress principle is still applicable in gassy sand 2 2 characteristics of pore fluid the mechanical properties of gassy sand are affected by pore water pressure and pore gas pressure together the external load is an important factor that causes the change of pore pressure especially under undrained condition the applied stress is shared by soil skeleton void gas and void water and the proportion of bearing depends on their relative compressibility the void gas ratio e g void water ratio e l and total void ratio e are defined as 5a e g v g v s 1 s r e 5b e l v l v s s r e 5c e e l e g where v g v l v s are the volume of gas liquid and solid phase respectively and s r is the degree of saturation there are three forms of liquid and gas phases in pore fluid of gassy sand completely miscible completely immiscible and partially miscible the existence of gas bubbles will increase the compressibility of gassy sand if the liquid and gas phases are miscible with each other to a certain extent the compressibility will be the function of pore pressure gas compression coefficient and dissolution coefficient however the effect of surface tension on soil skeleton can be ignored due to the existence form of gas bubbles in the void space and the mixture of liquid and gas can be regarded as a homogeneous medium assuming that the gas phase free and dissolved gas meets boyle s law and henry s law fredlund and rahardjo 1993 and the pore gas pressure absolute pressure is equal to the pore water pressure gauge pressure plus the atmospheric pressure according to the volume change of the gassy sand after loading there is 6 p a t m u l 0 v g 0 h v l 0 p a t m u l v g h v l where p a t m 101 325 kpa is a standard atmospheric pressure h is the solubility coefficient henry constant which can be taken as 0 02 for water gas fluid mixture rad et al 1994 under undrained condition pore gas and water are not allowed to be discharged so any applied stress will cause the increase of pore pressure for gassy sand the applied stress will also cause volume change due to the large compressibility of the gas bubbles hilf established a relationship between pore gas pressure and gas volume change under the undrained loading condition based on boyle s law and henry s law 7 δ u g δ n 1 s r 0 h s r 0 n 0 δ n u g 0 where u g 0 is the initial absolute gas pressure s r 0 is the initial degree of saturation n 0 is the initial porosity eq 7 describes the relationship between pore gas pressure and gas volume in the process of undrained loading by transforming the form of eq 7 the volume change of gassy sand under loading can be obtained 8 δ v g v 0 δ u g u g 0 δ u g 1 s r 0 h s r 0 n 0 where δ v g v 0 is the change of void gas volume relative to the initial volume eq 8 describes the change of volume strain caused by gas compression after each loading the degree of saturation and void ratio will be updated once and the newly generated void ratio and degree of saturation will participate in the next calculation hilf assumed that the change of pore gas pressure is equal to the change of pore water pressure in establishing eq 7 for gassy sand the effect of gas bubbles on soil skeleton can be ignored and the change of pore gas pressure can be regarded as the same as that of pore water pressure liu et al 2016 which meets the assumption of hilf thus eq 8 can be expressed in the incremental form 9 u l u l p a t m 1 s r 0 h s r

only have macro and micro spatial levels but also a mesoscopic level or granular level the interaction at this level is the contact force between soil particles that is to say for geotechnical materials in addition to the thermal movement of molecules at the micro level there is also irregular movement at the mesoscopic level such as particle sliding collision and rolling also known as granular fluctuation in thermodynamics the irregular movement of molecules at the micro level is represented as thermodynamic entropy s or temperature t at the macro level condensed matter physicists use the concept of granular entropy s g or granular temperature t g to describe the fluctuation motion at the mesoscopic level by analogy with the irregular movement of molecules at the micro level jiang and liu 2009 different from the micro molecular irregular movement the interaction at the mesoscopic level is generally inelastic which can produce energy dissipation granular fluctuation is the main mechanism that causes energy dissipation of soil at granular level and it reflects the magnitude of inelastic interaction between soil particles i e plastic deformation granular temperature and granular entropy are introduced to describe the intensity of granular fluctuation macroscopically and they can be quantitatively related to macroscopic dissipation jiang and liu 2009 if there is no continuous excitation the granular fluctuation will decay to the macroscopic thermodynamic entropy until the fluctuation disappears and reaches the equilibrium state again for multi scale geotechnical materials the essential characteristics of multi scale behavior can be easily and effectively grasped from the perspective of energy dissipation entropy is similar to the conserved quantity with superposition and non vanishing properties but the difference is that it can be produced also called entropy production although equilibrium is strictly required as a prerequisite the behavior of entropy is often found to be effective when it deviates from thermal equilibrium landau and lifshitz 1987 defining the specific entropy as the entropy balance equation can be obtained landau and lifshitz 1987 ρ ϑ r t k f k where ρ is the density is entropy flow r t is entropy production following the thermodynamic habits and is the heat production rate the behavior of granular entropy is basically similar to that of thermodynamic entropy due to the inelastic motion between particles the s g will decay to s similar to the motion equation of entropy s the motion equation of granular entropy s g can be expressed as follows 10 ρ s ϑ g r g t g i g where ρ s is bulk density ϑ g s g ρ s is specific entropy i g is granular entropy decay rate which is the entropy production of the system caused by the granular temperature t g the energy dissipation of soil is generally caused by the recombination of soil internal structure which will lead to the plastic deformation the forces that cause energy dissipation are called dissipative forces and its energy work is generally closely related to thermal motion the physical quantity conjugated with dissipative force is called dissipative flow as an energy dissipation mechanism granular entropy motion will cause energy dissipation and entropy increase of the system that is to say t g is one of the dissipative forces that causes entropy increase of the system and i g is the corresponding dissipative flow there is a linear relationship between dissipative flow and dissipative force de groot and mazur 1984 i g γ t g where γ is the migration coefficient according to onsager relation entropy production rate r can be expressed as the sum of the product of dissipative force and dissipation flow if only the dissipation caused by viscosity at the mesoscopic level is considered the granular entropy production rate r g can be expressed as 11 r g σ i j v g ε i j where ε i j is the strain rate of the soil skeleton as the dissipation force and σ i j v g is the viscous stress at the mesoscopic level similarly there is a linear relationship between them 12 σ i j v g λ i j k l g ε k l where λ i j k l g is the migration coefficient at the mesoscopic level which is related to the granular temperature under isotropic conditions it can be expressed as 13 λ i j k l g λ s g t g δ i l δ j k λ v g λ s g 3 t g δ i j δ l k where λ v g and λ s g are migration coefficients at the mesoscopic level the total equilibrium thermodynamics differential form of granular materials can be expressed as follows 14 d w π i j d ε i j e t g d s g t d s μ c d ρ s v i d m i where w is total energy density m i is momentum ε i j e is elastic strain π i j is effective stress μ c is chemical potential in addition the energy density related to granular fluctuation w g can be expressed as a function of bulk density and granular temperature jiang and liu 2009 15 w g b ρ s t g 2 2 where b is the material parameter according to the thermodynamics conjugate relationship in eq 14 there is 16 s g ρ s ϑ g w g t g ρ s b t g therefore it can be concluded that ϑ g b t g and the motion equation of granular temperature can be obtained by combining the above equations 17 t g λ s g b e i j e i j ρ s λ v g b ε v ε v ρ s γ b t g ρ s where ε v ε k k is volume strain and e i j ε i j 1 3 ε k k δ i j is deviator strain defining c 2 η s 2 λ s g γ c 3 η s 2 λ v g γ c 4 γ b t g g η s 2 t g then eq 17 can be expressed as 18 t g g c 2 c 4 e i j e i j ρ s c 3 c 4 ε v ε v ρ s c 4 t g g ρ s where t g g is the representation of granular temperature defined to simplify the expression granular temperature is introduced to describe the intensity of granular fluctuation macroscopically and it can be quantitatively related to macroscopic dissipation such as plastic deformation compared with the internal variable of hyper plasticity theory collins and kelly 2002 or the endochronic variable of endochronic theory valanis 1971 which are used to reflect the change of internal structure of soil plastic strain the definition of granular temperature is more intuitive and clear and its motion equation can be described quantitatively 3 2 expression of stress for multi phase geotechnical materials the elastic potential energy density function can be expressed as follows zhang and cheng 2016 19 w e b ε v e c 1 5 ε v e

compression curve of sand the void ratio e is approximately linear with ln p p a 27 γ e λ ln p p a where λ is the slope of the compression curve p a is reference pressure γ is the special void ratio when p p a taking logarithm on both sides of eq 25 after dimensionless it can be concluded that ln p p a ln b p a ln a where a 3 5 ε v e 2 5 assuming that b can be expressed in the form of b 0 exp ξ and b 0 is the material constant then 28 ln p p a ξ ln b 0 p a ln a by comparing eq 28 and eq 27 it can be approximately concluded that b b 0 exp e λ since b is the parameter describing the hardness of the material the more dense the material is the greater the value of b will be the expression of b obtained above can reflect this characteristic 3 3 expression of strain the introduction of granular temperature t g can describe the intensity of inelastic interaction between soil particles which will result in irreversible deformation then the relationship between the dissipation mechanism and the macroscopic deformation can be established so as to determine the irreversible deformation of soil the inelastic interaction between soil particles will produce dissipation and the effective stress π i j is the dissipation force and the corresponding dissipation flow is the irreversible deformation rate i e plastic deformation rate ε i j p since there is a linear relationship between dissipative flow and dissipative force there is 29 ε i j p η i j k l π k l where η i j k l is the migration coefficient which is related to the granular temperature similarly under isotropic conditions its form can be expressed as 30 η i j k l t g α η s 2 g e δ i l δ j k t g α η v 3 k e η s 6 g e δ i j δ l k where η v and η s are the corresponding migration coefficients α is the index parameter related to the shear strain rate and when α 0 5 it is shear rate independent zhang and cheng 2016 substituting eq 24 and eq 30 into eq 29 the expression of plastic strain rate can be obtained as follows 31 ε i j p η v t g 0 5 ε v e δ i j η s t g 0 5 ε s e defining c 1 η v η s the elastic volumetric strain rate and elastic shear strain rate can be expressed as 32 ε v e ε v 3 c 1 t

state is it will eventually reach a critical state based on the critical state theory some scholars establish the constitutive model of sand by introducing state parameters li 2002 qian et al 2019 shen et al 2016 woo et al 2017 yao et al 2019 the state parameters are determined by the relative density and confining pressure which can reflect the loose or dense state of the sand so that the established constitutive model can consider the mechanical behavior caused by the change of the state during the loading process according to the critical state soil mechanics when the critical state is reached the volume strain will not change any more and there is a unique relationship between the void ratio and the effective stress a large number of test results grozic et al 2005 sasitharan et al 1994 show that the critical state line of sand is approximately linear in the e lnp plane as follows 34 e c e γ λ c ln p p 0 where λ c is the slope of the curve e c is critical void ratio e γ is the related parameter of the curve p 0 is reference pressure the experimental data show that the change of degree of saturation has little effect on the value of λ c but has a certain effect on e γ cui and delage 1996 zhang and ikariya 2011 the effect on e γ is more pronounced in the lower saturation range and less so in the higher saturation range generally more than 80 been and jefferies 1985 introduced a state parameter ψ to describe the loose and dense state of sand which is defined as the difference between the current void ratio e and the critical state void ratio e c with the same effective stress ψ e e c as shown in fig 2 when ψ 0 the sand is in loose state otherwise it is in dense state the definition of state parameters includes two factors relative density and pressure which can reflect the state change of sand during loading dilatancy is one of the basic characteristics of geotechnical materials the reasonable description of dilatancy equation plays a decisive role in establishing constitutive model of sand generally the ratio of plastic volume strain increment to plastic shear strain increment is defined as the rate of dilatancy d d ε v p ε s p there are many different forms of dilatancy equation li and dafalias 2000 wan and guo 1998 li and dafalias 2000 established a dilatancy equation with state parameter as follows 35 d d 0 e m ψ η m d 0 m m e m ψ η where η q p is the stress ratio m is the critical state stress ratio d 0 and m are non negative constants which can be determined by laboratory tests and when m 0 d 0 m eq 35 degenerates to cam clay dilatancy equation d m η according to eq 32 and eq 33 it can be concluded that ε v p 3 c 1 t g g 0 5 ε v e ε s p t g g 0 5 ε s e combining with the dilatancy eq 35 the expression of c 1 can be obtained as follows 36 c 1 d 0 3 m ε v e m e m ψ η ε s e 3 5 calibration of model parameters the parameters involved in the proposed model are as follows parameters related to the elastic potential energy density function including b 0 ζ λ migration coefficients related to the motion equation of granular temperature including η v η s λ v g λ s g b γ parameters related to the dilatancy equation including e γ λ c m d 0 however the migration coefficients related to the motion equation of granular temperature do not need to be calibrated one by one because the parameters needed for model calculation are c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 which should be calibrated it can be seen that granular temperature plays a decisive role in describing the mechanical properties of gassy sand thus the related parameters c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 are also the key parameters of the model the specific calibration methods are as follows 1 the calibration of parameters related to dilation equation can be referred to the method in reference li and dafalias 2000 m is the critical state stress ratio e γ and λ c can be obtained by fitting the test results of critical state line m can be determined according to the phase transition state at d 0 d 0 can be determined by triaxial shear test 2 b 0 and λ can be determined by the isotropic compression curve and ζ can be determined by critical state stress ratio and the stress strain curve 3 c 4 can be calibrated by stress relaxation test ε i j 0 and t g g t g g 0 exp c 4 t ρ s can be obtained by eq 18 where t g g 0 is the granular temperature at the beginning of relaxation test after a certain period of time δ t t g g will gradually tend to 0 such as then the value of c 4 can be determined the effect of the value of c 4 on undrained shear properties of gassy sand is shown in fig 3 it can be seen c 4 has an effect on the maximum shear stress 4 c 3 is related to the consolidation compression curve which can be obtained by the isotropic consolidation compression test as shown in fig 4 5 c 1 is related to strain evolution which can be determined by eq 36 d 0 has a great influence on the value of c 1 the effect of the value of d 0 on undrained shear properties of gassy sand is shown in fig 5 which reflects the influence of c 1 to some extent 6 c 2 is related to the elastic shear strain at the critical state when the critical state is reached ε s e c r c 2 0 5 can be obtained by eq 18 and eq 33 and the expression of c 2 can be obtained by combining the critical state stress ratio eq 25 and eq 26 c 2 is mainly determined by ζ and fig 6 shows the effect of the value of ζ on undrained shear properties of gassy sand 4 simulation analysis of undrained shear behavior of gassy sand through the calibration of the model parameters of the actual foundation soil the proposed model can be used to describe and predict the consolidation compression and undrained shear properties of gassy sand grozic et al 1999 studied the undrained shear properties of gassy sand through triaxial undrained shear tests of remolded ottawa sand with different degrees of saturation the ottawa sand is a uniform medium sand comprised of round to subrounded quartz grains and has a specific gravity of 2 65 and a mean grain size of 0 34 mm the maximum and minimum void ratios are 0 82 and 0 50 respectively the test results show that the gassy sand shows strain softening or strain hardening during undrained shear which depends on the initial degree of saturation and void ratio when the initial void ratio of gassy sand is large it generally shows strain softening and even liquefaction when the degree of saturation is small 80 the gassy sand generally shows strain hardening several groups of representative sample results with different degrees of saturation are selected to verify the ability of the proposed model to describe the undrained shear characteristics of gassy sand as shown in table 1 sample 11 and 12 are saturated samples and some model parameters are calibrated by the test results of them others are samples with different initial degree of saturation and void ratio model parameters are listed in table 2 the critical state line of gassy ottawa sand can be expressed as grozic et al 2005 37 e c 0 92 0 0159 ln p p 0 the influence of critical state on the undrained behavior of gassy sand can be reflected by changing the value of e γ while keeping other parameters constant as shown in fig 7 it can be seen that e γ has a slight effect on the peak and critical shear stress values but it doesn t affect the shape of the stress strain curve and effective stress path since the degree of saturation of gassy sand is very high generally more than 80 the variation range of saturation is very small so the change of critical state line and state parameters under different saturation is not obvious for simplicity eq 37 is used to characterize the critical state line of gassy ottawa sand consolidation compression test of the ottawa sand soil in literature pestana and whittle 1995 was selected to calibrate some model parameters b 0 λ c 3 and verify the ability of the model to simulate consolidation compression behavior as shown in fig 8 the test results with the initial void ratio e 0 0 818 are used to calibrate the model parameters and the test results with e 0 0 746 and 0 662 are used for model verification it can be seen that the slopes of compression curves with different initial void ratios are approximately the same and the simulation results are in good agreement with the test results the results of undrained saturated triaxial shear tests were predicted in order to calibrate the model parameters ζ d 0 fig 9 presents the test results of saturated sample s11 along with the model parameters calibration the peak deviator stress and the subsequent strain softening behavior of the test results are matched well by the model fig 10 shows the simulation results of gassy sample 10 s10 including the stress strain curve effective stress path variation of void ratio and degree of saturation the degree of saturation is about 0 91 and the initial void ratio is 0 981 as can be seen from fig 10 s10 shows strain softening and the peak and final deviator stresses predicted by the model are approximately the same as in the test results however in the model responses the sample reached a peak and then experienced subsequent strain softening faster than the test the undrained shear process results in the increase of pore water pressure which leads to the compression of internal bubbles the decrease of void ratio and the increase of degree of saturation the simulation results are consistent with the test results grozic et al 1999 found that if the samples are loose enough and the initial degree of saturation is sufficiently high greater than 90 then the samples can strain soften and experience similar to that of saturated samples fig 11 shows the model simulations for a collapsible strain softening gassy sample 25 s25 it can be seen that flow liquefaction occurs i e after the shear stress reaches the peak value the mean effective stress decreases to almost zero and then remains at a constant value even though the shear stress has softened to zero this behavior may be due to lagging pore pressure readings grozic et al 1999 and therefore not simulated well by the model also the void ratio decreases the degree of saturation increases and the amplitude of the simulation results is slightly larger than the test results although the exact path followed by the model and test results is not exactly the same the model captures the general trends of test results fig 12 presents the behavior of a strain hardening gassy sample 21 s21 predicted using the modified model the degree of saturation of the sample 21 is low about 0 8 that is to say the internal gas content is large so that the volume strain of the sample changes more easily which will increase the drainage trend of the sample during undrained shear it can be seen that a continual increase in deviator stress with increasing axial strain whereas the simulation results shows a slowly increase in deviator stress after approximately 25 strain the simulation results of the stress path are different from the test results to some extent due to the large amount of gas bubbles the stress path is closer to the drained path and then gradually close to the critical state line the simulation results tend to the drained path to a greater extent than the test results although there is a certain deviation between the simulation results and the test results for the gassy sand sample with low degree of saturation the general trend of the undrained strain hardening can be reflected fig 13 shows a summary of the stress strain curves and stress path simulation results of the samples in table 1 in addition to the above samples sample 12 is a saturated sample and its undrained shear characteristic is similar to the saturated sample 11 the degree of saturation of sample 16 is 0 816 which is similar to sample 21 and also shows strain hardening it can be seen that when the degree of saturation is low less than 0 8 the gassy sand mainly shows strain hardening while when the degree of saturation is high it mainly shows strain softening and even shear failure conclusions based on the thermodynamic theory of granular matter considering the energy dissipation at the mesoscopic level combined with the dilatancy equation considering the state parameters and the relationship between pore gas pressure and pore gas volume change a thermodynamic constitutive model is developed to describe the undrained shear behavior of gassy sand for the gassy sand it is considered that the existence of gas bubbles only increases the compressibility and does not affect the deformation of the soil skeleton and terzaghi s effective stress is still applicable the form of the model is relatively simple which does not involve the concepts of yield criterion and flow law but introduces the concepts of granular temperature to reflect the constitutive relationship of the nonelastic deformation of gassy sand the dissipation mechanism of gassy sand is related to the macroscopic mechanical behavior by the model of migration coefficients and energy functions the proposed model is calibrated and verified using laboratory saturated and gassy samples of ottawa sand model simulation responses of the saturated and gassy samples during undrained shear tests which show a strain softening or strain hardening depending on the degree of saturation behavior match the observed test results reasonably well and the increase in void ratio and decrease in degree of saturation are also well simulated however the simulations of collapsible strain softening and strain hardening behavior are not entirely accurate but the general trend is simulated correctly the model can be further strengthened and extended to improve the simulation ability and application such as considering the influence of the intermediate principal stress and applying to practical engineering although the model involves many thermodynamic concepts and variables which may be difficult to understand and accept from the perspective of practical application it can provide some reference value for the analysis of practical geotechnical engineering problems from the perspective of basic science it is also an attempt and communication of interdisciplinary communication between granular physics and soil mechanics credit

21254,a simplified open floating slender structure is used to investigate the dynamic behaviors of the warship in this paper the deformation and damage mechanisms of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion are studied using the experiment and the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method firstly a validation for the cel method is carried out where the numerical results agree well with the results in experiment subsequently in order to analyze the deformation and damage characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion a series of cases for different detonation distances and different charge weights are carried out in the cases the results indicate that the deformation and damage of the simplified open floating slender structure are mainly induced by the bubble and the damage induced by the shock wave is not obvious for small charge weight and large detonation distance the whipping motion is the main deformation form of the simplified open floating slender structure when the charge weight increases or the detonation distance decreases to a critical value the simplified floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge generated in the middle region keywords underwater explosion bubble simplified open floating slender structure whipping motion plastic hinge coupled eulerian lagrangian method 1 introduction the warship may be subjected to underwater explosion in the war for the underwater explosion in the vicinity of the warship the shock wave usually will cause local deformation and damage to the warship zhang et al 2015 after the shock wave propagates around the following explosion bubble pulsation will result in the whipping motion and overall damage of the warship due to its low frequency feature vernon 1986 zhang and zong 2011 besides a high speed water jet will be formed toward the structure during the bubble collapse stage which will also cause local deformation and damage to the warship structure the interactions between the warship and the underwater explosion had been studied for many years but the deformation and damage mechanisms of the warship subjected to the underwater explosion bubble are not completely clear so far the warship has the similar structural characteristics to the slender structure so researches on the dynamic responses of the slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble are beneficial for understanding the deformation and damage mechanisms of the warship therefore the dynamic responses of a simplified floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble are studied in this paper at the beginning studies on the underwater explosion mainly focus on the explosion phenomena and the load characteristics cole 1948 geers and hunter 2002 based on the previous studies cole 1948 summarized the phenomena of the underwater explosion systematically and then geers and hunter 2002 proposed a model used for underwater explosion loads in the free field in the model the shock wave and the bubble pulsation are treated as two stages and the shock wave stage provides initial conditions to the bubble pulsation after that investigations on the dynamic behaviors of the underwater explosion bubble with different boundaries such as free surface cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2008b rigid boundary brujan et al 2002 cui et al 2016 klaseboer et al 2005 zhang et al 2008b elastic boundary brujan et al 2001a b klaseboer et al 2005 and elastic plastic boundary zhang et al 2008a were conducted at the same time dynamic responses of the structure subjected to the underwater explosion were studied the deformation and damage of simple structures such as circular plate and rectangular plate were studied experimentally and numerically ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 divided the failure modes of the thin rectangular plate subjected to the underwater explosion into four types based on the work of ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 zong et al 2013 calculated the deformation and rupture of a rectangular plate and a stiffened plate by using the acoustic structure coupling method and the numerical results were close to the experimental results of ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 however the researches mainly focused on the effect of the shock wave on the local deformation and damage of the structure in the near field underwater explosion and the deformation and damage of the structure induced by the underwater explosion bubble were studied rarely the interactions between the underwater explosion and the warship also had been studied by some scholars shin 2004 conducted a three dimensional analysis of a surface ship subjected to a far field underwater explosion by coupling ls dyna code with usa code and the numerical results agreed well with the experimental results of the surface ship zong et al 2013 studied the destruction process of a whole ship induced by a close in non contact underwater explosion the results indicated that the shock wave mainly results in local structural destruction besides the dynamic responses of a warship subjected to the underwater explosion bubble also had been studied zhang et al 2008a investigated the interactions between a surface ship and an underwater explosion bubble using the boundary element method bem combined with the finite element method fem the conclusions demonstrated that the underwater explosion bubble will pose a great threat to the deformation of the surface ship when the charge is detonated under the bottom of the surface ship since the structural characteristics are similar to the slender structure the warship was treated as a floating slender structure by some scholars gong and lam 2006 investigated the attenuation effects of the floating slender structure response to the underwater shock where the bulk cavitation induced by the shock wave was considered for the underwater explosion in the vicinity of the floating slender structure the floating slender structure can be damaged in a hog distortion mode with a plastic hinge at mid ship zhang et al 2015 when the charge weight is large enough and the underwater explosion bubble has a significant effect on the longitudinal strength of the slender structure in some conditions gong and khoo 2015 zhang et al 2008a besides chen et al 2009 investigated the dynamic responses of a floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion experimentally the results indicated that the effect of the shock wave on the floating slender structure can be reduced by the coating rubber but the whipping motion induced by the underwater explosion bubble pulsation cannot be reduced effectively therefore the effects of the underwater explosion bubble to the floating slender structure are not negligible in order to study the dynamic response of a floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble some experimental and numerical investigations were carried out zong 2005 discussed the features of the dynamic plastic response of a floating free free beam based on the assumption that the liquid is inviscid and incompressible in addition the motion of the free free beam was divided into three phases based on the experimental results wang et al 2014 analyzed the damage modes of a simplified floating slender structure after that wang et al 2016 calculated the shock wave load and the underwater explosion bubble loads using the simplified equations and empirical equations and proposed a semi analytical model to calculate the damage evolution of the simplified floating slender structure among the researches many numerical studies were based on empirical or theoretical equations and the non spherical feature of the underwater explosion bubble was not considered as a matter of fact the interactions between the underwater explosion bubble and the floating slender structure are strongly nonlinear and the non spherical motion of the underwater explosion bubble will change the pressure distribution in the flow field furthermore the shock wave load also has an effect on the initial dynamic response of the slender structure and then influences the dynamic behaviors of the underwater explosion bubble so the interactions between the underwater explosion bubble and the floating slender structure should be considered so far the deformation and damage mechanisms of the floating slender structure induced by the underwater explosion bubble are not completely clear in addition the global responses of a floating slender structure under various detonation distances and charge weights were researched little therefore it is significant to study the global response of a floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble considering the interactions of the shock wave the underwater explosion bubble and the floating slender structure the dynamic responses of a simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble were studied experimentally and numerically in this paper at first the experiments were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses of the simplified open floating slender structure in order to get more information on the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble the numerical study is conducted using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method by comparison the numerical results calculated by the cel method agree well with the experimental results subsequently a series of cases for different detonation distances and different charge weights are studied the dynamic responses of the simplified open floating structure in these cases are analyzed thoroughly and the deformation process of the underwater explosion bubble is also presented simultaneously 2 analytical methods the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method combines the advantages between the lagrange method and the euler method the lagrange method is usually utilized to describe the deformation of structure in the euler method the materials are allowed to flow across the element boundaries in a fixed mesh the cel method allows the interaction between eulerian field and lagrangian structure in the same model simulia 2011 therefore the cel method is used to calculate the interaction between the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble for detail explanation about the cel method there are many literatures aboshio and ye 2016 qiu et al 2011 simulia 2011 2 1 governing equations for fluids the fluids such as water and air are considered compressible in addition the viscosity of water is also considered in the numerical calculation the characteristics of the fluid are governed by governing equations such as the continuity equation the momentum equation and the energy equation in this paper the abaqus solver is utilized to solve the governing equations which are presented as follows the continuity equation for compressible fluid is written as follows moukalled et al 2015 1 ρ t ρ v 0 where ρ is the density of the fluid t is time and v u v w is the velocity vector of the fluid the momentum equation for the compressible fluid can be expressed as moukalled et al 2015 2 ρ v t ρ v v p τ f where f is the body force p is the pressure and τ is the viscous stress tensor for the newtonian fluid the momentum equation 2 can be expanded as moukalled et al 2015 3 ρ v t ρ v v μ v p μ v t λ v f where μ is the molecular viscosity coefficient λ is the bulk viscosity coefficient which is usually set equal to 2 3 μ i e λ 2 3 μ and superscript t is a transposed symbol the energy equation for specific total energy can be written as moukalled et al 2015 4 ρ e t ρ v e q s p v τ v f v q v where e represents the total energy per unit mass q s is the heat transfer rate per unit area and q v is the rate of heat source in this paper the underwater explosion process is considered as an adiabatic process and q s q v 0 2 2 equations of state for fluids the governing equations for three dimensional compressible fluid include six unknown variables such as ρ u v w p and e but the governing equations contain only five equations so the equation of state eos to describe the relation between pressure p and density ρ should be added there are many equations of state for one material therefore choosing a proper eos for a material is essential to the numerical simulation the equations of state used for the numerical calculation are presented in this subsection 2 2 1 equation of state for water the mie grüneisen equation of state is used for water

of the hugoniot pressure p h can be expressed as simulia 2011 7 p h ρ 0 c 0 2 η 1 s η 2 under the assumption that c 0 and s define a liner relationship between the shock velocity u s and the particle velocity u p i e u s c 0 s u p the linear u s u p hugoniot form of mie grüneisen equation is written as simulia 2011 8 p ρ 0 c 0 2 η 1 s η 2 1 γ 0 η 2 γ 0 ρ 0 e m where ρ 0 is the reference density c

referred in the numerical calculation the density ρ 0 of water is 1000 k g m 3 and the sound speed c 0 in water is 1450 m s 2 2 2 equation of state for air for the air the ideal gas equation of state is used simulia 2011 9 p p a ρ r θ θ z where ρ is the density of air which is 1 225 k g m 3 the ambient pressure p a is set as 101300 p a in the numerical calculation r is the gas constant θ is the current temperature and θ z is the temperature of absolute zero simulia 2011 2 2 3 equation of state for detonation products the jones wilkins lee or jwl equation of state is proposed by lee which is based on the previous work of jones and wilkin lee et al 1973 lee and hornig 1969 simulia 2011 in this equation pressure is function of density and internal energy in the numerical calculation the jwl equation of state is used for detonation products and the general form of the jwl equation of state is written as lee et al 1973 simulia 2011 10 p a 1 ω ρ r 1 ρ 0 exp r 1 ρ 0 ρ b 1 ω ρ r 2 ρ 0 exp r 2

2 3 material properties of the simplified open floating slender structure the material of the simplified open floating slender structure is q235 steel the density of q235 steel is 7850 k g m 3 the young s modulus is 2 1 10 11 p a and the poisson s ratio is 0 3 table 1 gives the strain rate dependent data used to describe the plastic characteristics of q235 steel and shown in fig 1 2 4 interface capturing in the numerical calculation based on the volume of fluid vof method the eulerian material volume fractions evf are calculated for material interface capturing the flow of the materials

sum formula ρ i 1 n ρ i c i liu 2014 miller et al 2013 3 experimental arrangements and results experimental arrangement for the simplified open floating structure subjected to the underwater explosion is described in this section as shown in fig 2 the experiments are conducted in a 2 m 2 m 2 m cubic water tank the material of the simplified open floating slender structure is q235 steel the underwater explosion bubble motion and the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure are captured by a high speed camera with frequency of 5000 frames per second the observation window is 0 4 m 0 7 m and shown in fig 2 fig 3 gives the structural form of the simplified open floating slender structure the size of the simplified open floating slender structure is 1 5 m 0 2 m 0 1 m and the thickness of the plate of the simplified open floating slender structure is 2 mm besides the simplified open floating slender structure consists of five compartments with length 0 3 m width 0 2 m and height 0 1 m in addition the depth of immersion of the simplified open floating slender structure is 0 08 m as shown in fig 4 the spherical charge is placed under the center of the simplified open floating slender structure the detonation distance h is defined as the distance from the center of spherical charge to the lower surface of the simplified open floating slender structure in order to analyze the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble two experimental cases are conducted table 2 presents the parameters for different underwater explosion experimental cases the dimensionless detonation distance in table 2 is also calculated by dividing by the maximum radius of the explosion bubble in the free field with the same water depth experimental results for case 1 and case 2 are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the underwater explosion bubble in the two cases has the similar motion due to the high pressure inside bubble the bubble expands at the beginning in the later stage of expansion a small part of the bubble is attached to the simplified open floating slender structure when the bubble reaches its maximum volume the pressure inside bubble is smaller than the ambient pressure and therefore the bubble begins to collapse owing to the sideway jet the bubble is split into two parts that a small part is located above and a main part is located below which indirectly illustrates that the repulsion of the free surface to the bubble is greater than the attraction of the simplified open floating slender structure to the bubble in the two cases subsequently two opposite water jets are formed along the vertical direction in case 1 the simplified open floating slender structure moves upward with the expansion of the bubble and then moves downward with the collapse of the bubble where the simplified open floating structure mainly has a rigid body motion and the elastic plastic deformation is not obvious as shown in fig 5 however the simplified open floating slender structure has a serious elastic plastic deformation along the longitudinal direction in case 2 where the simplified open floating slender structure appears a slight hogging deformation with the expansion of the bubble and then appears an obvious sagging deformation with the collapse of the bubble as shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows the final deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure in case 2 the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure can be split into two parts elastic deformation which results in the rebound motion of the simplified open floating slender structure and plastic deformation the plastic destruction is mainly located in the side shell of the middle compartment of the simplified open floating slender structure which would lead to survivability loss of the real marine structures for other parts there are no obvious plastic deformations therefore the most easily damaged part is the middle part of the simplified open floating slender structure when the charge is detonated under the simplified open floating slender structure the different deformation characteristics between case 1 and case 2 show that the underwater explosion bubbles induced by different charge weights with different detonation distances have different effects on the longitudinal strength of the simplified open floating slender structure at the same time the experimental results illustrate that the longitudinal strength of the simplified open floating structure will be destroyed under certain conditions 4 validation of the numerical method two experiments for different detonation conditions have been conducted in section 3 where the underwater explosion bubble motion and the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure are analyzed due to the limited experimental cases some characteristics for the interaction between the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble are still very unclear such as the deformation size the mises stress the moment and the maximum peeq equivalent plastic strain in order to obtain more information about the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure induced by the underwater explosion bubble a series of numerical calculations for different charge weights and detonation distances will be conducted for further discussion before discuss the dynamic responses of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the various underwater explosions a validation for the cel method is firstly conducted by the experimental results as shown in fig 8 the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble motion in experiment and numerical calculation are presented simultaneously the initial condition and boundary condition of the numerical calculation are the same as the experimental case 2 in table 2 the computational parameters used in this section and next section are briefly presented in table 3 in fig 8 the pictures at left side denote the experimental results which are captured by a high speed camera and the right pictures denote the numerical results calculated by the cel method in addition the stress contours of the side shell are presented in fig 8 which is beneficial to understand the deformation process of the simplified open floating slender structure in fig 8 a the initial conditions in experiment and numerical simulation are manifested after the charge is detonated the shock wave is generated first which results in the initial motion of the simplified open floating slender structure at that time the explosion products of the charge are converted to a gas bubble since the internal bubble pressure is higher than the ambient pressure the bubble begins to expand cole and weller 1948 the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure is directly related to the atmospheric pressure the initial shock wave and the pulsation pressure induced by the bubble except for the difference in pressure amplitude the pulsation pressure with time has the similar trend as the internal pressure of bubble before analyzing the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure it is necessary to understand the trend of the internal pressure of bubble pulsation pressure at the initial time there is a high pressure inside the underwater explosion bubble subsequently with the bubble expanding the internal pressure decreases gradually when the bubble reaches its maximum volume the internal pressure can be reduced to several thousand pa with the bubble collapse the internal pressure begins to increase gradually and reaches the maximum at the minimum bubble volume at the early expansion stage of underwater explosion bubble since the shock wave and the pulsation pressure acting on the bottom plate are larger than the atmospheric pressure above the simplified open floating slender structure appears a hogging deformation as shown in fig 8 b due to the hogging deformation the stress in the middle region of the simplified open floating slender structure is larger than other regions subsequently the upside of the bubble is close to the simplified open floating slender structure owing to the effect of the simplified open floating slender structure the upside of the bubble becomes little flat as shown in fig 8 c meanwhile because the pulsation pressure acting on the simplified open floating slender structure reduces with the expansion of the bubble the simplified open floating slender structure has rebounded owing to the restoring force as the bubble expands the bubble shape is not spherical anymore and a sunken deformation of the bubble occurs near the bottom plate of the simplified open floating slender structure as shown in fig 8 d and e due to the rebound motion of the simplified open floating slender structure the buckling deformation occurs at the side shells of the simplified open floating slender structure after reaches its maximum volume the bubble begins to collapse near the maximum volume of the bubble the pulsation pressure in liquid is much less than the atmospheric pressure above and therefore the difference of pressure acting on the upper and lower surface of the bottom plate of the simplified open floating slender structure is relatively large so a sagging deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure occurs with rebounding as shown in fig 8 f meanwhile the buckling deformation at the side shells becomes more obvious owing to the effects of the simplified open floating slender structure and the free surface the bubble collapse form shown in fig 8 f is different from that in the free field based on the previous work of blake et al 1986 blake et al 1987 and brujan et al 2001a that bubble assumes a mushroom like shape here is the result of the combined action of the free surface the buoyancy force and the simplified open floating slender structure in fig 8 f the repulsion of the free surface to the bubble plays a dominant role so an annular sideway jet close to the top of the bubble is formed subsequently the bubble is split into two sub bubbles by the annular sideway jets and the two sub bubbles collapse toward different directions the upper sub bubble generates a water jet directed toward the simplified open floating slender structure and the lower sub bubble generates a water jet directed away from the simplified open floating slender structure as shown in fig 8 g at the same time the sagging deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure with a plastic hinge reaches the maximum value owing to the inertia force after the bubble reaches its minimum volume the two sub bubbles with irregular shape begin to rebound as shown in fig 8 h meanwhile the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure also begins to rebound due to the restoring force and the bubble pulsation force fig 9 presents the schematic diagram of the physical quantity definition as shown in fig 9 a in order to obtain the displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure the origin is set at the middle of the bottom edge of the simplified open floating slender structure when the charge is not detonated besides the effective bubble radius is defined as r e f f a 2 b 2 2 and the definition of the bubble radius parameters a and b is presented in fig 9 b fig 10 gives the comparison of experimental results and numerical results fig 10 a gives the evolution of the vertical displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure and fig 10 b gives the evolution of the effective bubble radius as shown in fig 10 a except for some little difference in displacement amplitude the vertical displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure in numerical results has similar trend as that in experiment the main reason for the difference of vertical displacement fig 10 a between experimental results and numerical results is as follows during the experiment in order to prevent the simplified open floating slender structure from overturning flexible ropes are used at both ends of the structure for auxiliary positioning which may affect the displacement of the simplified open floating slender structure so the vertical displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure in numerical results is not exactly equal to that in experiment based on the above analysis the differences of vertical displacement between the experimental results and the numerical results in fig 10 a are acceptable besides the comparison of effective bubble radius between experimental and numerical results is conducted as shown in fig 10 b the trend and the amplitude of the effective bubble radius in the numerical results are in good agreement with the effective bubble radius in experiment so far some characteristics for the interaction between the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble in experimental and numerical results have been investigated and compared such as the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure fig 8 the bubble shapes fig 8 the vertical displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure fig 10 a and the effective bubble radius fig 10 b in summary the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results so the cel method can calculate the interaction between the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble well next the more detailed analysis for the results in fig 8 will be conducted as shown in fig 8 c and d a phenomenon can be observed that the deformation mode of the simplified open floating slender structure has a transformation from hogging to sagging with bubble collapse the displacements of the simplified open floating slender structure along the longitudinal direction at some typical moments are presented in fig 11 the simplified open floating structure has a hogging motion firstly and then rebounds while moving as a whole due to the restoring force as shown in fig 11 a finally with the bubble collapse the start time is about t 25 ms the sagging motion of the simplified open floating slender structure becomes more obvious which continues developing until the bubble reaches its minimum volume fig 8 g and t 52 ms in fig 11 b the deformations of the simplified open floating slender structure from hogging to sagging at different times are presented it can be seen that the change of deformation type happens during the bubble expansion and only one transition occurs between hogging and sagging in the time interval 11 ms 25 ms the reason is that the middle part of the simplified open floating slender structure becomes large under the effects of the shock wave and the bubble pulsation pressure at initial stage when the effect of the bubble pulsation pressure decreases the simplified open floating slender structure rebounds due to the restoring force and the atmospheric pressure subsequently due to the inertia and the atmospheric pressure the sagging deformation occurs during the global upward motion of the simplified open floating slender structure fig 12 presents the local deformation of the side shells the side shells in the middle part of the simplified open floating slender structure have a little deformation in the hogging process then the side shells appear slight buckling due to the rebounding motion of the simplified open floating slender structure as shown in fig 12 b d even though the buckling is slight it will reduce the strength of the middle part during the sagging motion subsequently the obvious buckling occurs in the side shells when the bubble begins to collapse as shown in fig 12 e with the bubble collapse the buckling deformation becomes more and more obvious as shown in fig 12 f 5 research on effect of different parameters underwater explosion loads consist of the shock wave and the bubble loads the shock wave has the characteristics of high frequency and high peak pressure which usually will result in the local structural deformation on the contrary the underwater explosion bubble pulsation is characterized by low frequency which has an effect on the longitudinal strength of the slender structure generally liu et al 2018 for the cases in this paper because the charge is not close to the simplified open floating slender structure and the charge weights are not very large the local deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure caused by the shock wave is not obvious the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure is mainly induced by the underwater explosion bubble therefore the interactions between the underwater explosion bubble and the simplified open floating slender structure are mainly investigated in this section the underwater explosion cases for further investigation are presented in table 4 5 1 cases for different detonation distances the effect of the detonation distance on the dynamic response of the simplified open floating slender structure is investigated in this section fig 13 gives the numerical results in case 2 the bubble shape and the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure at different times in case 2 are almost similar to that in case 1 however due to larger detonation distance in case 2 the sunken deformation at the top of the bubble almost disappears and the upper sub bubble split from the main bubble is also smaller than that in case 1 fig 14 and fig 15 present the numerical results in case 3 and case 4 respectively including bubble shapes the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure and the stress distribution of the side shells since the obstruction effect of the simplified open floating slender structure on the bubble motion decreases the bubble maintains spherical shape approximately in the expansion process during the collapse stage the bubbles in the two cases are not split finally which is different from the phenomenon observed in case 1 and case 2 the reason is that the attraction of the simplified open floating slender structure to the bubble reduces with the increase of the detonation distance in addition for larger detonation distance the rebounding and sagging motions of the simplified open floating slender structure during the bubble expansion become weak so there is no obvious buckling deformation in the middle part of the side shells therefore when the detonation distance is large the underwater explosion bubble has less effect on the longitudinal strength of the simplified open floating slender structure and the simplified open floating slender structure mainly has a whipping motion with no obvious local structural deformation fig 16 presents the comparison of displacement distribution in different cases as shown in fig 16 a the deformations in different cases mainly occur in the middle of the simplified open floating slender structure and the displacements at the ends of the simplified open floating slender structure in different cases are almost equal when the simplified open floating slender structure is still in hogging stage in case 1 the simplified open floating slender structure in other cases have entered the sagging stage as shown in fig 16 b the reason is that the power of the shock wave and the bubble pulsation pressure is stronger in case 1 than other cases so the duration for the hogging motion of the simplified open floating structure in case 1 is longer subsequently except that the simplified open floating slender structure in case 4 has a little deformation while moving as a whole the sagging deformation of the simplified open floating structure in cases 1 3 increases as shown in fig 16 c owing to the inertia the simplified open floating slender structure in different cases continues moving upward as shown in fig 16 d after the displacement of the simplified open floating slender structure in different cases reaches the maximum the simplified open floating slender structure begins to fall back the simplified open floating slender structure in cases 3 and 4 keeps moving as a whole without obvious deformation until falls back to its initial position however the simplified open floating slender structure in cases 1 and 2 with the sagging deformation continues moving downward with bubble collapse as shown in fig 16 e and f in summary for larger detonation distances the simplified open floating slender structure has a whipping motion first and then has a rigid body motion without obvious deformation in the side shells on the contrary for smaller detonation distances the simplified open floating slender structure has a serious sagging deformation with buckling in the side shells during the bubble collapse in order to know more about the deformation mechanism of the simplified open floating slender structure some observation points are set to obtain the mises stress and the strain as shown in fig 17 the observation points p1 p11 are located in the center line of the bottom of the simplified open floating slender structure the points p12 and p13 are placed at the bottom and top of the side shell in the middle section of the simplified open floating slender structure respectively specifically the spacing d of the observation point in fig 17 is 0 15 m fig 18 presents the mises stress evolutions at the same observation point in different cases in general the mises stress at p6 increases with the decrease of the detonation distance as shown in fig 18 a the mises stress in case 1 and case 2 increases gradually with the increase of the sagging deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure the sagging deformation in cases 3 and 4 is not too obvious when the simplified open floating slender structure falls back to its initial position so the increase of the mises stress in case 3 and case 4 is not obvious but a maximum mises stress occurs in the four cases when the simplified open floating slender structure reaches the maximum downward displacement at time 55 ms approximately the mises stress in cases 1 and 2 reaches the maximum value again due to the water jet impacting on the bottom plate as shown in fig 18 b with the increase of the sagging deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure the increase phenomenon of the mises stress at p4 disappears in case 1 and case 2 because the large deformation mainly appears in the middle region of the simplified open floating structure at the same time the stress between 50 ms and 60 ms at p4 in cases 3 and 4 is close to that in cases 1 and 2 in fig 18 c the mises stress at p2 in cases 3 and 4 is approximate to that in cases 1 and 2 during the first bubble pulsation period which indicates that the mises stress at the ends of the simplified open floating slender structure is influenced slightly by the detonation distance however the different tendency of the mises stress occurs at the beginning of the secondary pulsation of the underwater explosion bubble at time 57 ms approximately this is because the simplified open floating slender structure in cases 1 and 2 is still in the sagging motion state but in cases 3 and 4 the simplified open floating slender structure has another hogging motion due to the bubble expansion in fig 18 d the evolution tendencies of stress in cases 1 and 2 are similar the abrupt decrease and increase at 10 ms and 20 ms are induced by the vibration of the side shells described in fig 12 the tendency in case 3 is similar to cases 1 and 2 until t 20 ms however the evolution tendency of stress in case 4 is similar to cases 1 and 2 only before t 10 ms the decrease of the mises stress at p13 in cases 1 and 2 at approximately 52 ms is induced by the water jet and the rebounding of the simplified open floating structure and the increase in cases 3 and 4 is resulted from the secondary bubble expansion 5 2 cases for different charge weights the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure for different charge weights are investigated in this subsection fig 19 presents the overall deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble shape in different cases when the water jet penetrates the underwater explosion bubble depending on the charge weight there are mainly two deformation forms including the whipping motion and the damage in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge generated in the middle of the simplified open floating slender structure in addition for the cases where the simplified open floating slender structure has large deformation the bubble is split into two sub bubbles in the two sub bubbles the upper jet is directed toward the simplified open floating slender structure and the other is away from the simplified open floating slender structure as shown in fig 20 in order to estimate the overall deformation degree of the simplified open floating slender structure displacements related to two observation points p m and p e are compared in the following the points p m and p e are located in the center and the end of the side edge the edge marked in red in fig 20 respectively the displacements of p m and p e are represented by d m and d e respectively in addition the displacement difference between the two observation points δ d d m d e is defined whether the simplified open floating slender structure is in hogging motion state or in sagging motion state can be determined from the positive or negative values of δ d the larger the displacement difference is the more serious the deformation is for different cases the trends of the displacement d m with time are similar where the displacement increases first with the bubble expansion and then decreases with the bubble collapse in a bubble pulsation period however the trends of δ d with time are different fig 21 gives the displacement evolutions in different cases for different charge weights the evolution of the displacement difference δ d has different characteristics according to the response of the simplified open floating slender structure there are three types of the changing trends of δ d corresponding to three deformation features the first deformation feature is whipping motion as shown in fig 21 a the curve of δ d oscillates up and down with time near zero during bubble pulsation period and the amplitude of δ d is in the order of o 10 3 which indicates that the simplified open floating slender structure mainly has the whipping motion the second deformation feature is the incomplete secondary rebounding motion after the sagging deformation reaches the first extreme value as shown in fig 21 b d the duration of the sagging deformation is longer than that of the hogging deformation besides the rebounding motion of the simplified open floating slender structure at 16 ms approximately indicates that the whipping motion of the simplified open floating slender structure becomes weaker with charge weight increases due to the increase of the charge weight the attraction of the bubble to the simplified open floating slender structure becomes strong therefore the rebounding motion doesn t cause the simplified open floating slender structure to deform in a hogging mode again but the sagging deformation increased again as the bubble collapse in the time interval of 28 ms 40 ms the third deformation feature is that the simplified open floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode as shown in fig 21 e f the dynamic behaviors of the simplified open floating slender structure with time are similar when the charge weight is greater than a critical value at the initial stage the simplified open floating slender structure has the hogging motion due to the shock wave and the bubble expansion and then the simplified open floating slender structure has serious sagging motion with a plastic hinge as the bubble collapse in summary when the charge weight is small the whipping motion of the simplified open floating slender structure is dominated with the increase of the charge weight the deformation mode of the simplified open floating slender structure converts from a whipping motion to a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge in the middle of the simplified open floating slender structure the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure are associated with the moment so the moment in the middle section of the simplified open floating slender structure with time in different cases are presented in fig 22 the moments with time in cases 5 and 9 are similar to the evolution of δ d in fig 21 a and d respectively in case 5 the moment with time is similar to the sinusoidal function so the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure is mainly dominated by the whipping motion in case 9 owing to the increase of the charge weight the moment is strengthened so the sagging deformation becomes serious and the rebounding motion becomes weak as shown in fig 21 d besides the moment changes smooth and steady with the bubble collapse in case 11 however the magnitude of the moment during the sagging motion in case 11 is smaller than that in cases 5 and 9 because the strength of the middle section of the simplified open floating slender structure in case 11 is reduced by the buckling deformation of the side shells mentioned in section 4 fig 23 gives the maximum relative displacements of the simplified open floating slender structure δ d max in the hogging and sagging process during the first bubble pulsation period for different charge weights the maximum relative displacement in the hogging and sagging process increases with the increase of the charge weight however the increase rates in the hogging and sagging process are different the increase rate of the maximum relative displacement in the two processes is similar for small charge weight as the charge weight increases the maximum relative displacement increase steadily in addition the value of the maximum relative displacement in the hogging process and the sagging process is approximate to each other in a charge weight interval of 0 002 kg 0 008 kg at that time the attraction of the bubble to the simplified open floating slander structure is not obvious however when the charge weight beyond a critical value in present work the critical value is 0 008 kg the maximum relative displacement in the sagging process increases rapidly but the maximum relative displacement in the hogging process remains at a low growth rate it can be concluded that in the cases within a certain detonation distance as the charge weight increases the impact of bubble collapse on the simplified open floating slender structure becomes obvious and the sagging deformation is much larger than the hogging deformation in the cases the maximum peeq equivalent plastic strain is mainly located in the side shells fig 24 gives the maximum peeq in the side shells of the simplified open floating slender structure during the first bubble pulsation period as shown in fig 24 the maximum peeq increases with the increase of the charge weight however the increase tendency of the maximum peeq for different charge weights can be split into three regions the region where the charge weight is smaller than 0 006 kg is defined as the first region where the whipping motion of the simplified open floating slender structure is dominated the region where the charge weight is in the range of 0 006 kg 0 010 kg is defined as the second region where the maximum peeq increases sharply besides the deformation mode of the simplified open floating slender structure transforms from the whipping motion to the damage in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge the region where the charge weight is larger than 0 010 kg is defined as the third region where the simplified open floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge 6 conclusions in order to investigate the dynamic response of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble the experimental and numerical investigations were carried out in addition a series of cases for different detonation distances and different charge weights were conducted using coupled eulerian lagrangian method to get more information of the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 there are mainly two deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure in the cases of this paper for large detonation distance or small charge weight the simplified open floating slender structure mainly has a whipping motion when the charge weight increases or the detonation distance decreases to a critical value due to the combine action of the pressure difference pressure difference between atmospheric pressure and bubble pulsation pressure and the redounding motion the simplified open floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge generated in the middle of the simplified open floating slender structure 2 for the cases where the simplified open floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with plastic hinge due to the combined action of the free surface the buoyancy force and the simplified open floating slender structure the bubble displays a mushroom like shape besides with bubble collapsing the bubble is split into two sub bubbles by the annular sideway jets and the two sub bubbles collapse toward opposite directions 3 the stress in the middle of the structure for different detonation distances is different but there is little difference in the ends of the structure therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the explosion bubble has more effect on the response of the middle part of the structure and the smaller the detonation distance is the larger the stress is 4 the motion of the simplified open floating slender structure can be divided into three regions for different charge weights in this paper the deformation characteristics such as evolution of displacement moment in the middle cross section and maximum peeq are quite different in different regions in the first region the slender structure mainly has a whipping motion the second region is a transition region where the motion of the slender structure converts from whipping motion to sagging damage in a longitudinal bending mode in the third region the slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with plastic hinge credit authorship contribution statement n gan methodology

21254,a simplified open floating slender structure is used to investigate the dynamic behaviors of the warship in this paper the deformation and damage mechanisms of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion are studied using the experiment and the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method firstly a validation for the cel method is carried out where the numerical results agree well with the results in experiment subsequently in order to analyze the deformation and damage characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion a series of cases for different detonation distances and different charge weights are carried out in the cases the results indicate that the deformation and damage of the simplified open floating slender structure are mainly induced by the bubble and the damage induced by the shock wave is not obvious for small charge weight and large detonation distance the whipping motion is the main deformation form of the simplified open floating slender structure when the charge weight increases or the detonation distance decreases to a critical value the simplified floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge generated in the middle region keywords underwater explosion bubble simplified open floating slender structure whipping motion plastic hinge coupled eulerian lagrangian method 1 introduction the warship may be subjected to underwater explosion in the war for the underwater explosion in the vicinity of the warship the shock wave usually will cause local deformation and damage to the warship zhang et al 2015 after the shock wave propagates around the following explosion bubble pulsation will result in the whipping motion and overall damage of the warship due to its low frequency feature vernon 1986 zhang and zong 2011 besides a high speed water jet will be formed toward the structure during the bubble collapse stage which will also cause local deformation and damage to the warship structure the interactions between the warship and the underwater explosion had been studied for many years but the deformation and damage mechanisms of the warship subjected to the underwater explosion bubble are not completely clear so far the warship has the similar structural characteristics to the slender structure so researches on the dynamic responses of the slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble are beneficial for understanding the deformation and damage mechanisms of the warship therefore the dynamic responses of a simplified floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble are studied in this paper at the beginning studies on the underwater explosion mainly focus on the explosion phenomena and the load characteristics cole 1948 geers and hunter 2002 based on the previous studies cole 1948 summarized the phenomena of the underwater explosion systematically and then geers and hunter 2002 proposed a model used for underwater explosion loads in the free field in the model the shock wave and the bubble pulsation are treated as two stages and the shock wave stage provides initial conditions to the bubble pulsation after that investigations on the dynamic behaviors of the underwater explosion bubble with different boundaries such as free surface cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2008b rigid boundary brujan et al 2002 cui et al 2016 klaseboer et al 2005 zhang et al 2008b elastic boundary brujan et al 2001a b klaseboer et al 2005 and elastic plastic boundary zhang et al 2008a were conducted at the same time dynamic responses of the structure subjected to the underwater explosion were studied the deformation and damage of simple structures such as circular plate and rectangular plate were studied experimentally and numerically ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 divided the failure modes of the thin rectangular plate subjected to the underwater explosion into four types based on the work of ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 zong et al 2013 calculated the deformation and rupture of a rectangular plate and a stiffened plate by using the acoustic structure coupling method and the numerical results were close to the experimental results of ramajeyathilagam and vendhan 2004 however the researches mainly focused on the effect of the shock wave on the local deformation and damage of the structure in the near field underwater explosion and the deformation and damage of the structure induced by the underwater explosion bubble were studied rarely the interactions between the underwater explosion and the warship also had been studied by some scholars shin 2004 conducted a three dimensional analysis of a surface ship subjected to a far field underwater explosion by coupling ls dyna code with usa code and the numerical results agreed well with the experimental results of the surface ship zong et al 2013 studied the destruction process of a whole ship induced by a close in non contact underwater explosion the results indicated that the shock wave mainly results in local structural destruction besides the dynamic responses of a warship subjected to the underwater explosion bubble also had been studied zhang et al 2008a investigated the interactions between a surface ship and an underwater explosion bubble using the boundary element method bem combined with the finite element method fem the conclusions demonstrated that the underwater explosion bubble will pose a great threat to the deformation of the surface ship when the charge is detonated under the bottom of the surface ship since the structural characteristics are similar to the slender structure the warship was treated as a floating slender structure by some scholars gong and lam 2006 investigated the attenuation effects of the floating slender structure response to the underwater shock where the bulk cavitation induced by the shock wave was considered for the underwater explosion in the vicinity of the floating slender structure the floating slender structure can be damaged in a hog distortion mode with a plastic hinge at mid ship zhang et al 2015 when the charge weight is large enough and the underwater explosion bubble has a significant effect on the longitudinal strength of the slender structure in some conditions gong and khoo 2015 zhang et al 2008a besides chen et al 2009 investigated the dynamic responses of a floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion experimentally the results indicated that the effect of the shock wave on the floating slender structure can be reduced by the coating rubber but the whipping motion induced by the underwater explosion bubble pulsation cannot be reduced effectively therefore the effects of the underwater explosion bubble to the floating slender structure are not negligible in order to study the dynamic response of a floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble some experimental and numerical investigations were carried out zong 2005 discussed the features of the dynamic plastic response of a floating free free beam based on the assumption that the liquid is inviscid and incompressible in addition the motion of the free free beam was divided into three phases based on the experimental results wang et al 2014 analyzed the damage modes of a simplified floating slender structure after that wang et al 2016 calculated the shock wave load and the underwater explosion bubble loads using the simplified equations and empirical equations and proposed a semi analytical model to calculate the damage evolution of the simplified floating slender structure among the researches many numerical studies were based on empirical or theoretical equations and the non spherical feature of the underwater explosion bubble was not considered as a matter of fact the interactions between the underwater explosion bubble and the floating slender structure are strongly nonlinear and the non spherical motion of the underwater explosion bubble will change the pressure distribution in the flow field furthermore the shock wave load also has an effect on the initial dynamic response of the slender structure and then influences the dynamic behaviors of the underwater explosion bubble so the interactions between the underwater explosion bubble and the floating slender structure should be considered so far the deformation and damage mechanisms of the floating slender structure induced by the underwater explosion bubble are not completely clear in addition the global responses of a floating slender structure under various detonation distances and charge weights were researched little therefore it is significant to study the global response of a floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble considering the interactions of the shock wave the underwater explosion bubble and the floating slender structure the dynamic responses of a simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble were studied experimentally and numerically in this paper at first the experiments were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses of the simplified open floating slender structure in order to get more information on the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble the numerical study is conducted using the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method by comparison the numerical results calculated by the cel method agree well with the experimental results subsequently a series of cases for different detonation distances and different charge weights are studied the dynamic responses of the simplified open floating structure in these cases are analyzed thoroughly and the deformation process of the underwater explosion bubble is also presented simultaneously 2 analytical methods the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel method combines the advantages between the lagrange method and the euler method the lagrange method is usually utilized to describe the deformation of structure in the euler method the materials are allowed to flow across the element boundaries in a fixed mesh the cel method allows the interaction between eulerian field and lagrangian structure in the same model simulia 2011 therefore the cel method is used to calculate the interaction between the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble for detail explanation about the cel method there are many literatures aboshio and ye 2016 qiu et al 2011 simulia 2011 2 1 governing equations for fluids the fluids such as water and air are considered compressible in addition the viscosity of water is also considered in the numerical calculation the characteristics of the fluid are governed by governing equations such as the continuity equation the momentum equation and the energy equation in this paper the abaqus solver is utilized to solve the governing equations which are presented as follows the continuity equation for compressible fluid is written as follows moukalled et al 2015 1 ρ t ρ v 0 where ρ is the density of the fluid t is time and v u v w is the velocity vector of the fluid the momentum equation for the compressible fluid can be expressed as moukalled et al 2015 2 ρ v t ρ v v p τ f where f is the body force p is the pressure and τ is the viscous stress tensor for the newtonian fluid the momentum equation 2 can be expanded as moukalled et al 2015 3 ρ v t ρ v v μ v p μ v t λ v f where μ is the molecular viscosity coefficient λ is the bulk viscosity coefficient which is usually set equal to 2 3 μ i e λ 2 3 μ and superscript t is a transposed symbol the energy equation for specific total energy can be written as moukalled et al 2015 4 ρ e t ρ v e q s p v τ v f v q v where e represents the total energy per unit mass q s is the heat transfer rate per unit area and q v is the rate of heat source in this paper the underwater explosion process is considered as an adiabatic process and q s q v 0 2 2 equations of state for fluids the governing equations for three dimensional compressible fluid include six unknown variables such as ρ u v w p and e but the governing equations contain only five equations so the equation of state eos to describe the relation between pressure p and density ρ should be added there are many equations of state for one material therefore choosing a proper eos for a material is essential to the numerical simulation the equations of state used for the numerical calculation are presented in this subsection 2 2 1 equation of state for water the mie grüneisen equation of state is used for water simulia 2011 the equation of state is assumed that the pressure is a function of the density and the internal energy of unit mass the most common form of the mie grüneisen equation is written as

of the hugoniot pressure p h can be expressed as simulia 2011 7 p h ρ 0 c 0 2 η 1 s η 2 under the assumption that c 0 and s define a liner relationship between the shock velocity u s and the particle velocity u p i e u s c 0 s u p the linear u s u p hugoniot form of mie grüneisen equation is written as simulia 2011 8 p ρ 0 c 0 2 η 1 s η 2 1 γ 0 η 2 γ 0 ρ 0 e m where ρ 0 is the reference density c

referred in the numerical calculation the density ρ 0 of water is 1000 k g m 3 and the sound speed c 0 in water is 1450 m s 2 2 2 equation of state for air for the air the ideal gas equation of state

current temperature and θ z is the temperature of absolute zero simulia 2011 2 2 3 equation of state for detonation products the jones wilkins lee or jwl equation of state is proposed by lee which is based on the previous work of jones and wilkin lee et al 1973 lee and hornig 1969 simulia 2011 in this equation pressure is function of density and internal energy in the numerical calculation the jwl equation of state is used for detonation products and the general form of the jwl equation of state is written as lee et al 1973 simulia 2011 10 p a 1 ω ρ r 1 ρ 0 exp r 1 ρ 0 ρ b 1 ω ρ r 2 ρ 0 exp r 2

2 3 material properties of the simplified open floating slender structure the material of the simplified open floating slender structure is q235 steel the density of q235 steel is 7850 k g m 3 the young s modulus is 2 1 10 11 p a and the poisson s ratio is 0 3 table 1 gives the strain rate dependent data used to describe the plastic characteristics of q235 steel and shown in fig 1 2 4 interface capturing in the numerical calculation based on the volume of fluid vof method the eulerian material volume fractions evf are calculated for material interface capturing the flow of the materials between eulerian elements is described by the volume fraction equation miller et al 2013 11 ρ i c i t ρ i c i v 0 where i 1 n c i 1 n is the number of materials in an element in the volume fraction equation 11 c i is the volume fraction in an element of a certain material a volume fraction value of one indicates that the element is full of the specified material and a volume fraction value of

one simulia 2011 besides for each element properties can be calculated using the volume fraction of all fluid materials in the element for example the density of an element ρ can be calculated using a sum formula ρ i 1 n ρ i c i liu 2014 miller et al 2013 3 experimental arrangements and results experimental arrangement for the simplified open floating structure subjected to the underwater explosion is described in this section as shown in fig 2 the experiments are conducted in a 2 m 2 m 2 m cubic water tank the material of the simplified open floating slender structure is q235 steel the underwater explosion bubble motion and the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure are captured by a high speed camera with frequency of 5000 frames per second the observation window is 0 4 m 0 7 m and shown in fig 2 fig 3 gives the structural form of the simplified open floating slender structure the size of the simplified open floating slender structure is 1 5 m 0 2 m 0 1 m and the thickness of the plate of the simplified open floating slender structure is 2 mm besides the simplified open floating slender structure consists of five compartments with length 0 3 m width 0 2 m and height 0 1 m in addition the depth of immersion of the simplified open floating slender structure is 0 08 m as shown in fig 4 the spherical charge is placed under the center of the simplified open floating slender structure the detonation distance h is defined as the distance from the center of spherical charge to the lower surface of the simplified open floating slender structure in order to analyze the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble two experimental cases are conducted table 2 presents the parameters for different underwater explosion experimental cases the dimensionless detonation distance in table 2 is also calculated by dividing by the maximum radius of the explosion bubble in the free field with the same water depth experimental results for case 1 and case 2 are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the underwater explosion bubble in the two cases has the similar motion due to the high pressure inside bubble the bubble expands at the beginning in the later stage of expansion a small part of the bubble is attached to the simplified open floating slender structure when the bubble reaches its maximum volume the pressure inside bubble is smaller than the ambient pressure and therefore the bubble begins to collapse owing to the sideway jet the bubble is split into two parts that a small part is located above and a main part is located below which indirectly illustrates that the repulsion of the free surface to the bubble is greater than the attraction of the simplified open floating slender structure to the bubble in the two cases subsequently two opposite water jets are formed along the vertical direction in case 1 the simplified open floating slender structure moves upward with the expansion of the bubble and then moves downward with the collapse of the bubble where the simplified open floating structure mainly has a rigid body motion and the elastic plastic deformation is not obvious as shown in fig 5 however the simplified open floating slender structure has a serious elastic plastic deformation along the longitudinal direction in case 2 where the simplified open floating slender structure appears a slight hogging deformation with the expansion of the bubble and then appears an obvious sagging deformation with the collapse of the bubble as shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows the final deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure in case 2 the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure can be split into two parts elastic deformation which results in the rebound motion of the simplified open floating slender structure and plastic deformation the plastic destruction is mainly located in the side shell of the middle compartment of the simplified open floating slender structure which would lead to survivability loss of the real marine structures for other parts there are no obvious plastic deformations therefore the most easily damaged part is the middle part of the simplified open floating slender structure when the charge is detonated under the simplified open floating slender structure the different deformation characteristics between case 1 and case 2 show that the underwater explosion bubbles induced by different charge weights with different detonation distances have different effects on the longitudinal strength of the simplified open floating slender structure at the same time the experimental results illustrate that the longitudinal strength of the simplified open floating structure will be destroyed under certain conditions 4 validation of the numerical method two experiments for different detonation conditions have been conducted in section 3 where the underwater explosion bubble motion and the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure are analyzed due to the limited experimental cases some characteristics for the interaction between the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble are still very unclear such as the deformation size the mises stress the moment and the maximum peeq equivalent plastic strain in order to obtain more information about the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure induced by the underwater explosion bubble a series of numerical calculations for different charge weights and detonation distances will be conducted for further discussion before discuss the dynamic responses of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the various underwater explosions a validation for the cel method is firstly conducted by the experimental results as shown in fig 8 the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble motion in experiment and numerical calculation are presented simultaneously the initial condition and boundary condition of the numerical calculation are the same as the experimental case 2 in table 2 the computational parameters used in this section and next section are briefly presented in table 3 in fig 8 the pictures at left side denote the experimental results which are captured by a high speed camera and the right pictures denote the numerical results calculated by the cel method in addition the stress contours of the side shell are presented in fig 8 which is beneficial to understand the deformation process of the simplified open floating slender structure in fig 8 a the initial conditions in experiment and numerical simulation are manifested after the charge is detonated the shock wave is generated first which results in the initial motion of the simplified open floating slender structure at that time the explosion products of the charge are converted to a gas bubble since the internal bubble pressure is higher than the ambient pressure the bubble begins to expand cole and weller 1948 the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure is directly related to the atmospheric pressure the initial shock wave and the pulsation pressure induced by the bubble except for the difference in pressure amplitude the pulsation pressure with time has the similar trend as the internal pressure of bubble before analyzing the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure it is necessary to understand the trend of the internal pressure of bubble pulsation pressure at the initial time there is a high pressure inside the underwater explosion bubble subsequently with the bubble expanding the internal pressure decreases gradually when the bubble reaches its maximum volume the internal pressure can be reduced to several thousand pa with the bubble collapse the internal pressure begins to increase gradually and reaches the maximum at the minimum bubble volume at the early expansion stage of underwater explosion bubble since the shock wave and the pulsation pressure acting on the bottom plate are larger than the atmospheric pressure above the simplified open floating slender structure appears a hogging deformation as shown in fig 8 b due to the hogging deformation the stress in the middle region of the simplified open floating slender structure is larger than other regions subsequently the upside of the bubble is close to the simplified open floating slender structure owing to the effect of the simplified open floating slender structure the upside of the bubble becomes little flat as shown in fig 8 c meanwhile because the pulsation pressure acting on the simplified open floating slender structure reduces with the expansion of the bubble the simplified open floating slender structure has rebounded owing to the restoring force as the bubble expands the bubble shape is not spherical anymore and a sunken deformation of the bubble occurs near the bottom plate of the simplified open floating slender structure as shown in fig 8 d and e due to the rebound motion of the simplified open floating slender structure the buckling deformation occurs at the side shells of the simplified open floating slender structure after reaches its maximum volume the bubble begins to collapse near the maximum volume of the bubble the pulsation pressure in liquid is much less than the atmospheric pressure above and therefore the difference of pressure acting on the upper and lower surface of the bottom plate of the simplified open floating slender structure is relatively large so a sagging deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure occurs with rebounding as shown in fig 8 f meanwhile the buckling deformation at the side shells becomes more obvious owing to the effects of the simplified open floating slender structure and the free surface the bubble collapse form shown in fig 8 f is different from that in the free field based on the previous work of blake et al 1986 blake et al 1987 and brujan et al 2001a that bubble assumes a mushroom like shape here is the result of the combined action of the free surface the buoyancy force and the simplified open floating slender structure in fig 8 f the repulsion of the free surface to the bubble plays a dominant role so an annular sideway jet close to the top of the bubble is formed subsequently the bubble is split into two sub bubbles by the annular sideway jets and the two sub bubbles collapse toward different directions the upper sub bubble generates a water jet directed toward the simplified open floating slender structure and the lower sub bubble generates a water jet directed away from the simplified open floating slender structure as shown in fig 8 g at the same time the sagging deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure with a plastic hinge reaches the maximum value owing to the inertia force after the bubble reaches its minimum volume the two sub bubbles with irregular shape begin to rebound as shown in fig 8 h meanwhile the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure also begins to rebound due to the restoring force and the bubble pulsation force fig 9 presents the schematic diagram of the physical quantity definition as shown in fig 9 a in order to obtain the displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure the origin is set at the middle of the bottom edge of the simplified open floating slender structure when the charge is not detonated besides the effective bubble radius is defined as r e f f a 2 b 2 2 and the definition of the bubble radius parameters a and b is presented in fig 9 b fig 10 gives the comparison of experimental results and numerical results fig 10 a gives the evolution of the vertical displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure and fig 10 b gives the evolution of the effective bubble radius as shown in fig 10 a except for some little difference in displacement amplitude the vertical displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure in numerical results has similar trend as that in experiment the main reason for the difference of vertical displacement fig 10 a between experimental results and numerical results is as follows during the experiment in order to prevent the simplified open floating slender structure from overturning flexible ropes are used at both ends of the structure for auxiliary positioning which may affect the displacement of the simplified open floating slender structure so the vertical displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure in numerical results is not exactly equal to that in experiment based on the above analysis the differences of vertical displacement between the experimental results and the numerical results in fig 10 a are acceptable besides the comparison of effective bubble radius between experimental and numerical results is conducted as shown in fig 10 b the trend and the amplitude of the effective bubble radius in the numerical results are in good agreement with the effective bubble radius in experiment so far some characteristics for the interaction between the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble in experimental and numerical results have been investigated and compared such as the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure fig 8 the bubble shapes fig 8 the vertical displacement of the middle cross section of the simplified open floating slender structure fig 10 a and the effective bubble radius fig 10 b in summary the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results so the cel method can calculate the interaction between the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble well next the more detailed analysis for the results in fig 8 will be conducted as shown in fig 8 c and d a phenomenon can be observed that the deformation mode of the simplified open floating slender structure has a transformation from hogging to sagging with bubble collapse the displacements of the simplified open floating slender structure along the longitudinal direction at some typical moments are presented in fig 11 the simplified open floating structure has a hogging motion firstly and then rebounds while moving as a whole due to the restoring force as shown in fig 11 a finally with the bubble collapse the start time is about t 25 ms the sagging motion of the simplified open floating slender structure becomes more obvious which continues developing until the bubble reaches its minimum volume fig 8 g and t 52 ms in fig 11 b the deformations of the simplified open floating slender structure from hogging to sagging at different times are presented it can be seen that the change of deformation type happens during the bubble expansion and only one transition occurs between hogging and sagging in the time interval 11 ms 25 ms the reason is that the middle part of the simplified open floating slender structure becomes large under the effects of the shock wave and the bubble pulsation pressure at initial stage when the effect of the bubble pulsation pressure decreases the simplified open floating slender structure rebounds due to the restoring force and the atmospheric pressure subsequently due to the inertia and the atmospheric pressure the sagging deformation occurs during the global upward motion of the simplified open floating slender structure fig 12 presents the local deformation of the side shells the side shells in the middle part of the simplified open floating slender structure have a little deformation in the hogging process then the side shells appear slight buckling due to the rebounding motion of the simplified open floating slender structure as shown in fig 12 b d even though the buckling is slight it will reduce the strength of the middle part during the sagging motion subsequently the obvious buckling occurs in the side shells when the bubble begins to collapse as shown in fig 12 e with the bubble collapse the buckling deformation becomes more and more obvious as shown in fig 12 f 5 research on effect of different parameters underwater explosion loads consist of the shock wave and the bubble loads the shock wave has the characteristics of high frequency and high peak pressure which usually will result in the local structural deformation on the contrary the underwater explosion bubble pulsation is characterized by low frequency which has an effect on the longitudinal strength of the slender structure generally liu et al 2018 for the cases in this paper because the charge is not close to the simplified open floating slender structure and the charge weights are not very large the local deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure caused by the shock wave is not obvious the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure is mainly induced by the underwater explosion bubble therefore the interactions between the underwater explosion bubble and the simplified open floating slender structure are mainly investigated in this section the underwater explosion cases for further investigation are presented in table 4 5 1 cases for different detonation distances the effect of the detonation distance on the dynamic response of the simplified open floating slender structure is investigated in this section fig 13 gives the numerical results in case 2 the bubble shape and the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure at different times in case 2 are almost similar to that in case 1 however due to larger detonation distance in case 2 the sunken deformation at the top of the bubble almost disappears and the upper sub bubble split from the main bubble is also smaller than that in case 1 fig 14 and fig 15 present the numerical results in case 3 and case 4 respectively including bubble shapes the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure and the stress distribution of the side shells since the obstruction effect of the simplified open floating slender structure on the bubble motion decreases the bubble maintains spherical shape approximately in the expansion process during the collapse stage the bubbles in the two cases are not split finally which is different from the phenomenon observed in case 1 and case 2 the reason is that the attraction of the simplified open floating slender structure to the bubble reduces with the increase of the detonation distance in addition for larger detonation distance the rebounding and sagging motions of the simplified open floating slender structure during the bubble expansion become weak so there is no obvious buckling deformation in the middle part of the side shells therefore when the detonation distance is large the underwater explosion bubble has less effect on the longitudinal strength of the simplified open floating slender structure and the simplified open floating slender structure mainly has a whipping motion with no obvious local structural deformation fig 16 presents the comparison of displacement distribution in different cases as shown in fig 16 a the deformations in different cases mainly occur in the middle of the simplified open floating slender structure and the displacements at the ends of the simplified open floating slender structure in different cases are almost equal when the simplified open floating slender structure is still in hogging stage in case 1 the simplified open floating slender structure in other cases have entered the sagging stage as shown in fig 16 b the reason is that the power of the shock wave and the bubble pulsation pressure is stronger in case 1 than other cases so the duration for the hogging motion of the simplified open floating structure in case 1 is longer subsequently except that the simplified open floating slender structure in case 4 has a little deformation while moving as a whole the sagging deformation of the simplified open floating structure in cases 1 3 increases as shown in fig 16 c owing to the inertia the simplified open floating slender structure in different cases continues moving upward as shown in fig 16 d after the displacement of the simplified open floating slender structure in different cases reaches the maximum the simplified open floating slender structure begins to fall back the simplified open floating slender structure in cases 3 and 4 keeps moving as a whole without obvious deformation until falls back to its initial position however the simplified open floating slender structure in cases 1 and 2 with the sagging deformation continues moving downward with bubble collapse as shown in fig 16 e and f in summary for larger detonation distances the simplified open floating slender structure has a whipping motion first and then has a rigid body motion without obvious deformation in the side shells on the contrary for smaller detonation distances the simplified open floating slender structure has a serious sagging deformation with buckling in the side shells during the bubble collapse in order to know more about the deformation mechanism of the simplified open floating slender structure some observation points are set to obtain the mises stress and the strain as shown in fig 17 the observation points p1 p11 are located in the center line of the bottom of the simplified open floating slender structure the points p12 and p13 are placed at the bottom and top of the side shell in the middle section of the simplified open floating slender structure respectively specifically the spacing d of the observation point in fig 17 is 0 15 m fig 18 presents the mises stress evolutions at the same observation point in different cases in general the mises stress at p6 increases with the decrease of the detonation distance as shown in fig 18 a the mises stress in case 1 and case 2 increases gradually with the increase of the sagging deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure the sagging deformation in cases 3 and 4 is not too obvious when the simplified open floating slender structure falls back to its initial position so the increase of the mises stress in case 3 and case 4 is not obvious but a maximum mises stress occurs in the four cases when the simplified open floating slender structure reaches the maximum downward displacement at time 55 ms approximately the mises stress in cases 1 and 2 reaches the maximum value again due to the water jet impacting on the bottom plate as shown in fig 18 b with the increase of the sagging deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure the increase phenomenon of the mises stress at p4 disappears in case 1 and case 2 because the large deformation mainly appears in the middle region of the simplified open floating structure at the same time the stress between 50 ms and 60 ms at p4 in cases 3 and 4 is close to that in cases 1 and 2 in fig 18 c the mises stress at p2 in cases 3 and 4 is approximate to that in cases 1 and 2 during the first bubble pulsation period which indicates that the mises stress at the ends of the simplified open floating slender structure is influenced slightly by the detonation distance however the different tendency of the mises stress occurs at the beginning of the secondary pulsation of the underwater explosion bubble at time 57 ms approximately this is because the simplified open floating slender structure in cases 1 and 2 is still in the sagging motion state but in cases 3 and 4 the simplified open floating slender structure has another hogging motion due to the bubble expansion in fig 18 d the evolution tendencies of stress in cases 1 and 2 are similar the abrupt decrease and increase at 10 ms and 20 ms are induced by the vibration of the side shells described in fig 12 the tendency in case 3 is similar to cases 1 and 2 until t 20 ms however the evolution tendency of stress in case 4 is similar to cases 1 and 2 only before t 10 ms the decrease of the mises stress at p13 in cases 1 and 2 at approximately 52 ms is induced by the water jet and the rebounding of the simplified open floating structure and the increase in cases 3 and 4 is resulted from the secondary bubble expansion 5 2 cases for different charge weights the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure for different charge weights are investigated in this subsection fig 19 presents the overall deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure and the underwater explosion bubble shape in different cases when the water jet penetrates the underwater explosion bubble depending on the charge weight there are mainly two deformation forms including the whipping motion and the damage in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge generated in the middle of the simplified open floating slender structure in addition for the cases where the simplified open floating slender structure has large deformation the bubble is split into two sub bubbles in the two sub bubbles the upper jet is directed toward the simplified open floating slender structure and the other is away from the simplified open floating slender structure as shown in fig 20 in order to estimate the overall deformation degree of the simplified open floating slender structure displacements related to two observation points p m and p e are compared in the following the points p m and p e are located in the center and the end of the side edge the edge marked in red in fig 20 respectively the displacements of p m and p e are represented by d m and d e respectively in addition the displacement difference between the two observation points δ d d m d e is defined whether the simplified open floating slender structure is in hogging motion state or in sagging motion state can be determined from the positive or negative values of δ d the larger the displacement difference is the more serious the deformation is for different cases the trends of the displacement d m with time are similar where the displacement increases first with the bubble expansion and then decreases with the bubble collapse in a bubble pulsation period however the trends of δ d with time are different fig 21 gives the displacement evolutions in different cases for different charge weights the evolution of the displacement difference δ d has different characteristics according to the response of the simplified open floating slender structure there are three types of the changing trends of δ d corresponding to three deformation features the first deformation feature is whipping motion as shown in fig 21 a the curve of δ d oscillates up and down with time near zero during bubble pulsation period and the amplitude of δ d is in the order of o 10 3 which indicates that the simplified open floating slender structure mainly has the whipping motion the second deformation feature is the incomplete secondary rebounding motion after the sagging deformation reaches the first extreme value as shown in fig 21 b d the duration of the sagging deformation is longer than that of the hogging deformation besides the rebounding motion of the simplified open floating slender structure at 16 ms approximately indicates that the whipping motion of the simplified open floating slender structure becomes weaker with charge weight increases due to the increase of the charge weight the attraction of the bubble to the simplified open floating slender structure becomes strong therefore the rebounding motion doesn t cause the simplified open floating slender structure to deform in a hogging mode again but the sagging deformation increased again as the bubble collapse in the time interval of 28 ms 40 ms the third deformation feature is that the simplified open floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode as shown in fig 21 e f the dynamic behaviors of the simplified open floating slender structure with time are similar when the charge weight is greater than a critical value at the initial stage the simplified open floating slender structure has the hogging motion due to the shock wave and the bubble expansion and then the simplified open floating slender structure has serious sagging motion with a plastic hinge as the bubble collapse in summary when the charge weight is small the whipping motion of the simplified open floating slender structure is dominated with the increase of the charge weight the deformation mode of the simplified open floating slender structure converts from a whipping motion to a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge in the middle of the simplified open floating slender structure the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure are associated with the moment so the moment in the middle section of the simplified open floating slender structure with time in different cases are presented in fig 22 the moments with time in cases 5 and 9 are similar to the evolution of δ d in fig 21 a and d respectively in case 5 the moment with time is similar to the sinusoidal function so the deformation of the simplified open floating slender structure is mainly dominated by the whipping motion in case 9 owing to the increase of the charge weight the moment is strengthened so the sagging deformation becomes serious and the rebounding motion becomes weak as shown in fig 21 d besides the moment changes smooth and steady with the bubble collapse in case 11 however the magnitude of the moment during the sagging motion in case 11 is smaller than that in cases 5 and 9 because the strength of the middle section of the simplified open floating slender structure in case 11 is reduced by the buckling deformation of the side shells mentioned in section 4 fig 23 gives the maximum relative displacements of the simplified open floating slender structure δ d max in the hogging and sagging process during the first bubble pulsation period for different charge weights the maximum relative displacement in the hogging and sagging process increases with the increase of the charge weight however the increase rates in the hogging and sagging process are different the increase rate of the maximum relative displacement in the two processes is similar for small charge weight as the charge weight increases the maximum relative displacement increase steadily in addition the value of the maximum relative displacement in the hogging process and the sagging process is approximate to each other in a charge weight interval of 0 002 kg 0 008 kg at that time the attraction of the bubble to the simplified open floating slander structure is not obvious however when the charge weight beyond a critical value in present work the critical value is 0 008 kg the maximum relative displacement in the sagging process increases rapidly but the maximum relative displacement in the hogging process remains at a low growth rate it can be concluded that in the cases within a certain detonation distance as the charge weight increases the impact of bubble collapse on the simplified open floating slender structure becomes obvious and the sagging deformation is much larger than the hogging deformation in the cases the maximum peeq equivalent plastic strain is mainly located in the side shells fig 24 gives the maximum peeq in the side shells of the simplified open floating slender structure during the first bubble pulsation period as shown in fig 24 the maximum peeq increases with the increase of the charge weight however the increase tendency of the maximum peeq for different charge weights can be split into three regions the region where the charge weight is smaller than 0 006 kg is defined as the first region where the whipping motion of the simplified open floating slender structure is dominated the region where the charge weight is in the range of 0 006 kg 0 010 kg is defined as the second region where the maximum peeq increases sharply besides the deformation mode of the simplified open floating slender structure transforms from the whipping motion to the damage in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge the region where the charge weight is larger than 0 010 kg is defined as the third region where the simplified open floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge 6 conclusions in order to investigate the dynamic response of the simplified open floating slender structure subjected to the underwater explosion bubble the experimental and numerical investigations were carried out in addition a series of cases for different detonation distances and different charge weights were conducted using coupled eulerian lagrangian method to get more information of the deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 there are mainly two deformation characteristics of the simplified open floating slender structure in the cases of this paper for large detonation distance or small charge weight the simplified open floating slender structure mainly has a whipping motion when the charge weight increases or the detonation distance decreases to a critical value due to the combine action of the pressure difference pressure difference between atmospheric pressure and bubble pulsation pressure and the redounding motion the simplified open floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with a plastic hinge generated in the middle of the simplified open floating slender structure 2 for the cases where the simplified open floating slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with plastic hinge due to the combined action of the free surface the buoyancy force and the simplified open floating slender structure the bubble displays a mushroom like shape besides with bubble collapsing the bubble is split into two sub bubbles by the annular sideway jets and the two sub bubbles collapse toward opposite directions 3 the stress in the middle of the structure for different detonation distances is different but there is little difference in the ends of the structure therefore a conclusion can be drawn that the explosion bubble has more effect on the response of the middle part of the structure and the smaller the detonation distance is the larger the stress is 4 the motion of the simplified open floating slender structure can be divided into three regions for different charge weights in this paper the deformation characteristics such as evolution of displacement moment in the middle cross section and maximum peeq are quite different in different regions in the first region the slender structure mainly has a whipping motion the second region is a transition region where the motion of the slender structure converts from whipping motion to sagging damage in a longitudinal bending mode in the third region the slender structure is damaged in a longitudinal bending mode with plastic hinge credit authorship contribution statement n gan methodology
