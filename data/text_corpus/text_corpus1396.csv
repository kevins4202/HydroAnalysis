6980,groundwater resources are shared across management boundaries multiple management units that differ in scale constraints and objectives may manage a shared resource in a decentralized approach the interactions among water managers water users and the water resource components influence the performance of management strategies and the resilience of community level water supply and groundwater availability this research develops an agent based modeling abm framework to capture the dynamic interactions among household level consumers and policy makers to simulate water demands the abm is coupled with a groundwater model to evaluate effects on the groundwater table the framework is applied to explore trade offs between improvements in water supply sustainability for local resources and water table changes at the basin level a group of municipalities are simulated as agents who share access to a groundwater aquifer in verde river basin arizona the framework provides a holistic approach to incorporate water user municipal and basin level objectives in evaluating water reduction strategies for long term water resilience keywords agent based model complex adaptive system groundwater management demand management water shortage sustainability index 1 introduction water management is a major challenge for growing urban water systems sustainable human water use practices should balance the continued capacity to meet water demands for an increasing population and the protection of groundwater and surface water resources from over exploitation elshafei et al 2015 while urban water management is based on the science of hydrologic processes to address depletion of water resources human activities that alter the natural processes are of scientific interests as well anthropogenic activities that influence the hydrologic cycle range from direct interactions such as withdrawals and return flows to indirect actions such as land cover change dam construction hydropower generation and anthropogenic climate change eslamian and eslamian 2017 shahid et al 2017 weiskel et al 2007 a limited characterization of the dynamics between human and natural systems can hinder the predictive capabilities of models to capture emergent behaviors and system performance elshafei et al 2015 the field of socio hydrology focuses on characterizing and integrating hydrologic processes and human interactions within a changing biophysical environment with the objective of understanding co evolving dynamics feedbacks and threshold behaviors that are present across multiple scales sivapalan et al 2012 sivapalan 2015 research has advanced our understanding of socio hydrology systems by exploring the co evolution of humans and water systems liu et al 2014 and characterizing the aspects of social systems including norms economics regulations and infrastructure choices on water security and community level resilience yu et al 2017 scott et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2017 solander et al 2016 to better incorporate the concepts of socio hydrology in managing water systems for improved resilience and sustainability further research is needed to develop realistic simulations of human water systems that can be used for decision making di baldassarre et al 2016 water resources are managed by multiple decision makers that share a common resource and differ in their access to water and supply constraints and simulation frameworks are needed represent the co evolution of policies behaviors and water resources as an emergent outcome due to the interactions among a set of managers within a human water system both the behavioral response of human populations and organizations and the performance of managers in achieving their goals have a hydrologic impact on water systems this study develops a simulation framework to represent independent water management units to realistically assess the effectiveness and feasibility of long term basin level water management strategies we extend the field of socio hydrology by developing a modeling framework to explicitly represent the interconnections of population policy and hydrology to quantify the sustainability of alternative management practices in a shared groundwater system real world water restriction policies are assessed based on their impacts on the demand reduction of communities city level water supply performance and groundwater improvements at a basin level cities are simulated to enact mandatory water restrictions as a proactive or reactive mechanism to protect groundwater when demands grow beyond a permitted yield to facilitate the heterogeneity complexity and adaptive behaviors of stakeholders that are involved in shared water management we use an agent based modeling abm approach abm represents a set of autonomous and heterogeneous actors that act and interact to produce system level emergent behavior abm has been used to simulate the complexity of consumer water demands in which consumer behaviors are influenced by interactions with other consumers water suppliers meteorological information water pricing educational conservation campaigns innovation diffusion and opinion dynamics downing et al 2000 moss and edmonds 2005 athanasiadis et al 2005 gal√°n et al 2009 berglund 2015 al amin et al 2015 mashhadi ali et al 2017 in our study water users and water managers in each city are represented as agents the abm approach provides an approach to simulate water use based on indoor water consumption data available through surveys and historical local weather data local data allows simulation of heterogeneous actions and reactions to water restrictions the abm approach also facilitates simulation of the dynamic interactions among water user agents manager agents and water resources to simulate city and basin level emergent groundwater level responses this framework is applied for an illustrative case study in the verde river basin arizona where eight cities are represented using population agents and manager agents to capture the complexity of a human water system at a basin level the abm is coupled with a regional groundwater flow model developed in modflow results demonstrate the effects of heterogeneous actions on outcomes for local cities and basin level resources this research explores the mechanisms behind the co evolution of human water systems in water management systems that rely on restrictions the framework provides an approach to develop and evaluate water management strategies that implement mandatory restriction policies for sustainability and resilience metrics 2 assessing water restrictions for demand management a water restriction program prioritizes essential water uses and places restrictions on low priority end uses such as outdoor irrigation in residential areas costs of a restriction program are reflected in the cost of monitoring by municipalities and in fines paid by users for violating restrictions mandatory water restrictions can be enforced in reaction to environmental triggers or they may remain in effect regardless of climate or environmental conditions as shown in fig 1 by imposing water restrictions on certain water uses water managers can improve water supply sustainability for a municipality and reduce the depletion of shared regional water resources at the same time water restriction programs can enlarge the water deficit which is the gap between the amount of water that is used and the amount of demand or desired water use water restriction programs therefore lead to trade offs between the improvement of regional water resources and local water supply sustainability when selecting water restriction program designs such as the frequency and timing of restrictions water managers can evaluate alternative programs based on their impacts at multiple scales at the basin level groundwater resources are typically evaluated based on depletion of the water table konikow and kendy 2005 sophocleous 2002 reliability resilience vulnerability maximum deficit and sustainability are indices for measuring the performance of a local water supply loucks 1997 sandoval solis et al 2010 these metrics are based on the deficit of water which is the difference between the demand for water and the actual amount of water delivered reliability refers to the probability that there will be no deficit resilience is the ability of the system to return to a deficit of zero after a non zero deficit occurs vulnerability is the volume of the deficit compared to the average demand maximum deficit is the largest deficit experienced by a community of water users over the time period and sustainability is an index that synthesizes these metrics in one value between 0 0 and 1 0 sandoval solis et al 2010 the definitions of these indices in the context of this study are further described in section 3 2 to evaluate mandatory water restriction programs the system supply performance is measured under alternative levels timing and frequencies of restrictions to determine water savings the water availability for critical end use purposes is evaluated to ensure that required demands are satisfied and basin level impacts are evaluated to determine loss of water resources this research develops a holistic framework to assess the impacts of water restrictions on users supply and resources and explore trade offs among conflicting goals 3 materials and methods coupled groundwater abm gw abm frameworks have been developed to represent adaptive and dynamic characteristics of complex water resource systems in other studies by tightly coupling abm and groundwater simulation models to explicitly represent the dynamic decision making of water managers and water users zhou et al 2015 gw abm frameworks have been developed to study the effects of residential land use change reeves and zellner 2010 zellner and reeves 2012 and agricultural decision making and land use change holtz and pahl wostl 2012 mulligan et al 2014 on groundwater depletion these studies demonstrate that short sighted or self interested behaviors of agents undercut the expected groundwater improvements of policy instruments as assessed with simplified groundwater modeling in a methodological study castilla rho et al 2015 illustrated an interactive modeling environment for developing gw abms to simulate these complex socio environmental couplings in groundwater systems and explore emerging groundwater conditions due to agent behaviors and interactions the gw abm described here is designed to assess water restrictions based on multiple goals 1 maintenance of the groundwater table at a basin scale and 2 improvement in city level water supply sustainability indices fig 2 describes the conceptual framework for the coupled gw abm municipal water demands are generated based on the dynamic interactions of the population agent and the manager agent in the abm framework an explicit climate dependent outdoor demand model is used which facilitates the opportunity to analyze management alternatives and consider seasonal variations in alternative climate change projections aggregated indoor outdoor and non residential demands are used to calculate the water withdrawal from groundwater resources the water withdrawal affects the groundwater conditions and the corresponding groundwater level is evaluated using a groundwater simulation model manager agents respond to increases in water demand rather than depletion of water supply based on data that describes the case study and real system that is explored in the application and a tightly coupled framework is not needed for this study the components of the framework are described as follows 3 1 process overview and schedule the schedule of the abm groundwater model is summarized here the agent based model is run at a monthly time step representing a typical rate of communication about restrictions between utility managers and customers finer time steps such as daily or weekly would not be feasible for implementing water restrictions which involves communication of restrictions and water resources conditions to water users on the other hand an annual time step would not allow a utility to react to water resources conditions and a monthly schedule allows utilities to select different choices depending on the season at each time step indoor and outdoor end uses generate household level water demands the number of households changes according to population growth projections household level water demands are accumulated to generate residential water demands non residential water demands are calculated using a factor based on the assumption that non residential demands grow linearly with residential demands residential and non residential demands are summed to generate city water demands manager agents react to the total demand based on violation of the safe yield which is the volume of water that can be safely withdrawn from the aquifer a proactive manager updates water restrictions corresponding to the month violation count and violation magnitude a reactive manager updates restriction status corresponding to the violation alone household end uses are updated for the next time step based on the restrictions that are applied groundwater level changes are evaluated corresponding to city water demands through the use of a groundwater model the sustainability index is calculated based on water savings within each city in this model formulation manager agents do not interact directly to communicate about management strategies or performance autonomous utilities have individual effects on their local water savings and water supply sustainability and they exert an aggregated impact on the groundwater table these three metrics are the emergent features that are studied using this framework key design concepts of the coupled groundwater abm gw abm model are summarized in table 1 3 2 population agent each household is assigned parameters for the household size indoor end uses and outdoor lawn watering requirements these parameters are set based on average values for a city households are homogeneous within each city and are combined to act as one agent the population agent total water demands for residential purposes d r t at each time step t at the household level are calculated based on indoor d r in t and outdoor demands d r out t 1 d r t d r in t d r out t 2 d r in t mean end h t 3 d r out t ir t a eff k crop lwf l ratio where mean end is the average demand volume per capita for a set of designated indoor end uses for one household i e shower toilet clothes washer dishwasher bathroom faucet and leak and h t is the household size a is the lawn area ir is the irrigation requirement eff is the efficiency of irrigation technologies and k crop is the crop coefficient lwf is the lawn watering frequency which is a behavioral factor to represent how often households water their lawns lwf is 0 when households never water their lawns lwf is 0 5 when households water their lawns every alternative day and lwf is 1 when households water their lawns every day l ratio is the calibration parameter which is the ratio of actual outdoor water use to theoretical irrigation requirements the irrigation requirement is calculated as a function of number of rainy days and evaotranspiration et assuming no irrigation is required on a rainy day the irrigation requirements are assumed to be constant across a city at each time step non residential water users are not modeled as interactive agents in this study their demands d nr t are assumed to increase linearly with residential demand the non residential demand in each city is a fixed ratio of the residential demand at each time step 4 d nr t nr ratio d r t 5 d c t n t d r t d nr t where nr ratio is a ratio of non residential to residential demands and is based on historical observations the total water demand d c t at each time step is calculated as the sum of water demands for all households n t at time step t and the non residential demand d nr t the set of households and the non residential sector represents the city and the city collectively exerts an aggregated demand that is supplied by the municipal agent 3 3 water utility manager agent a water utility manager is represented as a municipal agent at each time step the municipal agent observes a parameter representing the status of the stress on water resources and enacts a set of rules for conservation the water manager agent can enact proactive or reactive management strategies a proactive approach enacts predefined water restrictions for specific months of the year such as in the summer when demands are high the proactive approach may also incorporate some restrictions in response to the increasing demands when it violates a resource condition e g safe yield in addition to predefined restrictions a reactive approach on the other hand only applies restrictions when a violation of pre determined resource conditions occurs the water manager agent monitors changes in water supply sustainability indices which are described as follows with changes to water availability 3 3 1 sustainability index here the utility manager observes the sustainability index which was developed by sandoval solis et al 2010 to quantify the sustainability of water use practices the sustainability index has been applied for evaluating both mexican and usa water users as well as for environmental flows in the rio grande basin following the 1944 treaty between united states and mexico ibwc 1944 the index incorporates common indicators of water sustainability performance in a single value whereas each of the indicators are assumed of equal weight the water utility manager agent observes the sustainability index si which is calculated for a city as follows 6 si rel res 1 maxdef 1 vul 1 4 where rel is the reliability of the water supply system water demand reliability is the probability that the available water supply meets the water demand during the period of simulation sandoval solis et al 2010 for each time period t where water demand wd it in city i is less than the safe yield sy it deficit d it is zero 7 d it wd it sy it if wd it sy it 0 if wd it sy it 8 rel no of times d it 0 total no of timestep res is the resilience of the water supply system resilience is a system s capacity to adapt to changing conditions such as drought sandoval solis et al 2010 9 res no of times d it 0 followed by d it 0 no of times d it 0 vul is the vulnerability of the system vulnerability is the likely value of water deficits if they occur sandoval solis et al 2010 essentially vulnerability expresses the severity of water deficit with respect to demands 10 vul d it no of times d it 0 occurs maxdef is the maximum deficit of the water supply system the maximum deficit if deficits occur is the worst case annual deficit 11 maxdef max d it wd it a low value of any of the performance indicator lowers overall the sustainability index commensurately for example if a city maintains a reliable 0 9 and resilient 0 9 supply with low vulnerability 0 1 but experiences a high maximum deficit 0 9 the si index will be 0 5 indicating a moderate sustainability the product of the terms is raised to 1 4 in calculating the si index to ensure equivalence of the aggregated impacts of four indicators 4 illustrative case study verde river basin the gw abm framework is applied for the verde river basin vrb in arizona fig 3 the major towns or cities in the vrb include camp verde payson sedona cottonwood and clarkdale the verde river flows to the south and east and joins the salt river that plays an important role in the water supply for phoenix and other downstream localities the vrb overlays the big chino valley aquifer and the cities in the vrb rely on groundwater pumping to meet the majority of their demands cities including prescott prescott valley and chino valley belong to the prescott active management area which has groundwater rights to export out of the big chino and little chino aquifer wirt et al 2005 and as a result water users in these cities are also hydrologically connected to the vrb in total eight population growth centers are included in the simulation of the vrb as a complex system for simplicity we refer to them as city in this study the 1980 arizona groundwater management act defines safe yield as a groundwater management goal safe yield attempts to achieve and maintain a long term balance between the amount of groundwater withdrawn and the annual amount of natural and artificial recharge in designated active management areas the safe yield is evaluated through hydrologic modeling and unique yield limits are assigned to different cities determined by the arizona department of water resources adwr cities within the vrb use different management approaches to restrict demands for example the town of payson uses the number of consecutive days that safe yield is violated as a trigger for application of different levels of mandatory conservation measures while the town of payson responds reactively to groundwater safe yield violations other cities act in a proactive or static manner the city of cottonwood for example uses static mandatory high level restrictions from may to september the abm gw framework was developed for application to the vrb using mason a discrete event multiagent simulation library core in java luke 2011 which was loosely coupled with the groundwater model modflow harbaugh 2005 further details are provided as follows 4 1 population agent each city is represented as one water user residential water use is modeled based on the water use data for calendar years 1990 through 1997 collected from surveys conducted by the adwr pearson et al 2000 the ratio of indoor end use to the per capita water use is available through an end use survey conducted in phoenix az and indoor end uses in each municipality are assumed to have the same percentage that is reported for phoenix 30 5 nelson et al 1999 the lawn area is estimated using land use maps and corresponding housing data in each city city of sedona community development department 2014 town of camp verde 2016 town of payson 2014 cottonwood 2014 based on the acreage and relative contribution of residential land use types the average lot size for a household is estimated for each city the lawn area is assumed to be 50 of each lot the ratio of actual outdoor water use to theoretical irrigation requirements l ratio for each population agent was adjusted to match residential water demand to survey results from 1990 to 1997 pearson et al 2000 fig 4 the baseline water demands show an increasing trend in all major cities which indicates population growth is a major driving factor in demand dynamics in the basin population and population growth rates for each city are shown in table 2 non residential water users are not modeled as interactive agents in this study non residential water demands show an increasing trend in the study area for the period 1990 1997 pearson et al 2000 and the ratio of non residential water use to residential water use nr ratio is calculated from corresponding data 4 2 water utility manager agent the water managers monitor water demands to determine if they exceed the safe yield the safe yield for each city table 2 is based on city water reports payson 2013 cottonwood 2006 centre 2015 or assumed equal to the groundwater recharge in 2005 pool et al 2011 for cases in which a safe yield value is not available although safe yield is subject to change with decisions to transfer water from other basins and water right acquisition we assume safe yield for each city remains constant and future expansion of supply capacity is not considered the demand reduction strategy that is used by each city is shown in table 2 the proactive and reactive manager agents are coded following the water restriction programs as described for the town of payson and city of cottonwood respectively the rules for the interactions of household agents and manager agents are described in detail in table 3 4 3 groundwater model the northern arizona regional groundwater flow model nargfm is a numerical flow model modflow of the groundwater flow system in the primary aquifers in northern arizona developed by the us geological survey usgs to simulate interactions among the aquifers perennial streams and springs for predevelopment and transient conditions during the period 1910 2005 pool et al 2011 the verde river basin groundwater model vrbgm has been derived from the nargfm model with appropriate boundary condition considerations the model simulates groundwater flow across the entire basin the model boundaries were set along the boundary of the verde river basin and no flow conditions were assumed across boundary perimeters cell sizes of 1000 m by 1000 m are used in the vrbgm following the original usgs model a grid of 285 rows 187 columns and three layers are used to represent the vrbgm the three layers in the model represent the aquifer structures fig 5 layer 1 is the uppermost layer it represents the thick silt and clay and adjacent inter bedded alluvial deposits in the big chino valley and the fine grained part of the verde formation in the verde valley layer 2 represents the sand and gravel in the verde and big chino valleys and the lower volcanic unit in the little chino valley layer 3 is the lowest of the layers and it extends across the entire model domain and represents the redwall muav aquifer and crystalline rocks that are exposed at the land surface in the southern and eastern parts of the model domain pool et al 2011 the model simulates groundwater condition from 1910 through 2065 steady state conditions are assumed in 1910 and transient conditions are assumed from 1910 through 2065 the simulation period is divided into eleven multi year stress periods in the historical period from 1910 to 2015 and another ten multi year stress periods for future scenarios the model does not simulate any seasonal or annual varioations each stress period consists of five time steps where each subsequent time step increases in length by a factor of 1 2 compared to the previous time step modflow recharge package rch is used to simulate the natural recharge groundwater recharge is calculated as the total difference of inflows and outflows and is applied to the topmost model cell in the spatial extent of the model modflow stream str and drainage drn packages simulate intermittent streams and springs stream aquifer interactions of the verde river drainage system are also simulated using the str package surface water entities in the area include the verde river and several creeks these are sycamore creek oak creek wet beaver creek west clear creek and several major springs the verde river stream network also includes intermittent stream reaches of williamson valley wash and little chino wash pool et al 2011 the modflow well package wel is used to simulate groundwater withdrawal pool et al 2011 provide historical water withdrawal data well locations withdrawal rates and model layer from which withdrawals are taken for wells that lacked depth information wells were assigned to the uppermost layer or to the primary layer used by other nearby wells following the original model a constant decadal withdrawal rate is used for each well from 1940 to 2065 4 4 assessing the groundwater model modflow results are compared with the observed groundwater levels to ensure that the model accurately simulates the verde river basin groundwater conditions after changes were made to the original nargfm model observed data series from 44 locations were used to assess the model performance the data series includes 407 observations at nine locations in layer one 1141 observations at 26 locations in layer two and 292 observations at nine locations in layer three fig 6 the observations are all between the historical period of 1920 2015 the model performance is evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse the nse measures the goodness of model fit nse value of unity 1 0 indicates that simulations perfectly represent the observations a negative nse indicates that model predictions are worse than a prediction performed using the average of all observations as an alternative model and in general a value of greater than 0 6 is accepted as a good model the rmse measures model accuracy in terms of deviations between predictions and observations the vrbgm performed well compared to the original nargfm table 4 and the observed data fig 6 the nse values were better in layer two 0 93 and layer three 0 89 compared to layer one 0 69 though the model overall 0 94 performed better than the nargfm 0 74 the nse values for all the layers and that of the overall vrbgm model are greater than 0 6 which indicates the acceptance of the model as a good one the rmse values were lowest in layer three and the vrbgm performed better than the nargfm in terms of rmse 4 5 modeling scenarios four management scenarios are simulated using the gw abm framework no management groundwater level changes are projected for future demands without management over the period 2016 2065 business as usual cities apply proactive reactive or no management practices based on their current management preference table 2 groundwater level changes are assessed for projected future demands proactive water restrictions groundwater depletion is assessed for future population and climate changes from 2015 to 2065 following the mandatory conservation program in cottonwood in this approach some restrictions are implemented based on the season without regard for the state of the demands restrictions are also implemented in reaction to the total water demand in the city as compared to the safe yield reactive water restrictions groundwater depletion is assessed for future population and climate changes from 2015 to 2065 following the mandatory conservation program in payson az the trigger for enacting different levels of restrictions is total water demands in the city relative to the safe production capacity the water manager updates its rules based on demands alone three climate scenarios are tested for each of the four cases described above three different bias corrected spatially downscaled cmip5 climate model intercomparison project projections were used in this study the dataset was taken from geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory usa nasa goddard institute for space studies usa and national center for atmospheric research usa maurer 2012 an emission path of rcp 6 0 was assumed in all cases the variation in climate components impact both water withdrawals and groundwater recharge the variation in groundwater withdrawal is caused due the variation of outdoor lawn watering which is dictated by evapotranspiration and number of rainy days and captured using eq 3 the higher the evapotranspiration and the lower the number of rainy days are the higher the irrigation requirements are these values vary across spatial cities and temporal scale and produce different outdoor water usage across climate projections and are ported to groundwater model in the form of groundwater withdrawals at cities well package the climate components also affect the groundwater recharge calculated as the total difference of inflows and outflows stonestrom 1984 where the inflows are calculated as the sum of precipitation snow melt and soil storage from last time step and the outflows are calculated as the sum of runoff evapotranspiration and snow accumulation the recharges are calculated for each cell in the grid of 285 rows and 187 columns for each stress period and are incorporated into the groundwater model using the recharge package 5 results 5 1 occurrence of restrictions for management strategies under the three different climate projections municipal water demands are projected for the future period of 2016 2065 based on the projected demands the cities are grouped into three different types low stress moderate stress and high stress cities low stress cities are those where safe yield is not violated by city demands for the projected 20 45 years moderate stress cities have growing demands that are projected to surpass the safe yield over the next 20 45 years for high stress cities the safe yield is violated under current demands or projected as violated within the next 20 years fig 7 shows the average occurrence of each status as the number of months per year that a system spends in each status level results are shown for both proactive and reactive management approaches for each of the eight cities for high stress systems systems remain in high water restriction status levels high water restriction status levels indicate that more restrictions are enforced to curb water consumption restrictions that are imposed vary between proactive and reactive approaches for cottonwood and clarkdale low stress cities under reactive management the water systems remain in status 1 no restrictions for the majority of the simulated period higher status restrictions are seldom applied for these cities proactive managers remain in status 2 from may to september and in status 1 from october to april moderate stress cities include camp verde payson and sedona these cities have a higher occurrence of status levels 2 3 and 4 compared to low stress cities payson and camp verde remain in status level 1 for approximately 50 of the simulated months sedona remains in status level 1 less than 1 of the simulated months but it is in moderate status levels 2 and 3 for most of the simulated period high stress cities include prescott prescott valley and chino valley these cities are almost continuously in status level 4 5 2 household water savings results as described above for fig 7 focus on system level restrictions fig 8 on the other hand demonstrates household level water savings that emerge due to water restrictions water savings are simulated as they vary in response to restrictions that are applied due to the magnitude and frequency of safe yield violations results are reported for cities representing low stress cottonwood medium stress payson and high stress prescott valley systems the three cities are stressed at different levels initially and the water stress changes over the time as a result the safe yield violation also changes over the time in the city of cottonwood safe yield violations are not observed until 2050 2065 fig 8b and as a result reactive restrictions are not applied until this time waters savings are not observed until 2035 for proactive restrictions however mandatory water restrictions are in place from may to september for the entire simulated period three climate projections are simulated and show differences in projected water savings due to variations in evapotranspiration among the three projections in cottonwood water saving varies by 6 8 m3 year under proactive management and 3 4 m3 year under reactive management across the three climate projections for the projected time period for proactive management this represents 7 of the average annual savings for reactive management this is 1 06 times the average annual savings which are relatively low as shown in fig 8 for medium stress cities such as payson in fig 8 water savings increase over the simulated period for both proactive and reactive water management the amount of water savings varies over a wide range during the years 2015 2035 for reactive management compared to proactive management due to the differences among the climate projection scenarios and the occurrence of safe yield violations households use more water for outdoor purposes in hotter drier climate projections and as a result safe yield violations occur more frequently over the entire simulated period water savings projections vary by 10 9 m3 year 18 of average annual savings and 12 5 m3 year 23 7 of average annual savings for proactive and reactive approaches respectively reactive and proactive management approaches save similar amounts of water in high stress cities such as prescott valley where status 4 is applied through the projected period the range of variation in water savings across the three climate projections is 31 3 m3 year for both management approaches representing 7 4 of average annual savings 5 3 municipal water savings fig 9 shows changes in water demands under no management scenarios compared to proactive and reactive management scenarios for the 50 year simulation period the corresponding water restriction status levels are shown for low stress cottonwood medium stress payson and high stress prescott valley systems city water demand generally grows over the time due to population growth proactive and reactive management affect the volume of city level water savings figs 9 and 10 for low stress cities proactive management saves more water than reactive management see cottonwood in fig 9 because safe yield violation acts as a trigger for enacting a higher status for the reactive management approach the reactive manager does not save much water for low stress cities as shown in the case of cottonwood the water restriction status is limited to status 1 with occasional changes to status 2 toward the end of the projected period the city water savings which largely depend on residential water consumption followed similar trends and reactive management saves more water through the use of mandatory level 2 status restrictions from may to september the reactive management approach applies status 2 3 and 4 restrictions more frequently in moderate and high stress cities payson and prescott valley in fig 9 the proactive management approach saves more water both at the household and city level for moderate stress cities payson in fig 9 in high stress cities proactive and reactive management save similar amounts of water at both household and city levels prescott valley in fig 9 lawn watering restrictions are similar when status 4 is applied for both proactive and reactive approaches table 3 5 4 water supply sustainability low stress cities are characterized by high reliability and resilience and low vulnerability and maximum deficiency fig 10 for both cottonwood and clarkdale reliability and resilience are higher than 0 98 in no management and these values increase to 1 0 under both proactive and reactive management for these cities vulnerabilities and maximum deficits are less than 0 2 and these values reduce to 0 0 under reactive management for medium stress cities camp verde and payson the reliability ranges between 0 3 0 5 and the resilience between 0 1 and 0 3 under no management the reliability and resilience is 0 0 for sedona which is also a medium stress city the indices increase to the range of 0 5 0 6 for camp verde and payson and to 0 1 for sedona under proactive management proactive management improves the resilience more than the reactive management because of the proactive restrictions in place between may september the improvement in resilience is close to 0 2 for camp verde and payson and 0 02 for sedona high stress cities are characterized by zero reliability and resilience and vulnerability and maximum deficit are above 0 8 proactive and reactive management approaches cannot improve reliability and resilience however they do decrease the vulnerability within the range of 0 3 0 6 the improvement in maximum deficit is small less than 0 05 for prescott valley and prescott though larger greater than 0 4 for chino valley 5 5 groundwater level changes under management scenarios the safe yield based water restriction programs are mandated to safeguard water resources from long term water withdrawals for municipal and other water uses here we explore the change in depletion that restrictions can generate a water level depletion of around 20 25 m in the southern part big chino and verde valley subbasin is expected without any management and can be attributed in part to preexisting and constant withdrawals fig 11 the eight cities are located in the little chino subbasin prescott ama and verde valley subbasin an average groundwater depletion of 0 10 m is observed at these cities the depletion varies among projections due to a variable recharge as calculated using projected rainfall evapotranspiration runoff snowmelt and storage compared to business as usual cases fig 11 the proactive fig 11 and reactive management fig 11d both improve the water level by as much as 3 m in the central area of verde valley subbasin and as much as 3 6 m in the little chino subbasin the cities in the little chino subbasin include prescott valley town of prescott and chino valley these cities have municipal demands that lead to water withdrawals beyond safe yield the proactive and reactive management approaches therefore both apply high levels of restrictions in these cities for the projected future water level improvements are thus higher in the little chino subbasin the cities in the verde valley subbasin have low or moderate stress and water savings and the corresponding groundwater improvements are comparatively lower in this zone the groundwater in the upper big chino north verde valley central and verde canyon south subbasin are hydrologically connected the water table improvements in the verde valley subbasin therefore improves water level in these zones as well 5 6 trade offs among water supply sustainability water savings and groundwater improvements two tailed student s t tests assuming unequal variance indicates that the business as usual proactive and reactive management can improve the groundwater conditions significantly p 0 01 at 95 ci in all cases compared to no management scenarios across all climate projections however the improvements vary across climate projections the variation is caused due to the variation in climate components that impact both water withdrawals and groundwater recharge fig 12 shows the average water level drop in depleted areas cells in which the water depletion is greater than 0 m in eight cities between 2016 and 2065 under different management alternatives and three climate projections the no management water level depletion is projected to be 16 2 m 17 0 m and 17 5 m under climate projection 1 2 and 3 under the proactive management the depletion is projected to be 9 9 m 9 0 m and 9 9 m respectively for climate change scenarios the reactive management projections are 8 7 m 7 6 m and 8 6 m respectively the proactive and reactive management significantly improves the groundwater levels at the location of withdrawal average improvements at the basin level however are much lower 0 3 m management that improves water supply sustainability is also associated with water savings in the city calculated as water demand difference under no management and a certain management approach the water savings is thus an indicator of the difference between unrestricted expected demands and the restricted actual water consumption the difference may have economic and welfare consequences based on the actual total demand water prices and price elasticities wan et al 2013 the sustainability index is calculated based on four water supply indices as described above for low stress cities the sustainability index is at a high value for the base case close to the maximum 1 0 the two management approaches could not improve the metric in this case within a limited scope proactive management improves the sustainability index more but with higher stress on water users causing higher water savings compared to reactive management fig 12 improvements in maximum deficit and vulnerability are better for reactive management and the reliability and resilience improve more under proactive management the total sustainability index is higher for proactive management for moderate and high stress cities the reactive management approach improves the sustainability index more than the proactive management approach and increases water savings compared to a proactive manager for extreme cases such as prescott valley where safe yield was violated throughout the projected period neither proactive nor reactive management could improve the sustainability index proactive management can save more water in low to moderate stress cities which are identified based on the time it is expected for cities to violate safe yield limits on withdrawals while reactive management can save the same or higher volumes of water in high stress cities in our study while comparing the two management policies it is important to underline the triggers for both the management alternatives that was coded based on local setups as shown in table 3 for the reactive management restrictions are only applied reactively to frequency and magnitude of safe yield violation for proactive management similar restrictions are applied due to safe yield violations in addition to proactive restrictions that are applied regardless of safe yield violations if an area is subject to repetitive safe yield violation it may save more water using a reactive management policy because for high stress cities both the management approaches yield higher status status 4 mostly for most part of the simulation period in the reactive management approach however restrictions for non residential demand reductions are higher compared to proactive management refer to table 3 at status level 4 local context in terms of restrictions under different status affects the performance of proactive and reactive management alternatives in this case the water stress which is the magnitude and frequency of safe yield violation and the complexity of the rules affect the comparison between strategies 6 conclusions this research develops a holistic approach to evaluate alternative management approaches for water restriction programs as water stress continues to increase cities across the globe are expected to improve their water use efficiency in terms of both consumption and management the framework developed here assesses water management plans based on indices that have been developed to evaluate management decisions for sustainability social welfare and groundwater depletion the verde river basin is explored as an illustrative case study to incorporate context specific variables including projected population growth and climate change the model includes several simplifying assumptions and aggregated representation of each cities that may not reflect the actual long term portfolios and policies of the cities we rather present an analysis of inter dependence of the cities in meeting water demands locally and preserving water tables in groundwater for future uses two water conservation programs were studied a reactive and proactive approach to limit outdoor lawn watering a significant difference in water savings was observed for proactive and reactive management strategies contextual information is needed to compare proactive and reactive management strategies proactive management can save more water in low to moderate stress cities while reactive management can save the same or higher volumes of water in high stress cities if an area is subject to repetitive safe yield violation it may save more water using a reactive management policy for high stress cities in this study higher restrictions are applied under reactive management compared to proactive management in similar safe yield violation conditions the amount of water saved through different management approaches can significantly affect sustainability by changing the vulnerability and maximum deficit of the system the reliability and resilience also depend on how these restrictions are applied and the condition of the resources a restriction program with higher water savings does not necessarily generate sustainability index improvements the water savings which represents the difference between unrestricted water demand and actual water consumption increases with higher restrictions and water savings the scope of this study was limited by the availability of data for end uses the indoor and outdoor end uses in this study were assumed to remain constant throughout the future projections an end use survey can improve the understanding of the complex interactions in human nature environment and can improve the application of this framework the safe yields in this study were maintained at conservative levels based on the literature of baseline conditions in 2010 or according to the average historical recharge in cities where values were not available more realistically safe yields may be dynamically updated through management decisions to import water and utilize other surface or reclaimed water sources many of these cities may plan to increase their safe yield within the projected time frame and changing safe yield values were not considered in this study one extension of this work can be to incorporate adaptation and learning for both the users and the water managers with increasing stress on resource and corresponding restrictions the abm framework may be transformed into a cooperative or competitive framework where users can interact at household levels and water managers at city or basin level responses of managers in setting the safe yield may be simulated dynamically with climate change and population growth the impact of climate variability and management decisions on groundwater and other resources should be explored to evaluate the magnitude of uncertainty in long term planning acknowledgments we thank the editor associate

6980,groundwater resources are shared across management boundaries multiple management units that differ in scale constraints and objectives may manage a shared resource in a decentralized approach the interactions among water managers water users and the water resource components influence the performance of management strategies and the resilience of community level water supply and groundwater availability this research develops an agent based modeling abm framework to capture the dynamic interactions among household level consumers and policy makers to simulate water demands the abm is coupled with a groundwater model to evaluate effects on the groundwater table the framework is applied to explore trade offs between improvements in water supply sustainability for local resources and water table changes at the basin level a group of municipalities are simulated as agents who share access to a groundwater aquifer in verde river basin arizona the framework provides a holistic approach to incorporate water user municipal and basin level objectives in evaluating water reduction strategies for long term water resilience keywords agent based model complex adaptive system groundwater management demand management water shortage sustainability index 1 introduction water management is a major challenge for growing urban water systems sustainable human water use practices should balance the continued capacity to meet water demands for an increasing population and the protection of groundwater and surface water resources from over exploitation elshafei et al 2015 while urban water management is based on the science of hydrologic processes to address depletion of water resources human activities that alter the natural processes are of scientific interests as well anthropogenic activities that influence the hydrologic cycle range from direct interactions such as withdrawals and return flows to indirect actions such as land cover change dam construction hydropower generation and anthropogenic climate change eslamian and eslamian 2017 shahid et al 2017 weiskel et al 2007 a limited characterization of the dynamics between human and natural systems can hinder the predictive capabilities of models to capture emergent behaviors and system performance elshafei et al 2015 the field of socio hydrology focuses on characterizing and integrating hydrologic processes and human interactions within a changing biophysical environment with the objective of understanding co evolving dynamics feedbacks and threshold behaviors that are present across multiple scales sivapalan et al 2012 sivapalan 2015 research has advanced our understanding of socio hydrology systems by exploring the co evolution of humans and water systems liu et al 2014 and characterizing the aspects of social systems including norms economics regulations and infrastructure choices on water security and community level resilience yu et al 2017 scott et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2017 solander et al 2016 to better incorporate the concepts of socio hydrology in managing water systems for improved resilience and sustainability further research is needed to develop realistic simulations of human water systems that can be used for decision making di baldassarre et al 2016 water resources are managed by multiple decision makers that share a common resource and differ in their access to water and supply constraints and simulation frameworks are needed represent the co evolution of policies behaviors and water resources as an emergent outcome due to the interactions among a set of managers within a human water system both the behavioral response of human populations and organizations and the performance of managers in achieving their goals have a hydrologic impact on water systems this study develops a simulation framework to represent independent water management units to realistically assess the effectiveness and feasibility of long term basin level water management strategies we extend the field of socio hydrology by developing a modeling framework to explicitly represent the interconnections of population policy and hydrology to quantify the sustainability of alternative management practices in a shared groundwater system real world water restriction policies are assessed based on their impacts on the demand reduction of communities city level water supply performance and groundwater improvements at a basin level cities are simulated to enact mandatory water restrictions as a proactive or reactive mechanism to protect groundwater when demands grow beyond a permitted yield to facilitate the heterogeneity complexity and adaptive behaviors of stakeholders that are involved in shared water management we use an agent based modeling abm approach abm represents a set of autonomous and heterogeneous actors that act and interact to produce system level emergent behavior abm has been used to simulate the complexity of consumer water demands in which consumer behaviors are influenced by interactions with other consumers water suppliers meteorological information water pricing educational conservation campaigns innovation diffusion and opinion dynamics downing et al 2000 moss and edmonds 2005 athanasiadis et al 2005 gal√°n et al 2009 berglund 2015 al amin et al 2015 mashhadi ali et al 2017 in our study water users and water managers in each city are represented as agents the abm approach provides an approach to simulate water use based on indoor water consumption data available through surveys and historical local weather data local data allows simulation of heterogeneous actions and reactions to water restrictions the abm approach also facilitates simulation of the dynamic interactions among water user agents manager agents and water resources to simulate city and basin level emergent groundwater level responses this framework is applied for an illustrative case study in the verde river basin arizona where eight cities are represented using population agents and manager agents to capture the complexity of a human water system at a basin level the abm is coupled with a regional groundwater flow model developed in modflow results demonstrate the effects of heterogeneous actions on outcomes for local cities and basin level resources this research explores the mechanisms behind the co evolution of human water systems in water management systems that rely on restrictions the framework provides an approach to develop and evaluate water management strategies that implement mandatory restriction policies for sustainability and resilience metrics 2 assessing water restrictions for demand management a water restriction program prioritizes essential water uses and places restrictions on low priority end uses such as outdoor irrigation in residential areas costs of a restriction program are reflected in the cost of monitoring by municipalities and in fines paid by users for violating restrictions mandatory water restrictions can be enforced in reaction to environmental triggers or they may remain in effect regardless of climate or environmental conditions as shown in fig 1 by imposing water restrictions on certain water uses water managers can improve water supply sustainability for a municipality and reduce the depletion of shared regional water resources at the same time water restriction programs can enlarge the water deficit which is the gap between the amount of water that is used and the amount of demand or desired water use water restriction programs therefore lead to trade offs between the improvement of regional water resources and local water supply sustainability when selecting water restriction program designs such as the frequency and timing of restrictions water managers can evaluate alternative programs based on their impacts at multiple scales at the basin level groundwater resources are typically evaluated based on depletion of the water table konikow and kendy 2005 sophocleous 2002 reliability resilience vulnerability maximum deficit and sustainability are indices for measuring the performance of a local water supply loucks 1997 sandoval solis et al 2010 these metrics are based on the deficit of water which is the difference between the demand for water and the actual amount of water delivered reliability refers to the probability that there will be no deficit resilience is the ability of the system to return to a deficit of zero after a non zero deficit occurs vulnerability is the volume of the deficit compared to the average demand maximum deficit is the largest deficit experienced by a community of water users over the time period and sustainability is an index that synthesizes these metrics in one value between 0 0 and 1 0 sandoval solis et al 2010 the definitions of these indices in the context of this study are further described in section 3 2 to evaluate mandatory water restriction programs the system supply performance is measured under alternative levels timing and frequencies of restrictions to determine water savings the water availability for critical end use purposes is evaluated to ensure that required demands are satisfied and basin level impacts are evaluated to determine loss of water resources this research develops a holistic framework to assess the impacts of water restrictions on users supply and resources and explore trade offs among conflicting goals 3 materials and methods coupled groundwater abm gw abm frameworks have been developed to represent adaptive and dynamic characteristics of complex water resource systems in other studies by tightly coupling abm and groundwater simulation models to explicitly represent the dynamic decision making of water managers and water users zhou et al 2015 gw abm frameworks have been developed to study the effects of residential land use change reeves and zellner 2010 zellner and reeves 2012 and agricultural decision making and land use change holtz and pahl wostl 2012 mulligan et al 2014 on groundwater depletion these studies demonstrate that short sighted or self interested behaviors of agents undercut the expected groundwater improvements of policy instruments as assessed with simplified groundwater modeling in a methodological study castilla rho et al 2015 illustrated an interactive modeling environment for developing gw abms to simulate these complex socio environmental couplings in groundwater systems and explore emerging groundwater conditions due to agent behaviors and interactions the gw abm described here is designed to assess water restrictions based on multiple goals 1 maintenance of the groundwater table at a basin scale and 2 improvement in city level water supply sustainability indices fig 2 describes the conceptual framework for the coupled gw abm municipal water demands are generated based on the dynamic interactions of the population agent and the manager agent in the abm framework an explicit climate dependent outdoor demand model is used which facilitates the opportunity to analyze management alternatives and consider seasonal variations in alternative climate change projections aggregated indoor outdoor and non residential demands are used to calculate the water withdrawal from groundwater resources the water withdrawal affects the groundwater conditions and the corresponding groundwater level is evaluated using a groundwater simulation model manager agents respond to increases in water demand rather than depletion of water supply based on data that describes the case study and real system that is explored in the application and a tightly coupled framework is not needed for this study the components of the framework are described as follows 3 1 process overview and schedule the schedule of the abm groundwater model is summarized here the agent based model is run at a monthly time step representing a typical rate of communication about restrictions between utility managers and customers finer time steps such as daily or weekly would not be feasible for implementing water restrictions which involves communication of restrictions and water resources conditions to water users on the other hand an annual time step would not allow a utility to react to water resources conditions and a monthly schedule allows utilities to select different choices depending on the season at each time step indoor and outdoor end uses generate household level water demands the number of households changes according to population growth projections household level water demands are accumulated to generate residential water demands non residential water demands are calculated using a factor based on the assumption that non residential demands grow linearly with residential demands residential and non residential demands are summed to generate city water demands manager agents react to the total demand based on violation of the safe yield which is the volume of water that can be safely withdrawn from the aquifer a proactive manager updates water restrictions corresponding to the month violation count and violation magnitude a reactive manager updates restriction status corresponding to the violation alone household end uses are updated for the next time step based on the restrictions that are applied groundwater level changes are evaluated corresponding to city water demands through the use of a groundwater model the sustainability index is calculated based on water savings within each city in this model formulation manager agents do not interact directly to communicate about management strategies or performance autonomous utilities have individual effects on their local water savings and water supply sustainability and they exert an aggregated impact on the groundwater table these three metrics are the emergent features that are studied using this framework key design concepts of the coupled groundwater abm gw abm model are summarized in table 1 3 2 population agent each household is assigned parameters for the household size indoor end uses and outdoor lawn watering requirements these parameters are set based on average values for a city households are homogeneous within each city and are combined to act as one agent the population agent total water demands for residential purposes d r t at each time step t at the household level are calculated based on indoor d r in t and outdoor demands d r out t 1 d r t d r in t d r out t 2 d r in t mean end h t 3 d r out t ir t a eff k crop lwf l ratio where mean end is the average demand volume per capita for a set of designated indoor end uses for one household i e shower toilet clothes washer dishwasher bathroom faucet and leak and h t is the household size a is the lawn area ir is the irrigation requirement eff is the efficiency of irrigation technologies and k crop is the crop coefficient lwf is the lawn watering frequency which is a behavioral factor to represent how often households water their lawns lwf is 0 when households never water their lawns lwf is 0 5 when households water their lawns every alternative day and lwf is 1 when households water their lawns every day l ratio is the calibration parameter which is the ratio of actual outdoor water use to theoretical irrigation requirements the irrigation requirement is calculated as a function of number of rainy days and evaotranspiration et assuming no irrigation is required on a rainy day the irrigation requirements are assumed to be constant across a city at each time step non residential water users are not modeled as interactive agents in this study their demands d nr t are assumed to increase linearly with residential demand the non residential demand in each city is a fixed ratio of the residential demand at each time step 4 d nr t nr ratio d r t 5 d c t n t d r t d nr t where nr ratio is a ratio of non residential to residential demands and is based on historical observations the total water demand d c t at each time step is calculated as the sum of water demands for all households n t at time step t and the non residential demand d nr t the set of households and the non residential sector represents the city and the city collectively exerts an aggregated demand that is supplied by the municipal agent 3 3 water utility manager agent a water utility manager is represented as a municipal agent at each time step the municipal agent observes a parameter representing the status of the stress on water resources and enacts a set of rules for conservation the water manager agent can enact proactive or reactive management strategies a proactive approach enacts predefined water restrictions for specific months of the year such as in the summer when demands are high the proactive approach may also incorporate some restrictions in response to the increasing demands when it violates a resource condition e g safe yield in addition to predefined restrictions a reactive approach on the other hand only applies restrictions when a violation of pre determined resource conditions occurs the water manager agent monitors changes in water supply sustainability indices which are described as follows with changes to water availability 3 3 1 sustainability index here the utility manager observes the sustainability index which was developed by sandoval solis et al 2010 to quantify the sustainability of water use practices the sustainability index has been applied for evaluating both mexican and usa water users as well as for environmental flows in the rio grande basin following the 1944 treaty between united states and mexico ibwc 1944 the index incorporates common indicators of water sustainability performance in a single value whereas each of the indicators are assumed of equal weight the water utility manager agent observes the sustainability index si which is calculated for a city as follows 6 si rel res 1 maxdef 1 vul 1 4 where rel is the reliability of the water supply system water demand reliability is the probability that the available water supply meets the water demand during the period of simulation sandoval solis et al 2010 for each time period t where water demand wd it in city i is less than the safe yield sy it deficit d it is zero 7 d it wd it sy it if wd it sy it 0 if wd it sy it 8 rel no of times d it 0 total no of timestep res is the resilience of the water supply system resilience is a system s capacity to adapt to changing conditions such as drought sandoval solis et al 2010 9 res no of times d it 0 followed by d it 0 no of times d it 0 vul is the vulnerability of the system vulnerability is the likely value of water deficits if they occur sandoval solis et al 2010 essentially vulnerability expresses the severity of water deficit with respect to demands 10 vul d it no of times d it 0 occurs maxdef is the maximum deficit of the water supply system the maximum deficit if deficits occur is the worst case annual deficit 11 maxdef max d it wd it a low value of any of the performance indicator lowers overall the sustainability index commensurately for example if a city maintains a reliable 0 9 and resilient 0 9 supply with low vulnerability 0 1 but experiences a high maximum deficit 0 9 the si index will be 0 5 indicating a moderate sustainability the product of the terms is raised to 1 4 in calculating the si index to ensure equivalence of the aggregated impacts of four indicators 4 illustrative case study verde river basin the gw abm framework is applied for the verde river basin vrb in arizona fig 3 the major towns or cities in the vrb include camp verde payson sedona cottonwood and clarkdale the verde river flows to the south and east and joins the salt river that plays an important role in the water supply for phoenix and other downstream localities the vrb overlays the big chino valley aquifer and the cities in the vrb rely on groundwater pumping to meet the majority of their demands cities including prescott prescott valley and chino valley belong to the prescott active management area which has groundwater rights to export out of the big chino and little chino aquifer wirt et al 2005 and as a result water users in these cities are also hydrologically connected to the vrb in total eight population growth centers are included in the simulation of the vrb as a complex system for simplicity we refer to them as city in this study the 1980 arizona groundwater management act defines safe yield as a groundwater management goal safe yield attempts to achieve and maintain a long term balance between the amount of groundwater withdrawn and the annual amount of natural and artificial recharge in designated active management areas the safe yield is evaluated through hydrologic modeling and unique yield limits are assigned to different cities determined by the arizona department of water resources adwr cities within the vrb use different management approaches to restrict demands for example the town of payson uses the number of consecutive days that safe yield is violated as a trigger for application of different levels of mandatory conservation measures while the town of payson responds reactively to groundwater safe yield violations other cities act in a proactive or static manner the city of cottonwood for example uses static mandatory high level restrictions from may to september the abm gw framework was developed for application to the vrb using mason a discrete event multiagent simulation library core in java luke 2011 which was loosely coupled with the groundwater model modflow harbaugh 2005 further details are provided as follows 4 1 population agent each city is represented as one water user residential water use is modeled based on the water use data for calendar years 1990 through 1997 collected from surveys conducted by the adwr pearson et al 2000 the ratio of indoor end use to the per capita water use is available through an end use survey conducted in phoenix az and indoor end uses in each municipality are assumed to have the same percentage that is reported for phoenix 30 5 nelson et al 1999 the lawn area is estimated using land use maps and corresponding housing data in each city city of sedona community development department 2014 town of camp verde 2016 town of payson 2014 cottonwood 2014 based on the acreage and relative contribution of residential land use types the average lot size for a household is estimated for each city the lawn area is assumed to be 50 of each lot the ratio of actual outdoor water use to theoretical irrigation requirements l ratio for each population agent was adjusted to match residential water demand to survey results from 1990 to 1997 pearson et al 2000 fig 4 the baseline water demands show an increasing trend in all major cities which indicates population growth is a major driving factor in demand dynamics in the basin population and population growth rates for each city are shown in table 2 non residential water users are not modeled as interactive agents in this study non residential water demands show an increasing trend in the study area for the period 1990 1997 pearson et al 2000 and the ratio of non residential water use to residential water use nr ratio is calculated from corresponding data 4 2 water utility manager agent the water managers monitor water demands to determine if they exceed the safe yield the safe yield for each city table 2 is based on city water reports payson 2013 cottonwood 2006 centre 2015 or assumed equal to the groundwater recharge in 2005 pool et al 2011 for cases in which a safe yield value is not available although safe yield is subject to change with decisions to transfer water from other basins and water right acquisition we assume safe yield for each city remains constant and future expansion of supply capacity is not considered the demand reduction strategy that is used by each city is shown in table 2 the proactive and reactive manager agents are coded following the water restriction programs as described for the town of payson and city of cottonwood respectively the rules for the interactions of household agents and manager agents are described in detail in table 3 4 3 groundwater model the northern arizona regional groundwater flow model nargfm is a numerical flow model modflow of the groundwater flow system in the primary aquifers in northern arizona developed by the us geological survey usgs to simulate interactions among the aquifers perennial streams and springs for predevelopment and transient conditions during the period 1910 2005 pool et al 2011 the verde river basin groundwater model vrbgm has been derived from the nargfm model with appropriate boundary condition considerations the model simulates groundwater flow across the entire basin the model boundaries were set along the boundary of the verde river basin and no flow conditions were assumed across boundary perimeters cell sizes of 1000 m by 1000 m are used in the vrbgm following the original usgs model a grid of 285 rows 187 columns and three layers are used to represent the vrbgm the three layers in the model represent the aquifer structures fig 5 layer 1 is the uppermost layer it represents the thick silt and clay and adjacent inter bedded alluvial deposits in the big chino valley and the fine grained part of the verde formation in the verde valley layer 2 represents the sand and gravel in the verde and big chino valleys and the lower volcanic unit in the little chino valley layer 3 is the lowest of the layers and it extends across the entire model domain and represents the redwall muav aquifer and crystalline rocks that are exposed at the land surface in the southern and eastern parts of the model domain pool et al 2011 the model simulates groundwater condition from 1910 through 2065 steady state conditions are assumed in 1910 and transient conditions are assumed from 1910 through 2065 the simulation period is divided into eleven multi year stress periods in the historical period from 1910 to 2015 and another ten multi year stress periods for future scenarios the model does not simulate any seasonal or annual varioations each stress period consists of five time steps where each subsequent time step increases in length by a factor of 1 2 compared to the previous time step modflow recharge package rch is used to simulate the natural recharge groundwater recharge is calculated as the total difference of inflows and outflows and is applied to the topmost model cell in the spatial extent of the model modflow stream str and drainage drn packages simulate intermittent streams and springs stream aquifer interactions of the verde river drainage system are also simulated using the str package surface water entities in the area include the verde river and several creeks these are sycamore creek oak creek wet beaver creek west clear creek and several major springs the verde river stream network also includes intermittent stream reaches of williamson valley wash and little chino wash pool et al 2011 the modflow well package wel is used to simulate groundwater withdrawal pool et al 2011 provide historical water withdrawal data well locations withdrawal rates and model layer from which withdrawals are taken for wells that lacked depth information wells were assigned to the uppermost layer or to the primary layer used by other nearby wells following the original model a constant decadal withdrawal rate is used for each well from 1940 to 2065 4 4 assessing the groundwater model modflow results are compared with the observed groundwater levels to ensure that the model accurately simulates the verde river basin groundwater conditions after changes were made to the original nargfm model observed data series from 44 locations were used to assess the model performance the data series includes 407 observations at nine locations in layer one 1141 observations at 26 locations in layer two and 292 observations at nine locations in layer three fig 6 the observations are all between the historical period of 1920 2015 the model performance is evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse the nse measures the goodness of model fit nse value of unity 1 0 indicates that simulations perfectly represent the observations a negative nse indicates that model predictions are worse than a prediction performed using the average of all observations as an alternative model and in general a value of greater than 0 6 is accepted as a good model the rmse measures model accuracy in terms of deviations between predictions and observations the vrbgm performed well compared to the original nargfm table 4 and the observed data fig 6 the nse values were better in layer two 0 93 and layer three 0 89 compared to layer one 0 69 though the model overall 0 94 performed better than the nargfm 0 74 the nse values for all the layers and that of the overall vrbgm model are greater than 0 6 which indicates the acceptance of the model as a good one the rmse values were lowest in layer three and the vrbgm performed better than the nargfm in terms of rmse 4 5 modeling scenarios four management scenarios are simulated using the gw abm framework no management groundwater level changes are projected for future demands without management over the period 2016 2065 business as usual cities apply proactive reactive or no management practices based on their current management preference table 2 groundwater level changes are assessed for projected future demands proactive water restrictions groundwater depletion is assessed for future population and climate changes from 2015 to 2065 following the mandatory conservation program in cottonwood in this approach some restrictions are implemented based on the season without regard for the state of the demands restrictions are also implemented in reaction to the total water demand in the city as compared to the safe yield reactive water restrictions groundwater depletion is assessed for future population and climate changes from 2015 to 2065 following the mandatory conservation program in payson az the trigger for enacting different levels of restrictions is total water demands in the city relative to the safe production capacity the water manager updates its rules based on demands alone three climate scenarios are tested for each of the four cases described above three different bias corrected spatially downscaled cmip5 climate model intercomparison project projections were used in this study the dataset was taken from geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory usa nasa goddard institute for space studies usa and national center for atmospheric research usa maurer 2012 an emission path of rcp 6 0 was assumed in all cases the variation in climate components impact both water withdrawals and groundwater recharge the variation in groundwater withdrawal is caused due the variation of outdoor lawn watering which is dictated by evapotranspiration and number of rainy days and captured using eq 3 the higher the evapotranspiration and the lower the number of rainy days are the higher the irrigation requirements are these values vary across spatial cities and temporal scale and produce different outdoor water usage across climate projections and are ported to groundwater model in the form of groundwater withdrawals at cities well package the climate components also affect the groundwater recharge calculated as the total difference of inflows and outflows stonestrom 1984 where the inflows are calculated as the sum of precipitation snow melt and soil storage from last time step and the outflows are calculated as the sum of runoff evapotranspiration and snow accumulation the recharges are calculated for each cell in the grid of 285 rows and 187 columns for each stress period and are incorporated into the groundwater model using the recharge package 5 results 5 1 occurrence of restrictions for management strategies under the three different climate projections municipal water demands are projected for the future period of 2016 2065 based on the projected demands the cities are grouped into three different types low stress moderate stress and high stress cities low stress cities are those where safe yield is not violated by city demands for the projected 20 45 years moderate stress cities have growing demands that are projected to surpass the safe yield over the next 20 45 years for high stress cities the safe yield is violated under current demands or projected as violated within the next 20 years fig 7 shows the average occurrence of each status as the number of months per year that a system spends in each status level results are shown for both proactive and reactive management approaches for each of the eight cities for high stress systems systems remain in high water restriction status levels high water restriction status levels indicate that more restrictions are enforced to curb water consumption restrictions that are imposed vary between proactive and reactive approaches for cottonwood and clarkdale low stress cities under reactive management the water systems remain in status 1 no restrictions for the majority of the simulated period higher status restrictions are seldom applied for these cities proactive managers remain in status 2 from may to september and in status 1 from october to april moderate stress cities include camp verde payson and sedona these cities have a higher occurrence of status levels 2 3 and 4 compared to low stress cities payson and camp verde remain in status level 1 for approximately 50 of the simulated months sedona remains in status level 1 less than 1 of the simulated months but it is in moderate status levels 2 and 3 for most of the simulated period high stress cities include prescott prescott valley and chino valley these cities are almost continuously in status level 4 5 2 household water savings results as described above for fig 7 focus on system level restrictions fig 8 on the other hand demonstrates household level water savings that emerge due to water restrictions water savings are simulated as they vary in response to restrictions that are applied due to the magnitude and frequency of safe yield violations results are reported for cities representing low stress cottonwood medium stress payson and high stress prescott valley systems the three cities are stressed at different levels initially and the water stress changes over the time as a result the safe yield violation also changes over the time in the city of cottonwood safe yield violations are not observed until 2050 2065 fig 8b and as a result reactive restrictions are not applied until this time waters savings are not observed until 2035 for proactive restrictions however mandatory water restrictions are in place from may to september for the entire simulated period three climate projections are simulated and show differences in projected water savings due to variations in evapotranspiration among the three projections in cottonwood water saving varies by 6 8 m3 year under proactive management and 3 4 m3 year under reactive management across the three climate projections for the projected time period for proactive management this represents 7 of the average annual savings for reactive management this is 1 06 times the average annual savings which are relatively low as shown in fig 8 for medium stress cities such as payson in fig 8 water savings increase over the simulated period for both proactive and reactive water management the amount of water savings varies over a wide range during the years 2015 2035 for reactive management compared to proactive management due to the differences among the climate projection scenarios and the occurrence of safe yield violations households use more water for outdoor purposes in hotter drier climate projections and as a result safe yield violations occur more frequently over the entire simulated period water savings projections vary by 10 9 m3 year 18 of average annual savings and 12 5 m3 year 23 7 of average annual savings for proactive and reactive approaches respectively reactive and proactive management approaches save similar amounts of water in high stress cities such as prescott valley where status 4 is applied through the projected period the range of variation in water savings across the three climate projections is 31 3 m3 year for both management approaches representing 7 4 of average annual savings 5 3 municipal water savings fig 9 shows changes in water demands under no management scenarios compared to proactive and reactive management scenarios for the 50 year simulation period the corresponding water restriction status levels are shown for low stress cottonwood medium stress payson and high stress prescott valley systems city water demand generally grows over the time due to population growth proactive and reactive management affect the volume of city level water savings figs 9 and 10 for low stress cities proactive management saves more water than reactive management see cottonwood in fig 9 because safe yield violation acts as a trigger for enacting a higher status for the reactive management approach the reactive manager does not save much water for low stress cities as shown in the case of cottonwood the water restriction status is limited to status 1 with occasional changes to status 2 toward the end of the projected period the city water savings which largely depend on residential water consumption followed similar trends and reactive management saves more water through the use of mandatory level 2 status restrictions from may to september the reactive management approach applies status 2 3 and 4 restrictions more frequently in moderate and high stress cities payson and prescott valley in fig 9 the proactive management approach saves more water both at the household and city level for moderate stress cities payson in fig 9 in high stress cities proactive and reactive management save similar amounts of water at both household and city levels prescott valley in fig 9 lawn watering restrictions are similar when status 4 is applied for both proactive and reactive approaches table 3 5 4 water supply sustainability low stress cities are characterized by high reliability and resilience and low vulnerability and maximum deficiency fig 10 for both cottonwood and clarkdale reliability and resilience are higher than 0 98 in no management and these values increase to 1 0 under both proactive and reactive management for these cities vulnerabilities and maximum deficits are less than 0 2 and these values reduce to 0 0 under reactive management for medium stress cities camp verde and payson the reliability ranges between 0 3 0 5 and the resilience between 0 1 and 0 3 under no management the reliability and resilience is 0 0 for sedona which is also a medium stress city the indices increase to the range of 0 5 0 6 for camp verde and payson and to 0 1 for sedona under proactive management proactive management improves the resilience more than the reactive management because of the proactive restrictions in place between may september the improvement in resilience is close to 0 2 for camp verde and payson and 0 02 for sedona high stress cities are characterized by zero reliability and resilience and vulnerability and maximum deficit are above 0 8 proactive and reactive management approaches cannot improve reliability and resilience however they do decrease the vulnerability within the range of 0 3 0 6 the improvement in maximum deficit is small less than 0 05 for prescott valley and prescott though larger greater than 0 4 for chino valley 5 5 groundwater level changes under management scenarios the safe yield based water restriction programs are mandated to safeguard water resources from long term water withdrawals for municipal and other water uses here we explore the change in depletion that restrictions can generate a water level depletion of around 20 25 m in the southern part big chino and verde valley subbasin is expected without any management and can be attributed in part to preexisting and constant withdrawals fig 11 the eight cities are located in the little chino subbasin prescott ama and verde valley subbasin an average groundwater depletion of 0 10 m is observed at these cities the depletion varies among projections due to a variable recharge as calculated using projected rainfall evapotranspiration runoff snowmelt and storage compared to business as usual cases fig 11 the proactive fig 11 and reactive management fig 11d both improve the water level by as much as 3 m in the central area of verde valley subbasin and as much as 3 6 m in the little chino subbasin the cities in the little chino subbasin include prescott valley town of prescott and chino valley these cities have municipal demands that lead to water withdrawals beyond safe yield the proactive and reactive management approaches therefore both apply high levels of restrictions in these cities for the projected future water level improvements are thus higher in the little chino subbasin the cities in the verde valley subbasin have low or moderate stress and water savings and the corresponding groundwater improvements are comparatively lower in this zone the groundwater in the upper big chino north verde valley central and verde canyon south subbasin are hydrologically connected the water table improvements in the verde valley subbasin therefore improves water level in these zones as well 5 6 trade offs among water supply sustainability water savings and groundwater improvements two tailed student s t tests assuming unequal variance indicates that the business as usual proactive and reactive management can improve the groundwater conditions significantly p 0 01 at 95 ci in all cases compared to no management scenarios across all climate projections however the improvements vary across climate projections the variation is caused due to the variation in climate components that impact both water withdrawals and groundwater recharge fig 12 shows the average water level drop in depleted areas cells in which the water depletion is greater than 0 m in eight cities between 2016 and 2065 under different management alternatives and three climate projections the no management water level depletion is projected to be 16 2 m 17 0 m and 17 5 m under climate projection 1 2 and 3 under the proactive management the depletion is projected to be 9 9 m 9 0 m and 9 9 m respectively for climate change scenarios the reactive management projections are 8 7 m 7 6 m and 8 6 m respectively the proactive and reactive management significantly improves the groundwater levels at the location of withdrawal average improvements at the basin level however are much lower 0 3 m management that improves water supply sustainability is also associated with water savings in the city calculated as water demand difference under no management and a certain management approach the water savings is thus an indicator of the difference between unrestricted expected demands and the restricted actual water consumption the difference may have economic and welfare consequences based on the actual total demand water prices and price elasticities wan et al 2013 the sustainability index is calculated based on four water supply indices as described above for low stress cities the sustainability index is at a high value for the base case close to the maximum 1 0 the two management approaches could not improve the metric in this case within a limited scope proactive management improves the sustainability index more but with higher stress on water users causing higher water savings compared to reactive management fig 12 improvements in maximum deficit and vulnerability are better for reactive management and the reliability and resilience improve more under proactive management the total sustainability index is higher for proactive management for moderate and high stress cities the reactive management approach improves the sustainability index more than the proactive management approach and increases water savings compared to a proactive manager for extreme cases such as prescott valley where safe yield was violated throughout the projected period neither proactive nor reactive management could improve the sustainability index proactive management can save more water in low to moderate stress cities which are identified based on the time it is expected for cities to violate safe yield limits on withdrawals while reactive management can save the same or higher volumes of water in high stress cities in our study while comparing the two management policies it is important to underline the triggers for both the management alternatives that was coded based on local setups as shown in table 3 for the reactive management restrictions are only applied reactively to frequency and magnitude of safe yield violation for proactive management similar restrictions are applied due to safe yield violations in addition to proactive restrictions that are applied regardless of safe yield violations if an area is subject to repetitive safe yield violation it may save more water using a reactive management policy because for high stress cities both the management approaches yield higher status status 4 mostly for most part of the simulation period in the reactive management approach however restrictions for non residential demand reductions are higher compared to proactive management refer to table 3 at status level 4 local context in terms of restrictions under different status affects the performance of proactive and reactive management alternatives in this case the water stress which is the magnitude and frequency of safe yield violation and the complexity of the rules affect the comparison between strategies 6 conclusions this research develops a holistic approach to evaluate alternative management approaches for water restriction programs as water stress continues to increase cities across the globe are expected to improve their water use efficiency in terms of both consumption and management the framework developed here assesses water management plans based on indices that have been developed to evaluate management decisions for sustainability social welfare and groundwater depletion the verde river basin is explored as an illustrative case study to incorporate context specific variables including projected population growth and climate change the model includes several simplifying assumptions and aggregated representation of each cities that may not reflect the actual long term portfolios and policies of the cities we rather present an analysis of inter dependence of the cities in meeting water demands locally and preserving water tables in groundwater for future uses two water conservation programs were studied a reactive and proactive approach to limit outdoor lawn watering a significant difference in water savings was observed for proactive and reactive management strategies contextual information is needed to compare proactive and reactive management strategies proactive management can save more water in low to moderate stress cities while reactive management can save the same or higher volumes of water in high stress cities if an area is subject to repetitive safe yield violation it may save more water using a reactive management policy for high stress cities in this study higher restrictions are applied under reactive management compared to proactive management in similar safe yield violation conditions the amount of water saved through different management approaches can significantly affect sustainability by changing the vulnerability and maximum deficit of the system the reliability and resilience also depend on how these restrictions are applied and the condition of the resources a restriction program with higher water savings does not necessarily generate sustainability index improvements the water savings which represents the difference between unrestricted water demand and actual water consumption increases with higher restrictions and water savings the scope of this study was limited by the availability of data for end uses the indoor and outdoor end uses in this study were assumed to remain constant throughout the future projections an end use survey can improve the understanding of the complex interactions in human nature environment and can improve the application of this framework the safe yields in this study were maintained at conservative levels based on the literature of baseline conditions in 2010 or according to the average historical recharge in cities where values were not available more realistically safe yields may be dynamically updated through management decisions to import water and utilize other surface or reclaimed water sources many of these cities may plan to increase their safe yield within the projected time frame and changing safe yield values were not considered in this study one extension of this work can be to incorporate adaptation and learning for both the users and the water managers with increasing stress on resource and corresponding restrictions the abm framework may be transformed into a cooperative or competitive framework where users can interact at household levels and water managers at city or basin level responses of managers in setting the safe yield may be simulated dynamically with climate change and population growth the impact of climate variability and management decisions on groundwater and other resources should be explored to evaluate the magnitude of uncertainty in long term planning acknowledgments we thank the editor associate

6981,excessive river erosion and sedimentation threatens critical infrastructure degrades aquatic habitat and impairs water quality tools for predicting the magnitude of erosion sedimentation and channel evolution processes are needed for effective mitigation and management we present a new numerical model that simulates coupled river bed and bank erosion at the watershed scale the model uses modified versions of bagnold s sediment transport equation to simulate bed erosion and aggradation as well as a simplified bank stability and toe erosion model bstem to simulate bank erosion processes the model is mechanistic and intermediate complexity accounting for the dominant channel evolution processes while limiting data requirements we apply the model to a generic test case of channel network response following a disturbance and the results match physical understanding of channel evolution the model was also tested on two field data sets below parker dam on the lower colorado river and the north fork toutle river nftr which responded dramatically to the 1980 eruption of mount st helens it accurately predicts observed channel incision and bed material coarsening on the colorado river as well as observations for the upstream 18 km of the nftr watershed the model does not include algorithms for extensive lateral migration and avulsions and therefore did not perform well in the lower nftr where the channel migrated across a wide valley bottom rem is parsimonious and useful for simulating network scale channel change in single thread systems responding to disturbance keywords channel evolution erosion sedimentation modeling watershed scale 1 introduction excessive river erosion and sedimentation are triggered by a variety of watershed disturbances which alter natural flow and sediment dynamics for example urbanization increases discharge hollis 1975 rosburg et al 2017 channel straightening increases slope simon 1989 and dam construction decreases sediment supply and modifies flow regimes williams and wolman 1984 channel instability and sediment imbalance threatens infrastructure degrades aquatic habitat and impairs water quality landowners and environmental resource agencies often respond to these threats by attempting to stabilize channels sometimes without success e g miller and kochel 2009 stream stabilization projects may fail if designers do not account for altered hydrology and sediment supply or simply due to the inherent uncertainty of channel response simon et al 2007 roni and beechie 2013 wohl et al 2005 bernhardt and palmer 2007 it is challenging to predict how streams will adjust and what new equilibrium state if any they will attain numerical modeling can address this issue by providing a simple and reproducible way to 1 assess channel sensitivity to disturbance and 2 predict channel adjustment while morphodynamic modeling has advanced in recent years most of the research has focused on large spatial and temporal scales e g landscape evolution models lague 2014 or individual processes e g bar formation nelson et al 2015 models that predict channel changes at intermediate spatial and temporal scales 10 s 100 s km2 watersheds 10 s 100 s of years are needed to help guide river restoration and management recent research has attempted to fill this gap with regime based models of river response eaton and millar 2017 watershed scale accounting of sediment dynamics parker et al 2015 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2014 2015 schmitt et al 2016 soar et al 2017 and mechanistic bank erosion modeling langendoen et al 2012 stryker et al 2017 these approaches are useful but they either do not account for all relevant erosion processes or require significant amounts of data making it difficult to assess uncertainty and provide results useful to managers the aim of this study was to develop a network scale morphodynamic model for simulating channel incision and bank erosion with limited data requirements to achieve this goal we use specific stream power bagnold 1966 allowing us to model channel erosion and deposition without simulating detailed flow hydraulics avoiding hydraulic calculations has several advantages less computation time fewer data and calibration requirements and fewer sources of uncertainty specific stream power is a physically based easily calculated parameter which is directly related to the erosive processes we are interested in modeling furthermore the simplicity gained by using specific stream power facilitates running monte carlo simulations allowing us to be transparent about uncertainty explicitly translating variability in model inputs into probabilistic predictions of channel evolution this paper introduces this new stream power based morphodynamic model the river erosion model rem rem is designed for modeling channel evolution at the watershed scale integrating a bank stability model based on lammers et al 2017 with novel stream power based sediment transport equations lammers and bledsoe 2018 rem is likely most applicable in smaller watersheds 10 s 100 s km2 where model input data are more easily collected unfortunately we are not aware of any data on watershed scale channel response in these smaller systems we therefore test rem on a generic watershed responding to base level fall as well as two field datasets of rivers responding to different types of disturbance the first is a reach of the lower colorado river which incised and coarsened after parker dam was constructed in 1938 the second is the north fork toutle river nftr which has followed a complex trajectory of channel change following massive sediment deposition from the eruption of mount st helens in 1980 applying rem to these complex systems tests the basic model processes explores uncertainty and model sensitivity and pushes the limits of model application determining the range of conditions for which it is most suitable 2 model description rem simulates bed erosion and aggradation in non cohesive sand and gravel using a sediment mass balance and into cohesive bed material using an excess shear stress approach channel width changes are simulated accounting for fluvial bank erosion e g excess shear and bank mass failure finally rem can account for meander bend migration and subsequent increases in sinuosity as well as knickpoint migration and associated sediment loading these features are described below applying rem to the colorado river and nftr test the bed and bank components of the model but we did not include any cohesive bed erosion meander migration or knickpoints these are useful model features but they require further testing 2 1 cross section geometry rem assumes a prismatic channel based on user supplied bottom width bank and toe heights and angles and floodplain width and slope fig 1 all channel geometry variables are unique for the right and left banks bank soil parameters e g cohesion can be distinct for the bank toe and upper bank soil but are the same for the right and left banks in a reach for each cross section a cohesive layer may be placed some distance below the channel bed aggradation and degradation only occur across the flat channel bottom 2 2 network structure and sediment routing the model uses a simple reach node network structure where a series of channel reaches are connected by nodes fig 1 schmitt et al 2016 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2015 the user specifies inputs individually by reach and each reach may have multiple cross sections model inputs are constant within each reach e g initial bed grain size distribution bank soil parameters etc so we recommend defining reaches as relatively homogeneous sections of a stream there is no defined length of model reaches they may be as short one cross section or long 10 s of km as necessary depending on the requirements of a specific model application incoming bed material load to each cross section is the sum of sediment supplied by the upstream cross section or cross sections at tributary junctions sediment from local bank erosion and any user inputted upland sediment supply upland sediment and bed material load from eroded banks are assumed to be the same grain size distribution as the initial bed grain size distribution for that reach the washload component of any bank cohesive bed or knickpoint erosion is immediately routed to the watershed outlet the effects of grade controls or bank armoring can be incorporated by placing non erodible cross sections within the channel network i e cohesive soils with high œÑ c a table of required and optional model inputs is included in the supplementary material 2 3 stream power many models use the standard step method or a simple flow resistance relationship to compute flow depth velocity and shear stress e g el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 allen et al 1999 in contrast we use specific stream power to directly model channel incision and bank erosion specific stream power is the power available to do work in the stream normalized by bed area bagnold 1966 1 œâ œâ w Œ≥ qs w where œâ is specific stream power w m 2 œâ is total stream power w m 1 Œ≥ is the specific weight of water 9810 n m 3 q is discharge m3 s 1 s is the friction slope m m 1 and w is the water surface width m specific stream power is a useful variable because it is readily calculated throughout a stream network but still represents the physical processes in rivers because of this it has been used to determine erosion and deposition potential parker et al 2015 vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 bizzi and lerner 2015 soar et al 2017 explain dominant modes of channel adjustment knighton 1999 bull 1979 model sediment transport processes bagnold 1977 1980 martin and church 2000 eaton and church 2011 and explain historic variability and future evolution of rivers fryirs et al 2012 discharge data are typically available from gaging stations regional regression equations or hydrologic modeling channel slope and width can be obtained from high resolution digital elevation models often created from airborne lidar data 2 4 discharge rem is driven by a user supplied flow record with a given time step e g daily hourly or 15 min to account for overbank flooding the model uses the manning equation to partition flow between the channel and floodplain using the sub area method similar to the approach used by hec ras and others e g soar et al 2017 the channel and two floodplains are treated as separate sections j each with their own manning roughness coefficient n j the discharge for each section is calculated using trial values of water surface elevation this processes is repeated until the sum of these discharges equals the known total flow 2 q j 1 3 a j r j 2 3 s 1 2 n j where a j is the section area m2 r j is the section hydraulic radius m and s is the channel slope only the discharge within the channel and the corresponding flow width are used to calculate specific stream power this approach assumes flow is uniform and quasi steady meaning changes in stream power are driven entirely by changes in local bed slope and channel geometry e g width and total area this means rem cannot accurately simulate areas with unsteady or non uniform flow such as channel constrictions or weirs 2 5 channel incision the model simulates incision into non cohesive and cohesive bed material including a mix of both bed types as described below 2 5 1 non cohesive incision fundamentally the model uses the exner equation to simulate bed elevation changes based on a sediment mass balance 3 Œ∑ t 1 w avg 1 Œª q b x where Œ∑ is the bed elevation m Œª is the bed porosity assumed to be 0 4 w avg is the average bottom width of adjacent cross sections q b is the volumetric sediment transport rate m3 s 1 and t and x are time and downstream distance respectively rem models sediment transport by grain size and tracks changes in bed material composition 4 f k t 1 l a f k f lk l a t 1 l a w avg 1 Œª q bk x f lk q b x where f k is the fraction of the k th grain size in the active layer where there is some finite user defined number of grain sizes l a is the active layer thickness m q bk is the volumetric sediment transport rate of the k th grain size m3 s 1 and f lk is the interface exchange fraction which depends on whether the bed is degrading or aggrading 5 f lk f k if Œ∑ t 0 Œ± f k 1 Œ± p bk if Œ∑ t 0 where f k is the fraction of the k th grain size in the channel bed subsurface below the active layer p bk is the bedload fraction of the k th grain size and Œ± is a weighting parameter than ranges from 0 to 1 we assume Œ± 0 5 the model does not store bed stratigraphy meaning information on buried sediment size is lost if the channel aggrades and then incises the active layer thickness l a is calculated as three times the surface layer d 90 sediment fluxes are discretized using the Œ∫ scheme with flux limiters hirsch 2007 6 q be q bi 1 4 1 Œ∫ œà r i 1 Œ∫ r i œà 1 r i q bi q bi 1 where q be is the volumetric sediment flux out of the control volume centered on the i th cross section m3 s 1 q bi 1 and q bi are the volumetric sediment fluxes at the i th 1 upstream and i th cross sections m3 s 1 and Œ∫ is a constant that controls the discretization scheme we use second order upwinding Œ∫ 1 hirsch 2007 r i is defined as 7 r i q bi 1 q bi q bi q bi 1 finally rem uses the superbee limiter function œà 8 œà max 0 min 2 r i 1 min r i 2 the model uses two new stream power based equations bagnold 1980 for calculating bedload and total load sediment

calculated for each grain size using a stream power based hiding function 11 œâ rk œâ r 50 d k d 50 b where œâ rk is the reference dimensionless specific stream power of the k th grain size œâ r 50 is the reference dimensionless specific stream power of the median grain size and b is an empirical exponent that varies from 0 size independent mobilization to 1 5 equal threshold mobilization details about this hiding function are described in supplementary material stream power is made dimensionless by 12 œâ œâ œÅ g s 1 d s 3 2 where œÅ is water density 1000 kg m 3 g is gravity 9 81 m s 2 and s is sediment specific gravity usually 2 65 for each grain size œâ rk is calculated from eq 11 converted to a dimensional œâ eq 12 and used as œâ c in eq 9 or 10 these sediment transport equations do not explicitly incorporate channel roughness in the calculation of œâ however channel roughness is indirectly included in equation coefficients that were fit to field data where channel roughness influences the relationship between œâ and sediment transport rates these coefficients and the œâ c term account for the specific stream power available to move sediment i e not including stream power used to enable the flowing water to overcome the frictional resistance of the channel boundary bagnold 1980 2 5 2 cohesive incision the model uses a simple excess shear stress equation to model cohesive bed erosion partheniades 1965 13 e k Œ¥ t œÑ œÑ c where e is the erosion distance m k is the erodibility coefficient m3 n 1 s 1 Œ¥ t is the time step s œÑ is the applied shear stress pa and œÑ c is the critical shear stress of the bed material pa the erodibility coefficient is calculated based on an empirical relationship developed by simon et al 2010 after work by hanson and simon 2001 14 k 1 6 10 6 œÑ c 0 826 eq 13 calculates erosion using excess shear stress but this model is based on a stream power approach since data on œÑ c of various soils are widely available in the literature and there is no work that we are aware of defining critical stream power of cohesive material we chose to use an empirical equation to calculate average bed shear stresses directly from œâ 15 œÑ 1 96 œâ 0 72 we fit this empirical equation using calculated average bed shear stress œÑ Œ≥ hs and specific stream power œâ Œ≥ qs w using depth discharge and bed slope measurements from a large database of rivers and flumes lammers and bledsoe 2018 this approach assumes wide channels w d 20 and uniform flow channel roughness is only indirectly accounted for in the calculation of œÑ used to fit the equation these assumptions and limitations could introduce additional variability into the analysis see supplementary material for more details this estimated value of œÑ eq 15 is then used to calculate cohesive erosion rates eq 13 2 5 3 mixed non cohesive cohesive incision in streams with both non cohesive and cohesive bed material modeling bed elevation changes is more complicated sand and gravel can be deposited on top of cohesive material and transport capacity may not be representative of actual sediment movement if the stream is supply limited e g no alluvium on the bed to account for these processes rem calculates the actual volume of sediment transported out of a cross section as the minimum of the transport capacity q be eq 6 and the sediment available for transport sum of the incoming sediment from upstream and bank erosion and of the available non cohesive alluvium on the channel bed the available non cohesive sediment is calculated as 16 q bk avail Œ∑ l a Œ∑ cohesive f k l a f k w avg 1 Œª Œ¥ x Œ¥ t where q bk avail is the volume of bed sediment of the k th size class available for transport converted to a rate m3 s 1 Œ∑ cohesive is the elevation of the cohesive layer m Œ¥ x is the distance to the next cross section m and Œ¥ t is the time step s if Œ∑ cohesive Œ∑ or f k or f k 0 there is no available bed sediment 2 6 bank erosion and failure the model simulates two fundamental bank erosion mechanisms fluvial erosion and mass wasting bank erosion is calculated at the discharge time step e g daily hourly 15 min etc independent of the time step for bed aggradation and degradation 2 6 1 fluvial erosion fluvial erosion is the removal of bank soil by flowing water once the resistance threshold of the bank material has been exceeded similar to cohesive incision rem models fluvial bank erosion using an excess shear stress approach eq 13 we use an empirical equation to calculate average wall i e bank shear stress directly from œâ 17 œÑ w 0 83 œâ 0 65 where œÑ w is the shear stress acting on the channel bank pa this equation was fit using data on average measured wall shear stress and stream power calculated from discharge width and bed slope from six flume studies this approach assumes uniform flow and is unfortunately limited to flume data since there are no direct field measurements of shear stress at the channel banks see supplementary material for more details a user specified fraction of the eroded bank material is added to the bed material load i e sand and coarser the remainder is exported from the watershed as washload 2 6 2 mass failure planar mass failure is modeled using a modified version of the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem simon et al 2000 2011 bstem estimates bank stability using a limit equilibrium analysis to calculate a factor of safety the ratio of resisting to driving forces acting on the bank the bank is predicted to be stable if the factor of safety is greater than one and unstable if it is less than one bstem accounts for several processes that increase or decrease bank strength including 1 water pressure in soil pores positive pressure decreasing stability and negative pressure increasing stability 2 confining pressure of the streamflow and 3 increased soil cohesion from plant roots although the simplified version of bstem accounts for the first two processes we exclude vegetation effects since they have a negligible effect on bstem output in sensitivity analyses lammers et al 2017 and increase computation time and data requirements this gives the following factor of safety equation 18 fs cl Œº a Œº w l tan œï b w cos Œ≤ Œº a l p cos Œ± Œ≤ tan œï w sin Œ≤ p sin Œ± Œ≤ where c is apparent cohesion kpa l is the length of the failure plane m w is the weight of the soil block per unit bank length kn m 1 p is the hydrostatic pressure force of the water in the stream kn m 1 Œ≤ is the failure plane angle degrees from horizontal Œ± is the bank angle degrees from horizontal Œº a is the pore air pressure kpa Œº w is the pore water pressure kpa œï is the effective friction angle degrees and œï b is an angle describing the rate of increase of shear strength from matric suction assumed to be 15 lammers et al 2017 bstem uses a horizontal layer method to calculate a net factor of safety for the bank accounting for different soil layers the simplified version follows this same approach but uses simplified bank geometry see section 2 1 assumes only two soil layers main bank and toe and assumes the failure plane intersects the bottom of the bank or top of the bank toe for a more detailed description of bstem see midgley et al 2012 daly et al 2015 simon et al 2000 2011 2 6 3 coupled bank erosion modeling fluvial erosion and mass failure are linked processes fluvial erosion is typically higher at the bank toe which steepens the bank and makes it more susceptible to failure after a bank fails the collapsed soil is often deposited at the base of the bank toe temporarily protecting the bank from fluvial erosion thorne 1982 bank erosion also controls channel width which creates a feedback between specific stream power and bank erosion fluvial erosion widens the channel bottom reducing œâ mass failure deposits soil at the base of the toe narrowing the channel bottom increasing œâ but increases channel top width which can increase total channel area as the failed soil block is eroded we account for these dynamic and coupled processes in two ways first fluvial erosion is assumed to be a maximum at the base of the toe this node is eroded the most widening the channel bottom with zero erosion at the top creating a steeper toe angle if the new toe angle exceeds 90 e g an undercut bank the overhanging bank immediately collapses and the bank and toe angles and bottom width are updated accordingly this bank steepening coupled with bank heightening from bed erosion increases the chance of mass failure if the bank fails the collapsed soil block is deposited at the bank toe narrowing the channel bottom and the toe angle is reduced to conserve the mass of the failed block if the failed block is too large to fit at the base of the toe any extra bank material is stored in a tank no further fluvial erosion is allowed until the material in this tank is eroded lai et al 2015 the area of the failed soil block is calculated based on bank geometry and the calculated failure plane angle from the bstem sub routine see supplementary material for more details 2 7 meandering in addition to incising meandering channels can also reduce their slope via lateral migration rem incorporates this process by simulating meander migration from fluvial erosion allowing the channel to increase its length thereby decreasing its slope the effects of curvature on shear stress distributions can be simulated by directly modeling flow mechanics typically using a high resolution 1 d or 2 d model crosato 2007 huang et al 2014 darby et al 2002 however rem does not directly calculate boundary shear stress distributions meaning it cannot mechanistically account for the effects of bend geometry on bank erosion instead we use an empirical equation to find the maximum shear stress on the outside of bends army corps of engineers 1970 19 œÑ max 2 65 œÑ w r c w 1 2 where œÑ max is the maximum bend shear stress pa œÑ w is the wall shear stress calculated using eq 17 pa r c is the bend radius of curvature m and w is the channel bottom width m eq 19 is based on only five small flume datasets and more recent analysis suggests that no single relationship adequately predicts maximum shear stress in bends thornton et al 2012 field studies however show that radius of curvature is a major control on channel migration rate nanson and hickin 1983 1986 hooke 1997 we therefore used eq 19 imperfect as it may be to account for this process including meander dynamics in the model requires two user inputs for each reach radius of curvature and sinuosity are used to build and track changes in channel planform we conceptualize the channel as a series of circular arc segments where each arc is one bend the number of bends between each cross section is calculated from the user defined cross section spacing radius of curvature and sinuosity using equations describing circular arcs meander migration modeling will not be physically realistic unless there is at least one full meander bend between adjacent cross sections i e dx must be sufficiently long depending on the supplied r c and sinuosity however more than one bend can be present between adjacent cross sections additionally rem does not account for complex bend geometry down valley migration or meander cutoffs see supplementary material for more details 2 8 knickpoint migration knickpoints or headcuts are small waterfalls or locally steep stream sections where bed erosion is especially pronounced these vertical drops tend to migrate upstream as they erode and can initiate substantial bank erosion schumm et al 1984 we use a simple empirical model to simulate headcut advance allen et al 2018 20 hc m 0 00126 ehc q cum 0 5 h hc 0 225 where hc m is the headcut migration distance m q cum is cumulative daily discharge m3 calculated from the user supplied discharge series h hc is headcut height m user supplied and ehc is an erodibility resistance parameter that is a function of soil erodibility and vegetation cover 21 ehc 17 8 16 5 k d 15 rcf where k d is soil erodibility cm h 1 pa 1 user supplied and rcf is a root cover density factor dimensionless 0 1 4 while channel beds are usually unvegetated using rcf 0 sometimes requires a negative k d value to accurately predict knickpoint migration rates therefore rem assumes rcf 1 4 and requires users to calibrate k d to match observed migration rates see supplementary material for more details this sub routine requires the user to input the initial location i e reach and station elevation height and k d of each knickpoint the position of each knickpoint is tracked as it migrates upstream including into any tributaries and bed elevations are adjusted accordingly however knickpoint height does not change as the knickpoint migrates the volume of eroded sediment is calculated based on migration distance knickpoint height and channel width a user specified proportion of this eroded sediment is added to the bed material load e g sand and gravel while the rest is considered washload e g silt and clay that is exported to the watershed outlet 3 model testing 3 1 generic model test while rem is suited for application to small watersheds there are no datasets for these types of systems with the necessary input data and sufficiently detailed monitoring of channel evolution across decadal time scales therefore we applied rem to a simple generic watershed to test its applicability in this context and confirm that rem can simulate the type of channel evolution we expect based on physical understanding of these processes we simulated channel evolution in a generic watershed with six distinct reaches the total channel length of 10 4 km corresponds to an approximate drainage area of 6 5 km2 hack 1957 eq 3 initial grain size 2 mm slope 0 003 and bank height 2 m were constant throughout the watershed channels were assumed to be straight with no meandering discharge was steady at a station but increased moving downstream upstream sediment supply was equal to the transport capacity of the undisturbed channel a full table of model inputs is included in supplementary material beginning with an initially stable channel we dropped the downstream elevation by 2 5 m including a 1 5 m tall knickpoint and modeled 20 years of resulting channel evolution given this base level drop we expected significant channel incision and bank failure with the area of disturbance migrating upstream with the knickpoint 3 2 colorado river 3 2 1 study area parker dam completed in 1938 is one of several large dams on the lower colorado river built for water supply and power generation like most hydropower dams parker dam altered flows and trapped sediment the combined effects of these changes caused the colorado river downstream from the dam to incise while the bed material coarsened williams and wolman 1984 3 2 2 data collection and modeling initial longitudinal profiles and grain size data for a 144 km reach downstream of parker dam were obtained from two u s bureau of reclamation reports u s bureau of reclamation 1948 1950 we used a single grain size distribution for the entire reach the pre dam grain size data were all finer than 2 mm however later observations included gravel up to 32 mm presumably unearthed as the channel incised since the channel coarsened over time and rem does not account for bed stratigraphy we adjusted the initial grain size distribution to include a small amount of coarser material average channel widths were calculated from 1938 aerial photographs norman et al 2006 and contemporary satellite imagery google earth pro 2017 we ran the model from 1938 to 1975 using daily discharge data from usgs gage 09427520 only bed elevation changes were modeled no bank erosion or meander migration was included we used a cross section spacing of 2000 m and a time step of 2400 s the total load sediment transport equation was used for all grain sizes 4 mm and the bedload equation for all coarser grain sizes we assumed no sediment inputs from upstream i e the dam trapped all sediment model results were compared to measured longitudinal profiles for a 66 km subreach from 27 to 93 km downstream of parker dam williams and wolman 1984 we also compared modeled d 50 to measured values from three cross sections 26 64 and 130 km downstream of parker dam williams and wolman 1984 in addition to the single model run described above we ran 5000 monte carlo simulations varying the initial grain size distribution channel width floodplain geometry roughness values and the exponent and coefficient of the hiding function sobol quasi random numbers using the gsl r package hankin 2006 were used to generate these variables since they provide more uniform coverage than simple random numbers sobol 1976 3 3 north fork toutle river 3 3 1 study area the north fork toutle river nftr was a typical gravel bed mountain river draining the northern slope of mount st helens on may 18 1980 after several months of increased volcanic activity a massive debris avalanche triggered an eruption this deposited about 2 8 km3 of sediment across the upper part of the nftr with depths averaging 45 m but reaching 140 m in some areas simon et al 1999 this massive sediment deposit buried the channel network of the upper nftr over the following months and years channels reformed from surface runoff pumping from spirit lake and multiple lahars volcanic debris or mudflows simon et al 1999 to prevent sedimentation in the downstream cowlitz and columbia rivers two sediment retention structures where built on the nftr the first n1 was built in summer 1980 and operated until it was breached in 1982 a second more permanent sediment retention structure the srs was built in 1987 and was essentially filled by 1998 simon et al 1999 zheng et al 2014 to prevent overtopping of spirit lake water was released into a nftr tributary see tr065 and tr070 in fig 2 at a constant rate of 5 1 m3 s 1 from november 1982 to august 1983 causing extreme incision up to 34 m paine 1984 for more details on the eruption and its effects see simon et al 1999 lipman and mullineaux 1981 and major et al 2018 3 3 2 data collection and modeling we modeled evolution of the upper nftr and its tributaries from september 1983 august 2011 we started the model 3 5 years after the eruption because there were more cross section data and this avoided several lahars and pumping from spirit lake which had complicated effects on channel adjustment following the eruption the usgs and army corps of engineers established several permanent cross sections which have been surveyed at irregular intervals since 1980 we used these data mosbrucker et al 2015 for 19 cross sections on the nftr and its tributaries to estimate initial channel and floodplain geometry fig 2 each of these cross sections defined a model reach with unique inputs initial bed grain size distributions were estimated from field data u s army corps of engineers 1988 paine 1984 we used the daily discharge series at the srs constructed by simon and klimetz 2012 from several nearby usgs gages these values were scaled by drainage area to give discharge in each reach we also used bank sediment properties œÑ c k cohesion unit weight and œï and manning s n values estimated by simon and klimetz 2012 we assumed no hillslope sediment supply since upland erosion peaked soon after the eruption and remained negligible compared to in stream sediment sources simon et al 1999 we used a model cross section spacing of 500 m a time step of 2400 s and the bedload sediment transport equation sediment specific gravity was adjusted to account for lighter volcanic material simon and klimetz 2012 eq 24 finally we assumed that 100 of the eroded bank material consisted of bed material load non cohesive bed erosion fluvial bank erosion and bank failure were modeled but no meander migration or knickpoint erosion was included we ran 5000 monte carlo simulations to quantify uncertainty varying initial grain size channel width channel roughness hiding function parameters and bank soil properties model accuracy was assessed by comparing modeled bed elevations to observations from survey data and a 1 m dem from 2009 mosbrucker 2014 other parameters e g d 50 and width were not used because only sparse grain size data were available and the simplified model cross sections could not adequately represent the complex observed channel geometries 3 4 sensitivity analysis for both case studies we performed sensitivity analyses to determine which variables most influence model output we used a density based method that estimates parameter sensitivity based on differences between conditional and unconditional probability density functions of model output plischke et al 2013 variables with a greater effect have bigger differences in these density functions this method has two advantages over other approaches it requires no unique input parameter sampling design e g saltelli et al 2010 and it requires much fewer model runs e g pianosi and wagener 2015 we therefore used the output from monte carlo simulations to compute the sensitivity indices bootstrapping with 1000 replicates was used to correct for bias and calculate uncertainty in sensitivity indices finally we incorporated a dummy variable to determine the threshold for influential variables this dummy variable is a simple set of random numbers that has no influence on the model and accounts for noise in the sensitivity analysis plischke et al 2013 khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 these sensitivity analyses are only applicable for each individual case study because each system has unique boundary conditions and relevant processes because of this it is necessary to perform a sensitivity analysis separately for every model application to understand what variables are most influential in each case for the colorado river we quantified sensitivity for two model outputs bed elevation and bed d 50 for the nftr channel width was also included to give a single output value for each model run we summed the absolute value of the total change in the variable e g bed elevation for all cross sections for the nftr a separate sensitivity analysis was performed for each reach for comparison among reaches we standardized the sensitivity indices by taking the difference between the index for each input and the dummy variable divided by the dummy variable index the variables included in each sensitivity analysis are shown in tables 1 and 2 all analyses of model outputs were done using r version 3 4 1 r core team 2018 4 results 4 1 generic model test fig 3 shows changes in bed elevation channel width and width depth ratio for the modeled test case the zone of disturbance migrated upstream through time with changes in channel width lagging slightly behind changes in bed elevation the greatest channel changes were at the far downstream end the area with greatest disturbance fig 4 shows changes in stream power bed elevation and channel width at two locations indicated in fig 3 a for both areas stream power was relatively constant until the knickpoint passed after which stream power spiked before slowly decreasing bed elevation and width show similar trends with abrupt changes following passage of the knickpoint after the initial drop in channel elevation both cross sections showed a period of aggradation followed by renewed incision sediment export from the watershed peaked early in the simulation and then decreased exponentially 4 2 colorado river fig 5 shows the error in predicted bed elevation and bed d 50 the median of the monte carlo simulations generally has lower error than the single model run for the bed elevation results fig 5 a c model error decreases over the course of the simulation although the uncertainty increases for the bed d 50 results fig 5 e g uncertainty is high for all sites but error generally decreases moving downstream fig 6 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis for bed elevation and bed d 50 outputs initial d 50 geometric standard deviation of the grain size distribution œÉ g and channel width have the largest influence on predicted bed elevation changes initial d 50 and œÉ g have a significant effect on the final d 50 while channel width and the hiding function parameters œâ c and b have only a small effect floodplain angle has a moderate effect on both outputs 4 3 north fork toutle river fig 7 shows modeled and observed bed elevations for the nftr the model predicted channel change well at the majority of sites mostly in the upper half of the watershed cw280 nf130 nf350 and nf405 these cross sections have generally low error in predicted final bed elevations normalized to the magnitude of total bed elevation change fig 8 median normalized error is 43 but is only 22 for reaches cw280 nf130 for the remainder of the cross sections the model did a relatively poor job of predicting changes in bed elevation there is substantial uncertainty for all sites especially in the upper half of the watershed e g 20 m wide 90 confidence interval the magnitude of uncertainty is generally less in the lower portion of the watershed where the magnitude of aggradation and incision was smaller the sensitivity results for the nftr model runs are summarized in fig 9 modeled bed elevation was influenced most by bank œÑ c bank cohesion and hiding function parameters œâ c and b channel width and initial bed grain size d 50 and œÉ g also had a minor effect modeled d 50 was influenced by similar variables but the hiding function parameters initial grain size and bank cohesion had a much larger effect for modeled channel width bank œÑ c was by far the most influential but initial width and œâ c also contributed to some observed model uncertainty 5 discussion 5 1 rem predicts realistic channel change the generic test case and field applications show that rem can realistically and accurately simulate channel evolution in the absence of avulsions and extensive lateral migration first the model test case matches physical understanding of channel evolution in response to disturbance in this case base level drop the greatest channel change is observed nearest the disturbance and rates and magnitudes of erosion decline nonlinearly with time and distance upstream fig 3 this is consistent with conceptual models of channel evolution schumm et al 1984 simon 1989 and experimental begin et al 1981 numerical simon and darby 1997 and field studies simon and rinaldi 2006 in general the channel incises which destabilizes the banks leading to rapid widening fig 4 as the upstream channel begins to erode large amounts of sediment are delivered downstream causing aggradation after this upstream sediment supply is cut off i e upstream channel erosion has slowed or stopped channel incision begins again this shift between degradation and aggradation depending on sediment delivery from upstream is an important control on channel evolution as demonstrated in both numerical modeling simon and darby 1997 and field studies simon and hupp 1992 downstream aggradation can help stabilize these reaches and allows the channel to more rapidly attain a new stable slope doyle and harbor 2003 disrupting this downstream sediment delivery for example by installing grade control structures can induce a second round of incision downstream simon and darby 2002 similar to what the modeling showed fig 4 following a disturbance the channel is expected to adjust rapidly with the rate of change slowing until the channel reaches some new stable state this results in an exponential decay in channel variables to some asymptote these variables may include stream power bull 1979 bledsoe et al 2002 sediment discharge simon 1999 bledsoe et al 2002 or bed elevation begin et al 1981 but all describe a reduction in the rate of energy dissipation simon 1992 modeling shows these exponential reductions in specific stream power and sediment discharge and an exponential increase in channel width fig 4 bed elevation follows a more complex trajectory but does decrease towards an asymptote during the second round of incision modeling from the nftr also shows this exponential decrease or increase in bed elevation fig 7 consistent with physical understanding of channel evolution in the colorado river modeling the greatest incision and bed coarsening were seen closest to the dam the disturbance with less channel change downstream data not shown furthermore rem accurately predicts the magnitude of channel incision in this system bed elevation rmse 0 7 1 5 m for all years bed material coarsening is also accurately predicted although errors are more variable d 50 rmse 0 1 5 mm in the nftr rem accurately predicts channel incision in the upper half of the watershed cw280 nf130 this portion of the channel is single thread while the downstream portion where the model error is higher is braided or avulsing features that were deliberately not incorporated into rem taken together these three model tests suggest that rem can predict channel evolution across decadal time scales in single thread systems with reasonable accuracy matching both physical understanding of channel change and adequately predicting evolution in real world dynamic fluvial systems further testing however is required in the smaller watersheds for which rem will most likely be applied while the physical processes are generally the same in these systems e g sediment transport bank erosion and failure it is possible that scale differences or other issues will be discovered during application to these smaller channel networks 5 2 model strengths and weaknesses rem s main strength is its parsimony and utility in simulating watershed scale channel evolution processes watershed scale assessment is essential because channel evolution is not limited to local disturbances or dynamics changes in both upstream and downstream channel form and sediment delivery affect local channel response e g schumm et al 1984 simon 1992 simon and darby 2002 both bed and bank erosion processes are especially important in smaller urban watersheds booth 1990 furthermore channel hardpoints i e bed and bank armoring can significantly influence local channel evolution and adjustment in other parts of the watershed booth and fischenich 2015 rem accounts for these processes enabling users to specify non erodible cross sections and may be an important tool for understanding urban channel network evolution other numerical models have been developed that include both bed and bank erosion but these are typically designed for reach scale application for example the concepts model langendoen and simon 2008 langendoen and alonso 2008 and darby and thorne 1996a model both include more detailed modeling than rem but cannot be easily applied at the watershed scale alternatively the watershed scale soil and water assessment tool swat allen et al 1999 mittelstet et al 2016 arnold et al 1998 has erosion processes for cohesive channels however rem incorporates cohesive and non cohesive erosion and bank failure rem includes the most important mechanisms to realistically simulate channel evolution while still keeping data requirements to a minimum another important strength of rem is its capacity to explicitly account for input variable uncertainty it automates the use of monte carlo simulations allowing users to easily quantify model uncertainty and produce probabilistic estimates of channel change quantifying uncertainty can be useful for decision making and assessing reliability of model outputs e g pappenberger and beven 2006 model field tests illustrate this in most cases it appears the median of the monte carlo simulations predicts river behavior as well or better than the single model run with the exception of nf130 and nf300 from the nftr fig 7 this suggests that accounting for uncertainty in the inputs can actually improve model accuracy how much uncertainty is too much must be determined by the model user because it depends on the question s being asked the model test cases show large uncertainty bounds this may seem discouraging but is an inescapable consequence of simulating complex and uncertain geomorphic systems shreve 1975 by quantifying this uncertainty we can at least be candid about confidence in the model s predictions the widths of the simulated uncertainty bounds are proportional to the magnitude of modeled bed elevation figs 5 and 7 and grain size fig 5 this is expected the larger the change the greater uncertainty rem is only applicable for single thread rivers it is therefore unsurprising that it could not adequately predict channel evolution in the downstream half of the nftr this section of the river migrates across a wide valley bottom and in the lower reaches the channel braids zheng et al 2017 in reality much of the channel is 15 20 m wide but may be within a several hundred meter wide valley the model cannot simulate the aggressive channel migration observed in the lower portion of the watershed and instead spreads the water out over an unrealistically wide modeled channel bottom fig 8 illustrates this issue showing how error in modeled bed elevation increases substantially where the valley widens just downstream of nf130 rem does include a meandering algorithm but this is not entirely mechanistic and is incorporated to allow single thread meandering channels an additional mode of slope adjustment this meandering algorithm was not incorporated into the nftr modeling other limitations are a consequence of rem s relative simplicity the model assumes uniform flow s o s f to calculate specific stream power and relies on new empirical equations to convert stream power to shear stress for cohesive erosion modeling this facilitates network scale analysis without detailed hydraulic modeling but may be a source of error this also neglects local complex flow hydraulics which can have an impact on channel change making it unsuitable for small scale analyses like bridge scour still rem has a strong physical basis integrating novel stream power based sediment transport models lammers and bledsoe 2018 with a well tested bank erosion algorithm bstem simon et al 2000 2011 that underwent systematic sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to identify the most parsimonious representation of essential physical processes lammers et al 2017 finally due to a lack of available data rem was not tested against field data sets on network scale channel response in smaller watersheds with cohesive banks while the generic model test case gives some indication of rem s applicability to these types of systems further testing is needed to determine how well rem can simulate channel response in these watersheds additional testing of the cohesive bed erosion meander migration and knickpoint retreat sub routines is also needed 5 3 model sensitivity sensitivity is a function of 1 how much an input influences model output and 2 how much the input varies sensitivity analyses can therefore reveal information about model structure and suggest which variables should be most accurately quantified to obtain the most reliable results rem sensitivity analyses largely confirm the validity of the model as important parameters are known to be linked to important channel evolution processes and are consistent with results reported in the literature bed elevation is most controlled by d 50 œÉ g width and floodplain angle colorado river fig 6 plus hiding function parameters and bank œÑ c and cohesion nftr fig 9 the size and erodibility of the bed material directly influences the extent of incision bank erodibility has a secondary effect by either allowing the channel to widen and reducing incision or limiting widening and forcing the channel to incise more simon 1992 other numerical models have shown that bed d 50 has a significant effect on modeled channel profiles el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2009 however darby and thorne 1996b found that d 50 had a minimal effect compared to discharge predicted bed d 50 was most influenced by initial grain size distribution in the colorado river case study fig 6 but hiding function parameters were equally or more influential for the nftr fig 9 others have also shown that hiding function parameters in their case critical shear stress and the hiding factor control modeled grain sizes ruark et al 2011 hoey and ferguson 1994 the nftr results also show that bank œÑ c and cohesion had an influence on modeled d 50 sediment from bank erosion has the same grain size distribution as the initial bed sediment as the bed coarsens bank erosion therefore becomes a source of finer grains channel width was controlled most by bank œÑ c fig 9 this suggests that fluvial erosion not mass failure was the dominant bank erosion process in the nftr darby and thorne 1996b also found that œÑ c had a much greater influence on channel widening than bank cohesion the three variables controlling bank failure cohesion œï and weight all had similar relative importance unlike other sensitivity analyses of bank erosion models that found cohesion was the dominant control on bank stability lammers et al 2017 van de wieland darby 2007 parker et al 2008 samadi et al 2009 these studies also did not show that œÑ c was important possibly because they did not model cumulative bank erosion and therefore did not incorporate the threshold effect of œÑ c determining when erosion occurs despite its relative simplicity rem is dependent on field data which may be difficult to collect at a network scale however the sensitivity results provide guidance on which variables should be most accurately quantified to yield the best model results this is especially important for bank œÑ c which has a strong influence on the model is subject to considerable uncertainty and is difficult to measure in the field wynn et al 2008 konsoer et al 2016 daly et al 2015 bank œÑ c may need to be estimated through model calibration to provide more reliable model inputs than field measurements 5 4 future improvements and applications there are a number of modifications that could improve model predictions coupling rem with an upland erosion model would provide more realistic estimates of sediment inputs and channel response e g stryker et al 2017 furthermore floodplains can be significant sediment sinks kronvang et al 2007 fryirs and brierley 2001 although floodplain sedimentation likely has a larger effect on fine sediment delivery e g walling et al 1998 than the bed material load that controls channel incision and aggradation adding these processes may improve model predictions but this extra complexity also increases data requirements and uncertainty it is important to balance the need to incorporate relevant processes while retaining the simplicity that makes rem applicable at the watershed scale rem has a number of potential applications both in river management and research for example channel erosion can be a significant but difficult to quantify source of fine sediment and phosphorus pollution in watersheds fox et al 2016 rem could be used to estimate loading of these pollutants at watershed scales urban stormwater management or mismanagement is a leading cause of channel degradation walsh et al 2016 2005 while certain stormwater design standards can help mitigate channel degradation e g tillinghast et al 2011 rem may allow a more comprehensive analysis of channel stability when coupled with a stormwater management model rem also has a number of research applications the search for an optimal or equilibrium channel form has intrigued scientists for decades e g langbein and leopold 1964 yang et al 1981 millar 2005 huang et al 2014 tools like rem can be used to explore this concept in more detail looking beyond the optimal channel cross section and examining interactions between parts of a network and their influence on watershed scale channel evolution 6 conclusions we present a new model for simulating channel evolution at the watershed scale this model is based on specific stream power and does not require detailed hydraulic modeling results from a generic test case of channel response to base level lowering match physical understanding of channel evolution the model also accurately predicts channel incision and bed coarsening for a reach of the lower colorado river below parker dam in the north fork toutle river the model accurately predicted channel incision and widening in the upper portion of the watershed where the channel remained single thread model predictions were poor in the lower watershed where the river migrated significantly across the valley floor a behavior that rem is not designed to simulate results from these case studies suggest the model can provide useful predictions of watershed scale channel erosion while recognizing it is limited to single thread channels importantly the model can also account for uncertainty in input variables allowing for a probabilistic assessment of channel change more model testing is required to fully understand its capabilities and limitations for example rem s ability to simulate cohesive incision knickpoint migration or meandering was not tested because of a lack of sufficient field data further testing is also warranted on the smaller watersheds i e 10 100 km2 for which rem was designed understanding how and how much rivers may change under future climate and land use variability is an essential question for sustainable river management other tools have been developed to estimate watershed sediment dynamics czuba et al 2017 schmitt et al 2016 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2014 and erosion and deposition potential soar et al 2017 parker et al 2015 in smaller urbanizing watersheds however channel changes are driven by both bed and bank erosion processes booth 1990 and strongly influenced by channel armoring and other channel improvements booth and fischenich 2015 by accounting for these processes rem can provide insight into urban stream evolution additionally the model can be used to test different mitigation strategies for example by simulating how the river erodes under different stormwater and or stream restoration scenarios to support cost effective and successful solutions to address excessive channel erosion acknowledgments this work was partially funded by the

6981,excessive river erosion and sedimentation threatens critical infrastructure degrades aquatic habitat and impairs water quality tools for predicting the magnitude of erosion sedimentation and channel evolution processes are needed for effective mitigation and management we present a new numerical model that simulates coupled river bed and bank erosion at the watershed scale the model uses modified versions of bagnold s sediment transport equation to simulate bed erosion and aggradation as well as a simplified bank stability and toe erosion model bstem to simulate bank erosion processes the model is mechanistic and intermediate complexity accounting for the dominant channel evolution processes while limiting data requirements we apply the model to a generic test case of channel network response following a disturbance and the results match physical understanding of channel evolution the model was also tested on two field data sets below parker dam on the lower colorado river and the north fork toutle river nftr which responded dramatically to the 1980 eruption of mount st helens it accurately predicts observed channel incision and bed material coarsening on the colorado river as well as observations for the upstream 18 km of the nftr watershed the model does not include algorithms for extensive lateral migration and avulsions and therefore did not perform well in the lower nftr where the channel migrated across a wide valley bottom rem is parsimonious and useful for simulating network scale channel change in single thread systems responding to disturbance keywords channel evolution erosion sedimentation modeling watershed scale 1 introduction excessive river erosion and sedimentation are triggered by a variety of watershed disturbances which alter natural flow and sediment dynamics for example urbanization increases discharge hollis 1975 rosburg et al 2017 channel straightening increases slope simon 1989 and dam construction decreases sediment supply and modifies flow regimes williams and wolman 1984 channel instability and sediment imbalance threatens infrastructure degrades aquatic habitat and impairs water quality landowners and environmental resource agencies often respond to these threats by attempting to stabilize channels sometimes without success e g miller and kochel 2009 stream stabilization projects may fail if designers do not account for altered hydrology and sediment supply or simply due to the inherent uncertainty of channel response simon et al 2007 roni and beechie 2013 wohl et al 2005 bernhardt and palmer 2007 it is challenging to predict how streams will adjust and what new equilibrium state if any they will attain numerical modeling can address this issue by providing a simple and reproducible way to 1 assess channel sensitivity to disturbance and 2 predict channel adjustment while morphodynamic modeling has advanced in recent years most of the research has focused on large spatial and temporal scales e g landscape evolution models lague 2014 or individual processes e g bar formation nelson et al 2015 models that predict channel changes at intermediate spatial and temporal scales 10 s 100 s km2 watersheds 10 s 100 s of years are needed to help guide river restoration and management recent research has attempted to fill this gap with regime based models of river response eaton and millar 2017 watershed scale accounting of sediment dynamics parker et al 2015 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2014 2015 schmitt et al 2016 soar et al 2017 and mechanistic bank erosion modeling langendoen et al 2012 stryker et al 2017 these approaches are useful but they either do not account for all relevant erosion processes or require significant amounts of data making it difficult to assess uncertainty and provide results useful to managers the aim of this study was to develop a network scale morphodynamic model for simulating channel incision and bank erosion with limited data requirements to achieve this goal we use specific stream power bagnold 1966 allowing us to model channel erosion and deposition without simulating detailed flow hydraulics avoiding hydraulic calculations has several advantages less computation time fewer data and calibration requirements and fewer sources of uncertainty specific stream power is a physically based easily calculated parameter which is directly related to the erosive processes we are interested in modeling furthermore the simplicity gained by using specific stream power facilitates running monte carlo simulations allowing us to be transparent about uncertainty explicitly translating variability in model inputs into probabilistic predictions of channel evolution this paper introduces this new stream power based morphodynamic model the river erosion model rem rem is designed for modeling channel evolution at the watershed scale integrating a bank stability model based on lammers et al 2017 with novel stream power based sediment transport equations lammers and bledsoe 2018 rem is likely most applicable in smaller watersheds 10 s 100 s km2 where model input data are more easily collected unfortunately we are not aware of any data on watershed scale channel response in these smaller systems we therefore test rem on a generic watershed responding to base level fall as well as two field datasets of rivers responding to different types of disturbance the first is a reach of the lower colorado river which incised and coarsened after parker dam was constructed in 1938 the second is the north fork toutle river nftr which has followed a complex trajectory of channel change following massive sediment deposition from the eruption of mount st helens in 1980 applying rem to these complex systems tests the basic model processes explores uncertainty and model sensitivity and pushes the limits of model application determining the range of conditions for which it is most suitable 2 model description rem simulates bed erosion and aggradation in non cohesive sand and gravel using a sediment mass balance and into cohesive bed material using an excess shear stress approach channel width changes are simulated accounting for fluvial bank erosion e g excess shear and bank mass failure finally rem can account for meander bend migration and subsequent increases in sinuosity as well as knickpoint migration and associated sediment loading these features are described below applying rem to the colorado river and nftr test the bed and bank components of the model but we did not include any cohesive bed erosion meander migration or knickpoints these are useful model features but they require further testing 2 1 cross section geometry rem assumes a prismatic channel based on user supplied bottom width bank and toe heights and angles and floodplain width and slope fig 1 all channel geometry variables are unique for the right and left banks bank soil parameters e g cohesion can be distinct for the bank toe and upper bank soil but are the same for the right and left banks in a reach for each cross section a cohesive layer may be placed some distance below the channel bed aggradation and degradation only occur across the flat channel bottom 2 2 network structure and sediment routing the model uses a simple reach node network structure where a series of channel reaches are connected by nodes fig 1 schmitt et al 2016 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2015 the user specifies inputs individually by reach and each reach may have multiple cross sections model inputs are constant within each reach e g initial bed grain size distribution bank soil parameters etc so we recommend defining reaches as relatively homogeneous sections of a stream there is no defined length of model reaches they may be as short one cross section or long 10 s of km as necessary depending on the requirements of a specific model application incoming bed material load to each cross section is the sum of sediment supplied by the upstream cross section or cross sections at tributary junctions sediment from local bank erosion and any user inputted upland sediment supply upland sediment and bed material load from eroded banks are assumed to be the same grain size distribution as the initial bed grain size distribution for that reach the washload component of any bank cohesive bed or knickpoint erosion is immediately routed to the watershed outlet the effects of grade controls or bank armoring can be incorporated by placing non erodible cross sections within the channel network i e cohesive soils with high œÑ c a table of required and optional model inputs is included in the supplementary material 2 3 stream power many models use the standard step method or a simple flow resistance relationship to compute flow depth velocity and shear stress e g el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 allen et al 1999 in contrast we use specific stream power to directly model channel incision and bank erosion specific stream power is the power available to do work in the stream normalized by bed area bagnold 1966 1 œâ œâ w Œ≥ qs w where œâ is specific stream power w m 2 œâ is total stream power w m 1 Œ≥ is the specific weight of water 9810 n m 3 q is discharge m3 s 1 s is the friction slope m m 1 and w is the water surface width m specific stream power is a useful variable because it is readily calculated throughout a stream network but still represents the physical processes in rivers because of this it has been used to determine erosion and deposition potential parker et al 2015 vocal ferencevic and ashmore 2012 bizzi and lerner 2015 soar et al 2017 explain dominant modes of channel adjustment knighton 1999 bull 1979 model sediment transport processes bagnold 1977 1980 martin and church 2000 eaton and church 2011 and explain historic variability and future evolution of rivers fryirs et al 2012 discharge data are typically available from gaging stations regional regression equations or hydrologic modeling channel slope and width can be obtained from high resolution digital elevation models often created from airborne lidar data 2 4 discharge rem is driven by a user supplied flow record with a given time step e g daily hourly or 15 min to account for overbank flooding the model uses the manning equation to partition flow between the channel and floodplain using the sub area method similar to the approach used by hec ras and others e g soar et al 2017 the channel and two floodplains are treated as separate sections j each with their own manning roughness coefficient n j the discharge for each section is calculated using trial values of water surface elevation this processes is repeated until the sum of these discharges equals the known total flow 2 q j 1 3 a j r j 2 3 s 1 2 n j where a j is the section area m2 r j is the section hydraulic radius m and s is the channel slope only the discharge within the channel and the corresponding flow width are used to calculate specific stream power this approach assumes flow is uniform and quasi steady meaning changes in stream power are driven entirely by changes in local bed slope and channel geometry e g width and total area this means rem cannot accurately simulate areas with unsteady or non uniform flow such as channel constrictions or weirs 2 5 channel incision the model simulates incision into non cohesive and cohesive bed material including a mix of both bed types as described below 2 5 1 non cohesive incision fundamentally the model uses the exner equation to simulate bed elevation changes based on a sediment mass balance 3 Œ∑ t 1 w avg 1 Œª q b x where Œ∑ is the bed elevation m Œª is the bed porosity assumed to be 0 4 w avg is the average bottom width of adjacent cross sections q b is the volumetric sediment transport rate m3 s 1 and t and x are time and downstream distance respectively rem models sediment transport by grain size and tracks changes in bed material composition 4 f k t 1 l a f k f lk l a t 1 l a w avg 1 Œª q bk x f lk q b x where f k is the fraction of the k th grain size in the active layer where there is some finite user defined number of grain sizes l a is the active layer thickness m q bk is the volumetric sediment transport rate of the k th grain size m3 s 1 and f lk is the interface exchange fraction which depends on whether the bed is degrading or aggrading 5 f lk f k if Œ∑ t 0 Œ± f k 1 Œ± p bk if Œ∑ t 0 where f k is the fraction of the k th grain size in the channel bed subsurface below the active layer p bk is the bedload fraction of the k th grain size and Œ± is a weighting parameter than ranges from 0 to 1 we assume Œ± 0 5 the model does not store bed stratigraphy meaning information on buried sediment size is lost if the channel aggrades and then incises the active layer thickness l a is calculated as three times the surface layer d 90 sediment fluxes are discretized using the Œ∫ scheme with flux limiters hirsch 2007 6 q be q bi 1 4 1 Œ∫ œà r i 1 Œ∫ r i œà 1 r i q bi q bi 1 where q be is the volumetric sediment flux out of the control volume centered on the i th cross section m3 s 1 q bi 1 and q bi are the volumetric sediment fluxes at the i th 1 upstream and i th cross sections m3 s 1 and Œ∫ is a constant that controls the discretization scheme we use second order upwinding Œ∫ 1 hirsch 2007 r i is defined as 7 r i q bi 1 q bi q bi q bi 1 finally rem uses the superbee limiter function œà 8 œà max 0 min 2 r i 1 min r i 2 the model uses two new stream power based equations bagnold 1980 for calculating bedload and total load sediment transport capacity lammers and bledsoe 2018 9 q b 1 43 10 4 œâ œâ c 3 2 d s 1 2 q 1 2 10 q t 0 0214 œâ œâ c 3 2 d s 1 q 5 6 where q b is the mass sediment transport rate per unit width kg m 1 s 1 q t is the total load ppm q is unit discharge m2 s 1 d s is the grain size m œâ is specific stream power w m 2 and œâ c is the critical specific stream power for incipient motion w m 2 this value is calculated for each grain size using a stream power based hiding function 11 œâ rk œâ r 50 d k d 50 b where œâ rk is the reference dimensionless specific stream power of the k th grain size œâ r 50 is the reference dimensionless specific stream power of the median grain size and b is an empirical exponent that varies from 0 size independent mobilization to 1 5 equal threshold mobilization details about this hiding function are described in supplementary material stream power is made dimensionless by 12 œâ œâ œÅ g s 1 d s 3 2 where œÅ is water density 1000 kg m 3 g is gravity 9 81 m s 2 and s is sediment specific gravity usually 2 65 for each grain size œâ rk is calculated from eq 11 converted to a dimensional œâ eq 12 and used as œâ c in eq 9 or 10 these sediment transport equations do not explicitly incorporate channel roughness in the calculation of œâ however channel roughness is indirectly included in equation coefficients that were fit to field data where channel roughness influences the relationship between œâ and sediment transport rates these coefficients and the œâ c term account for the specific stream power available to move sediment i e not including stream power used to enable the flowing water to overcome the frictional resistance of the channel boundary bagnold 1980 2 5 2 cohesive incision the model uses a simple excess shear stress equation to model cohesive bed erosion partheniades 1965 13 e k Œ¥ t œÑ œÑ c where e is the erosion distance m k is the erodibility coefficient m3 n 1 s 1 Œ¥ t is the time step s œÑ is the applied shear stress pa and œÑ c is the critical shear stress of the bed material pa the erodibility coefficient is calculated based on an empirical relationship developed by simon et al 2010 after work by hanson and simon 2001 14 k 1 6 10 6 œÑ c 0 826 eq 13 calculates erosion using excess shear stress but this model is based on a stream power approach since data on œÑ c of various soils are widely available in the literature and there is no work that we are aware of defining critical stream power of cohesive material we chose to use an empirical equation to calculate average bed shear stresses directly from œâ 15 œÑ 1 96 œâ 0 72 we fit this empirical equation using calculated average bed shear stress œÑ Œ≥ hs and specific stream power œâ Œ≥ qs w using depth discharge and bed slope measurements from a large database of rivers and flumes lammers and bledsoe 2018 this approach assumes wide channels w d 20 and uniform flow channel roughness is only indirectly accounted for in the calculation of œÑ used to fit the equation these assumptions and limitations could introduce additional variability into the analysis see supplementary material for more details this estimated value of œÑ eq 15 is then used to calculate cohesive erosion rates eq 13 2 5 3 mixed non cohesive cohesive incision in streams with both non cohesive and cohesive bed material modeling bed elevation changes is more complicated sand and gravel can be deposited on top of cohesive material and transport capacity may not be representative of actual sediment movement if the stream is supply limited e g no alluvium on the bed to account for these processes rem calculates the actual volume of sediment transported out of a cross section as the minimum of the transport capacity q be eq 6 and the sediment available for transport sum of the incoming sediment from upstream and bank erosion and of the available non cohesive alluvium on the channel bed the available non cohesive sediment is calculated as 16 q bk avail Œ∑ l a Œ∑ cohesive f k l a f k w avg 1 Œª Œ¥ x Œ¥ t where q bk avail is the volume of bed sediment of the k th size class available for transport converted to a rate m3 s 1 Œ∑ cohesive is the elevation of the cohesive layer m Œ¥ x is the distance to the next cross section m and Œ¥ t is the time step s if Œ∑ cohesive Œ∑ or f k or f k 0 there is no available bed sediment 2 6 bank erosion and failure the model simulates two fundamental bank erosion mechanisms fluvial erosion and mass wasting bank erosion is calculated at the discharge time step e g daily hourly 15 min etc independent of the time step for bed aggradation and degradation 2 6 1 fluvial erosion fluvial erosion is the removal of bank soil by flowing water once the resistance threshold of the bank material has been exceeded similar to cohesive incision rem models fluvial bank erosion using an excess shear stress approach eq 13 we use an empirical equation to calculate average wall i e bank shear stress directly from œâ 17 œÑ w 0 83 œâ 0 65 where œÑ w is the shear stress acting on the channel bank pa this equation was fit using data on average measured wall shear stress and stream power calculated from discharge width and bed slope from six flume studies this approach assumes uniform flow and is unfortunately limited to flume data since there are no direct field measurements of shear stress at the channel banks see supplementary material for more details a user specified fraction of the eroded bank material is added to the bed material load i e sand and coarser the remainder is exported from the watershed as washload 2 6 2 mass failure planar mass failure is modeled using a modified version of the bank stability and toe erosion model bstem simon et al 2000 2011 bstem estimates bank stability using a limit equilibrium analysis to calculate a factor of safety the ratio of resisting to driving forces acting on the bank the bank is predicted to be stable if the factor of safety is greater than one and unstable if it is less than one bstem accounts for several processes that increase or decrease bank strength including 1 water pressure in soil pores positive pressure decreasing stability and negative pressure increasing stability 2 confining pressure of the streamflow and 3 increased soil cohesion from plant roots although the simplified version of bstem accounts for the first two processes we exclude vegetation effects since they have a negligible effect on bstem output in sensitivity analyses lammers et al 2017 and increase computation time and data requirements this gives the following factor of safety equation 18 fs cl Œº a Œº w l tan œï b w cos Œ≤ Œº a l p cos Œ± Œ≤ tan œï w sin Œ≤ p sin Œ± Œ≤ where c is apparent cohesion kpa l is the length of the failure plane m w is the weight of the soil block per unit bank length kn m 1 p is the hydrostatic pressure force of the water in the stream kn m 1 Œ≤ is the failure plane angle degrees from horizontal Œ± is the bank angle degrees from horizontal Œº a is the pore air pressure kpa Œº w is the pore water pressure kpa œï is the effective friction angle degrees and œï b is an angle describing the rate of increase of shear strength from matric suction assumed to be 15 lammers et al 2017 bstem uses a horizontal layer method to calculate a net factor of safety for the bank accounting for different soil layers the simplified version follows this same approach but uses simplified bank geometry see section 2 1 assumes only two soil layers main bank and toe and assumes the failure plane intersects the bottom of the bank or top of the bank toe for a more detailed description of bstem see midgley et al 2012 daly et al 2015 simon et al 2000 2011 2 6 3 coupled bank erosion modeling fluvial erosion and mass failure are linked processes fluvial erosion is typically higher at the bank toe which steepens the bank and makes it more susceptible to failure after a bank fails the collapsed soil is often deposited at the base of the bank toe temporarily protecting the bank from fluvial erosion thorne 1982 bank erosion also controls channel width which creates a feedback between specific stream power and bank erosion fluvial erosion widens the channel bottom reducing œâ mass failure deposits soil at the base of the toe narrowing the channel bottom increasing œâ but increases channel top width which can increase total channel area as the failed soil block is eroded we account for these dynamic and coupled processes in two ways first fluvial erosion is assumed to be a maximum at the base of the toe this node is eroded the most widening the channel bottom with zero erosion at the top creating a steeper toe angle if the new toe angle exceeds 90 e g an undercut bank the overhanging bank immediately collapses and the bank and toe angles and bottom width are updated accordingly this bank steepening coupled with bank heightening from bed erosion increases the chance of mass failure if the bank fails the collapsed soil block is deposited at the bank toe narrowing the channel bottom and the toe angle is reduced to conserve the mass of the failed block if the failed block is too large to fit at the base of the toe any extra bank material is stored in a tank no further fluvial erosion is allowed until the material in this tank is eroded lai et al 2015 the area of the failed soil block is calculated based on bank geometry and the calculated failure plane angle from the bstem sub routine see supplementary material for more details 2 7 meandering in addition to incising meandering channels can also reduce their slope via lateral migration rem incorporates this process by simulating meander migration from fluvial erosion allowing the channel to increase its length thereby decreasing its slope the effects of curvature on shear stress distributions can be simulated by directly modeling flow mechanics typically using a high resolution 1 d or 2 d model crosato 2007 huang et al 2014 darby et al 2002 however rem does not directly calculate boundary shear stress distributions meaning it cannot mechanistically account for the effects of bend geometry on bank erosion instead we use an empirical equation to find the maximum shear stress on the outside of bends army corps of engineers 1970 19 œÑ max 2 65 œÑ w r c w 1 2 where œÑ max is the maximum bend shear stress pa œÑ w is the wall shear stress calculated using eq 17 pa r c is the bend radius of curvature m and w is the channel bottom width m eq 19 is based on only five small flume datasets and more recent analysis suggests that no single relationship adequately predicts maximum shear stress in bends thornton et al 2012 field studies however show that radius of curvature is a major control on channel migration rate nanson and hickin 1983 1986 hooke 1997 we therefore used eq 19 imperfect as it may be to account for this process including meander dynamics in the model requires two user inputs for each reach radius of curvature and sinuosity are used to build and track changes in channel planform we conceptualize the channel as a series of circular arc segments where each arc is one bend the number of bends between each cross section is calculated from the user defined cross section spacing radius of curvature and sinuosity using equations describing circular arcs meander migration modeling will not be physically realistic unless there is at least one full meander bend between adjacent cross sections i e dx must be sufficiently long depending on the supplied r c and sinuosity however more than one bend can be present between adjacent cross sections additionally rem does not account for complex bend geometry down valley migration or meander cutoffs see supplementary material for more details 2 8 knickpoint migration knickpoints or headcuts are small waterfalls or locally steep stream sections where bed erosion is especially pronounced these vertical drops tend to migrate upstream as they erode and can initiate substantial bank erosion schumm et al 1984 we use a simple empirical model to simulate headcut advance allen et al 2018 20 hc m 0 00126 ehc q cum 0 5 h hc 0 225 where hc m is the headcut migration distance m q cum is cumulative daily discharge m3 calculated from the user supplied discharge series h hc is headcut height m user supplied and ehc is an erodibility resistance parameter that is a function of soil erodibility and vegetation cover 21 ehc 17 8 16 5 k d 15 rcf where k d is soil erodibility cm h 1 pa 1 user supplied and rcf is a root cover density factor dimensionless 0 1 4 while channel beds are usually unvegetated using rcf 0 sometimes requires a negative k d value to accurately predict knickpoint migration rates therefore rem assumes rcf 1 4 and requires users to calibrate k d to match observed migration rates see supplementary material for more details this sub routine requires the user to input the initial location i e reach and station elevation height and k d of each knickpoint the position of each knickpoint is tracked as it migrates upstream including into any tributaries and bed elevations are adjusted accordingly however knickpoint height does not change as the knickpoint migrates the volume of eroded sediment is calculated based on migration distance knickpoint height and channel width a user specified proportion of this eroded sediment is added to the bed material load e g sand and gravel while the rest is considered washload e g silt and clay that is exported to the watershed outlet 3 model testing 3 1 generic model test while rem is suited for application to small watersheds there are no datasets for these types of systems with the necessary input data and sufficiently detailed monitoring of channel evolution across decadal time scales therefore we applied rem to a simple generic watershed to test its applicability in this context and confirm that rem can simulate the type of channel evolution we expect based on physical understanding of these processes we simulated channel evolution in a generic watershed with six distinct reaches the total channel length of 10 4 km corresponds to an approximate drainage area of 6 5 km2 hack 1957 eq 3 initial grain size 2 mm slope 0 003 and bank height 2 m were constant throughout the watershed channels were assumed to be straight with no meandering discharge was steady at a station but increased moving downstream upstream sediment supply was equal to the transport capacity of the undisturbed channel a full table of model inputs is included in supplementary material beginning with an initially stable channel we dropped the downstream elevation by 2 5 m including a 1 5 m tall knickpoint and modeled 20 years of resulting channel evolution given this base level drop we expected significant channel incision and bank failure with the area of disturbance migrating upstream with the knickpoint 3 2 colorado river 3 2 1 study area parker dam completed in 1938 is one of several large dams on the lower colorado river built for water supply and power generation like most hydropower dams parker dam altered flows and trapped sediment the combined effects of these changes caused the colorado river downstream from the dam to incise while the bed material coarsened williams and wolman 1984 3 2 2 data collection and modeling initial longitudinal profiles and grain size data for a 144 km reach downstream of parker dam were obtained from two u s bureau of reclamation reports u s bureau of reclamation 1948 1950 we used a single grain size distribution for the entire reach the pre dam grain size data were all finer than 2 mm however later observations included gravel up to 32 mm presumably unearthed as the channel incised since the channel coarsened over time and rem does not account for bed stratigraphy we adjusted the initial grain size distribution to include a small amount of coarser material average channel widths were calculated from 1938 aerial photographs norman et al 2006 and contemporary satellite imagery google earth pro 2017 we ran the model from 1938 to 1975 using daily discharge data from usgs gage 09427520 only bed elevation changes were modeled no bank erosion or meander migration was included we used a cross section spacing of 2000 m and a time step of 2400 s the total load sediment transport equation was used for all grain sizes 4 mm and the bedload equation for all coarser grain sizes we assumed no sediment inputs from upstream i e the dam trapped all sediment model results were compared to measured longitudinal profiles for a 66 km subreach from 27 to 93 km downstream of parker dam williams and wolman 1984 we also compared modeled d 50 to measured values from three cross sections 26 64 and 130 km downstream of parker dam williams and wolman 1984 in addition to the single model run described above we ran 5000 monte carlo simulations varying the initial grain size distribution channel width floodplain geometry roughness values and the exponent and coefficient of the hiding function sobol quasi random numbers using the gsl r package hankin 2006 were used to generate these variables since they provide more uniform coverage than simple random numbers sobol 1976 3 3 north fork toutle river 3 3 1 study area the north fork toutle river nftr was a typical gravel bed mountain river draining the northern slope of mount st helens on may 18 1980 after several months of increased volcanic activity a massive debris avalanche triggered an eruption this deposited about 2 8 km3 of sediment across the upper part of the nftr with depths averaging 45 m but reaching 140 m in some areas simon et al 1999 this massive sediment deposit buried the channel network of the upper nftr over the following months and years channels reformed from surface runoff pumping from spirit lake and multiple lahars volcanic debris or mudflows simon et al 1999 to prevent sedimentation in the downstream cowlitz and columbia rivers two sediment retention structures where built on the nftr the first n1 was built in summer 1980 and operated until it was breached in 1982 a second more permanent sediment retention structure the srs was built in 1987 and was essentially filled by 1998 simon et al 1999 zheng et al 2014 to prevent overtopping of spirit lake water was released into a nftr tributary see tr065 and tr070 in fig 2 at a constant rate of 5 1 m3 s 1 from november 1982 to august 1983 causing extreme incision up to 34 m paine 1984 for more details on the eruption and its effects see simon et al 1999 lipman and mullineaux 1981 and major et al 2018 3 3 2 data collection and modeling we modeled evolution of the upper nftr and its tributaries from september 1983 august 2011 we started the model 3 5 years after the eruption because there were more cross section data and this avoided several lahars and pumping from spirit lake which had complicated effects on channel adjustment following the eruption the usgs and army corps of engineers established several permanent cross sections which have been surveyed at irregular intervals since 1980 we used these data mosbrucker et al 2015 for 19 cross sections on the nftr and its tributaries to estimate initial channel and floodplain geometry fig 2 each of these cross sections defined a model reach with unique inputs initial bed grain size distributions were estimated from field data u s army corps of engineers 1988 paine 1984 we used the daily discharge series at the srs constructed by simon and klimetz 2012 from several nearby usgs gages these values were scaled by drainage area to give discharge in each reach we also used bank sediment properties œÑ c k cohesion unit weight and œï and manning s n values estimated by simon and klimetz 2012 we assumed no hillslope sediment supply since upland erosion peaked soon after the eruption and remained negligible compared to in stream sediment sources simon et al 1999 we used a model cross section spacing of 500 m a time step of 2400 s and the bedload sediment transport equation sediment specific gravity was adjusted to account for lighter volcanic material simon and klimetz 2012 eq 24 finally we assumed that 100 of the eroded bank material consisted of bed material load non cohesive bed erosion fluvial bank erosion and bank failure were modeled but no meander migration or knickpoint erosion was included we ran 5000 monte carlo simulations to quantify uncertainty varying initial grain size channel width channel roughness hiding function parameters and bank soil properties model accuracy was assessed by comparing modeled bed elevations to observations from survey data and a 1 m dem from 2009 mosbrucker 2014 other parameters e g d 50 and width were not used because only sparse grain size data were available and the simplified model cross sections could not adequately represent the complex observed channel geometries 3 4 sensitivity analysis for both case studies we performed sensitivity analyses to determine which variables most influence model output we used a density based method that estimates parameter sensitivity based on differences between conditional and unconditional probability density functions of model output plischke et al 2013 variables with a greater effect have bigger differences in these density functions this method has two advantages over other approaches it requires no unique input parameter sampling design e g saltelli et al 2010 and it requires much fewer model runs e g pianosi and wagener 2015 we therefore used the output from monte carlo simulations to compute the sensitivity indices bootstrapping with 1000 replicates was used to correct for bias and calculate uncertainty in sensitivity indices finally we incorporated a dummy variable to determine the threshold for influential variables this dummy variable is a simple set of random numbers that has no influence on the model and accounts for noise in the sensitivity analysis plischke et al 2013 khorashadi zadeh et al 2017 these sensitivity analyses are only applicable for each individual case study because each system has unique boundary conditions and relevant processes because of this it is necessary to perform a sensitivity analysis separately for every model application to understand what variables are most influential in each case for the colorado river we quantified sensitivity for two model outputs bed elevation and bed d 50 for the nftr channel width was also included to give a single output value for each model run we summed the absolute value of the total change in the variable e g bed elevation for all cross sections for the nftr a separate sensitivity analysis was performed for each reach for comparison among reaches we standardized the sensitivity indices by taking the difference between the index for each input and the dummy variable divided by the dummy variable index the variables included in each sensitivity analysis are shown in tables 1 and 2 all analyses of model outputs were done using r version 3 4 1 r core team 2018 4 results 4 1 generic model test fig 3 shows changes in bed elevation channel width and width depth ratio for the modeled test case the zone of disturbance migrated upstream through time with changes in channel width lagging slightly behind changes in bed elevation the greatest channel changes were at the far downstream end the area with greatest disturbance fig 4 shows changes in stream power bed elevation and channel width at two locations indicated in fig 3 a for both areas stream power was relatively constant until the knickpoint passed after which stream power spiked before slowly decreasing bed elevation and width show similar trends with abrupt changes following passage of the knickpoint after the initial drop in channel elevation both cross sections showed a period of aggradation followed by renewed incision sediment export from the watershed peaked early in the simulation and then decreased exponentially 4 2 colorado river fig 5 shows the error in predicted bed elevation and bed d 50 the median of the monte carlo simulations generally has lower error than the single model run for the bed elevation results fig 5 a c model error decreases over the course of the simulation although the uncertainty increases for the bed d 50 results fig 5 e g uncertainty is high for all sites but error generally decreases moving downstream fig 6 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis for bed elevation and bed d 50 outputs initial d 50 geometric standard deviation of the grain size distribution œÉ g and channel width have the largest influence on predicted bed elevation changes initial d 50 and œÉ g have a significant effect on the final d 50 while channel width and the hiding function parameters œâ c and b have only a small effect floodplain angle has a moderate effect on both outputs 4 3 north fork toutle river fig 7 shows modeled and observed bed elevations for the nftr the model predicted channel change well at the majority of sites mostly in the upper half of the watershed cw280 nf130 nf350 and nf405 these cross sections have generally low error in predicted final bed elevations normalized to the magnitude of total bed elevation change fig 8 median normalized error is 43 but is only 22 for reaches cw280 nf130 for the remainder of the cross sections the model did a relatively poor job of predicting changes in bed elevation there is substantial uncertainty for all sites especially in the upper half of the watershed e g 20 m wide 90 confidence interval the magnitude of uncertainty is generally less in the lower portion of the watershed where the magnitude of aggradation and incision was smaller the sensitivity results for the nftr model runs are summarized in fig 9 modeled bed elevation was influenced most by bank œÑ c bank cohesion and hiding function parameters œâ c and b channel width and initial bed grain size d 50 and œÉ g also had a minor effect modeled d 50 was influenced by similar variables but the hiding function parameters initial grain size and bank cohesion had a much larger effect for modeled channel width bank œÑ c was by far the most influential but initial width and œâ c also contributed to some observed model uncertainty 5 discussion 5 1 rem predicts realistic channel change the generic test case and field applications show that rem can realistically and accurately simulate channel evolution in the absence of avulsions and extensive lateral migration first the model test case matches physical understanding of channel evolution in response to disturbance in this case base level drop the greatest channel change is observed nearest the disturbance and rates and magnitudes of erosion decline nonlinearly with time and distance upstream fig 3 this is consistent with conceptual models of channel evolution schumm et al 1984 simon 1989 and experimental begin et al 1981 numerical simon and darby 1997 and field studies simon and rinaldi 2006 in general the channel incises which destabilizes the banks leading to rapid widening fig 4 as the upstream channel begins to erode large amounts of sediment are delivered downstream causing aggradation after this upstream sediment supply is cut off i e upstream channel erosion has slowed or stopped channel incision begins again this shift between degradation and aggradation depending on sediment delivery from upstream is an important control on channel evolution as demonstrated in both numerical modeling simon and darby 1997 and field studies simon and hupp 1992 downstream aggradation can help stabilize these reaches and allows the channel to more rapidly attain a new stable slope doyle and harbor 2003 disrupting this downstream sediment delivery for example by installing grade control structures can induce a second round of incision downstream simon and darby 2002 similar to what the modeling showed fig 4 following a disturbance the channel is expected to adjust rapidly with the rate of change slowing until the channel reaches some new stable state this results in an exponential decay in channel variables to some asymptote these variables may include stream power bull 1979 bledsoe et al 2002 sediment discharge simon 1999 bledsoe et al 2002 or bed elevation begin et al 1981 but all describe a reduction in the rate of energy dissipation simon 1992 modeling shows these exponential reductions in specific stream power and sediment discharge and an exponential increase in channel width fig 4 bed elevation follows a more complex trajectory but does decrease towards an asymptote during the second round of incision modeling from the nftr also shows this exponential decrease or increase in bed elevation fig 7 consistent with physical understanding of channel evolution in the colorado river modeling the greatest incision and bed coarsening were seen closest to the dam the disturbance with less channel change downstream data not shown furthermore rem accurately predicts the magnitude of channel incision in this system bed elevation rmse 0 7 1 5 m for all years bed material coarsening is also accurately predicted although errors are more variable d 50 rmse 0 1 5 mm in the nftr rem accurately predicts channel incision in the upper half of the watershed cw280 nf130 this portion of the channel is single thread while the downstream portion where the model error is higher is braided or avulsing features that were deliberately not incorporated into rem taken together these three model tests suggest that rem can predict channel evolution across decadal time scales in single thread systems with reasonable accuracy matching both physical understanding of channel change and adequately predicting evolution in real world dynamic fluvial systems further testing however is required in the smaller watersheds for which rem will most likely be applied while the physical processes are generally the same in these systems e g sediment transport bank erosion and failure it is possible that scale differences or other issues will be discovered during application to these smaller channel networks 5 2 model strengths and weaknesses rem s main strength is its parsimony and utility in simulating watershed scale channel evolution processes watershed scale assessment is essential because channel evolution is not limited to local disturbances or dynamics changes in both upstream and downstream channel form and sediment delivery affect local channel response e g schumm et al 1984 simon 1992 simon and darby 2002 both bed and bank erosion processes are especially important in smaller urban watersheds booth 1990 furthermore channel hardpoints i e bed and bank armoring can significantly influence local channel evolution and adjustment in other parts of the watershed booth and fischenich 2015 rem accounts for these processes enabling users to specify non erodible cross sections and may be an important tool for understanding urban channel network evolution other numerical models have been developed that include both bed and bank erosion but these are typically designed for reach scale application for example the concepts model langendoen and simon 2008 langendoen and alonso 2008 and darby and thorne 1996a model both include more detailed modeling than rem but cannot be easily applied at the watershed scale alternatively the watershed scale soil and water assessment tool swat allen et al 1999 mittelstet et al 2016 arnold et al 1998 has erosion processes for cohesive channels however rem incorporates cohesive and non cohesive erosion and bank failure rem includes the most important mechanisms to realistically simulate channel evolution while still keeping data requirements to a minimum another important strength of rem is its capacity to explicitly account for input variable uncertainty it automates the use of monte carlo simulations allowing users to easily quantify model uncertainty and produce probabilistic estimates of channel change quantifying uncertainty can be useful for decision making and assessing reliability of model outputs e g pappenberger and beven 2006 model field tests illustrate this in most cases it appears the median of the monte carlo simulations predicts river behavior as well or better than the single model run with the exception of nf130 and nf300 from the nftr fig 7 this suggests that accounting for uncertainty in the inputs can actually improve model accuracy how much uncertainty is too much must be determined by the model user because it depends on the question s being asked the model test cases show large uncertainty bounds this may seem discouraging but is an inescapable consequence of simulating complex and uncertain geomorphic systems shreve 1975 by quantifying this uncertainty we can at least be candid about confidence in the model s predictions the widths of the simulated uncertainty bounds are proportional to the magnitude of modeled bed elevation figs 5 and 7 and grain size fig 5 this is expected the larger the change the greater uncertainty rem is only applicable for single thread rivers it is therefore unsurprising that it could not adequately predict channel evolution in the downstream half of the nftr this section of the river migrates across a wide valley bottom and in the lower reaches the channel braids zheng et al 2017 in reality much of the channel is 15 20 m wide but may be within a several hundred meter wide valley the model cannot simulate the aggressive channel migration observed in the lower portion of the watershed and instead spreads the water out over an unrealistically wide modeled channel bottom fig 8 illustrates this issue showing how error in modeled bed elevation increases substantially where the valley widens just downstream of nf130 rem does include a meandering algorithm but this is not entirely mechanistic and is incorporated to allow single thread meandering channels an additional mode of slope adjustment this meandering algorithm was not incorporated into the nftr modeling other limitations are a consequence of rem s relative simplicity the model assumes uniform flow s o s f to calculate specific stream power and relies on new empirical equations to convert stream power to shear stress for cohesive erosion modeling this facilitates network scale analysis without detailed hydraulic modeling but may be a source of error this also neglects local complex flow hydraulics which can have an impact on channel change making it unsuitable for small scale analyses like bridge scour still rem has a strong physical basis integrating novel stream power based sediment transport models lammers and bledsoe 2018 with a well tested bank erosion algorithm bstem simon et al 2000 2011 that underwent systematic sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to identify the most parsimonious representation of essential physical processes lammers et al 2017 finally due to a lack of available data rem was not tested against field data sets on network scale channel response in smaller watersheds with cohesive banks while the generic model test case gives some indication of rem s applicability to these types of systems further testing is needed to determine how well rem can simulate channel response in these watersheds additional testing of the cohesive bed erosion meander migration and knickpoint retreat sub routines is also needed 5 3 model sensitivity sensitivity is a function of 1 how much an input influences model output and 2 how much the input varies sensitivity analyses can therefore reveal information about model structure and suggest which variables should be most accurately quantified to obtain the most reliable results rem sensitivity analyses largely confirm the validity of the model as important parameters are known to be linked to important channel evolution processes and are consistent with results reported in the literature bed elevation is most controlled by d 50 œÉ g width and floodplain angle colorado river fig 6 plus hiding function parameters and bank œÑ c and cohesion nftr fig 9 the size and erodibility of the bed material directly influences the extent of incision bank erodibility has a secondary effect by either allowing the channel to widen and reducing incision or limiting widening and forcing the channel to incise more simon 1992 other numerical models have shown that bed d 50 has a significant effect on modeled channel profiles el kadi abderrezzak et al 2008 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2009 however darby and thorne 1996b found that d 50 had a minimal effect compared to discharge predicted bed d 50 was most influenced by initial grain size distribution in the colorado river case study fig 6 but hiding function parameters were equally or more influential for the nftr fig 9 others have also shown that hiding function parameters in their case critical shear stress and the hiding factor control modeled grain sizes ruark et al 2011 hoey and ferguson 1994 the nftr results also show that bank œÑ c and cohesion had an influence on modeled d 50 sediment from bank erosion has the same grain size distribution as the initial bed sediment as the bed coarsens bank erosion therefore becomes a source of finer grains channel width was controlled most by bank œÑ c fig 9 this suggests that fluvial erosion not mass failure was the dominant bank erosion process in the nftr darby and thorne 1996b also found that œÑ c had a much greater influence on channel widening than bank cohesion the three variables controlling bank failure cohesion œï and weight all had similar relative importance unlike other sensitivity analyses of bank erosion models that found cohesion was the dominant control on bank stability lammers et al 2017 van de wieland darby 2007 parker et al 2008 samadi et al 2009 these studies also did not show that œÑ c was important possibly because they did not model cumulative bank erosion and therefore did not incorporate the threshold effect of œÑ c determining when erosion occurs despite its relative simplicity rem is dependent on field data which may be difficult to collect at a network scale however the sensitivity results provide guidance on which variables should be most accurately quantified to yield the best model results this is especially important for bank œÑ c which has a strong influence on the model is subject to considerable uncertainty and is difficult to measure in the field wynn et al 2008 konsoer et al 2016 daly et al 2015 bank œÑ c may need to be estimated through model calibration to provide more reliable model inputs than field measurements 5 4 future improvements and applications there are a number of modifications that could improve model predictions coupling rem with an upland erosion model would provide more realistic estimates of sediment inputs and channel response e g stryker et al 2017 furthermore floodplains can be significant sediment sinks kronvang et al 2007 fryirs and brierley 2001 although floodplain sedimentation likely has a larger effect on fine sediment delivery e g walling et al 1998 than the bed material load that controls channel incision and aggradation adding these processes may improve model predictions but this extra complexity also increases data requirements and uncertainty it is important to balance the need to incorporate relevant processes while retaining the simplicity that makes rem applicable at the watershed scale rem has a number of potential applications both in river management and research for example channel erosion can be a significant but difficult to quantify source of fine sediment and phosphorus pollution in watersheds fox et al 2016 rem could be used to estimate loading of these pollutants at watershed scales urban stormwater management or mismanagement is a leading cause of channel degradation walsh et al 2016 2005 while certain stormwater design standards can help mitigate channel degradation e g tillinghast et al 2011 rem may allow a more comprehensive analysis of channel stability when coupled with a stormwater management model rem also has a number of research applications the search for an optimal or equilibrium channel form has intrigued scientists for decades e g langbein and leopold 1964 yang et al 1981 millar 2005 huang et al 2014 tools like rem can be used to explore this concept in more detail looking beyond the optimal channel cross section and examining interactions between parts of a network and their influence on watershed scale channel evolution 6 conclusions we present a new model for simulating channel evolution at the watershed scale this model is based on specific stream power and does not require detailed hydraulic modeling results from a generic test case of channel response to base level lowering match physical understanding of channel evolution the model also accurately predicts channel incision and bed coarsening for a reach of the lower colorado river below parker dam in the north fork toutle river the model accurately predicted channel incision and widening in the upper portion of the watershed where the channel remained single thread model predictions were poor in the lower watershed where the river migrated significantly across the valley floor a behavior that rem is not designed to simulate results from these case studies suggest the model can provide useful predictions of watershed scale channel erosion while recognizing it is limited to single thread channels importantly the model can also account for uncertainty in input variables allowing for a probabilistic assessment of channel change more model testing is required to fully understand its capabilities and limitations for example rem s ability to simulate cohesive incision knickpoint migration or meandering was not tested because of a lack of sufficient field data further testing is also warranted on the smaller watersheds i e 10 100 km2 for which rem was designed understanding how and how much rivers may change under future climate and land use variability is an essential question for sustainable river management other tools have been developed to estimate watershed sediment dynamics czuba et al 2017 schmitt et al 2016 czuba and foufoula georgiou 2014 and erosion and deposition potential soar et al 2017 parker et al 2015 in smaller urbanizing watersheds however channel changes are driven by both bed and bank erosion processes booth 1990 and strongly influenced by channel armoring and other channel improvements booth and fischenich 2015 by accounting for these processes rem can provide insight into urban stream evolution additionally the model can be used to test different mitigation strategies for example by simulating how the river erodes under different stormwater and or stream restoration scenarios to support cost effective and successful solutions to address excessive channel erosion acknowledgments this work was partially funded by the

6982,emitter discharge is one of the most important parameters considered in the design operation and management of subsurface irrigation systems the emitter discharge if properly chosen can eliminate surface runoff and minimize deep percolation water losses the discharge from a ceramic emitter depends on the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity so it is important to determine the optimal working levels for these two design parameters in this work it is confirmed that the hydrus 2d predictions of the cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front are in good agreement with experimental results and that the hydrus 2d model can be used to accurately simulate soil water movement under subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters additional simulations with hydrus 2d were used to study the effects of various design parameters i e working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity on emitter discharges in soils deep percolation and soil wetting fronts results show that both the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity have significant impact on the discharge of emitters in soil and the deep percolation water losses the emitter discharge in soil decreases with time and finally stabilizes when the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity are higher the stable discharge emitter discharge in soil at 120 h is greater and this situation may increase the risk of deep percolation the relationship between the working pressure head ceramic hydraulic conductivity and stable discharge is developed as a power function to satisfy the water requirements of trees with an active layer of root systems down to about 0 100 cm in the loess plateau in china and reduce the risk of deep percolation it is recommended that the working pressure head should be 20 50 cm of water and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity should be between 0 1 and 1 9 cm h 1 keywords subsurface irrigation discharge ceramic hydraulic conductivity working pressure head hydrus 2d 1 introduction subsurface irrigation with water distribution emitters installed below the soil surface supplies water directly to the plant roots and maintains a relatively dry soil surface which reduces evaporation losses and ensures high water use efficiency ghazouani et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 subsurface irrigation by automatic devices like pitchers pot or porous pipes is a water saving technology moisture is emitted by capillary suction of a relatively dry soil and thirsty roots just in right quantities spontaneously and continuously i e without any electronic or mechanical controls kacimov and obnosov 2017 however irrigation of crops with pitchers or ceramic tubes is seldom scaled up in modern field conditions bainbridge 2001 one of the problems is that the discharges and manufacture deviations of these devices are difficult to be precisely controlled naik et al 2013 other problems include the flow rate does not meet the crop water requirements and the current tendency of emitter manufacturing is to reduce emitter discharge to values comparable to the fluxes of root water uptake phene et al 1991 dabach et al 2015 in the past few years a ceramic emitter with controllable emitter discharge and lower manufacture deviation has been developed cai et al 2015 2017c the working pressure head of ceramic emitter is usually smaller than 100 cm but it can be negative or close to zero ashrafi et al 2002 kato and tejima 1982 if the working pressure is negative or zero the emitter discharge decreases gradually as the soil water content increases around the emitter lazarovitch et al 2005 provenzano 2008b when soil water content attains saturated water content the emitter discharge will be zero when the soil moisture decreases the flow from the emitter to the soil will be resumed there is a feedback regulation relationship between the water content and emitter discharge cai et al 2017c kacimov and obnosov 2017 in the field environments the conditions in which working pressure is negative or zero seldom occur unless there is a special water supply to provide water for the emitter li et al 2017a b to reduce system costs the working pressure head of emitter is better to be a positive value emitter discharge is one of the most important parameters considered in the design operation and management of subsurface irrigation lamm et al 2007 if the working pressure head at a ceramic emitter is positive the discharge depends on the gradient of total potential around the emitter and the soil water potential in the soil around the emitter may be at positive pressure cai et al 2017b shani et al 1996 found that the soil water potential became positive in soils with a lower infiltration capacity compared with the emitter discharge in air where a small pressure difference across the emitter led to the discharge from the emitter decreasing compared with the emitter discharge in air thus the emitter discharge in soil decreases due to the positive pressure in the soil water around the emitter and a reduction of 10 50 in the discharge rate has been measured for unplugged subsurface emitters gil et al 2008 2010a if emitter discharges are excessively high water losses and the reduced availability of water to crop roots may occur because of deep percolation deep percolation wastes water and it also causes problems such as environmental pollution by nutrient chemical and pesticides leaching qiu et al 2017 therefore it is very important to reduce water seepage and improve the irrigation efficiency based on scientific irrigation practices lamm et al 2007 grimes et al 1969 stated that a curvilinear relationship between yield and seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration was due to a probable decrease in efficiency of water utilization by the plant and potential deep percolation below the effective root zone at the highest irrigation level 125 fully irrigated treatment in this research ayars et al 1999 demonstrated that the use of high frequency irrigation reduced deep percolation and increased the water use efficiency from shallow ground water when crops were grown in high water table areas theoretically given a seasonal irrigation total high irrigation frequency will have a smaller wetted volume and maintains a higher mean soil water content as compared to low irrigation frequency irmak et al 2016 therefore it is also possible that deep percolation could become a problem during longer irrigation events lamm et al 2007 in subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters the supply of water might be continuous so the irrigation event would be equal to the whole growth stage thus it is very important to select reasonable ceramic emitter discharge the discharge from a ceramic emitter is determined by the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity so it is important to determine the optimal working levels for these two parameters working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity to meet the water requirements of crops and reduce the risk of deep percolation hydrus 2d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2006 2016 is the most widely used computer software package for predicting water movement in two dimensional variably saturated porous media brunetti et al 2017 phogat et al 2014 many studies have simulated water movement in subsurface irrigation conditions with clay pipes pitchers and ceramic emitters using this model cai et al 2017a moniruzzaman et al 2011 siyal et al 2009 siyal and skaggs 2009 verified the performance of the hydrus model in simulating wetting front under subsurface irrigation with clay pipes and the simulated and observed soil moisture data have a good consistency hydrus 2d was used to analyze water movement under negative pressure irrigation with porous ceramic pipes by wang et al 2017 and a good agreement between the simulated and measured cumulative water infiltration values and the position of wetting front was obtained however in these simulations a clay pipe was represented as a type of line source flow but a ceramic emitter is much smaller than a clay pipe and the water movement process is an axisymmetrical process when only a single emitter is used for irrigation thus it is necessary to investigate whether the hydrus 2d model can be used to simulate water movement for ceramic emitters the objectives of this research are to 1 compare hydrus 2d simulations of water infiltration with soil tank experimental data of subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters 2 evaluate the impact of technical parameters working pressure head h and ceramic hydraulic conductivity ke on discharge of ceramic emitters in soils stable discharge q discharge of emitters in soil at 120 h and the deep percolation fluxes 3 establish a simple and convenient mathematical equation to predict emitter discharge 4 determine the appropriate working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity for the correct irrigation system design process 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory soil tank experiments 2 1 1 laboratory setup the laboratory experiments were performed in a three dimensional soil tank 0 4 m 0 2 m 0 4 m made of polymethyl methacrylate which allowed soil water movements to be observed easily in the front panel a ceramic emitter was fed by a mariotte bottle diameter 10 cm volume 7 85 l fig 1 a the porous ceramic emitter fig 1b was cut into two symmetrical parts and a half of the ceramic emitter was fixed onto the front polymethyl methacrylate panel fig 1c to prevent preferential flow along the wall surface a layer of vaseline was smeared on the inner wall of the soil tank before filling with soil to create a coarse surface after sieving air dried loam soil 24 5 clay 39 3 silt and 36 2 sand with an initial soil water content of 0 15 cm3 cm 3 was used to fill the soil tank with an average soil bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 loading and compaction of the soil in the tank were conducted in 5 cm layers to obtain a homogeneous soil profile the soil was placed in the tank and manually compacted using a square steel pad of area 50 cm2 10 cm 5 cm and weighing 0 6 kg the pad was lifted approximately 30 cm and dropped freely to the soil surface the upper surface of each layer should be rough sufficiently to avoid the occurrence of soil stratification in the soil tank experiment ceramic emitters with two different hydraulic conductivities were used as two cases which were denoted as emitter 1 and emitter 2 for each case only one ceramic emitter was installed at a depth of 15 cm and it was connected to the mariotte bottle with an 8 mm rubber pipe to supply water to the emitter the working pressure heads of ceramic emitter 1 and emitter 2 the height difference between the delivery port of the mariotte bottle and the center point of ceramic emitted were 24 cm and 84 cm respectively the shape of the wetting front and the cumulative infiltration were recorded from 0 to 5 h the shape of the wetting front was drawn on the front of the polymethyl methacrylate panel with an interval of 0 5 h for the first 3 h and then with an interval of 1 h for the last 2 h wetting front data collection was performed using auto cad 2007 software autodesk inc usa first multi segment lines were used to depict the wetting front shapes at different times second multi line lines were extracted to coordinate so the irregular shape of the wetting front image was converted into data coordinates finally the horizontal wetting front was read from the data coordinates as same to upward and downward vertical wetting front the cumulative infiltration volume was equal to the product of the cross sectional area and the difference in the water level in the mariotte bottle 2 1 2 emitter hydraulic conductivity the porous ceramic emitters were made of silica talc and silica sol and they were sintered in a tunnel furnace the open porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic emitters were controlled by altering the grain size of the silica fig 1b the values of air entry point for emitter 1 and emitter 2 were 940 cm and 860 cm respectively the saturated water content of each ceramic emitter was measured using the drying method the relationship between the differential working pressure head and emitter discharge can be derived from darcy s

different working pressure heads ranging from 0 to 100 cm 2 1 3 soil hydraulic properties the soil water retention curve was determined using the centrifugal method with a high speed centrifuge cr21g pf hitachi japan the hydraulic parameters of the soil were fitted using the retc code schaap et al 2001 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the soil was measured using the falling head method in the laboratory 2 2 hydrus 2d simulations 2 2 1 numerical modeling theory water seepage from the ceramic emitter into the soil is simulated using the hydrus 2d software package ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2006 assuming the soil is homogeneous and isotropic only one ceramic emitter is used as a cylindrical source of water in both sets of experiments where the water movement during the infiltration process is considered as an axisymmetrical process three dimensional axisymmetrical flow in variably unsaturated rigid isotropic porous media can be described by richards equation 3 Œ∏ t 1 r r r k h h r z k h h z k h z where Œ∏ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 t is the time t z and r are the radial and vertical positive upward space coordinates respectively l and k h is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 the soil water content h and hydraulic conductivity k h are described by the analytical functions of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 as follows 4 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ r 1 Œ± h n m h 0 Œ∏ s h 0 5 k h k s s

empirical parameter l l whose value is approximately equal to the inverse of the air entry value and n and m are the van genuchten mualem shape parameters the parameters of soil hydraulic properties are set as test values and shown in table 1 2 2 2 system geometry and boundary conditions the active layer for most fruit tree root systems is about 100 cm li et al 2017a b sharma et al 2017 surikova et al 2011 thus a soil profile of depth z 100 cm is used in the simulations the simulations are conducted by considering a soil profile with a width r 50 cm where a ceramic emitter with a lip a 0 5 cm impermeable layer is placed at a depth d on the plane of symmetry for comparing simulated and measured results d 15 cm for other scenarios d 45 cm the geometry and boundary conditions defining the physical problem in this study are shown in fig 2 the ceramic emitter internal boundary nodes are assigned at constant pressure head values 24 cm for emitter 1 and 84 cm for emitter 2 which are identical to the pressure head values implemented in the soil tank laboratory experiments a free drainage boundary condition is used for the bottom boundary the surface boundary condition is set as an atmospheric boundary condition where the water evaporation rate is 0 4 cm d 1 daily variations in the evaporation rate are not considered no flow boundary conditions are assumed at the boundaries for water transport on the left and right sides of the flow domain 2 2 3 initial conditions for the soil and emitter the initial water content values are set uniform across the flow domain at about 0 15 cm3 cm 3 the water content values are converted into soil pressure head using eq 4 with parameter values listed in table 1 which is about 6800 cm the ceramic emitter is initially saturated and therefore initial water contents of the ceramic emitters are set at saturated water content i e about 0 29 for emitter 1 and 0 31 for emitter 2 the pressure head values are all shown in table 2 2 2 4 emitter hydraulic properties the structure pores in the ceramic material is similar to the soil structure so ceramic emitters can release or uptake water as the soil does thus the water retention of ceramic materials can also be described by the van genuchten mualem model in the simulations there are six hydraulic parameters for the ceramic emitter Œ∏s Œ∏r Œ± n ke and l a small value of Œ± 1 00 10 8 cm 1 is used to maintain the ceramic emitter saturated throughout the simulations siyal and skaggs 2009 because the other unsaturated parameters Œ∏s Œ∏r n and l are not sensitive to the results and thus Œ∏r n and l were taken as 0 078 1 900 and 0 5 respectively table 1 Œ∏s is set at experimental test value a linear relationship is observed between the emitter discharge and the working pressure head fig 3 so that the ceramic hydraulic conductivity is calculated with eq 1 the values of ceramic hydraulic conductivity used in the simulations are listed in table 1 2 3 evaluation of the modeling results the agreement between the hydrus 2d model predictions and the measured data was evaluated using the mean relative error mre normalized root mean square error nrmse and the coefficient of determination r2 willmott 1982 6 mre 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 7 nrmse 1 o 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 8 r 2 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where pi is the predicted value oi is the observed value n is the number of values compared and isthemeanoftheobserveddata is the mean of the observed data mre simply reflects the difference between the predictions and measured results and an mre absolute value less than 15 means that the model exhibits good stability and applicability an nrmse value less than 0 20 indicates very good consistency between the predictions and measured results whereas a nrmse value greater than 0 30 indicates a considerable difference between the two results the coefficient of determination can range from negative infinity to 1 r2 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the simulated and measured data in the best condition it is assumed that the values of the mre and nrmse are small and the values of r2 are close to 1 shwetha and varija 2015 2 4 statistical analyses

r2 dai et al 2018 2 5 model application and simulation scenarios after validating the model the effects of h and ke on the emitter discharge in soil and the wetting front were investigated the input data for the simulations working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the hydrus 2d model fig 4 shows the measured and simulated cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front for emitter 1 and emitter 2 the results show that there is a strong correlation between the simulated and measured cumulative infiltration for both emitters within 5 h as shown in fig 4 a the mre nrmse and r2 values for the cumulative infiltration are 0 9 0 022 and 0 998 for emitter 1 respectively and 7 2 0 079 and 0 981 for emitter 2 the mre values below 15 the nrmse values are smaller than 0 2 and the r2 values are close to 1 indicating that the hydrus 2d is highly suitable for simulating the cumulative infiltration from the ceramic emitters under different hydraulic conductivity and working pressure heads the wetting front of ceramic emitter in loam is approximately elliptical under the influence of gravity the upward vertical wetting front is less than the horizontal wetting front and the horizontal wetting front less than the downward vertical wetting front for simplicity only the data for the horizontal wetting front are given the horizontal wetting fronts observed during the soil tank experiment are compared with the hydrus 2d simulations in fig 4 b the mre and nrmse values for the horizontal wetting fronts are 11 2 and 0 130 for emitter 1 respectively and 9 4 and 0 10 for emitter 2 the mre values are smaller than 15 the nrmse values for the wetting distances in the horizontal direction are smaller than 0 20 the r2 values for the two cases are 0 900 and 0 930 close to 1 the results show that the simulated wetting front agree well with the measured results based on the cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front it can be concluded that the hydrus 2d model gives highly accurate predictions of soil water movements under subsurface irrigation for ceramic emitters with different working pressure heads and two hydraulic conductivities thus numerical simulations with the hydrus 2d model are used in this study to investigate the effect of the working pressure head and hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic emitter on the emitter discharge and the deep percolation rate 3 2 predicted flow characteristics fig 5 shows the simulated emitter discharge as a function of time at various h and ke values over a period of 40 h for simplicity the data of only nine cases are shown as shown in fig 5 a when h is 0 cm the emitter discharge decreases rapidly at the beginning of the experiments and finally reaches a steady state for example the emitter discharge decreases to a stabilized value of 0 15 l h 1 after about 18 h when ke is 0 1 cm h 1 when h is 0 cm water will evaporate from the surface of the saturated emitter but the evaporation rate emitter discharge is very small so we assume that the emitter discharge in air is 0 l h 1 meanwhile emitter discharge in soil is greater than 0 l h 1 under this zero pressure condition fig 5 a this is because when h is 0 cm the soil matric potential soil suction will suck the water from the emitter the outflow driving force for the emitter is the soil matric potential in soil therefore as soil matric potential changes so would the rate of emitter discharge the soil was dry in the flow domain initially the negative soil matric potential caused a water potential difference inside h 0 and outside soil matric potential the emitter and thus the emitter discharge was very high as shown by eqs 1 and 2 as the irrigation water entered and wetted the soil the difference in water potential decreased and resulted in the emitter discharge decreased as shown in fig 5 b when h and ke are 50 cm and 0 1 cm h 1 respectively the emitter discharge decreases to a stabilized value of 0 29 l h 1 after about 23 h the emitter discharge in soil is initially higher than that in air then the emitter stabilized discharge in the soil is equal to that in air as the time increases when the emitter discharge in air is equal to the maximum infiltration capacity of the soil the soil water potential is zero and the soil water potential will not restrain outflow from the emitter however when h and ke are 50 cm and 0 5 cm h 1 respectively the emitter discharge in the soil is smaller than that in air as the time increases fig 5 b as shown in fig 5 c when h and ke are 100 cm and 3 cm h 1 respectively the emitter discharge decreases to a stabilized value after 30 h when h is positive and the emitter discharge in air is greater than the maximum infiltration capacity of the soil the outflow driving forces for the emitter are the soil water potential and h as a result the soil water potential can change from negative to a positive value when the soil water potential is positive the soil water potential reduces the outflow from the emitter warrick and shani 1996 provenzano 2008b so the emitter discharge in the soil is smaller than that in air as shown in fig 5 c the soil water potential values around the ceramic emitter after 120 h at different h and ke values as calculated using eqs 1 and 2 are presented in table 3 when h is 0 cm the soil water potential is negative regardless the ke value when h exceeds 70 cm the soil water potential is positive even when ke is 0 1 cm h 1 as shown in table 3 when h is 50 cm ke is 0 1 cm h 1 and the soil water potential is only 0 09 cm a negligible value so the emitter discharge in the soil is close to that in air fig 5 b therefore during the design of an irrigation system with a ceramic emitter it is necessary to consider the possible reductions in the emitter discharge in the soil gil et al 2010b the h and ke values of ceramic emitter must be selected carefully to avoid a buildup of positive backpressure in the soil around the emitter which might reduce emitter discharge when the soil water potential changes slightly with time it means that the difference between h and soil water potential is approaching to a stable condition so the emitter discharge approaches a constant value corresponding to discharge in soil at 120 h the constant emitter discharge is then designated as the stable discharge q the stable discharge q at different h and ke values are presented in fig 6 the higher h and ke values the greater the q the maximum stable discharge 2 80 l h 1 is about 19 times the minimum value 0 15 l h 1 based on the data shown in fig 6 a regression model has been developed to predict q as a function of h and ke 9 q 0 67 0 04 h 1 01 1 04 k e 0 11 0 05 h 1 01 k e 0 11 r 2 0 99 this equation is valid for h lower than 100 cm and 0 1 cm h 1 ke 3 0 cm h 1 and can be used in designing a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters in loam to satisfy the water requirements of crops q must be greater than the water consumption rate of crops zhu and wu 2004 studied at the central loess plateau in china 36o55 n 109o00 e and found that the water requirement of apple trees is about 580 mm during the growing period where the maximum daily water consumption rate in the fruit growth stage july and april was about 4 13 mm d 1 at that time rainfall is abundant on the loess plateau where the rainfall intensity is higher than 2 43 mm d 1 if apple trees are planted with a 2 5 m within row spacing and with 4 m between the rows to reduce the irrigation cost the stable discharge q must be larger than 0 71 l h 1 if only one ceramic emitter is buried in the soil near an apple tree then according to eq 9 q will meet the water requirements of apple trees when ke 0 5 cm h 1 and h 63 cm or when ke 2 0 cm h 1 h only needs to be larger than 18 cm however when there are two ceramic emitters buried in the soil near an apple tree when ke 0 5 cm h 1 h can be as low as 10 cm in subsurface drip irrigation root intrusion is a unique problem that can reduce emitter discharge and system uniformity lamm et al 2007 the problem of root intrusion can be significantly reduced by using the ceramic emitters but the problem relates to the possibility that roots wrap the ceramic emitters completely and block the flow in emitters still exists fig 7 when this problem happens it is better to increase h to ensure q meet the requirements of trees therefore in the design of a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters it is better to choose a higher ke with a lower h if root wrapping conditions occur the farmers can increase h to ensure q meet the requirements of trees 3 3 risk assessment for deep percolation during the actual operation of an irrigation system if q is excessively high the soil water content may exceed the field capacity of the soil and water may percolate below the root zone due to the action of gravity fig 8 shows the wetting patterns simulated in loam at three different h and ke values listed in table 2 after irrigating for 120 h as shown in fig 8 case 13 when h 50 cm and ke 0 1 cm h 1 the downward vertical wetting front is about 43 cm and the irrigation water has not reached the bottom of the flow domain so deep percolation has been avoided according to fig 8 case 15 when h 50 cm and ke 0 5 cm h 1 the downward vertical wetting front is greater than 55 cm and some of the irrigation water moves out of the soil profile becoming unavailable for crops so there is a slight loss due to deep percolation when h 50 cm and ke 3 cm h 1 fig 8 case 17 the soil water content is almost 0 38 cm3 cm 3 which is much larger than the field capacity and close to the saturated soil water content in the soil profile in this case the soil air content is low thereby inhibiting seed germination and crop growth as well as wasting excessive amounts of water due to deep percolation fig 9 shows the variation in the deep percolation rate at different values of h and ke the deep percolation rate increases as h and ke increases when h is 0 cm and 20 cm the deep percolation rate is equal to 0 however when h is 100 cm and ke is 3 cm h 1 the deep percolation rate is up to 25 9 which demonstrates that 25 9 of the irrigation water is ineffective in a correctly designed subsurface irrigation system the water use efficiency should be higher than 95 so the deep percolation rate needs to less than 5 to improve the benefits for crops provenzano 2008a thus when h 100 cm and ke 0 8 cm h 1 the risk of deep percolation is low in addition if h is less than 50 cm then regardless of the value of ke the percolation rate is less than 5 and the risk of deep percolation is low in previous studies we found that ke was controlled by the open porosity of the ceramic emitter cai et al 2015a where the flexure strength of the ceramic emitter was smaller when the open porosity was higher cai et al 2015b it is normally better to have a high flexure strength for a ceramic emitter therefore a ceramic emitter with a lower ke should be chosen if the hydraulic conductivity is too low the emitter discharge will not fulfill the crop water requirements when the active layer for tree root systems is about 0 100 cm even if h is 100 cm the wetting front is smaller than 50 cm when ke is 0 1 cm h 1 thus ke should be greater than 0 1 cm h 1 it is not easy to set the working pressure head of a ceramic emitter lower than 20 cm under field conditions except by using a special water supply device such as a negative pressure generator li et al 2017a b or a constant pressure water tank chen et al 2004 which might greatly increase the system cost thus the working pressure head of the ceramic emitter should be higher than 20 cm when h and ke are excessively high the stable discharge will be large and regions of positive pressure will form around the emitter thereby destroying the soil structure and degrading the normal functioning of the emitter wu et al 2008 thus according to the requirement for a stable discharge and avoiding the risk of deep percolation the appropriate working pressure head should be 20 50 cm and the hydraulic conductivity needs to be 0 1 1 9 cm h 1 4 summary in this study the validity of using hydrus 2d for simulating water infiltration under subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitter was evaluated cumulative infiltration r2 0 981 0 998 and horizontal wetting front r2 0 900 0 930 predicted with hydrus 2d were in good agreement with experimental results it can be concluded that the hydrus 2d model can be used to accurately simulate water movement with ceramic emitters when the working pressure head is positive hydrus 2d can be a useful tool for investigating and designing subsurface irrigation systems with ceramic emitters the emitter discharge in soil decreases rapidly at the beginning and then reaches a steady state the changes of the emitter discharge in soil result from variations in the soil water potential the stable discharge is large when the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity are high the relationship of working pressure head ceramic hydraulic conductivity and stable discharge can be described by a power function the risk of water percolating into deep soils is large when both the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity are high furthermore excessive working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity may destroy the soil structure and severely affect the normal functioning of the emitter a lower hydraulic conductivity is recommended for ceramic emitters to meet the flexure strength requirements and the working pressure head of the ceramic emitter should be higher than 20 cm based on cost reduction considerations therefore to satisfy the water requirements of trees in loess plateau in china and reduce the risk of deep percolation the appropriate working pressure head should be between 20 and 50 cm and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity should be 0 1 1 9 cm h 1 acknowledgements the authors gratefully

6982,emitter discharge is one of the most important parameters considered in the design operation and management of subsurface irrigation systems the emitter discharge if properly chosen can eliminate surface runoff and minimize deep percolation water losses the discharge from a ceramic emitter depends on the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity so it is important to determine the optimal working levels for these two design parameters in this work it is confirmed that the hydrus 2d predictions of the cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front are in good agreement with experimental results and that the hydrus 2d model can be used to accurately simulate soil water movement under subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters additional simulations with hydrus 2d were used to study the effects of various design parameters i e working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity on emitter discharges in soils deep percolation and soil wetting fronts results show that both the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity have significant impact on the discharge of emitters in soil and the deep percolation water losses the emitter discharge in soil decreases with time and finally stabilizes when the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity are higher the stable discharge emitter discharge in soil at 120 h is greater and this situation may increase the risk of deep percolation the relationship between the working pressure head ceramic hydraulic conductivity and stable discharge is developed as a power function to satisfy the water requirements of trees with an active layer of root systems down to about 0 100 cm in the loess plateau in china and reduce the risk of deep percolation it is recommended that the working pressure head should be 20 50 cm of water and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity should be between 0 1 and 1 9 cm h 1 keywords subsurface irrigation discharge ceramic hydraulic conductivity working pressure head hydrus 2d 1 introduction subsurface irrigation with water distribution emitters installed below the soil surface supplies water directly to the plant roots and maintains a relatively dry soil surface which reduces evaporation losses and ensures high water use efficiency ghazouani et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 subsurface irrigation by automatic devices like pitchers pot or porous pipes is a water saving technology moisture is emitted by capillary suction of a relatively dry soil and thirsty roots just in right quantities spontaneously and continuously i e without any electronic or mechanical controls kacimov and obnosov 2017 however irrigation of crops with pitchers or ceramic tubes is seldom scaled up in modern field conditions bainbridge 2001 one of the problems is that the discharges and manufacture deviations of these devices are difficult to be precisely controlled naik et al 2013 other problems include the flow rate does not meet the crop water requirements and the current tendency of emitter manufacturing is to reduce emitter discharge to values comparable to the fluxes of root water uptake phene et al 1991 dabach et al 2015 in the past few years a ceramic emitter with controllable emitter discharge and lower manufacture deviation has been developed cai et al 2015 2017c the working pressure head of ceramic emitter is usually smaller than 100 cm but it can be negative or close to zero ashrafi et al 2002 kato and tejima 1982 if the working pressure is negative or zero the emitter discharge decreases gradually as the soil water content increases around the emitter lazarovitch et al 2005 provenzano 2008b when soil water content attains saturated water content the emitter discharge will be zero when the soil moisture decreases the flow from the emitter to the soil will be resumed there is a feedback regulation relationship between the water content and emitter discharge cai et al 2017c kacimov and obnosov 2017 in the field environments the conditions in which working pressure is negative or zero seldom occur unless there is a special water supply to provide water for the emitter li et al 2017a b to reduce system costs the working pressure head of emitter is better to be a positive value emitter discharge is one of the most important parameters considered in the design operation and management of subsurface irrigation lamm et al 2007 if the working pressure head at a ceramic emitter is positive the discharge depends on the gradient of total potential around the emitter and the soil water potential in the soil around the emitter may be at positive pressure cai et al 2017b shani et al 1996 found that the soil water potential became positive in soils with a lower infiltration capacity compared with the emitter discharge in air where a small pressure difference across the emitter led to the discharge from the emitter decreasing compared with the emitter discharge in air thus the emitter discharge in soil decreases due to the positive pressure in the soil water around the emitter and a reduction of 10 50 in the discharge rate has been measured for unplugged subsurface emitters gil et al 2008 2010a if emitter discharges are excessively high water losses and the reduced availability of water to crop roots may occur because of deep percolation deep percolation wastes water and it also causes problems such as environmental pollution by nutrient chemical and pesticides leaching qiu et al 2017 therefore it is very important to reduce water seepage and improve the irrigation efficiency based on scientific irrigation practices lamm et al 2007 grimes et al 1969 stated that a curvilinear relationship between yield and seasonal actual crop evapotranspiration was due to a probable decrease in efficiency of water utilization by the plant and potential deep percolation below the effective root zone at the highest irrigation level 125 fully irrigated treatment in this research ayars et al 1999 demonstrated that the use of high frequency irrigation reduced deep percolation and increased the water use efficiency from shallow ground water when crops were grown in high water table areas theoretically given a seasonal irrigation total high irrigation frequency will have a smaller wetted volume and maintains a higher mean soil water content as compared to low irrigation frequency irmak et al 2016 therefore it is also possible that deep percolation could become a problem during longer irrigation events lamm et al 2007 in subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters the supply of water might be continuous so the irrigation event would be equal to the whole growth stage thus it is very important to select reasonable ceramic emitter discharge the discharge from a ceramic emitter is determined by the working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity so it is important to determine the optimal working levels for these two parameters working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity to meet the water requirements of crops and reduce the risk of deep percolation hydrus 2d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2006 2016 is the most widely used computer software package for predicting water movement in two dimensional variably saturated porous media brunetti et al 2017 phogat et al 2014 many studies have simulated water movement in subsurface irrigation conditions with clay pipes pitchers and ceramic emitters using this model cai et al 2017a moniruzzaman et al 2011 siyal et al 2009 siyal and skaggs 2009 verified the performance of the hydrus model in simulating wetting front under subsurface irrigation with clay pipes and the simulated and observed soil moisture data have a good consistency hydrus 2d was used to analyze water movement under negative pressure irrigation with porous ceramic pipes by wang et al 2017 and a good agreement between the simulated and measured cumulative water infiltration values and the position of wetting front was obtained however in these simulations a clay pipe was represented as a type of line source flow but a ceramic emitter is much smaller than a clay pipe and the water movement process is an axisymmetrical process when only a single emitter is used for irrigation thus it is necessary to investigate whether the hydrus 2d model can be used to simulate water movement for ceramic emitters the objectives of this research are to 1 compare hydrus 2d simulations of water infiltration with soil tank experimental data of subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters 2 evaluate the impact of technical parameters working pressure head h and ceramic hydraulic conductivity ke on discharge of ceramic emitters in soils stable discharge q discharge of emitters in soil at 120 h and

for the correct irrigation system design process 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory soil tank experiments 2 1 1 laboratory setup the laboratory experiments were performed in a three dimensional soil tank 0 4 m 0 2 m 0 4 m made of polymethyl methacrylate which allowed soil water movements to be observed easily in the front panel a ceramic emitter was fed by a mariotte bottle diameter 10 cm volume 7 85 l fig 1 a the porous ceramic emitter fig 1b was cut into two symmetrical parts and a half of the ceramic emitter was fixed onto the front polymethyl methacrylate panel fig 1c to prevent preferential flow along the wall surface a layer of vaseline was smeared on the inner wall of the soil tank before filling with soil to create a coarse surface after sieving air dried loam soil 24 5 clay 39 3 silt and 36 2 sand with an initial soil water content of 0 15 cm3 cm 3 was used to fill the soil tank with an average soil bulk density of 1 3 g cm 3 loading and compaction of the soil in the tank were conducted in 5 cm layers to obtain a homogeneous soil profile the soil was placed in the tank and manually compacted using a square steel pad of area 50 cm2 10 cm 5 cm and weighing 0 6 kg the pad was lifted approximately 30 cm and dropped freely to the soil surface the upper surface of each layer should be rough sufficiently to avoid the occurrence of soil stratification in the soil tank experiment ceramic emitters with two different hydraulic conductivities were used as two cases which were denoted as emitter 1 and emitter 2 for each case only one ceramic emitter was installed at a depth of 15 cm and it was connected to the mariotte bottle with an 8 mm rubber pipe to supply water to the emitter the working pressure heads of ceramic emitter 1 and emitter 2 the height difference between the delivery port of the mariotte bottle and the center point of ceramic emitted were 24 cm and 84 cm respectively the shape of the wetting front and the cumulative infiltration were recorded from 0 to 5 h the shape of the wetting front was drawn on the front of the polymethyl methacrylate panel with an interval of 0 5 h for the first 3 h and then with an interval of 1 h for the last 2 h wetting front data collection was performed using auto cad 2007 software autodesk inc usa first multi segment lines were used to depict the wetting front shapes at different times second multi line lines were extracted to coordinate so the irregular shape of the wetting front image was converted into data coordinates finally the horizontal wetting front was read from the data coordinates as same to upward and downward vertical wetting front the cumulative infiltration volume was equal to the product of the cross sectional area and the difference in the water level in the mariotte bottle 2 1 2 emitter hydraulic conductivity the porous ceramic emitters were made of silica talc and silica sol and they were sintered in a tunnel furnace the open porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic emitters were controlled by altering the grain size of the silica fig 1b the values of air entry point for emitter 1 and emitter 2 were 940 cm and 860 cm respectively the saturated water content of each ceramic emitter was measured using the drying method the relationship between the differential working pressure head and emitter discharge can be derived from darcy s

pf hitachi japan the hydraulic parameters of the soil were fitted using the retc code schaap et al 2001 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the soil was measured using the falling head method in the laboratory 2 2 hydrus 2d simulations 2 2 1 numerical modeling theory water seepage from the ceramic emitter into the soil is simulated using the hydrus 2d software package ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2006 assuming the soil is homogeneous and isotropic only one ceramic emitter is used as a cylindrical source of water in both sets of experiments where the water movement during the infiltration process is considered as an axisymmetrical process three dimensional axisymmetrical flow in variably unsaturated rigid isotropic porous media can be described by richards equation 3 Œ∏ t 1 r r r k h h r z k h h

the soil water content h and hydraulic conductivity k h are described by the analytical functions of van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 as follows 4 Œ∏ h Œ∏ r Œ∏ r 1 Œ± h n m h 0 Œ∏ s h 0 5 k h k s s

empirical parameter l l whose value is approximately equal to the inverse of the air entry value and n and m are the van genuchten mualem shape parameters the parameters of soil hydraulic properties are set as test values and shown in table 1 2 2 2 system geometry and boundary conditions the active layer for most fruit tree root systems is about 100 cm li et al 2017a b sharma et al 2017 surikova et al 2011 thus a soil profile of depth z 100 cm is used in the simulations the simulations are conducted by considering a soil profile with a width r 50 cm where a ceramic emitter with a lip a 0 5 cm impermeable layer is placed at a depth d on the plane of symmetry for comparing simulated and measured results d 15 cm for other scenarios d 45 cm the geometry and boundary conditions defining the physical problem in this study are shown in fig 2 the ceramic emitter internal boundary nodes are assigned at constant pressure head values 24 cm for emitter 1 and 84 cm for emitter 2 which are identical to the pressure head values implemented in the soil tank laboratory experiments a free drainage boundary condition is used for the bottom boundary the surface boundary condition is set as an atmospheric boundary condition where the water evaporation rate is 0 4 cm d 1 daily variations in the evaporation rate are not considered no flow boundary conditions are assumed at the boundaries for water transport on the left and right sides of the flow domain 2 2 3 initial conditions for the soil and emitter the initial water content values are set uniform across the flow domain at about 0 15 cm3 cm 3 the water content values are converted into soil pressure head using eq 4 with parameter values listed in table 1 which is about 6800 cm the ceramic emitter is initially saturated and therefore initial water contents of the ceramic emitters are set at saturated water content i e about 0 29 for emitter 1 and 0 31 for emitter 2 the pressure head values are all shown in table 2 2 2 4 emitter hydraulic properties the structure pores in the ceramic material is similar to the soil structure so ceramic emitters can release or uptake water as the soil does thus the water retention of ceramic materials can also be described by the van genuchten mualem model in the simulations there are six hydraulic parameters for the ceramic emitter Œ∏s Œ∏r Œ± n ke and l a small value of Œ± 1 00 10 8 cm 1 is used to maintain the ceramic emitter saturated throughout the simulations siyal and skaggs 2009 because the other unsaturated parameters Œ∏s Œ∏r n and l are not sensitive to the results and thus Œ∏r n and l were taken as 0 078 1 900 and 0 5 respectively table 1 Œ∏s is set at experimental test value a linear relationship is observed between the emitter discharge and the working pressure head fig 3 so that the ceramic hydraulic conductivity is calculated with eq 1 the values of ceramic hydraulic conductivity used in the simulations are listed in table 1 2 3 evaluation of the modeling results the agreement between the hydrus 2d model predictions and the measured data was evaluated using the mean relative error mre normalized root mean square error nrmse and the coefficient of determination r2 willmott 1982 6 mre 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 7 nrmse 1 o 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 8 r 2 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where pi is the predicted value oi is the observed value n is the number of values compared and isthemeanoftheobserveddata is the mean of the observed data mre simply reflects the difference between the predictions and measured results and an mre absolute value less than 15 means that the model exhibits good stability and applicability an nrmse value less than 0 20 indicates very good consistency between the predictions and measured results whereas a nrmse value greater than 0 30 indicates a considerable difference between the two results the coefficient of determination can range from negative infinity to 1 r2 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the simulated and measured data in the best condition it is assumed that the values of the mre and nrmse are small and the values of r2 are close to 1 shwetha and varija 2015 2 4 statistical analyses

r2 dai et al 2018 2 5 model application and simulation scenarios after validating the model the effects of h and ke on the emitter discharge in soil and the wetting front were investigated the input data for the simulations working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of the hydrus 2d model fig 4 shows the measured and simulated cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front for emitter 1 and emitter 2 the results show that there is a strong correlation between the simulated and measured cumulative infiltration for both emitters within 5 h as shown in fig 4 a the mre nrmse and r2 values for the cumulative infiltration are 0 9 0 022 and 0 998 for emitter 1 respectively and 7 2 0 079 and 0 981 for emitter 2 the mre values below 15 the nrmse values are smaller than 0 2 and the r2 values are close to 1 indicating that the hydrus 2d is highly suitable for simulating the cumulative infiltration from the ceramic emitters under different hydraulic conductivity and working pressure heads the wetting front of ceramic emitter in loam is approximately elliptical under the influence of gravity the upward vertical wetting front is less than the horizontal wetting front and the horizontal wetting front less than the downward vertical wetting front for simplicity only the data for the horizontal wetting front are given the horizontal wetting fronts observed during the soil tank experiment are compared with the hydrus 2d simulations in fig 4 b the mre and nrmse values for the horizontal wetting fronts are 11 2 and 0 130 for emitter 1 respectively and 9 4 and 0 10 for emitter 2 the mre values are smaller than 15 the nrmse values for the wetting distances in the horizontal direction are smaller than 0 20 the r2 values for the two cases are 0 900 and 0 930 close to 1 the results show that the simulated wetting front agree well with the measured results based on the cumulative infiltration and the horizontal wetting front it can be concluded that the hydrus 2d model gives highly accurate predictions of soil water movements under subsurface irrigation for ceramic emitters with different working pressure heads and two hydraulic conductivities thus numerical simulations with the hydrus 2d model are used in this study to investigate the effect of the working pressure head and hydraulic conductivity of the ceramic emitter on the emitter discharge and the deep percolation rate 3 2 predicted flow characteristics fig 5 shows the simulated emitter discharge as a function of time at various h and ke values over a period of 40 h for simplicity the data of only nine cases are shown as shown in fig 5 a when h is 0 cm the emitter discharge decreases rapidly at the beginning of the experiments and finally reaches a steady state for example the emitter discharge decreases to a stabilized value of 0 15 l h 1 after about 18 h when ke is 0 1 cm h 1 when h is 0 cm water will evaporate from the surface of the saturated emitter but the evaporation rate emitter discharge is very small so we assume that the emitter discharge in air is 0 l h 1 meanwhile emitter discharge in soil is greater than 0 l h 1 under this zero pressure condition fig 5 a this is because when h is 0 cm the soil matric potential soil suction will suck the water from the emitter the outflow driving force for the emitter is the soil matric potential in soil therefore as soil matric potential changes so would the rate of emitter discharge the soil was dry in the flow domain initially the negative soil matric potential caused a water potential difference inside h 0 and outside soil matric potential the emitter and thus the emitter discharge was very high as shown by eqs 1 and 2 as the irrigation water entered and wetted the soil the difference in water potential decreased and resulted in the emitter discharge decreased as shown in fig 5 b when h and ke are 50 cm and 0 1 cm h 1 respectively the emitter discharge decreases to a stabilized value of 0 29 l h 1 after about 23 h the emitter discharge in soil is initially higher than that in air then the emitter stabilized discharge in the soil is equal to that in air as the time increases when the emitter discharge in air is equal to the maximum infiltration capacity of the soil the soil water potential is zero and the soil water potential will not restrain outflow from the emitter however when h and ke are 50 cm and 0 5 cm h 1 respectively the emitter discharge in the soil is smaller than that in air as the time increases fig 5 b as shown in fig 5 c when h and ke are 100 cm and 3 cm h 1 respectively the emitter discharge decreases to a stabilized value after 30 h when h is positive and the emitter discharge in air is greater than the maximum infiltration capacity of the soil the outflow driving forces for the emitter are the soil water potential and h as a result the soil water potential can change from negative to a positive value when the soil water potential is positive the soil water potential reduces the outflow from the emitter warrick and shani 1996 provenzano 2008b so the emitter discharge in the soil is smaller than that in air as shown in fig 5 c the soil water potential values around the ceramic emitter after 120 h at different h and ke values as calculated using eqs 1 and 2 are presented in table 3 when h is 0 cm the soil water potential is negative regardless the ke value when h exceeds 70 cm the soil water potential is positive even when ke is 0 1 cm h 1 as shown in table 3 when h is 50 cm ke is 0 1 cm h 1 and the soil water potential is only 0 09 cm a negligible value so the emitter discharge in the soil is close to that in air fig 5 b therefore during the design of an irrigation system with a ceramic emitter it is necessary to consider the possible reductions in the emitter discharge in the soil gil et al 2010b the h and ke values of ceramic emitter must be selected carefully to avoid a buildup of positive backpressure in the soil around the emitter which might reduce emitter discharge when the soil water potential changes slightly with time it means that the difference between h and soil water potential is approaching to a stable condition so the emitter discharge approaches a constant value corresponding to discharge in soil at 120 h the constant emitter discharge is then designated as the stable discharge q the stable discharge q at different h and ke values are presented in fig 6 the higher h and ke values the greater the q the maximum stable discharge 2 80 l h 1 is about 19 times the minimum value 0 15 l h 1 based on the data shown in fig 6 a regression model has been developed to predict q as a function of h and ke 9 q 0 67 0 04 h 1 01 1 04 k e 0 11 0 05 h 1 01 k e 0 11 r 2 0 99 this equation is valid for h lower than 100 cm and 0 1 cm h 1 ke 3 0 cm h 1 and can be used in designing a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters in loam to satisfy the water requirements of crops q must be greater than the water consumption rate of crops zhu and wu 2004 studied at the central loess plateau in china 36o55 n 109o00 e and found that the water requirement of apple trees is about 580 mm during the growing period where the maximum daily water consumption rate in the fruit growth stage july and april was about 4 13 mm d 1 at that time rainfall is abundant on the loess plateau where the rainfall intensity is higher than 2 43 mm d 1 if apple trees are planted with a 2 5 m within row spacing and with 4 m between the rows to reduce the irrigation cost the stable discharge q must be larger than 0 71 l h 1 if only one ceramic emitter is buried in the soil near an apple tree then according to eq 9 q will meet the water requirements of apple trees when ke 0 5 cm h 1 and h 63 cm or when ke 2 0 cm h 1 h only needs to be larger than 18 cm however when there are two ceramic emitters buried in the soil near an apple tree when ke 0 5 cm h 1 h can be as low as 10 cm in subsurface drip irrigation root intrusion is a unique problem that can reduce emitter discharge and system uniformity lamm et al 2007 the problem of root intrusion can be significantly reduced by using the ceramic emitters but the problem relates to the possibility that roots wrap the ceramic emitters completely and block the flow in emitters still exists fig 7 when this problem happens it is better to increase h to ensure q meet the requirements of trees therefore in the design of a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters it is better to choose a higher ke with a lower h if root wrapping conditions occur the farmers can increase h to ensure q meet the requirements of trees 3 3 risk assessment for deep percolation during the actual operation of an irrigation system if q is excessively high the soil water content may exceed the field capacity of the soil and water may percolate below the root zone due to the action of gravity fig 8 shows the wetting patterns simulated in loam at three different h and ke values listed in table 2 after irrigating for 120 h as shown in fig 8 case 13 when h 50 cm and ke 0 1 cm h 1 the downward vertical wetting front is about 43 cm and the irrigation water has not reached the bottom of the flow domain so deep percolation has been avoided according to fig 8 case 15 when h 50 cm and ke 0 5 cm h 1 the downward vertical wetting front is greater than 55 cm and some of the irrigation water moves out of the soil profile becoming unavailable for crops so there is a slight loss due to deep percolation when h 50 cm and ke 3 cm h 1 fig 8 case 17 the soil water content is almost 0 38 cm3 cm 3 which is much larger than the field capacity and close to the saturated soil water content in the soil profile in this case the soil air content is low thereby inhibiting seed germination and crop growth as well as wasting excessive amounts of water due to deep percolation fig 9 shows the variation in the deep percolation rate at different values of h and ke the deep percolation rate increases as h and ke increases when h is 0 cm and 20 cm the deep percolation rate is equal to 0 however when h is 100 cm and ke is 3 cm h 1 the deep percolation rate is up to 25 9 which demonstrates that 25 9 of the irrigation water is ineffective in a correctly designed subsurface irrigation system the water use efficiency should be higher than 95 so the deep percolation rate needs to less than 5 to improve the benefits for crops provenzano 2008a thus when h 100 cm and ke 0 8 cm h 1 the risk of deep percolation is low in addition if h is less than 50 cm then regardless of the value of ke the percolation rate is less than 5 and the risk of deep percolation is low in previous studies we found that ke was controlled by the open porosity of the ceramic emitter cai et al 2015a where the flexure strength of the ceramic emitter was smaller when the open porosity was higher cai et al 2015b it is normally better to have a high flexure strength for a ceramic emitter therefore a ceramic emitter with a lower ke should be chosen if the hydraulic conductivity is too low the emitter discharge will not fulfill the crop water requirements when the active layer for tree root systems is about 0 100 cm even if h is 100 cm the wetting front is smaller than 50 cm when ke is 0 1 cm h 1 thus ke should be greater than 0 1 cm h 1 it is not easy to set the working pressure head of a ceramic emitter lower than 20 cm under field conditions except by using a special water supply device such as a negative pressure generator li et al 2017a b or a constant pressure water tank chen et al 2004 which might greatly increase the system cost thus the working pressure head of the ceramic emitter should be higher than 20 cm when h and ke are excessively high the stable discharge will be large and regions of positive pressure will form around the emitter thereby destroying the soil structure and degrading the normal functioning of the emitter wu et al 2008 thus according to the requirement for a stable discharge and avoiding the risk of deep percolation the appropriate working pressure head should be 20 50 cm and the hydraulic conductivity needs to be 0 1 1 9 cm h 1 4 summary in this study the validity of using hydrus 2d for simulating water infiltration under subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitter was evaluated cumulative infiltration r2 0 981 0 998 and horizontal wetting front r2 0 900 0 930 predicted with hydrus 2d were in good agreement with experimental results it can be concluded that the hydrus 2d model can be used to accurately simulate water movement with ceramic emitters when the working pressure head is positive hydrus 2d can be a useful tool for investigating and designing subsurface irrigation systems with ceramic emitters the emitter discharge in soil decreases rapidly at the beginning and then reaches a steady state the changes of the emitter discharge in soil result from variations in the soil water potential the stable discharge is large when the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity are high the relationship of working pressure head ceramic hydraulic conductivity and stable discharge can be described by a power function the risk of water percolating into deep soils is large when both the working pressure head and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity are high furthermore excessive working pressure head and ceramic hydraulic conductivity may destroy the soil structure and severely affect the normal functioning of the emitter a lower hydraulic conductivity is recommended for ceramic emitters to meet the flexure strength requirements and the working pressure head of the ceramic emitter should be higher than 20 cm based on cost reduction considerations therefore to satisfy the water requirements of trees in loess plateau in china and reduce the risk of deep percolation the appropriate working pressure head should be between 20 and 50 cm and the ceramic hydraulic conductivity should be 0 1 1 9 cm h 1 acknowledgements the authors gratefully

low velocity in the paper respectively the analytical solutions of the fractional derivative models are given and all parameters are determined based on test data the dependence of fractional derivative models on parameters such as fractional derivative order and threshold hydraulic gradient are analyzed by sensitivity studies the fractional derivative models provide better description of non darcian flow in porous media under the conditions of high and low velocity furthermore the memory effectiveness of fractional calculus is discussed showing that the fractional derivative order is an indicator of non darcian flow in porous media keywords non darcian flow fractional calculus fractional derivative model high velocity flow low velocity flow 1 introduction fluid flow in porous media is an essential dimension in different kinds of subjects and engineering technologies bear 1972 sahimi and transport 2011 darcy s law which represents a linear relation between the hydraulic gradient and fluid flux has been very popular with engineers however many researchers indicated that darcy s linear law is not always adequate for description of fluid flow in porous media miller and low 1963 bear 1972 kutiƒ∫ek 1972 nonlinear models therefore are supposed to characterize non darcian flow in porous media liu and birkholzer 2012 liu 2014 liu et al 2016 in general the non darcian flow can be divided into two categories high velocity non darcian flow and low velocity non darcian flow meng et al 2015 many efforts have been made to develop mathematical descriptions for non darcian flow for few decades it is well known that increasing hydraulic gradient beyond a critical value leads to nonlinearity between fluid flux and hydraulic gradient known as high velocity non darcian flow bear 1972 suggested a nonlinear flow model and found the reynolds number is the key to distinguish between laminar and turbulent flow in general the critical value of reynolds number is commonly used to determine the upper range of validity of darcy s law zoorabadi et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 several nonlinear relationships were proposed for the high velocity non darcian flow e g the quadratic relationship by forchheimer 1901 and the power function by izbash 1931 following these works many studies were carried out to investigate the non darcian flow in porous media eriƒá et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 soulaine and quintard 2014 hayat et al 2017 additionally high velocity non darcian flow is likely to occur near pumping wells in leaky aquifer systems wen et al 2013 2014 developed a semi analytical solution for non darcian flow to a partially penetrating well using the izbash equation subsequently mathias and wen 2015 presented a numerical simulation of the non darcian flow in leaky aquifers on the basis of the forchheimer equation meanwhile water flow in low permeability media such as clay may appear to be low velocity non darcian flow hansbo 1960 and hansbo 2001 reported that water flux in clay is a power function of the hydraulic gradient miller and low 1963 found the existence of a threshold hydraulic gradient below which water is essentially immobile based on data sets for water flow in clay swartzendruber 1962 proposed a modified darcy s law in which non linear behavior of water flux against gradient is described by an exponential function afterwards russell and swartzendruber 1971 presented intriguing results from a very carefully performed set of experiments where water was flowed through a variety of unconsolidated porous media they found departures from darcy s law at low velocities with different mixtures of sand and silt or with mixtures of sand silt and clay subsequently as low velocity non darcian flow is the key issue related to geological disposal of high level radioactive waste in clay or shale formations liu and birkholzer 2012 proposed a new relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient by generalizing the currently existing relationships most recently yang et al 2018 developed the swartzendruber model for description of non darcian flow in low permeability porous media on the basis of conformable derivative approach a requirement for accurately modeling non darcian flow in porous media is an appropriate relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient the aforementioned remarkable achievements of modeling approaches to non darcian flow in porous media with high velocity and low velocity are all made by the use of local formalisms however it is indicated that the transport in porous media should include nonlocal phenomena and nonlocal darcy s law is devised from integro differential equation with memory formalism cushman and ginn 1993 hu and cushman 1994 to validate darcy s law and develop non darcian models seem to be an endless challenge it therefore leads to a new channel according to darcy s law water flux is directly proportional to the hydraulic gradient i e the first order derivative of water head with respect to the flow distance in other words darcian flow can be described by an integer derivative of water head in the framework of nonlocality it is natural to introduce the fractional calculus to characterize non darcian flow the fractional calculus is a generalization of conventional calculus i e calculus of integrals and derivatives of any arbitrary real or complex order podlubny 1999 kilbas et al 2006 moreover since fractional calculus has the nonlocal behavior it is expected that fractional models will generally provide an accurate description of the system dynamics that possesses memory or hereditary properties than those based on classical calculus mainardi 2010 in past few decades fractional calculus has gained considerable popularity and importance due mainly to its demonstrated applications in numerous diverse and widespread fields of science and engineering herrmann 2011 ortigueira 2011 such as the applications of fractional derivative to time dependent characteristics of rocks zhou et al 2011 2013 composite materials zhou et al 2017 solid mechanics carpinteri and cornetti 2002 carpinteri et al 2004 fluid mechanics kulish and lage 2002 garra and salusti 2013 zhou et al 2018 geohydrology droghei and salusti 2015 zhang et al 2017 nanotechnology baleanu and guvenc 2010 and nuclear reactor dynamics ray 2016 furthermore fractional calculus has been used to modeling fluid flow and solute transport in porous media he 1998 modified the well known darcy s law with fractional derivatives and proposed a new model for seepage flow in porous media caputo 1999 and caputo and plastino 2004 considered fractional viscoelastic newton s equations to describe diffusion of fluids in porous media riemann et al 2002 proposed fractional geometry to model and explain derivations of the darcy s velocity due to fractured rocks in aquifers tian and tong 2006 researched the flow characteristics of fluids through a fractal reservoir with the fractional order derivative by regarding the water flow as a function of a fractional derivative of the piezometric head cloot and botha 2006 generalized the classical darcy s law to derive a new equation of groundwater flow ochoa tapia et al 2007 derived a fractional order darcy s law from fractional newton s law of viscosity to depict shear stress phenomena in non homogeneous porous media mehdinejadiani et al 2013 derived the fractional boussinesq equation fbe on unconfined groundwater by assuming power law changes of flux in a control volume and using a fractional taylor series and mehdinejadiani et al 2013 solved this fbe to simulate transient flow towards subsurface drainpipes chen et al 2013 developed a new variable order fractional diffusion equation to describe the diffusion process of chloridion in the reinforced concrete structure as the physical and geometrical coefficients of the porous solid vary with power law deseri and zingales 2015 obtained a generalized relation among flux and pressure in terms of fractional order integrals and derivatives p≈Çociniczak 2015 considered the trapping phenomena inside the medium and analyzed the time fractional porous medium equation for description of the anomalous transport in porous media li et al 2016 presented an investigation for coupled flow and heat transfer of a generalized maxwell fluid with modified fractional fourier s law and darcy s law kavvas et al 2017 developed dimensionally consistent governing equations of transient soil water flow and soil water flux in multi dimensional fractional anisotropic media and fractional time recently moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 compared the abilities of advection dispersion equation and spatial fractional advection dispersion equation to describe the migration of a non reactive contaminant in homogeneous and heterogeneous soils which well demonstrated the superiority of fractional derivatives to model the solute transport in porous media as mentioned above although time or space fractional derivatives are extensively used in models of fluid flow and solute transport in porous media in order to take into account the memory effect or nonlocal properties induced by the strong fluid solid interactions time or space fractional derivative models usually need to make dimensionless for convenience g√≥mez aguilar et al 2016 kavvas et al 2017 therefore a different perspective to incorporate fractional derivative into flow models will be shown herein the motivation of the present work is to describe the non darcian flow behavior by using the fractional derivative with respect to dimensionless variable a fractional darcian model is proposed for high velocity non darcian flow in porous media moreover low velocity non darcian flow for low permeability media in terms of swartzendruber model is also developed employing fractional derivative which results in a fractional swartzendruber model the analytic solutions of the dimensionally consistent fractional derivative flow models are given and all related parameters of the proposed models are determined by fitting analysis of experimental data in literatures the effects of the parameters in the fractional derivative flow models such as fractional derivative order and threshold hydraulic gradient are analyzed through sensitivity studies the results indicate that the fractional derivative flow models describe the characteristics of the non darcian flow additionally the memory effectiveness of fractional calculus is also discussed indicating that fractional derivative models can be used to describe the non darcian flow in porous media as a non markovian process 2 high velocity non darcian flow in porous media it is generally accepted that high velocity non darcian flow often occurs in highly disordered porous media the typical velocity gradient curve for high velocity non darcian flow is demonstrated in fig 1 b the two popular formulas for high velocity non darcian flow are given by forchheimer 1901 and izbash 1931 forchheimer 1901 introduced an empirical equation to account for the non darcian flow the forchheimer equation states that the hydraulic gradient is a quadratic function of flow velocity or fluid flux i e 1 i aq bq 2 where i is dimensionless hydraulic gradient q is flow velocity or fluid flux m s a is a parameter equal to the reciprocal of the hydraulic conductivity s m and b is the empirical forchheimer coefficient s 2 m 2 izbash 1931 proposed a power form relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient in a mathematical way i e 2 i aq b in which a and b are empirical coefficients it should be pointed out that the mentioned descriptive models have a more or less empirical feature moreover many literatures mentioned that the non darcian flow characteristic of the current state depends on the previous hydraulic gradient field miller and low 1963 bear 1972 cloot and botha 2006 that means non darcian flow in porous media is gradient dependent and can be regarded as the memory effectiveness therefore we may make attempt to deduce a new gradient dependent relationship from the remarkable darcy s law by invoking the nonlocal operator i e fractional derivative 2 1 derivation of fractional darcian model darcy s law demonstrates a linear relationship between the hydraulic gradient and water flux which can be usually expressed by 3 q ki where k is hydraulic conductivity m s and i is dimensionless hydraulic gradient applying the first order derivative to both sides of eq 3 we can obtain the darcy s law in a differential form i e 4 dq kdi or dq di k it is indicated that darcian flow can be described by the first order derivative of flux showing a local behavior consequently the linear darcian flow in eq 4 can be extended to the gradient dependent non darcian flow via nonlocal fractional derivative of flux wang et al 2017 i e 5 d Œ± q di Œ± k 0 Œ± 1 where d Œ± di Œ± is the caputo fractional derivative operator definition of which can be stated as kilbas et al 2006 6 d Œ± f t dt Œ± i n Œ± f n t 1 Œ≥ n Œ± 0 t t s n Œ± 1 f n s ds for a given function f t and Œ± 0 n is the least integer greater than Œ± i Œ± is the riemann liouville fractional integral operator given by kilbas et al 2006 7 i Œ± f t 1 Œ≥ Œ± 0 t t s Œ± 1 f s ds and Œ≥ is the gamma function i e Œ≥ Œ± 0 t Œ± 1 e t dt in addition for Œ± 0 d Œ± di Œ± denotes the identity operator wang et al 2017 addressed the fractional derivative flow model in eq 5 based on Œ± 0 and initial conditions q n 0 0 n 0 1 2 recently it is found that these initial conditions are too strong to be acceptable from the view point of engineering in the case of n 1 that is the proposed model in eq 5 is inapplicable with Œ± 1 consequently the fractional derivative order should be confined in the appropriate range of 0 to 1 and only the condition q 0 0 is needed in this case applying the riemann liouville fractional integral operator eq 7 to both side of eq 5 and considering the initial condition q 0 0 we obtain 8 q k i Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± in this case we get a power function of water flux q and hydraulic gradient i in eq 8 showing a similar form of izbash equation described in eq 2 overlooking the specific difference between eq 2 and eq 8 fractional darcian model in eq 8 can refer to a mathematical derivation of the empirical izbash equation most importantly since hydraulic gradient i is a dimensionless variable the differentiation and integration with respect to i doesn t change the dimension of q in eq 5 the units of left and right hand side of eq 5 are consistent i e m s therefore on contrast to the empirical izbash equation in eq 2 the presented fractional darcian model in eq 5 or eq 8 is dimensional balanced and more adequate for description of fluid flow with memory in porous media moreover the fractional darcian model in eq 8 shows an apparent illustration of the dependence of water flux on the fractional derivative order Œ± specially when the fractional derivative order Œ± 1 the fractional darcian model in eq 8 reduces to the classical dary s law indicating that the darcy s law shown in eq 3 is a special case of the fractional darcian model in eq 8 as a consequence with the fractional derivative order gradually tending to 1 0 the fractional darcian model for high velocity non darcian flow approaches to darcian flow although wang et al 2017 also mentioned the present relation in eq 8 unfortunately there are no further investigations and experimental validations of this model in subsequent subsection the fractional darcian model in eq 8 is evaluated on the basis of experimental data in literatures 2 2 parameters determination of the fractional darcian model to investigate the applicability and reliability of the proposed fractional darcian model in eq 8 experimental data sets sedghi asl et al 2014 chen et al 2015 will be used to validate the high velocity non darcian flow behavior sedghi asl et al 2014 built a packed column to study high velocity flow through granular materials with six different sizes of rounded aggregates and the obtained experimental data were used to evaluate the validity of four widely used non darcian equations the diameter and length of packed column were selected as 300 mm and 1150 mm respectively moreover the reynolds numbers re of each size of aggregates are obtained and listed in table 1 the parameters of fractional darcian model in eq 8 are determined by fitting analysis of the experimental data sedghi asl et al 2014 based on least squares fitting method lsf zhou et al 2011 and the fitting results are listed in table 1 the experimental data as well as the fitting curves given by the fractional darcian model in eq 8 is shown in fig 2 the fitting analysis results in table 1 and fig 2 indicate that the presented fractional darcian model in eq 8 is well consistent with the experimental data with an accuracy in addition chen et al 2015 interpret the behavior of non darcian flow in fractured sedimentary rocks in high pressure packer tests hppt using the forchheimer equation and izbash equation based on the hppt data obtained in borehole zk129 2 chen et al 2015 the presented fractional darcian model in eq 8 is evaluated table 2 lists the best fitted values of parameters of fractional darcian model the curve fitting results in fig 3 and table 2 indicate that the fractional darcian model in eq 8 well approximate the hppt data with high correlation coefficients r 2 the previous investigations clarify that the fractional darcian model in eq 8 can be used instead of the forchheimer equation and izbash equation to describe the high velocity non darcian flow characteristics as acknowledged by yao et al 2015 the pore structure of poor compacted porous media may deform under the condition of high velocity water flow which leads to uncertain experimental results therefore yao et al 2015 selected a natural outcrop core with a suitable permeability and good cementation to investigate the high velocity non darcian flow in highly productive reservoirs indicating that forchheimer equation can be used to model the non darcian flow characteristics in the selected real cores consequently the proposed fractional darcian model in eq 8 can be used for sand packed columns artificial cores fractured rocks and real cores due to its applicability analogous to forchheimer equation as mentioned above 3 low velocity non darcian flow in porous media water flow in low permeability porous media appears to be a typical non darcian flow curve which is a combination of a concave upward curve and a straight line hansbo 1960 2001 swartzendruber 1962 liu and birkholzer 2012 as shown in fig 1 c the whole flow curve is a concave upward curve at low hydraulic gradient with the increase of hydraulic gradient the relationship between velocity and hydraulic gradient is tending to be linear additionally the intersection between the linear part and the hydraulic gradient i axis is referred to threshold hydraulic gradient i hansbo 1960 2001 suggested a relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient to represent the non darcian flow behavior in low permeability clay material which is illustrated in fig 1 c i e 9 q ki n i i 1 q kni 1 n 1 i i i i 1 where i 1 ni n 1 i is threshold hydraulic gradient n is an exponent generally greater than 1 however as indicated by swartzendruber 1962 hansbo model in eq 9 includes two separative mathematical expressions and the three related parameters k i n cannot be evaluated unless the experimental data are available all the way from i 0 out to and including an appreciable part of the linear portion of the velocity gradient curve to circumvent these difficulties swartzendruber 1962 postulated a modified darcy s law i e 10 dq di k 1 e i i its analytic solution is shown as 11 q k i i 1 e i i it is observed that for a sufficiently large value of hydraulic gradient i e i i in eq 10 approaches zero with a result that swartzendruber model in eq 10 is reduced to darcy s law in eq 4 therefore the swartzendruber model in eq 10 which is referred to a modified darcy s law can be interpreted by adding a decay term e i i to the constant proportion k in the darcy s law eq 4 nevertheless liu and birkholzer 2012 pointed out that the swartzendruber model in eq 10 cannot capture the full range of non darcian flow in porous media in order to solve the problem further efforts are devoted to modeling of non darcian flow in porous media by using fractional calculus 3 1 fractional swartzendruber model in terms of caputo fractional derivative recently fractional generalizations of swartzendruber model have attracted increasing attention wang et al 2017 applied fractional derivative to swartzendruber exponential seepage equation and obtained a non darcy seepage equation of low velocity flow however as mentioned in the previous section inconsistent initial conditions are also subjected to the fractional swartzendruber exponential seepage equation zhou et al 2018 presented a preprint and shared an insight into the fractional generalization of swartzendruber model by replacing the first derivative in eq 10 with caputo fractional derivative in contrast the fractional derivative will be incorporated into the swartzendruber model in a quite different way deriving a different fractional swartzendruber model in present work it is of interest to note that e i i in eq 10 is an eigenfunction of the ordinary differential operator with the eigenvalue Œª 1 i i e 12 dq di Œª q a fractional generalization of this feature is the eigenfunction of the caputo fractional differential operator may be expressed in terms of mittag leffler function which is defined by e Œ± x k 0 x k Œ≥ Œ± k 1 and regarded as the queen function of fractional calculus gorenflo et al 2014 it is indicated that the mittag leffler function e Œ± i i e Œ± i Œ± i Œ± concezzi and spigler 2015 is the eigenfunction of the caputo fractional differential operator with eigenvalue Œª 1 i Œ± i e 13 d Œ± q di Œ± Œª q 0 Œ± 1 where d Œ± di Œ± denotes the caputo fractional differential operator indeed this feature can be interpreted as 14 d Œ± di Œ± e Œ± i i d Œ± di Œ± e Œ± i Œ± i Œ± k 1 1 k i Œ± k Œ≥ Œ± k Œ± 1 i Œ± k Œ± 1 i Œ± k 0 i Œ± i Œ± k Œ≥ Œ± k 1 1 i Œ± e Œ± i i by changing the negative exponential function e i i in eq 10 with the mittag leffler function e Œ± i i we obtain the following fractional swartzendruber model like 15 dq di k 1 e Œ± i i 0 Œ± 1 it is indicated that the constant proportion k in the darcy s law is modified by the mittag leffler function e Œ± i i in the present fractional swartzendruber model in eq 10 applying the laplace transform lt on the both side of eq 15 and q s denotes the laplace transform of q due to the initial condition q 0 0 we obtain 16 sq s k 1 s s Œ± 1 s Œ± 1 i Œ± k i Œ± 1 s s Œ± 1 i Œ± 17 q s k i Œ± s 2 s Œ± 1 i Œ± taking the inverse laplace transform ilt to eq 17 yields 18 q k i Œ± i Œ± 1 e Œ± Œ± 2 i Œ± i Œ± where e Œ± Œ± 2 i Œ± i Œ± k 0 1 k i Œ± i Œ± k Œ≥ Œ± k Œ± 2 represents the two parameters mittag leffler function mainardi 2010 for Œ± 1 eq 13 reduces to eq 12 obviously the swartzendruber model in eq 10 is consistent with the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 15 this becomes apparent by considering e i i e 1 i i e 1 i i in addition when Œ± 1 the analytic solution of the fractional swartzendruber model shown in eq 18 is given by 19 q k i i 2 e 1 3 i i considering e 1 3 z e z 1 z z 2 eq 19 can be expressed by 20 q k i i 1 e i i which is the analytic solution of swartzendruber model in eq 11 to sum up the swartzendruber model in eq 11 is a special case of the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 as a consequence the proposed fractional swartzendruber model can describe a relatively large range of low velocity non darcian flow behavior additionally the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 shows the dependence of water flux on the fractional derivative order Œ± for better illustration sensitivity analyses are carried out to study the effects of the threshold gradient i on the variation of water flux fig 4 it is seen that the higher threshold hydraulic gradient i the smaller water flux 3 2 parameters determination of the fractional swartzendruber model based on the simulation experiments of oil accumulation i e oil displacing water zhu et al 2009 studied the migration and accumulation characteristics of non darcian oil flow in low permeability sandstones in the range of experimental flow velocity the oil percolation curve exhibits low velocity non darcian flow characteristics as shown in fig 1 c additionally the exact value of the threshold gradient for sandstone cores are listed in table 3 the experimental data zhu et al 2009 is used to fit the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 and the corresponding parameters are determined by the levenberg marquardt method a nonlinear least squares fitting lsf method see zhou et al 2011 for details comparisons of experimental data and fitting curves given by the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 are illustrated in fig 5 for better analysis the parameters in eq 18 are determined and listed in table 3 as indicated in table 3 and fig 5 the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 is in good agreement with the experimental data with high correlation coefficients r 2 and low root mean square errors rmse in particular the fitting result of core y9 as shown in fig 5 and table 3 also confirms that the swartzendruber model in eq 11 is a special case of the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 4 discussion memory effectiveness of fractional calculus it is well known that classical calculus has clear physical and geometric interpretations however there was not widely acceptable geometric and physical interpretation of fractional calculus for more than 300 years the lack of these interpretations has been acknowledged as an open problem at the first international conference on the fractional calculus in new haven usa in 1974 ross 1975 although several interesting attempts have been made see podlubny 2002 and references therein for details heretofore this open problem is still unsolved in spite of these geometric and physical inconsistent fractional calculus provides new ways of thinking about complex nonlocal phenomena west 2016 it is worth recalling that fractional calculus has the non local behavior which yields the memory effectiveness or history dependence properties in practice fractional calculus with respect to time is characterized by long term memory effects that correspond to intrinsic dissipative processes in the physical systems furthermore the memory effectiveness means that the present state evolution depends on the whole past states to provide a better understanding of the memory effectiveness of the fractional calculus the fractional calculus with respect to time is taken into account as illustration rearranging the fractional integral in eq 7 as 21 i Œ± f t 1 Œ≥ Œ± 0 t t s Œ± 1 f s ds f t t Œ± 1 Œ≥ Œ± means that i Œ± f t is related with the physical quantity f t by the convolution operation between f t and the power type memory function t Œ± 1 Œ≥ Œ± as for the caputo fractional derivative in eq 6 which can be expressed as a fractional integral of the first order derivative one can arrive at 22 d Œ± f t dt Œ± i 1 Œ± f t 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ± 0 t t s Œ± f s ds f t t Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± where t is the current time point s represents the past time point and t s denotes the distance between the past time and the current time eq 22 shows that the fractional derivative of the physical quantity f t results from the convolution of the first order derivative of f t and the kernel function t Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± in general the kernel function is called memory function of fractional derivative kneller and hinsen 2004 meaning that the fractional derivative represents a typical non markovian process luo et al 1935 as illustrated in eq 22 the memory function determines a time interval during which f t affects on d Œ± f t dt Œ± through the memory function t Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± namely the current state evolution depends on all previous states furthermore the fractional derivative order Œ± is an index of memory du et al 2013 as shown in fig 6 fractional derivative memory function of various orders represent various memory effects at an instant time t the higher the fractional derivative order in general the weaker the memory effect additionally the longer the duration time t s the weaker the memory effect in other words the memory effect weakens gradually with the increase of the distance between the current time t and historical time s moreover as the fractional derivative order approaches to 1 0 the limit of the fractional derivative in eq 6 becomes 23 lim Œ± 1 d Œ± f t dt Œ± f t lim Œ± 1 t Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± f t Œ¥ t f t where Œ¥ t is the dirac delta function it is shown that the classical differential system has no memory effectiveness or the memory function is the dirac delta function in this case the future state of a system as a markovian process does not depend on the past but the present state of the system the system loses all its states except for the single current state at each instant time t with infinitely high density luo et al 1935 consequently the classical calculus is not adequate for system with memory effectiveness on the contrary the fractional calculus depicts different levels of memory process with more accuracy and is surely related to the non markovian process as discussed above the interest in the applications of fractional calculus arises from the fact that the fractional derivative takes into account the memory effect of the past evolution of the variable this is in contrast with the classical integer order derivative that considers only the local history or next neighborhood interaction this means that the memory effect of fractional derivative features nonlocal interaction or variable dependent for instance space dependent and previous discussed time dependent alternatively this memory effectiveness or non markovian behavior is also valid for the present fractional derivation with respect to the dimensionless variable i e hydraulic gradient in the present case of the non darcian flow behavior in porous media non darcian flow is characterized by nonlinear relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient resulting from a strong solid water interaction miller and low 1963 caputo and plastino 2004 stated that the permeability depends on the previous hydraulic gradient and the differing amounts of fluid passed through the porous media which implies the memory behavior of fluid flow in porous media cloot and botha 2006 mentioned that the non darcian flow characteristic of the current state depends on the previous hydraulic gradient field which is regarded as the memory effectiveness to represent the memory effect caputo and plastino 2004 and cloot and botha 2006 reformulated the constitutive equation with fractional derivative which results in memory formulas in contrast with time or space fractional derivative models usually need to make dimensionless for convenience the proposed gradient dependent fractional derivative models in this work is dimensionally consistent to sum up if regarding the non darcian flow in porous media as a markovian process flow in porous media can be characterized by integer order derivative zhou et al 2003 fractional derivative model can then be used to describe the non darcian flow in porous media as a non markovian process from the perspective of non darcian flow in porous media as a non markovian process previous investigations indicate that the use of fractional derivative yields more reliable results than integer order derivative moreover the fractional derivative order is shown to be an indicator of non darcian flow in porous media 5 conclusions the objective of the present work is to describe the non darcian flow behavior by using the factional derivative approach a fractional darcian model is proposed for the high velocity non darcian flow moreover low velocity non darcian flow for low permeability media in terms of swartzendruber model is also developed employing fractional derivative which results in a fractional swartzendruber model the analytic solutions of the fractional derivative flow models are given and all parameters of the proposed models are determined by fitting analysis of experimental data in literatures furthermore the effects of the parameters in the fractional derivative flow models such as fractional derivative order and threshold hydraulic gradient are analyzed through sensitivity studies additionally the memory effectiveness of fractional calculus is discussed the main conclusions are drawn as follows the fractional darcian model presented in this work can be used to describe the behavior of high velocity non darcian flow in porous media meanwhile the proposed fractional swartzendruber model is in consistent with low velocity non darcian flow in low permeability porous media the experimental data fitting results indicate that the fractional derivative flow models mentioned in this work be of the ability of better description for the characteristics of the non darcian flow with superior accuracy and flexibility when the fractional derivative order Œ± 1 the darcy s law is shown to be a special case of the fractional darcian model and the swartzendruber model is a special case of the fractional swartzendruber model in addition the discussion about the effectiveness of fractional calculus shows that fractional derivative models can be used to describe the non darcian flow in porous media as a

an indicator of non darcian flow in porous media keywords non darcian flow fractional calculus fractional derivative model high velocity flow low velocity flow 1 introduction fluid flow in porous media is an essential dimension in different kinds of subjects and engineering technologies bear 1972 sahimi and transport 2011 darcy s law which represents a linear relation between the hydraulic gradient and fluid flux has been very popular with engineers however many researchers indicated that darcy s linear law is not always adequate for description of fluid flow in porous media miller and low 1963 bear 1972 kutiƒ∫ek 1972 nonlinear models therefore are supposed to characterize non darcian flow in porous media liu and birkholzer 2012 liu 2014 liu et al 2016 in general the non darcian flow can be divided into two categories high velocity non darcian flow and low velocity non darcian flow meng et al 2015 many efforts have been made to develop mathematical descriptions for non darcian flow for few decades it is well known that increasing hydraulic gradient beyond a critical value leads to nonlinearity between fluid flux and hydraulic gradient known as high velocity non darcian flow bear 1972 suggested a nonlinear flow model and found the reynolds number is the key to distinguish between laminar and turbulent flow in general the critical value of reynolds number is commonly used to determine the upper range of validity of darcy s law zoorabadi et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 several nonlinear relationships were proposed for the high velocity non darcian flow e g the quadratic relationship by forchheimer 1901 and the power function by izbash 1931 following these works many studies were carried out to investigate the non darcian flow in porous media eriƒá et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 soulaine and quintard 2014 hayat et al 2017 additionally high velocity non darcian flow is likely to occur near pumping wells in leaky aquifer systems wen et al 2013 2014 developed a semi analytical solution for non darcian flow to a partially penetrating well using the izbash equation subsequently mathias and wen 2015 presented a numerical simulation of the non darcian flow in leaky aquifers on the basis of the forchheimer equation meanwhile water flow in low permeability media such as clay may appear to be low velocity non darcian flow hansbo 1960 and hansbo 2001 reported that water flux in clay is a power function of the hydraulic gradient miller and low 1963 found the existence of a threshold hydraulic gradient below which water is essentially immobile based on data sets for water flow in clay swartzendruber 1962 proposed a modified darcy s law in which non linear behavior of water flux against gradient is described by an exponential function afterwards russell and swartzendruber 1971 presented intriguing results from a very carefully performed set of experiments where water was flowed through a variety of unconsolidated porous media they found departures from darcy s law at low velocities with different mixtures of sand and silt or with mixtures of sand silt and clay subsequently as low velocity non darcian flow is the key issue related to geological disposal of high level radioactive waste in clay or shale formations liu and birkholzer 2012 proposed a new relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient by generalizing the currently existing relationships most recently yang et al 2018 developed the swartzendruber model for description of non darcian flow in low permeability porous media on the basis of conformable derivative approach a requirement for accurately modeling non darcian flow in porous media is an appropriate relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient the aforementioned remarkable achievements of modeling approaches to non darcian flow in porous media with high velocity and low velocity are all made by the use of local formalisms however it is indicated that the transport in porous media should include nonlocal phenomena and nonlocal darcy s law is devised from integro differential equation with memory formalism cushman and ginn 1993 hu and cushman 1994 to validate darcy s law and develop non darcian models seem to be an endless challenge it therefore leads to a new channel according to darcy s law water flux is directly proportional to the hydraulic gradient i e the first order derivative of water head with respect to the flow distance in other words darcian flow can be described by an integer derivative of water head in the framework of nonlocality it is natural to introduce the fractional calculus to characterize non darcian flow the fractional calculus is a generalization of conventional calculus i e calculus of integrals and derivatives of any arbitrary real or complex order podlubny 1999 kilbas et al 2006 moreover since fractional calculus has the nonlocal behavior it is expected that fractional models will generally provide an accurate description of the system dynamics that possesses memory or hereditary properties than those based on classical calculus mainardi 2010 in past few decades fractional calculus has gained considerable popularity and importance due mainly to its demonstrated applications in numerous diverse and widespread fields of science and engineering herrmann 2011 ortigueira 2011 such as the applications of fractional derivative to time dependent characteristics of rocks zhou et al 2011 2013 composite materials zhou et al 2017 solid mechanics carpinteri and cornetti 2002 carpinteri et al 2004 fluid mechanics kulish and lage 2002 garra and salusti 2013 zhou et al 2018 geohydrology droghei and salusti 2015 zhang et al 2017 nanotechnology baleanu and guvenc 2010 and nuclear reactor dynamics ray 2016 furthermore fractional calculus has been used to modeling fluid flow and solute transport in porous media he 1998 modified the well known darcy s law with fractional derivatives and proposed a new model for seepage flow in porous media caputo 1999 and caputo and plastino 2004 considered fractional viscoelastic newton s equations to describe diffusion of fluids in porous media riemann et al 2002 proposed fractional geometry to model and explain derivations of the darcy s velocity due to fractured rocks in aquifers tian and tong 2006 researched the flow characteristics of fluids through a fractal reservoir with the fractional order derivative by regarding the water flow as a function of a fractional derivative of the piezometric head cloot and botha 2006 generalized the classical darcy s law to derive a new equation of groundwater flow ochoa tapia et al 2007 derived a fractional order darcy s law from fractional newton s law of viscosity to depict shear stress phenomena in non homogeneous porous media mehdinejadiani et al 2013 derived the fractional boussinesq equation fbe on unconfined groundwater by assuming power law changes of flux in a control volume and using a fractional taylor series and mehdinejadiani et al 2013 solved this fbe to simulate transient flow towards subsurface drainpipes chen et al 2013 developed a new variable order fractional diffusion equation to describe the diffusion process of chloridion in the reinforced concrete structure as the physical and geometrical coefficients of the porous solid vary with power law deseri and zingales 2015 obtained a generalized relation among flux and pressure in terms of fractional order integrals and derivatives p≈Çociniczak 2015 considered the trapping phenomena inside the medium and analyzed the time fractional porous medium equation for description of the anomalous transport in porous media li et al 2016 presented an investigation for coupled flow and heat transfer of a generalized maxwell fluid with modified fractional fourier s law and darcy s law kavvas et al 2017 developed dimensionally consistent governing equations of transient soil water flow and soil water flux in multi dimensional fractional anisotropic media and fractional time recently moradi and mehdinejadiani 2018 compared the abilities of advection dispersion equation and spatial fractional advection dispersion equation to describe the migration of a non reactive contaminant in homogeneous and heterogeneous soils which well demonstrated the superiority of fractional derivatives to model the solute transport in porous media as mentioned above although time or space fractional derivatives are extensively used in models of fluid flow and solute transport in porous media in order to take into account the memory effect or nonlocal properties induced by the strong fluid solid interactions time or space fractional derivative models usually need to make dimensionless for convenience g√≥mez aguilar et al 2016 kavvas et al 2017 therefore a different perspective to incorporate fractional derivative into flow models will be shown herein the motivation of the present work is to describe the non darcian flow behavior by using the fractional derivative with respect to dimensionless variable a fractional darcian model is proposed for high velocity non darcian flow in porous media moreover low velocity non darcian flow for low permeability media in terms of swartzendruber model is also developed employing fractional derivative which results in a fractional swartzendruber model the analytic solutions of the dimensionally consistent fractional derivative flow models are given and all related parameters of the proposed models are determined by fitting analysis of experimental data in literatures the effects of the parameters in the fractional derivative flow models such as fractional derivative order and threshold hydraulic gradient are analyzed through sensitivity studies the results indicate that the fractional derivative flow models describe the characteristics of the non darcian flow additionally the memory effectiveness of fractional calculus is also discussed indicating that fractional derivative models can be used to describe the non darcian flow in porous media as a non markovian process 2 high velocity non darcian flow in porous media it is generally accepted that high velocity non darcian flow often occurs in highly disordered porous media the typical velocity gradient curve for high velocity non darcian flow is demonstrated in fig 1 b the two popular formulas for high velocity non darcian flow are given by forchheimer 1901 and izbash 1931 forchheimer 1901 introduced an empirical equation to account for the non darcian flow the forchheimer equation states that the hydraulic gradient is a quadratic function of flow velocity or fluid flux i e 1 i aq bq 2 where i is dimensionless hydraulic gradient q is flow velocity or fluid flux m s a is a parameter equal to the reciprocal of the hydraulic conductivity s m and b is the empirical forchheimer coefficient s 2 m 2 izbash 1931 proposed a power form relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient in a mathematical way i e 2 i aq b in which a and b are empirical coefficients it should be pointed out that the mentioned descriptive models have a more or less empirical feature moreover many literatures mentioned that the non darcian flow characteristic of the current state depends on the previous hydraulic gradient field miller and low 1963 bear 1972 cloot and botha 2006 that means non darcian flow in porous media is gradient dependent and can be regarded as the memory effectiveness therefore we may make attempt to deduce a new gradient dependent relationship from the remarkable darcy s law by invoking the nonlocal operator i e fractional derivative 2 1 derivation of fractional darcian model darcy s law demonstrates a linear relationship between the hydraulic gradient and water flux which can be usually expressed by 3 q ki where k is hydraulic conductivity m s and i is dimensionless hydraulic gradient applying the first order derivative to both sides of eq 3 we can obtain the darcy s law in a differential form i e 4 dq kdi or dq di k it is indicated that darcian flow can be described by the first order derivative of flux showing a local behavior consequently the linear darcian flow in eq 4 can be extended to the gradient dependent non darcian flow via nonlocal fractional derivative of flux wang et al 2017 i e 5 d Œ± q di Œ± k 0 Œ± 1 where d Œ± di Œ± is the caputo fractional derivative operator definition of which can be stated as kilbas et al 2006 6 d Œ± f t dt Œ± i n Œ± f n t 1 Œ≥ n Œ± 0 t t s n Œ± 1 f n s ds for a given function f t and Œ± 0 n is the least integer greater than Œ± i Œ± is the riemann liouville fractional integral operator given by kilbas et al 2006 7 i Œ± f t 1 Œ≥ Œ± 0 t t s Œ± 1 f s ds and Œ≥ is the gamma function i e Œ≥ Œ± 0 t Œ± 1 e t dt in addition for Œ± 0 d Œ± di Œ± denotes the identity operator wang et al 2017 addressed the fractional derivative flow model in eq 5 based on Œ± 0 and initial conditions q n 0 0 n 0 1 2 recently it is found that these initial conditions are too strong to be acceptable from the view point of engineering in the case of n 1 that is the proposed model in eq 5 is inapplicable with Œ± 1 consequently the fractional derivative order should be confined in the appropriate range of 0 to 1 and only the condition q 0 0 is needed in this case applying the riemann liouville fractional integral operator eq 7 to both side of eq 5 and considering the initial condition q 0 0 we obtain 8 q k i Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± in this case we get a power function of water flux q and hydraulic gradient i in eq 8 showing a similar form of izbash equation described in eq 2 overlooking the specific difference between eq 2 and eq 8 fractional darcian model in eq 8 can refer to a mathematical derivation of the empirical izbash equation most importantly since hydraulic gradient i is a dimensionless variable the differentiation and integration with respect to i doesn t change the dimension of q in eq 5 the units of left and right hand side of eq 5 are consistent i e m s therefore on contrast to the empirical izbash equation in eq 2 the presented fractional darcian model in eq 5 or eq 8 is dimensional balanced and more adequate for description of fluid flow with memory in porous media moreover the fractional darcian model in eq 8 shows an apparent illustration of the dependence of water flux on the fractional derivative order Œ± specially when the fractional derivative order Œ± 1 the fractional darcian model in eq 8 reduces to the classical dary s law indicating that the darcy s law shown in eq 3 is a special case of the fractional darcian model in eq 8 as a consequence with the fractional derivative order gradually tending to 1 0 the fractional darcian model for high velocity non darcian flow approaches to darcian flow although wang et al 2017 also mentioned the present relation in eq 8 unfortunately there are no further investigations and experimental validations of this model in subsequent subsection the fractional darcian model in eq 8 is evaluated on the basis of experimental data in literatures 2 2 parameters determination of the fractional darcian model to investigate the applicability and reliability of the proposed fractional darcian model in eq 8 experimental data sets sedghi asl et al 2014 chen et al 2015 will be used to validate the high velocity non darcian flow behavior sedghi asl et al 2014 built a packed column to study high velocity flow through granular materials with six different sizes of rounded aggregates and the obtained experimental data were used to evaluate the validity of four widely used non darcian equations the diameter and length of packed column were selected as 300 mm and 1150 mm respectively moreover the reynolds numbers re of each size of aggregates are obtained and listed in table 1 the parameters of fractional darcian model in eq 8 are determined by fitting analysis of the experimental data sedghi asl et al 2014 based on least squares fitting method lsf zhou et al 2011 and the fitting results are listed in table 1 the experimental data as well as the fitting curves given by the fractional darcian model in eq 8 is shown in fig 2 the fitting analysis results in table 1 and fig 2 indicate that the presented fractional darcian model in eq 8 is well consistent with the experimental data with an accuracy in addition chen et al 2015 interpret the behavior of non darcian flow in fractured sedimentary rocks in high pressure packer tests hppt using the forchheimer equation and izbash equation based on the hppt data obtained in borehole zk129 2 chen et al 2015 the presented fractional darcian model in eq 8 is evaluated table 2 lists the best fitted values of parameters of fractional darcian model the curve fitting results in fig 3 and table 2 indicate that the fractional darcian model in eq 8 well approximate the hppt data with high correlation coefficients r 2 the previous investigations clarify that the fractional darcian model in eq 8 can be used instead of the forchheimer equation and izbash equation to describe the high velocity non darcian flow characteristics as acknowledged by yao et al 2015 the pore structure of poor compacted porous media may deform under the condition of high velocity water flow which leads to uncertain experimental results therefore yao et al 2015 selected a natural outcrop core with a suitable permeability and good cementation to investigate the high velocity non darcian flow in highly productive reservoirs indicating that forchheimer equation can be used to model the non darcian flow characteristics in the selected real cores consequently the proposed fractional darcian model in eq 8 can be used for sand packed columns artificial cores fractured rocks and real cores due to its applicability analogous to forchheimer equation as mentioned above 3 low velocity non darcian flow in porous media water flow in low permeability porous media appears to be a typical non darcian flow curve which is a combination of a concave upward curve and a straight line hansbo 1960 2001 swartzendruber 1962 liu and birkholzer 2012 as shown in fig 1 c the whole flow curve is a concave upward curve at low hydraulic gradient with the increase of hydraulic gradient the relationship between velocity and hydraulic gradient is tending to be linear additionally the intersection between the linear part and the hydraulic gradient i axis is referred to threshold hydraulic gradient i hansbo 1960 2001 suggested a relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient to represent the non darcian flow behavior in low permeability clay material which is illustrated in fig 1 c i e 9 q ki n i i 1 q kni 1 n 1 i i i i 1 where i 1 ni n 1 i is threshold hydraulic gradient n is an exponent generally greater than 1 however as indicated by swartzendruber 1962 hansbo model in eq 9 includes two separative mathematical expressions and the three related parameters k i n cannot be evaluated unless the experimental data are available all the way from i 0 out to and including an appreciable part of the linear portion of the velocity gradient curve to circumvent these difficulties swartzendruber 1962 postulated a modified darcy s law i e 10 dq di k 1 e i i its analytic solution is shown as 11 q k i i 1 e i i it is observed that for a sufficiently large value of hydraulic gradient i e i i in eq 10 approaches zero with a result that swartzendruber model in eq 10 is reduced to darcy s law in eq 4 therefore the swartzendruber model in eq 10 which is referred to a modified darcy s law can be interpreted by adding a decay term e i i to the constant proportion k in the darcy s law eq 4 nevertheless liu and birkholzer 2012 pointed out that the swartzendruber model in eq 10 cannot capture the full range of non darcian flow in porous media in order to solve the problem further efforts are devoted to modeling of non darcian flow in porous media by using fractional calculus 3 1 fractional swartzendruber model in terms of caputo fractional derivative recently fractional generalizations of swartzendruber model have attracted increasing attention wang et al 2017 applied fractional derivative to swartzendruber exponential seepage equation and obtained a non darcy seepage equation of low velocity flow however as mentioned in the previous section inconsistent initial conditions are also subjected to the fractional swartzendruber exponential seepage equation zhou et al 2018 presented a preprint and shared an insight into the fractional generalization of swartzendruber model by replacing the first derivative in eq 10 with caputo fractional derivative in contrast the fractional derivative will be incorporated into the swartzendruber model in a quite different way deriving a different fractional swartzendruber model in present work it is of interest to note that e i i in eq 10 is an eigenfunction of the ordinary differential operator with the eigenvalue Œª 1 i i e 12 dq di Œª q a fractional generalization of this feature is the eigenfunction of the caputo fractional differential operator may be expressed in terms of mittag leffler function which is defined by e Œ± x k 0 x k Œ≥ Œ± k 1 and regarded as the queen function of fractional calculus gorenflo et al 2014 it is indicated that the mittag leffler function e Œ± i i e Œ± i Œ± i Œ± concezzi and spigler 2015 is the eigenfunction of the caputo fractional differential operator with eigenvalue Œª 1 i Œ± i e 13 d Œ± q di Œ± Œª q 0 Œ± 1 where d Œ± di Œ± denotes the caputo fractional differential operator indeed this feature can be interpreted as 14 d Œ± di Œ± e Œ± i i d Œ± di Œ± e Œ± i Œ± i Œ± k 1 1 k i Œ± k Œ≥ Œ± k Œ± 1 i Œ± k Œ± 1 i Œ± k 0 i Œ± i Œ± k Œ≥ Œ± k 1 1 i Œ± e Œ± i i by changing the negative exponential function e i i in eq 10 with the mittag leffler function e Œ± i i we obtain the following fractional swartzendruber model like 15 dq di k 1 e Œ± i i 0 Œ± 1 it is indicated that the constant proportion k in the darcy s law is modified by the mittag leffler function e Œ± i i in the present fractional swartzendruber model in eq 10 applying the laplace transform lt on the both side of eq 15 and q s denotes the laplace transform of q due to the initial condition q 0 0 we obtain 16 sq s k 1 s s Œ± 1 s Œ± 1 i Œ± k i Œ± 1 s s Œ± 1 i Œ± 17 q s k i Œ± s 2 s Œ± 1 i Œ± taking the inverse laplace transform ilt to eq 17 yields 18 q k i Œ± i Œ± 1 e Œ± Œ± 2 i Œ± i Œ± where e Œ± Œ± 2 i Œ± i Œ± k 0 1 k i Œ± i Œ± k Œ≥ Œ± k Œ± 2 represents the two parameters mittag leffler function mainardi 2010 for Œ± 1 eq 13 reduces to eq 12 obviously the swartzendruber model in eq 10 is consistent with the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 15 this becomes apparent by considering e i i e 1 i i e 1 i i in addition when Œ± 1 the analytic solution of the fractional swartzendruber model shown in eq 18 is given by 19 q k i i 2 e 1 3 i i considering e 1 3 z e z 1 z z 2 eq 19 can be expressed by 20 q k i i 1 e i i which is the analytic solution of swartzendruber model in eq 11 to sum up the swartzendruber model in eq 11 is a special case of the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 as a consequence the proposed fractional swartzendruber model can describe a relatively large range of low velocity non darcian flow behavior additionally the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 shows the dependence of water flux on the fractional derivative order Œ± for better illustration sensitivity analyses are carried out to study the effects of the threshold gradient i on the variation of water flux fig 4 it is seen that the higher threshold hydraulic gradient i the smaller water flux 3 2 parameters determination of the fractional swartzendruber model based on the simulation experiments of oil accumulation i e oil displacing water zhu et al 2009 studied the migration and accumulation characteristics of non darcian oil flow in low permeability sandstones in the range of experimental flow velocity the oil percolation curve exhibits low velocity non darcian flow characteristics as shown in fig 1 c additionally the exact value of the threshold gradient for sandstone cores are listed in table 3 the experimental data zhu et al 2009 is used to fit the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 and the corresponding parameters are determined by the levenberg marquardt method a nonlinear least squares fitting lsf method see zhou et al 2011 for details comparisons of experimental data and fitting curves given by the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 are illustrated in fig 5 for better analysis the parameters in eq 18 are determined and listed in table 3 as indicated in table 3 and fig 5 the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 is in good agreement with the experimental data with high correlation coefficients r 2 and low root mean square errors rmse in particular the fitting result of core y9 as shown in fig 5 and table 3 also confirms that the swartzendruber model in eq 11 is a special case of the fractional swartzendruber model in eq 18 4 discussion memory effectiveness of fractional calculus it is well known that classical calculus has clear physical and geometric interpretations however there was not widely acceptable geometric and physical interpretation of fractional calculus for more than 300 years the lack of these interpretations has been acknowledged as an open problem at the first international conference on the fractional calculus in new haven usa in 1974 ross 1975 although several interesting attempts have been made see podlubny 2002 and references therein for details heretofore this open problem is still unsolved in spite of these geometric and physical inconsistent fractional calculus provides new ways of thinking about complex nonlocal phenomena west 2016 it is worth recalling that fractional calculus has the non local behavior which yields the memory effectiveness or history dependence properties in practice fractional calculus with respect to time is characterized by long term memory effects that correspond to intrinsic dissipative processes in the physical systems furthermore the memory effectiveness means that the present state evolution depends on the whole past states to provide a better understanding of the memory effectiveness of the fractional calculus the fractional calculus with respect to time is taken into account as illustration rearranging the fractional integral in eq 7 as 21 i Œ± f t 1 Œ≥ Œ± 0 t t s Œ± 1 f s ds f t t Œ± 1 Œ≥ Œ± means that i Œ± f t is related with the physical quantity f t by the convolution operation between f t and the power type memory function t Œ± 1 Œ≥ Œ± as for the caputo fractional derivative in eq 6 which can be expressed as a fractional integral of the first order derivative one can arrive at 22 d Œ± f t dt Œ± i 1 Œ± f t 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ± 0 t t s Œ± f s ds f t t Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± where t is the current time point s represents the past time point and t s denotes the distance between the past time and the current time eq 22 shows that the fractional derivative of the physical quantity f t results from the convolution of the first order derivative of f t and the kernel function t Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± in general the kernel function is called memory function of fractional derivative kneller and hinsen 2004 meaning that the fractional derivative represents a typical non markovian process luo et al 1935 as illustrated in eq 22 the memory function determines a time interval during which f t affects on d Œ± f t dt Œ± through the memory function t Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± namely the current state evolution depends on all previous states furthermore the fractional derivative order Œ± is an index of memory du et al 2013 as shown in fig 6 fractional derivative memory function of various orders represent various memory effects at an instant time t the higher the fractional derivative order in general the weaker the memory effect additionally the longer the duration time t s the weaker the memory effect in other words the memory effect weakens gradually with the increase of the distance between the current time t and historical time s moreover as the fractional derivative order approaches to 1 0 the limit of the fractional derivative in eq 6 becomes 23 lim Œ± 1 d Œ± f t dt Œ± f t lim Œ± 1 t Œ± Œ≥ 1 Œ± f t Œ¥ t f t where Œ¥ t is the dirac delta function it is shown that the classical differential system has no memory effectiveness or the memory function is the dirac delta function in this case the future state of a system as a markovian process does not depend on the past but the present state of the system the system loses all its states except for the single current state at each instant time t with infinitely high density luo et al 1935 consequently the classical calculus is not adequate for system with memory effectiveness on the contrary the fractional calculus depicts different levels of memory process with more accuracy and is surely related to the non markovian process as discussed above the interest in the applications of fractional calculus arises from the fact that the fractional derivative takes into account the memory effect of the past evolution of the variable this is in contrast with the classical integer order derivative that considers only the local history or next neighborhood interaction this means that the memory effect of fractional derivative features nonlocal interaction or variable dependent for instance space dependent and previous discussed time dependent alternatively this memory effectiveness or non markovian behavior is also valid for the present fractional derivation with respect to the dimensionless variable i e hydraulic gradient in the present case of the non darcian flow behavior in porous media non darcian flow is characterized by nonlinear relationship between water flux and hydraulic gradient resulting from a strong solid water interaction miller and low 1963 caputo and plastino 2004 stated that the permeability depends on the previous hydraulic gradient and the differing amounts of fluid passed through the porous media which implies the memory behavior of fluid flow in porous media cloot and botha 2006 mentioned that the non darcian flow characteristic of the current state depends on the previous hydraulic gradient field which is regarded as the memory effectiveness to represent the memory effect caputo and plastino 2004 and cloot and botha 2006 reformulated the constitutive equation with fractional derivative which results in memory formulas in contrast with time or space fractional derivative models usually need to make dimensionless for convenience the proposed gradient dependent fractional derivative models in this work is dimensionally consistent to sum up if regarding the non darcian flow in porous media as a markovian process flow in porous media can be characterized by integer order derivative zhou et al 2003 fractional derivative model can then be used to describe the non darcian flow in porous media as a non markovian process from the perspective of non darcian flow in porous media as a non markovian process previous investigations indicate that the use of fractional derivative yields more reliable results than integer order derivative moreover the fractional derivative order is shown to be an indicator of non darcian flow in porous media 5 conclusions the objective of the present work is to describe the non darcian flow behavior by using the factional derivative approach a fractional darcian model is proposed for the high velocity non darcian flow moreover low velocity non darcian flow for low permeability media in terms of swartzendruber model is also developed employing fractional derivative which results in a fractional swartzendruber model the analytic solutions of the fractional derivative flow models are given and all parameters of the proposed models are determined by fitting analysis of experimental data in literatures furthermore the effects of the parameters in the fractional derivative flow models such as fractional derivative order and threshold hydraulic gradient are analyzed through sensitivity studies additionally the memory effectiveness of fractional calculus is discussed the main conclusions are drawn as follows the fractional darcian model presented in this work can be used to describe the behavior of high velocity non darcian flow in porous media meanwhile the proposed fractional swartzendruber model is in consistent with low velocity non darcian flow in low permeability porous media the experimental data fitting results indicate that the fractional derivative flow models mentioned in this work be of the ability of better description for the characteristics of the non darcian flow with superior accuracy and flexibility when the fractional derivative order Œ± 1 the darcy s law is shown to be a special case of the fractional darcian model and the swartzendruber model is a special case of the fractional swartzendruber model in addition the discussion about the effectiveness of fractional calculus shows that fractional derivative models can be used to describe the non darcian flow in porous media as a

6984,fluvial processes have a significant impact on buildings and infrastructure and despite their local character they cause annually considerable costs in mountain areas worldwide vulnerability studies are based mainly on empirical data from past events whereas laboratory studies investigating the impact forces on buildings are still limited the paper presents a study on impact forces resulting from complex flow processes on buildings the influencing factors they depend on and the identification of process parameters they correlate with a 1 30 physical scale model was built representing the torrential fan of the schnannerbach torrent austria measurement devices installed on the building structures located on the torrential fan recorded impact forces induced by a set of fluviatile flood scenarios the measured impact forces were compared to computation results using recently developed calculation approaches and to measurements resulting from experiments with a simplified homogeneous scale model set up with a single wall element in a rectangular flume the results show a clear correlation between the approaching flow heights and the impact forces on exposed buildings compared to clear water conditions bed load transport and deposition processes highly influence the impact forces due to sediment accumulations close to the buildings on the torrential fan the gained insights contribute to a better understanding of potentially damage causing impacts on buildings resulting from the interaction of flood processes and the exposed built environment keywords bed load transport impact force flood physical scale model vulnerability 1 introduction despite considerable efforts aiming at the protection of areas subject to torrential hazards fuchs and mcalpin 2005 oberndorfer et al 2007 holub and fuchs 2009 significant losses have been recorded during the last decades in european mountain regions e g hilker et al 2009 fuchs et al 2015 particularly within steep torrential fans flood discharge and sediment transport triggered by heavy rainfall and snow melt often leads to channel outbursts and consequently to substantial damage to buildings mazzorana et al 2012 2014 and infrastructure eidsvig et al 2017 due to climate change effects keiler et al 2010 magnitude and frequency of such hazards is expected to increase these effects together with socio economic changes in high risk areas are expected to affect the spatial pattern of exposure and risk in the future fuchs et al 2015 2017a b r√∂thlisberger et al 2017 recent efforts in research of structural vulnerability of buildings focus on the refinement of empirical relationships linking the degree of loss of individual buildings to the impact forces of torrential hazards e g quan luna et al 2011 totschnig et al 2011 totschnig and fuchs 2013 papathoma k√∂hle et al 2012 2015 these empirical vulnerability functions allow for the estimation of expected direct losses as a result of the hazard impact based on a spatially explicit representation of the process magnitude and the elements at risk classified into building categories however data availability regarding the intensity of the natural process and the characteristics of the buildings e g material geometry etc is limited fuchs et al 2007 moreover since vulnerability functions are based on empirical data they are case study specific and cannot be transferred elsewhere papathoma k√∂hle et al 2011 in this respect mazzorana et al 2014 proposed a method to quantify the vulnerability of buildings exposed to torrent processes focusing on the root causes responsible for damages of buildings exposed to such hazards i e process and impact model and the physical response from a structural perspective however there are limited studies focusing on the determination of the impact forces on buildings exposed to torrential hazards once the sediment laden flows become unconfined to close this gap and since real scale data are so far barely available the study of process structure interactions in an experimental setup may be considered as an alternative approach h√ºbl and k√∂nig 2007 finally resulting impact forces should be quantifiable by numerical modelling approaches in order to be implemented in operational risk management although the impact forces due to the process are the main trigger for building damages their measurement and computation remains a challenge douglas 2007 therefore proxy data such as the approaching flow heights or flow velocities have been mainly used until now to estimate the potential vulnerability of exposed buildings fuchs et al 2007 gall et al 2009 papathoma k√∂hle et al 2017 to overcome the challenges of using proxy data for the hazard intensity quan luna et al 2011 used numerical back calculation to develop vulnerability curves for different process parameters and properties such as flow height kinematic viscosity and impact pressure however common calculation approaches fail to provide highly accurate and precise results with respect to the complex three dimensional flow behaviour and sediment transport processes mazzorana et al 2014 gems et al 2016 research focusing on the impacts of clear water processes is more advanced but predominantly the model set up to determine the impact forces on individual objects in the laboratory has been kept rather simple armanini et al 2010 mignot and riviere 2010 guillen ludena et al 2017 riviere et al 2017 significant differences between the types of fluvial torrential hazards floods fluviatile processes debris floods and debris flows onr 2009 and the large variety of damage causing mechanisms pose an extra challenge to research in the literature a number of studies present equations for the estimation of the impact forces of sediment transport processes and in particular debris flow hazards h√ºbl and k√∂nig 2007 vilajosana et al 2007 bergmeister et al 2009 proske et al 2011 scheidl et al 2013 however impact forces of fluviatile sediment transport with a sediment concentration less than 20 and a relatively long duration of the impacting event seem to be different from debris flow impacts even if this has not been proven by empirical loss data so far fuchs et al 2015 in contrast to floods and fluviatile sediment transport debris flows are defined as a non newtonian fluid johnson 1984 and therefore they are not directly comparable with strictly newtonian flow behaviour tropea et al 2007 consequently the impacts generated by these flow behaviours are remarkably different the impact of debris flows tends to be impulsive with peak loads of very short durations whereas impacts of fluviatile sediment transport are uniform and of longer durations to sum up there is an apparent need to study process structure interactions for torrential hazards in an experimental setup since real scale data are not available physical scale models provide the opportunity to directly measure impact forces on buildings on a well defined scale and set up our study contributes to a better understanding of the impact forces on buildings under different scenarios this enables engineers to enhance the design of buildings in hazard areas holub et al 2012 supports the assessment of the physical vulnerability of buildings and highlight the need and assess the effectiveness of local adaptation measures holub and fuchs 2008 2 case study the study focuses on experiments using a physical scale model to provide insights about the interaction of fluviatile hazard process and elements at risk the physical model is a representation of the torrential fan of the schnannerbach torrent which is located in the stanzertal valley in tyrol western austria fig 1 on the settled torrential fan the rigid torrent channel is characterized by a sequence of artificial steps and pools and a mean gradient of about 13 recent flood events in 1999 2002 and 2005 relocated large amounts of sediment from the catchment area 6 3 km2 to the confluence with the receiving water rosanna river rudolf miklau et al 2006 chiari 2008 the flow and sediment deposition processes during the observed flood events were similar with regard to the type of relocation process in the confluence zone the transport capacity of the receiving water course is not sufficiently high to transport all incoming sediments gems et al 2014 accordingly a regressive deposition process in the torrent occurred starting from the confluence zone and spreading towards upstream finally caused overtopping and overbank sedimentation along the torrent channel especially the well documented flood event of august 2005 when about 35 000 m3 of sediment were transported to the lower reach of the torrent led to substantial damages in the village of schnann with a reported loss of 403 000 rudolf miklau et al 2006 totschnig et al 2011 studies on the specific event include the ones of chiari 2008 and gems et al 2014 focusing on the event reconstruction and on the design of flood protection measures on the torrential fan the present work on the other hand focuses on the damage generating processes in the settlement area the measurement of impacts on the buildings and their correlation with quantifiable process indicators such as approaching flow heights at the building and impact pressures the flood event of august 2005 was used as a model proxy since valuable data and information on the process characteristics were available rudolf miklau et al 2006 fuchs et al 2007 chiari 2008 totschnig and fuchs 2013 gems et al 2014 kammerlander et al 2016 lucerne 2016 at least 16 buildings reported significant losses during the 2005 flood event however only three buildings were used for our study fig 1 fig 1 also shows the respective grain size distributions which were sampled at different locations in the schnannerbach and also in neighbouring torrents in the days after the flood event rudolf miklau et al 2006 to quantify the impact forces of sediment laden processes on the building envelopes two different grain size distributions namely the distributions 1 and 2 in fig 1 were determined on the basis of these data and used in the experiments they cover different fractions of quartz sand and gravel and represent the mean distribution 1 and the upper coarse limit distribution 2 of the sampled data originally analysed after the 2005 event the second coarser distribution 2 was mainly used to analyse potential influences of the grain size characteristics on the impacts all information on grain sizes in the diagram is given in prototype dimensions further details on the definition of the grain size distributions can be found in section 3 2 and scaling issues are discussed in section 4 3 3 methods preliminary experiments using a single plate in a straight rectangular flume were conducted before analysing the process dynamics on the schnannerbach torrent both the preliminary tests and the schnannerbach scale model were scaled 1 30 according froude similarity details on the model set up and the aims of the experiments are discussed in the following sections 3 1 preliminary experiments preliminary experiments and correlated numerical calculations flow 3d were undertaken having the following objectives i to optimize the installation procedure of the measurement devices ii to improve the experimental procedure and data management for the highly complex experiments at the scale model of the schnannerbach torrent iii to ensure the applicability of froude similarity for scaling the impact forces to prototype dimensions and iv to obtain a large sample of measurement results for the identification of influential parameters on the impact forces a plate with a measurement device to detect the impact forces was placed in a straight rectangular flume with a width of 0 5 m different gradients in the channel from 4 to 15 were tested as well as different plate sizes and angles to the flow direction further details on the set up of the preliminary model can be found in sturm et al 2017a b although this experimental setup doesn t represent any prototype torrent the measurements provide appropriate measurements to set the basis for the schnannerbach experiments at the same scale a number of experiments were run each one representing different torrential processes from clear water conditions to fluviatile sediment transport under different boundary conditions g√∂ttgens 2016 sturm et al 2017a beside the impact forces the approaching flow heights at the plate and the flow velocities in the unaffected flow field upstream the plate were measured for every experiment the measurement results in the flume were used for validating a 3d numerical model flow 3d containing the flume with the single plate for clear water conditions the validated numerical model was further applied to underpin the validity of froude similarity for scaling the force measurements in the laboratory to prototype dimensions for that purpose the numerical model was set up at two different scales the scale model dimensions and the prototype dimensions both numerical models were calibrated on the measured approaching flow heights and flow velocities in the flume when scaling the numerically calculated forces at model scale the impact forces could be compared accordingly although the impact forces result from hydrostatic and hydrodynamic components it could be ensured that froude similarity correctly scales measured impact forces on the plate to determine the independency of the computational mesh on the calculated forces a third model having twice the cell size of the prototype was created the calculated forces were compared with the measured forces from the experiments the results show good accordance for all investigated numerical scenarios and consistency to the measurement results fig 2 further the numerical calculations showed the compatibility of the measured quantities flow depth flow velocities discharge specific normal force fig 2 for different scales when using froude similarity sturm et al 2017a b provide detailed information on the measured quantities of impact forces on the plate in the straight rectangular channel and the influencing parameters during the preliminary experiments 3 2 physical scale model of the schnannerbach torrent a physical model scaled by 1 30 representing the schnannerbach torrent channel and its fan with a mean gradient of 13 was constructed fig 3 the study focused on the impacts on three specific buildings in the case study area they were equipped with 16 measurement devices on the torrent facing wall elements the 17 surrounding remaining buildings not equipped with measurement devices figs 1 and 3 were considered only as removable surrounding buildings which potentially may influence the process and impact patterns on the three equipped buildings surrounding buildings were constructed as rigid blocks without any openings for the three equipped buildings model set ups with and without openings in the building envelope were analysed see section 3 3 the geometry of the buildings was accurately determined to natural conditions using photogrammetry the measurement devices equipped on the wall elements are force sensors k3d60 20n me measuring systems connected to appropriate measurement amplifiers gsv 1a16usb k3d me measuring systems measured voltages induced by the approaching loads are converted to forces by means of a calibrated relation of the values by the manufacturer me measuring systems calibrated force sensors were further verified by statically loading the sensors with calibrated weights in addition to centrically induced loads the force sensors were also loaded eccentrically the detailed calibration of the sensors proved good conformities with the calibration of the manufacturer and caused negligible adjustments of the calibration values the impact force devices are attached to a rigid framework inside the building and are insensitive to eccentric load applications fixed attachment spots of the devices inside the building represent a rigid framework on which the wall elements were centrically mounted these wall elements were freely movable in order to avoid mutual interaction and the transmission of the impact forces to the bottom of the scale model the gaps between the wall elements themselves and the bottom were masked with thin plastic films to avoid sediment getting stuck in these gaps and potentially distorting the measured impact forces fig 4 provides a 3d model of building2 with its main components as well as a close view on building2 recorded after one of the experiments in the 3d model of the building the attached walls of sensor 9 and 10 were removed to see the inside structure of the building with its base plate and framework a total of 16 measurement devices were installed to record three axial pressure forces with a high temporal resolution of 200 hz kaiheng et al 2011 and scheidl et al 2013 suggest even higher resolutions for debris flow impacts since the process durations are short and a high resolution of the first impact is crucial to detect the maximum forces for longer event durations of fluviatile processes and a more uniform process behaviour compared to debris flows a temporal resolution of 200 hz was found adequate in terms of temporal resolution frequency limit and data capacity the setting of the temporal resolution was analysed during the preliminary experiments therefore the impact forces and especially the impact peaks were compared at different resolutions sturm et al 2017a compared to the first impact of a debris surge scheidl et al 2013 the first impact of a fluviatile hazard process on a certain object is less extreme due to the successive overtopping of the torrent channel to determine the impacts of sediment transport processes on the buildings the sediment was supplied continuously with a conveyor belt to the channel at the upper model boundary two grain size distributions were used for the supply of sediments fig 1 distribution 1 and 2 prototype dimensions they consist of different grain classes of quartz gravel and sand each both grain size distributions are strongly related to the field samples at different locations in the schnannerbach and also neighbouring torrents fig 1 featuring similar catchment and process characteristics rudolf miklau et al 2006 in order to avoid suspended load transport behaviour and cohesion effects in the experiments the minimum grain size in the experiments was set to 0 0005 m 0 015 m in prototype dimensions those fractions of sediments finer than 0 015 m amount to 20 to 35 in field samples for the experiments those fractions were assigned to the next coarser fraction featuring a grain size range from 0 015 m to 0 030 m fig 1 prototype dimensions the bed of the rigid torrent channel between the steps was filled with bed load according to grain size distribution 1 fig 1 to take the roughness of the stonewalled channel into account a structure was carved into the wall elements surface to resemble the joints of the stone layers the terrain outside of the channel was uniformly covered with 0 5 mm diameter sands 0 015 m in prototype dimensions to represent the average roughness of the overland flow areas flow velocities of the water surface on the floodplain were measured with piv methods thieleke and stamhuis 2014 for clear water conditions therefore swimming tracers were added flatly to the water on the floodplain and its flow paths were detected by cameras filming with 60fps from top view the surface flow velocities were estimated with the post processing software of thieleke and stamhuis 2014 when tracking the moving distances of single tracers between video frames in defined time steps the impacting flow heights at the wall elements as well as the deposition heights around the buildings were measured for all experiments by use of water gauges plotted on the wall elements one camera was recording the experiments from top view and three cameras each focusing on one of the three equipped buildings supported the documentation of the experiments 3 3 experimental programme the experimental programme included clear water experiments and experiments with continuous sediment supply fig 5 the considered clear water discharges in the torrent channel did not exceed channel capacity not even the 150 year design flood peak 30 m3 s 1 in nature according to rudolf miklau et al 2006 however to achieve impacts of clear water on the buildings six specific overtopping spots along the channel were defined located at the numbered channel bed steps fig 3 and overtopping was achieved through mobile closure devices in the channel these six different overtopping spots lead to a high variety of impacts detected by the different measurement devices relating to spatial dispersals and impact angles on the wall elements with the aim to analyse representative scenarios under sediment laden conditions in accordance with the observed flood events characterised by overtopping of the channel due to regressive deposition the deposition process in the channel and the amount of supplied sediment had to be assessed in detail using different grain size distributions gems et al 2014 demonstrated that the sediment concentration of the flow is a highly sensitive parameter for sediment deposition in the channel for the sediment laden experiments the assumed initial condition was a blockage of the channel cross section at the village bridge fig 3 through the regressive deposition all considered buildings were affected by the hazard process during each process scenario to represent regressive deposition accordingly experiments showed that in this part of the torrent a sediment concentration of 15 5 was required for grain size distribution 1 and 12 5 for grain size distribution 2 fig 1 lower sediment concentrations did not result in a regressive deposition behaviour and a slightly higher concentration exceeded the transport capacity of the flow in the torrent channel with regard to fluviatile sediment transport compare gems et al 2014 based on these findings experimental scenarios with different discharges different grain size distributions and sediment loads were defined and tested fig 3 in total 120 clear water experiments and 20 sediment experiments were conducted almost steady state discharges were set for all experiments minor changes in the transport capacity of the channel due to the observed sediment depositions and corresponding dynamics in the flow behaviour led to necessary small adjustments of the discharge during the sediment experiments although clear water conditions showed a steady state condition at every spot within the model for each of the experiments sediment transport and deposition processes led to temporarily variable conditions in the torrent channel and on the torrential fan despite the steady state conditions at the upstream model boundary to determine the influence of the flow passing through the buildings openings in the building envelopes were considered as well in specific experimental scenarios comparison of hazard scenarios with and without the influence of surrounding buildings on the impact forces enabled the quantification of the influences of the settlement structure on the impact forces further experiments which were performed to create the roughness structure on the floodplain and to determine its influence on the hazard processes on the floodplain are not discussed in the present paper 4 results all presented experimental results focus on the physical model of the schnannerbach torrent and are presented in real scale dimensions due to the different widths of the wall elements fig 3 and in order to provide comparable and transferable modelling results the measured forces are illustrated in terms of specific parameters related to a wall element width of 1 m concerning the experiments with openings doors and windows in the wall elements the wall widths were adjusted accordingly the presented results in this paper focus on the specific normal forces although three dimensional forces were measured the measured shear forces on the wall elements were significantly lower than the normal forces and thus not relevant for possible damages 4 1 clear water experiments the discharges of every single clear water experiment fig 5 are considered to be steady state for the entire duration of the experiment however unpreventable marginal variabilities in discharge and inhomogeneity in the flow paths produced slight fluctuations in the measurement results depending on the magnitude of the discharge even at steady state conditions sturm et al 2017a for this reason the impact forces of the clear water experiments are presented as boxplots featuring the mean values and the associated standard deviations of the forces the clear water modelling results for one specific experimental model layout are shown in fig 6 for the specific impact forces ten different discharges fig 5 are represented in an increasing order as boxplots for every single wall element the discharge values result from scaling the discharges from 1 l s 1 to 10 l s 1 to prototype dimensions comparing the impact forces to the flow velocity plots the spatial pattern of the flow intensities could be clearly demonstrated fig 6 shows the effects of the buildings on the flow field and the velocity patterns for three different discharges further the three illustrated velocity patterns show increasing velocities with increasing discharges on the floodplain which further results in increasing impact forces on the exposed wall elements the most significant impacts were measured on the wall elements 3 building1 fig 3 and 11 building2 fig 3 mainly resulting from the direct flow for this specific experimental setting for these wall elements the fluctuations of the forces increased with increasing discharge all measurement devices on the wall elements with the exception of wall elements 12 and 13 recorded none or only very small impact forces for this specific experimental model layout the impact forces ranged from 0 to 6 knm 1 and most of the values did not exceed 0 5 knm 1 for clear water conditions flow velocities were evaluated with supply of swimming tracers and the piv analysis for this reason they could only be determined as velocities on the water surface at those spots where the tracers were located this leads to a fragmented representation of velocities on the floodplain illustrated in fig 6 besides the small flow depths on the plain area and the highly turbulent flow conditions made the procedure especially difficult to execute the obtained results clearly show that parameters such as flow heights and velocities approaching flow angles and possible shadowing between buildings as shown in fig 6 for building3 affect the impact forces on the wall elements the measured approaching flow heights of the discussed model layout show a good accordance with the impact forces a correlation of approaching flow heights and impact forces was performed for every wall element and for all clear water experiments fig 7 based on the illustrated measured forces on the single wall elements the mean values of each measured time series of one steady state experiment were used for presentation and further analyses as synopsis of all experimental layouts and all measurement data a unified regression curve is presented in fig 7 the proposed regression curve is a quadratic function according to equation 1 where h is the approaching flow height in meters at the wall and f represents the specific normal force in kn m 1 1 f 1 01145 h 3 35613 h 2 a statistical analysis of the regression 95 prediction and confidence intervals is added to fig 7 as well as the deviation of the single measurements from the regression curve and its frequency distribution most of the measurements are within a range of 1knm 1 to the regression curve with single deviations from the regression curve not exceeding 3knm 1 compared to the correlation in fig 7 a more pronounced consideration of the dynamics in the flow field on the impact forces could be achieved by a correlation of flow velocities on the floodplain and the impact forces in fig 8 the correlation of the measured flow velocities in the unaffected flow upstream the wall element with the impact forces again for all measurements at clear water conditions is shown the impact forces are affected not only by the flow velocity itself but also by the angle of the velocity vector at the wall elements therefore the measured values were divided in two diagrams each representing upstream flow angles at the wall element above left diagram and below right diagram 45 however the consideration of flow velocities on the floodplain for regression analysis is challenging due to the fact that those velocities at the wall element can hardly be determined and correlated to the respective impact forces turbulences in the backwater of the wall elements made those measurements impossible hence it has to be assumed that there were no flow velocities directly at the wall elements armanini et al 2010 furthermore flow velocities are more difficult to measure compared to the presented approaching flow heights at the wall elements a regression of flow velocities and impact forces corresponding to the correlation of approaching flow heights and the impact forces illustrated in fig 7 is not sufficient since the velocities are associated with high dispersion deriving from variable impacting flow angles and complex backwater effects for the experiments the hydrostatic force component seems to be more dominant than the hydrodynamic force component fig 9 in fig 9 eq 1 is compared with other calculation approaches and measurement results from sturm et al 2017a the only measurement results in fig 9 are the datasets from sturm et al 2017a the other values result from eq 1 and formulas where flow depths and velocities are estimated with the manning strickler equation assuming very broad flow cross sections equivalent to conditions on a floodplain and a gradient of 13 as illustrated in fig 6 the flow velocity field features a high spatial variation of hydraulic conditions on the floodplain mainly caused by the existence of buildings the explicit and accurate identification of the location of the relating flow velocity for each of the 16 considered building walls and the different experimental layouts is challenging the flow velocities can only be correlated to the approaching flow heights with great dispersion therefore a more general theoretical approach is chosen for these estimations using the manning strickler equation the strickler parameter was set to 50 m1 3 s 1 the approaching flow height h directly at the wall was correlated to the calculated flow depths hm and velocities by using the eq 2 from armanini et al 2010 where fr is the froude number and hm is the flow depth on the related spot on the floodplain the calculated flow velocities are lower than the measured surface velocities 2 h 1 0 5 f r 2 h m further the hydrostatic and the hydrodynamic force components were calculated based on the determined approaching flow heights and velocities and are shown in fig 9 the drag coefficient cd for calculating the hydrodynamic force was set to 1 3 according to armanini et al 2010 the dynamic impacts of waves against a vertical wall are expressed through equations 3 and 4 for the different conditions of a completely reflected wave and a formation of a vertical bulge at the wall in these equations which are considered in fig 9 fs is the hydrostatic force in the free flow area and Œ± means a calibration coefficient which was set to 1 0 3 f 1 1 51 f r 1 2 5 3 f s completely reflected wave 4 f 1 0 5 f r 2 1 Œ± f r 2 1 0 5 f r 2 f s formation of vertical bulge the investigations of sturm et al 2017a in the straight rectangular flume show good accordance with eq 1 equation 3 describes the process of a completely reflected wave at the wall at lower froude numbers and thus results in significant lower impact forces than the measured values the formation of a vertical bulge at the wall expressed through eq 4 underestimates the measurements expressed through eq 1 even more but is still higher than the calculated hydrodynamic force even if the experiments from armanini et al 2010 are comparable to the schnannerbach experiments the impact processes are still different armanini et al 2010 used channel slopes up to 44 for their experiments which resulted in high investigated froude numbers from 3 to 7 the dynamic force component seems to be dominant for the total impacts of these processes the schnannerbach and the preliminary experiments sturm et al 2017a with slopes up to 15 reached froude number maxima up to 5 the experiments showed that lower longitudinal slopes and lower froude numbers lead to lower vertical bulge formations directly at the wall eq 2 as a consequence the static force component becomes more dominant since the schnannerbach and the preliminary experiments studied lower slopes and lower froude numbers than the experiments of armanini et al 2010 the hydrostatic force component is more dominant within these experiments fig 9 confirms this statement by comparison of the hydrostatic and the hydrodynamic force for the same flow conditions last but not least different model layouts resulted in highly differing impact forces for clear water experiments in more detail the consideration of surrounding buildings on the floodplain led to deflections of the flow and changes of the impact forces the experiments were run with and without surrounding buildings the influence of surrounding buildings on the impact forces of each wall element can be seen in fig 10 it is noteworthy that for clear water conditions the influence of surrounding buildings on the impact forces is also highly dependent on the location of channel overtopping fig 10 clearly shows that the impact forces of walls 2 3 and 11 are higher for the case with surrounding buildings while the forces on walls 12 and 13 are mostly lower as expected the influence of surrounding buildings on the forces of the wall elements located very close to the channel is low the developed flow paths on the floodplain influenced by different building structures are a dominant factor on the impact forces for clear water conditions and are more influential than the discharge on the floodplain itself 4 2 experiments with sediment transport the experiments with sediment transport comprise 20 experiments with varying sediment supply although all the results are presented herein we focus on a specific experiment to illustrate the experimental process and its outcomes the development of the impact forces under continuous sediment supply for this specific experimental layout for each of the three buildings is illustrated in fig 11 further the plan views show the development of the regressive deposition on the floodplain at three specific times during the experiment in the same figure pictures of the three buildings during the approaching peak impact forces are shown the impact forces in fig 11 are illustrated in three diagrams each representing one building the beginning and the end of sediment supply are marked as dashed lines in the diagrams due to the regressive deposition in the torrent channel the impacts on the wall elements are temporarily shifted and highly variable during the experiment the intrusion of the flow mixture into the buildings through the openings led to an additional impact force on the wall coming from the inside and resulted in negative force values on the wall elements 1 7 and 16 the highest specific impacts were measured at wall element 11 because of the orientation of the wall with respect to the flow direction for this specific experimental layout as discharge was set to zero again the forces decreased to a specific almost constant value which can be described as a static force resulting from the pressure of the wet sediment deposition pushing against the walls experiments with fluviatile sediment transport clearly showed that the highest impact forces during the flood events are substantially higher than the first impacts on the wall elements and the static forces of deposited sediment in front of the building at the end of the experiment this is evident by the temporal distribution of the impact forces shown in fig 11 the 20 executed experiments with sediment supply clearly showed that the different characteristics e g discharge sediment concentration sediment grain sizes of the fluviatile hazard process in the channel are not significant for the deposition on the floodplain as observed if there is any overtopping of the channel at high flood intensities the impacts are mainly influenced by the sediment depositions on the floodplain which lead to different flow paths on the floodplain and consequently to different approaching flow behaviour decreasing or increasing the impact forces accordingly this confirms the findings of sturm et al 2017a suggesting that the sediment deposition process in a straight rectangular flume in front of the wall element leads to a deflection of the flow and a considerable reduction of the impact forces at certain topographic and hydraulic conditions when depositions in the channel or on the floodplain direct the flow to the wall element the forces increase due to the higher specific discharge on the wall element with the grain size distributions illustrated in fig 1 and maximum sediment concentrations of 15 5 fig 5 impacts of coarser grains were not detected in the measurement results because backwater effects in front of the wall elements decelerate the sediments and reduce the impacts according to the correlation illustrated in fig 7 the measured impact forces and the approaching flow heights of the water sediment mixture of the 20 sediment experiments fig 5 and most relevant wall elements are summarized in fig 12 the approaching flow height is defined as the sum of deposition height and the height of the over flowing liquid solid mixture compared to the clear water depths in fig 7 the illustrated values represent time averaged impacts and flow heights over time steps of 164 s prototype dimensions during the entire duration of each experiment for this diagram the values of the wall elements 1 7 and 16 which may cause negative values due to their orientation and distort the correlation were neglected the spread of the experimental results is significantly higher than the one from the clear water experiments fig 7 however a clear trend of increasing impact forces with increasing approaching flow heights could still clearly be observed a regression curve of the function type as eq 1 of these values expressed by eq 5 was developed where f is the specific normal force in knm 1 and h is the approaching flow height directly at the wall element in meters 5 f 4 47492 h 2 29447 h 2 to compare the impact forces of the water sediment mixture with those of the clear water experiments eq 1 was added to fig 12 the clear water eq 1 leads to slightly lower impact forces especially at lower approaching flow heights the fluctuation of the forces and the maximum impact forces are much higher with sediment loaded discharges as expected an estimation of the impacts of sediment transport processes is more challenging than for clear water conditions due to peculiar phenomena of unconfined biphasic flow such as avulsions channelization and flow diversions at deposition lobes de haas et al 2018 in more detail the maximum impact forces at clear water conditions reach values up to 14knm 1 fig 7 whereas the impacts of the water sediment mixture highly exceed this value and attain a quantity up to 60 kn m 1 the deviation of the measurements from the regression curve has its main spread around 10knm 1 with single outliers up to 50 kn m 1 further statistical analyses show the 95 confidence and prediction intervals of all the 9019 individual measurement points fig 12 although the probability of occurrence of high impact forces is rather low for all measurements points 1 9019 due to the number of investigated flood events 20 this probability is considerably higher 1 20 4 3 main findings and discussion knowledge regarding the interaction between elements at risk and fluviatile hazard process is still limited measuring these interactions in the natural environment is nearly impossible and for this reason laboratory experiments are a feasible alternative to capture interactions the preliminary studies of sturm et al 2017a b aimed at the assessment of impact forces at different flow conditions and its influential parameters at a simple model set up in a confined channel compared to the preliminary studies the conducted experiments at the schnannerbach model provided scale model measurements of impact forces on whole buildings located on a specific torrential fan and captured the extent of the impact forces generated by different flow processes under more natural boundary conditions the experiments clearly showed the development of the impact forces during fluviatile flood events and the interaction between the buildings on the torrential fan and its influence on the impact forces due to the application of 16 measurement devices attached to wall elements exposed differently by the flow provided substantial data for detecting impact forces induced by approaching flow processes a correlation with the approaching flow height as influencing process parameter for clear water conditions and fluviatile sediment transport processes is delivered our study highlights the following key statements and that factors which have a substantial influence on impacts caused by floods and fluviatile hazards 1 a clear relation between the approaching heights and the impact forces for clear water conditions which scatters much wider for fluviatile sediment transport processes 2 the presence of specific neighbouring buildings in reducing the impact force due to deflecting the flow and shielding the element at risk 3 the presence of specific neighbouring buildings in increasing the impact force due to redirecting the flow on the floodplain and forcing it on the element at risk 4 the orientation of walls in relation to the flow direction and minor differences of the impact force under different conditions as far as the sediment transport is concerned the research presented herein has led to some interesting results that could be considered in hazard zone mapping land use planning and the construction of prospective local protection measures the results can be used to inform land use planning decisions and to support engineers in retrofitting buildings during the mitigation and the reconstruction phase the experiments can be extended to include local adaptation measures including simple low cost changes or additions to buildings that may reduce the impact of hazardous processes and consequently reduce the costs the experimental tests would not have been possible without a number of assumptions and limitations these are mainly related to the scaling of the model and the limitation of the range of the sediment grain size used to reproduce sediment transport in more detail the reproduction and calibration of the flow and sediment deposition processes are therefore challenging and based on previous studies rudolf miklau et al 2006 chiari 2008 gems et al 2014 froude similarity was used for scaling the flow processes and the impact forces which was verified to scale the measurements accordingly section 3 1 it was not possible however to reproduce the material behaviour of the building envelope within the scale model the definition of a representative grain size distribution in physical scale modelling is generally influenced by the aims and some basic conditions of the scale model set up and underlies certain scale effects waldron 2008 gill and pugh 2009 oliveto and hager 2005 heller 2011 for the analysis of bedload transport processes in rivers focus is mainly set on the shields diagram which differentiates motion and non motion conditions in terms of the critical shields parameter and depending on the grain related reynolds number ensuring grain related reynolds numbers larger 80 to 100 the critical shields parameter is almost constant at a level of 0 06 shields 1936 to avoid scale effects in the transport of bedload in physical scale models the scale factors have to be defined with respect to the prevailing grain sizes in the river and the grain related reynolds number for the case study of the schnannerbach torrent the defined grain size distributions and the model scale 1 30 led to grain related reynolds numbers above 100 for flood conditions in the rigid torrent channel and thus ensured that there are no scale effects in terms of initial motion conditions a change from bedload transport in prototype dimensions to suspended load transport in the scale model was as well not observed due to the defined minimum grain size of 0 0005 m laboratory dimensions compare kresser 1964 the experimental measurements were calibrated on the detailed flood documentation based on the input quantities the natural flow and sediment depositions could be reproduced with high temporal and spatial accuracy which underpins the scalability of these processes the applicability of the chosen grain size distribution 1 was already proved by previous experiments of gems et al 2014 who focused on the capacity of the rigid torrent channel of the schnannerbach and regressive deposition processes starting from the confluence with the receiving water rosanna river during the flood event in august 2005 however scaling of the field samples to laboratory conditions grain size distributions 1 and 2 fig 1 includes also a certain narrowing of the grain size spectrum as the finest fractions below 0 0005 m laboratory dimensions were added to the next coarser fraction section 3 2 even though it does not relevantly influence bedload transport behaviour and deposition processes in the torrent channel as discussed above the question arises whether a narrowed grain size distribution leads to changes on the impacts at the buildings compared to perfectly real conditions as discussed above limiting to fluviatile transport process with sediment concentrations below 20 results in only marginal influences of grain size distribution and sediment concentration on the impacts compared to the topography and arrangement of buildings on the flood plain the experiments with the grain size distributions 1 and 2 did not show relevant differences of impacts at the buildings even though there are significant differences of characteristic grain diameters amongst the d50 of distribution 1 is 0 039 m compared to the a d50 of 0 960 m of distribution 2 and the fraction finer 0 03 m amounts to 42 for distribution 1 compared to 28 for distribution 2 with this background the narrowing of the grain size distribution does not lead to scale effects as long as the sediment concentration and the maximum grain size do not significantly increase compared to the conditions in the experiments also deposition evolution on the floodplain is only marginally influenced by the narrowing of the grain size since the depositions are initiated by the obstacles on the floodplain and not by low shields parameters however for a quantitative and more profound assessment of the influence of grain size characteristics on the impacts further experiments are mandatory scale models entail considerable effort in construction measurement techniques and calibration however they are prototypes for a specific area and the results are not always transferable nevertheless measurements of scale model experiments could deliver calibration data for numerical models e g basement 2006 2017 the application of numerical methods could be used to reproduce additional experimental scenarios and assign the calibration parameters on similar floodplains which could be further implemented in operational risk management the present study can be expanded in the future to further investigate the influence of openings in the building envelope on the impact forces furthermore future studies may include research on the influences of spatial configurations of the built environment debris flow processes and load distributions concerning static forces of the sediment depositions as well as combined forces with the dynamic impacts of the flow processes additional mechanisms such as abrasion or scouring that may also be responsible for damage should be also analysed further analyses should also focus on comparable experiments on different floodplains and the application of numerical analysis is recommended to make the introduced approaches more accessible to a broader set of endangered areas affected by torrential flooding processes the experiments contained 16 measurement devices with different locations and orientations to different flow intensities and processes which led to a variety of measurements nevertheless the results showed a clear correlation of the approaching flow heights and the impact forces for all measurements figs 7 12 the results can be used for estimations of impact forces of clear water and fluviatile sediment transport processes on buildings located on alluvial fans with comparable gradients and process intensities sturm et al 2017a provide additional studies on the influence of different gradients 4 15 on the impact forces in general further laboratory studies are necessary to shed additional light on the interaction between natural processes and elements at risk additional laboratory experiments may support vulnerability studies and research based on empirical data in order to improve risk assessment and the design of risk reduction strategies as a response to a changing environment 5 conclusions the research presented herein focuses on laboratory experiments aiming at the better understanding of the interaction of buildings with clear water hyper concentrated or debris flows the conducted experiments provide scale model measurements of impact forces on buildings located on a specific torrential fan the study is one of the few studies in the literature using laboratory experiments and scale models to investigate the interaction between buildings and torrential hazards the results are very important for the field of vulnerability research they may contribute to the validation of existing methods of vulnerability assessment e g vulnerability curves but also for the support of newly developed methods in the same field indicator based approaches in more detail vulnerability assessment methods using indicators e g considering building characteristics may benefit from laboratory experiments that can confirm the relevance of some indicators or even contribute to their weighting laboratory experiments in general may give a very good insight to the interaction between natural processes and elements at risk not only in mountain areas but also in other environmental contexts where the built environment is threatened by natural hazards the understanding of

6984,fluvial processes have a significant impact on buildings and infrastructure and despite their local character they cause annually considerable costs in mountain areas worldwide vulnerability studies are based mainly on empirical data from past events whereas laboratory studies investigating the impact forces on buildings are still limited the paper presents a study on impact forces resulting from complex flow processes on buildings the influencing factors they depend on and the identification of process parameters they correlate with a 1 30 physical scale model was built representing the torrential fan of the schnannerbach torrent austria measurement devices installed on the building structures located on the torrential fan recorded impact forces induced by a set of fluviatile flood scenarios the measured impact forces were compared to computation results using recently developed calculation approaches and to measurements resulting from experiments with a simplified homogeneous scale model set up with a single wall element in a rectangular flume the results show a clear correlation between the approaching flow heights and the impact forces on exposed buildings compared to clear water conditions bed load transport and deposition processes highly influence the impact forces due to sediment accumulations close to the buildings on the torrential fan the gained insights contribute to a better understanding of potentially damage causing impacts on buildings resulting from the interaction of flood processes and the exposed built environment keywords

economic changes in high risk areas are expected to affect the spatial pattern of exposure and risk in the future fuchs et al 2015 2017a b r√∂thlisberger et al 2017 recent efforts in research of structural vulnerability of buildings focus on the refinement of empirical relationships linking the degree of loss of individual buildings to the impact forces of torrential hazards e g quan luna et al 2011 totschnig et al 2011 totschnig and fuchs 2013 papathoma k√∂hle et al 2012 2015 these empirical vulnerability functions allow for the estimation of expected direct losses as a result of the hazard impact based on a spatially explicit representation of the process magnitude and the elements at risk classified into building categories however data availability regarding the intensity of the natural process and the characteristics of the buildings e g material geometry etc is limited fuchs et al 2007 moreover since vulnerability functions are based on empirical data they are case study specific and cannot be transferred elsewhere papathoma k√∂hle et al 2011 in this respect mazzorana et al 2014 proposed a method to quantify the vulnerability of buildings exposed to torrent processes focusing on the root causes responsible for damages of buildings exposed to such hazards i e process and impact model and the physical response from a structural perspective however there are limited studies focusing on the determination of the impact forces on buildings exposed to torrential hazards once the sediment laden flows become unconfined to close this gap and since real scale data are so far barely available the study of process structure interactions in an experimental setup may be considered as an alternative approach h√ºbl and k√∂nig 2007 finally resulting impact forces should be quantifiable by numerical modelling approaches in order to be implemented in operational risk management although the impact forces due to the process are the main trigger for building damages their measurement and computation remains a challenge douglas 2007 therefore proxy data such as the approaching flow heights or flow velocities have been mainly used until now to estimate the potential vulnerability of exposed buildings fuchs et al 2007 gall et al 2009 papathoma k√∂hle et al 2017 to overcome the challenges of using proxy data for the hazard intensity quan luna et al 2011 used numerical back calculation to develop vulnerability curves for different process parameters and properties such as flow height kinematic viscosity and impact pressure however common calculation approaches fail to provide highly accurate and precise results with respect to the complex three dimensional flow behaviour and sediment transport processes mazzorana et al 2014 gems et al 2016 research focusing on the impacts of clear water processes is more advanced but predominantly the model set up to determine the impact forces on individual objects in the laboratory has been kept rather simple armanini et al 2010 mignot and riviere 2010 guillen ludena et al 2017 riviere et al 2017 significant differences between the types of fluvial torrential hazards floods fluviatile processes debris floods and debris flows onr 2009 and the large variety of damage causing mechanisms pose an extra challenge to research in the literature a number of studies present equations for the estimation of the impact forces of sediment transport processes and in particular debris flow hazards h√ºbl and k√∂nig 2007 vilajosana et al 2007 bergmeister et al 2009 proske et al 2011 scheidl et al 2013 however impact forces of fluviatile sediment transport with a sediment concentration less than 20 and a relatively long duration of the impacting event seem to be different from debris flow impacts even if this has not been proven by empirical loss data so far fuchs et al 2015 in contrast to floods and fluviatile sediment transport debris flows are defined as a non newtonian fluid johnson 1984 and therefore they are not directly comparable with strictly newtonian flow behaviour tropea et al 2007 consequently the impacts generated by these flow behaviours are remarkably different the impact of debris flows tends to be impulsive with peak loads of very short durations whereas impacts of fluviatile sediment transport are uniform and of longer durations to sum up there is an apparent need to study process structure interactions for torrential hazards in an experimental setup since real scale data are not available physical scale models provide the opportunity to directly measure impact forces on buildings on a well defined scale and set up our study contributes to a better understanding of the impact forces on buildings under different scenarios this enables engineers to enhance the design of buildings in hazard areas holub et al 2012 supports the assessment of the physical vulnerability of buildings and highlight the need and assess the effectiveness of local adaptation measures holub and fuchs 2008 2 case study the study focuses on experiments using a physical scale model to provide insights about the interaction of fluviatile hazard process and elements at risk the physical model is a representation of the torrential fan of the schnannerbach torrent which is located in the stanzertal valley in tyrol western austria fig 1 on the settled torrential fan the rigid torrent channel is characterized by a sequence of artificial steps and pools and a mean gradient of about 13 recent flood events in 1999 2002 and 2005 relocated large amounts of sediment from the catchment area 6 3 km2 to the confluence with the receiving water rosanna river rudolf miklau et al 2006 chiari 2008 the flow and sediment deposition processes during the observed flood events were similar with regard to the type of relocation process in the confluence zone the transport capacity of the receiving water course is not sufficiently high to transport all incoming sediments gems et al 2014 accordingly a regressive deposition process in the torrent occurred starting from the confluence zone and spreading towards upstream finally caused overtopping and overbank sedimentation along the torrent channel especially the well documented flood event of august 2005 when about 35 000 m3 of sediment were transported to the lower reach of the torrent led to substantial damages in the village of schnann with a reported loss of 403 000 rudolf miklau et al 2006 totschnig et al 2011 studies on the specific event include the ones of chiari 2008 and gems et al 2014 focusing on the event reconstruction and on the design of flood protection measures on the torrential fan the present work on the other hand focuses on the damage generating processes in the settlement area the measurement of impacts on the buildings and their correlation with quantifiable process indicators such as approaching flow heights at the building and impact pressures the flood event of august 2005 was used as a model proxy since valuable data and information on the process characteristics were available rudolf miklau et al 2006 fuchs et al 2007 chiari 2008 totschnig and fuchs 2013 gems et al 2014 kammerlander et al 2016 lucerne 2016 at least 16 buildings reported significant losses during the 2005 flood event however only three buildings were used for our study fig 1 fig 1 also shows the respective grain size distributions which were sampled at different locations in the schnannerbach and also in neighbouring torrents in the days after the flood event rudolf miklau et al 2006 to quantify the impact forces of sediment laden processes on the building envelopes two different grain size distributions namely the distributions 1 and 2 in fig 1 were determined on the basis of these data and used in the experiments they cover different fractions of quartz sand and gravel and represent the mean distribution 1 and the upper coarse limit distribution 2 of the sampled data originally analysed after the 2005 event the second coarser distribution 2 was mainly used to analyse potential influences of the grain size characteristics on the impacts all information on grain sizes in the diagram is given in prototype dimensions further details on the definition of the grain size distributions can be found in section 3 2 and scaling issues are discussed in section 4 3 3 methods preliminary experiments using a single plate in a straight rectangular flume were conducted before analysing the process dynamics on the schnannerbach torrent both the preliminary tests and the schnannerbach scale model were scaled 1 30 according froude similarity details on the model set up and the aims of the experiments are discussed in the following sections 3 1 preliminary experiments preliminary experiments and correlated numerical calculations flow 3d were undertaken having the following objectives i to optimize the installation procedure of the measurement devices ii to improve the experimental procedure and data management for the highly complex experiments at the scale model of the schnannerbach torrent iii to ensure the applicability of froude similarity for scaling the impact forces to prototype dimensions and iv to obtain a large sample of measurement results for the identification of influential parameters on the impact forces a plate with a measurement device to detect the impact forces was placed in a straight rectangular flume with a width of 0 5 m different gradients in the channel from 4 to 15 were tested as well as different plate sizes and angles to the flow direction further details on the set up of the preliminary model can be found in sturm et al 2017a b although this experimental setup doesn t represent any prototype torrent the measurements provide appropriate measurements to set the basis for the schnannerbach experiments at the same scale a number of experiments were run each one representing different torrential processes from clear water conditions to fluviatile sediment transport under different boundary conditions g√∂ttgens 2016 sturm et al 2017a beside the impact forces the approaching flow heights at the plate and the flow velocities in the unaffected flow field upstream the plate were measured for every experiment the measurement results in the flume were used for validating a 3d numerical model flow 3d containing the flume with the single plate for clear water conditions the validated numerical model was further applied to underpin the validity of froude similarity for scaling the force measurements in the laboratory to prototype dimensions for that purpose the numerical model was set up at two different scales the scale model dimensions and the prototype dimensions both numerical models were calibrated on the measured approaching flow heights and flow velocities in the flume when scaling the numerically calculated forces at model scale the impact forces could be compared accordingly although the impact forces result from hydrostatic and hydrodynamic components it could be ensured that froude similarity correctly scales measured impact forces on the plate to determine the independency of the computational mesh on the calculated forces a third model having twice the cell size of the prototype was created the calculated forces were compared with the measured forces from the experiments the results show good accordance for all investigated numerical scenarios and consistency to the measurement results fig 2 further the numerical calculations showed the compatibility of the measured quantities flow depth flow velocities discharge specific normal force fig 2 for different scales when using froude similarity sturm et al 2017a b provide detailed information on the measured quantities of impact forces on the plate in the straight rectangular channel and the influencing parameters during the preliminary experiments 3 2 physical scale model of the schnannerbach torrent a physical model scaled by 1 30 representing the schnannerbach torrent channel and its fan with a mean gradient of 13 was constructed fig 3 the study focused on the impacts on three specific buildings in the case study area they were equipped with 16 measurement devices on the torrent facing wall elements the 17 surrounding remaining buildings not equipped with measurement devices figs 1 and 3 were considered only as removable surrounding buildings which potentially may influence the process and impact patterns on the three equipped buildings surrounding buildings were constructed as rigid blocks without any openings for the three equipped buildings model set ups with and without openings in the building envelope were analysed see section 3 3 the geometry of the buildings was accurately determined to natural conditions using photogrammetry the measurement devices equipped on the wall elements are force sensors k3d60 20n me measuring systems connected to appropriate measurement amplifiers gsv 1a16usb k3d me measuring systems measured voltages induced by the approaching loads are converted to forces by means of a calibrated relation of the values by the manufacturer me measuring systems calibrated force sensors were further verified by statically loading the sensors with calibrated weights in addition to centrically induced loads the force sensors were also loaded eccentrically the detailed calibration of the sensors proved good conformities with the calibration of the manufacturer and caused negligible adjustments of the calibration values the impact force devices are attached to a rigid framework inside the building and are insensitive to eccentric load applications fixed attachment spots of the devices inside the building represent a rigid framework on which the wall elements were centrically mounted these wall elements were freely movable in order to avoid mutual interaction and the transmission of the impact forces to the bottom of the scale model the gaps between the wall elements themselves and the bottom were masked with thin plastic films to avoid sediment getting stuck in these gaps and potentially distorting the measured impact forces fig 4 provides a 3d model of building2 with its main components as well as a close view on building2 recorded after one of the experiments in the 3d model of the building the attached walls of sensor 9 and 10 were removed to see the inside structure of the building with its base plate and framework a total of 16 measurement devices were installed to record three axial pressure forces with a high temporal resolution of 200 hz kaiheng et al 2011 and scheidl et al 2013 suggest even higher resolutions for debris flow impacts since the process durations are short and a high resolution of the first impact is crucial to detect the maximum forces for longer event durations of fluviatile processes and a more uniform process behaviour compared to debris flows a temporal resolution of 200 hz was found adequate in terms of temporal resolution frequency limit and data capacity the setting of the temporal resolution was analysed during the preliminary experiments therefore the impact forces and especially the impact peaks were compared at different resolutions sturm et al 2017a compared to the first impact of a debris surge scheidl et al 2013 the first impact of a fluviatile hazard process on a certain object is less extreme due to the successive overtopping of the torrent channel to determine the impacts of sediment transport processes on the buildings the sediment was supplied continuously with a conveyor belt to the channel at the upper model boundary two grain size distributions were used for the supply of sediments fig 1 distribution 1 and 2 prototype dimensions they consist of different grain classes of quartz gravel and sand each both grain size distributions are strongly related to the field samples at different locations in the schnannerbach and also neighbouring torrents fig 1 featuring similar catchment and process characteristics rudolf miklau et al 2006 in order to avoid suspended load transport behaviour and cohesion effects in the experiments the minimum grain size in the experiments was set to 0 0005 m 0 015 m in prototype dimensions those fractions of sediments finer than 0 015 m amount to 20 to 35 in field samples for the experiments those fractions were assigned to the next coarser fraction featuring a grain size range from 0 015 m to 0 030 m fig 1 prototype dimensions the bed of the rigid torrent channel between the steps was filled with bed load according to grain size distribution 1 fig 1 to take the roughness of the stonewalled channel into account a structure was carved into the wall elements surface to resemble the joints of the stone layers the terrain outside of the channel was uniformly covered with 0 5 mm diameter sands 0 015 m in prototype dimensions to represent the average roughness of the overland flow areas flow velocities of the water surface on the floodplain were measured with piv methods thieleke and stamhuis 2014 for clear water conditions therefore swimming tracers were added flatly to the water on the floodplain and its flow paths were detected by cameras filming with 60fps from top view the surface flow velocities were estimated with the post processing software of thieleke and stamhuis 2014 when tracking the moving distances of single tracers between video frames in defined time steps the impacting flow heights at the wall elements as well as the deposition heights around the buildings were measured for all experiments by use of water gauges plotted on the wall elements one camera was recording the experiments from top view and three cameras each focusing on one of the three equipped buildings supported the documentation of the experiments 3 3 experimental programme the experimental programme included clear water experiments and experiments with continuous sediment supply fig 5 the considered clear water discharges in the torrent channel did not exceed channel capacity not even the 150 year design flood peak 30 m3 s 1 in nature according to rudolf miklau et al 2006 however to achieve impacts of clear water on the buildings six specific overtopping spots along the channel were defined located at the numbered channel bed steps fig 3 and overtopping was achieved through mobile closure devices in the channel these six different overtopping spots lead to a high variety of impacts detected by the different measurement devices relating to spatial dispersals and impact angles on the wall elements with the aim to analyse representative scenarios under sediment laden conditions in accordance with the observed flood events characterised by overtopping of the channel due to regressive deposition the deposition process in the channel and the amount of supplied sediment had to be assessed in detail using different grain size distributions gems et al 2014 demonstrated that the sediment concentration of the flow is a highly sensitive parameter for sediment deposition in the channel for the sediment laden experiments the assumed initial condition was a blockage of the channel cross section at the village bridge fig 3 through the regressive deposition all considered buildings were affected by the hazard process during each process scenario to represent regressive deposition accordingly experiments showed that in this part of the torrent a sediment concentration of 15 5 was required for grain size distribution 1 and 12 5 for grain size distribution 2 fig 1 lower sediment concentrations did not result in a regressive deposition behaviour and a slightly higher concentration exceeded the transport capacity of the flow in the torrent channel with regard to fluviatile sediment transport compare gems et al 2014 based on these findings experimental scenarios with different discharges different grain size distributions and sediment loads were defined and tested fig 3 in total 120 clear water experiments and 20 sediment experiments were conducted almost steady state discharges were set for all experiments minor changes in the transport capacity of the channel due to the observed sediment depositions and corresponding dynamics in the flow behaviour led to necessary small adjustments of the discharge during the sediment experiments although clear water conditions showed a steady state condition at every spot within the model for each of the experiments sediment transport and deposition processes led to temporarily variable conditions in the torrent channel and on the torrential fan despite the steady state conditions at the upstream model boundary to determine the influence of the flow passing through the buildings openings in the building envelopes were considered as well in specific experimental scenarios comparison of hazard scenarios with and without the influence of surrounding buildings on the impact forces enabled the quantification of the influences of the settlement structure on the impact forces further experiments which were performed to create the roughness structure on the floodplain and to determine its influence on the hazard processes on the floodplain are not discussed in the present paper 4 results all presented experimental results focus on the physical model of the schnannerbach torrent and are presented in real scale dimensions due to the different widths of the wall elements fig 3 and in order to provide comparable and transferable modelling results the measured forces are illustrated in terms of specific parameters related to a wall element width of 1 m concerning the experiments with openings doors and windows in the wall elements the wall widths were adjusted accordingly the presented results in this paper focus on the specific normal forces although three dimensional forces were measured the measured shear forces on the wall elements were significantly lower than the normal forces and thus not relevant for possible damages 4 1 clear water experiments the discharges of every single clear water experiment fig 5 are considered to be steady state for the entire duration of the experiment however unpreventable marginal variabilities in discharge and inhomogeneity in the flow paths produced slight fluctuations in the measurement results depending on the magnitude of the discharge even at steady state conditions sturm et al 2017a for this reason the impact forces of the clear water experiments are presented as boxplots featuring the mean values and the associated standard deviations of the forces the clear water modelling results for one specific experimental model layout are shown in fig 6 for the specific impact forces ten different discharges fig 5 are represented in an increasing order as boxplots for every single wall element the discharge values result from scaling the discharges from 1 l s 1 to 10 l s 1 to prototype dimensions comparing the impact forces to the flow velocity plots the spatial pattern of the flow intensities could be clearly demonstrated fig 6 shows the effects of the buildings on the flow field and the velocity patterns for three different discharges further the three illustrated velocity patterns show increasing velocities with increasing discharges on the floodplain which further results in increasing impact forces on the exposed wall elements the most significant impacts were measured on the wall elements 3 building1 fig 3 and 11 building2 fig 3 mainly resulting from the direct flow for this specific experimental setting for these wall elements the fluctuations of the forces increased with increasing discharge all measurement devices on the wall elements with the exception of wall elements 12 and 13 recorded none or only very small impact forces for this specific experimental model layout the impact forces ranged from 0 to 6 knm 1 and most of the values did not exceed 0 5 knm 1 for clear water conditions flow velocities were evaluated with supply of swimming tracers and the piv analysis for this reason they could only be determined as velocities on the water surface at those spots where the tracers were located this leads to a fragmented representation of velocities on the floodplain illustrated in fig 6 besides the small flow depths on the plain area and the highly turbulent flow conditions made the procedure especially difficult to execute the obtained results clearly show that parameters such as flow heights and velocities approaching flow angles and possible shadowing between buildings as shown in fig 6 for building3 affect the impact forces on the wall elements the measured approaching flow heights of the discussed model layout show a good accordance with the impact forces a correlation of approaching flow heights and impact forces was performed for every wall element and for all clear water experiments fig 7 based on the illustrated measured forces on the single wall elements the mean values of each measured time series of one steady state experiment were used for presentation and further analyses as synopsis of all experimental layouts and all measurement data a unified regression curve is presented in fig 7 the proposed regression curve is a quadratic function according to equation 1 where h is the approaching flow height in meters at the wall and f represents the specific normal force in kn m 1 1 f 1 01145 h 3 35613 h 2 a statistical analysis of the regression 95 prediction and confidence intervals is added to fig 7 as well as the deviation of the single measurements from the regression curve and its frequency distribution most of the measurements are within a range of 1knm 1 to the regression curve with single deviations from the regression curve not exceeding 3knm 1 compared to the correlation in fig 7 a more pronounced consideration of the dynamics in the flow field on the impact forces could be achieved by a correlation of flow velocities on the floodplain and the impact forces in fig 8 the correlation of the measured flow velocities in the unaffected flow upstream the wall element with the impact forces again for all measurements at clear water conditions is shown the impact forces are affected not only by the flow velocity itself but also by the angle of the velocity vector at the wall elements therefore the measured values were divided in two diagrams each representing upstream flow angles at the wall element above left diagram and below right diagram 45 however the consideration of flow velocities on the floodplain for regression analysis is challenging due to the fact that those velocities at the wall element can hardly be determined and correlated to the respective impact forces turbulences in the backwater of the wall elements made those measurements impossible hence it has to be assumed that there were no flow velocities directly at the wall elements armanini et al 2010 furthermore flow velocities are more difficult to measure compared to the presented approaching flow heights at the wall elements a regression of flow velocities and impact forces corresponding to the correlation of approaching flow heights and the impact forces illustrated in fig 7 is not sufficient since the velocities are associated with high dispersion deriving from variable impacting flow angles and complex backwater effects for the experiments the hydrostatic force component seems to be more dominant than the hydrodynamic force component fig 9 in fig 9 eq 1 is compared with other calculation approaches and measurement results from sturm et al 2017a the only measurement results in fig 9 are the datasets from sturm et al 2017a the other values result from eq 1 and formulas where flow depths and velocities are estimated with the manning strickler equation assuming very broad flow cross sections equivalent to conditions on a floodplain and a gradient of 13 as illustrated in fig 6 the flow velocity field features a high spatial variation of hydraulic conditions on the floodplain mainly caused by the existence of buildings the explicit and accurate identification of the location of the relating flow velocity for each of the 16 considered building walls and the different experimental layouts is challenging the flow velocities can only be correlated to the approaching flow heights with great dispersion therefore a more general theoretical approach is chosen for these estimations using the manning strickler equation the strickler parameter was set to 50 m1 3 s 1 the approaching flow height h directly at the wall was correlated to the calculated flow depths hm and velocities by using the eq 2 from armanini et al 2010 where fr is the froude number and hm is the flow depth on the related spot on the floodplain the calculated flow velocities are lower than the measured surface velocities 2 h 1 0 5 f r 2 h m further the hydrostatic and the hydrodynamic force components were calculated based on the determined approaching flow heights and velocities and are shown in fig 9 the drag coefficient cd for calculating the hydrodynamic force was set to 1 3 according to armanini et al 2010 the dynamic impacts of waves against a vertical wall are expressed through equations 3 and 4 for the different conditions of a completely reflected wave and a formation of a vertical bulge at the wall in these equations which are considered in fig 9 fs is the hydrostatic force in the free flow area and Œ± means a calibration coefficient which was set to 1 0 3 f 1 1 51 f r 1 2 5 3 f s completely reflected wave 4 f 1 0 5 f r 2 1 Œ± f r 2 1 0 5 f r 2 f s formation of vertical bulge the investigations of sturm et al 2017a in the straight rectangular flume show good accordance with eq 1 equation 3 describes the process of a completely reflected wave at the wall at lower froude numbers and thus results in significant lower impact forces than the measured values the formation of a vertical bulge at the wall expressed through eq 4 underestimates the measurements expressed through eq 1 even more but is still higher than the calculated hydrodynamic force even if the experiments from armanini et al 2010 are comparable to the schnannerbach experiments the impact processes are still different armanini et al 2010 used channel slopes up to 44 for their experiments which resulted in high investigated froude numbers from 3 to 7 the dynamic force component seems to be dominant for the total impacts of these processes the schnannerbach and the preliminary experiments sturm et al 2017a with slopes up to 15 reached froude number maxima up to 5 the experiments showed that lower longitudinal slopes and lower froude numbers lead to lower vertical bulge formations directly at the wall eq 2 as a consequence the static force component becomes more dominant since the schnannerbach and the preliminary experiments studied lower slopes and lower froude numbers than the experiments of armanini et al 2010 the hydrostatic force component is more dominant within these experiments fig 9 confirms this statement by comparison of the hydrostatic and the hydrodynamic force for the same flow conditions last but not least different model layouts resulted in highly differing impact forces for clear water experiments in more detail the consideration of surrounding buildings on the floodplain led to deflections of the flow and changes of the impact forces the experiments were run with and without surrounding buildings the influence of surrounding buildings on the impact forces of each wall element can be seen in fig 10 it is noteworthy that for clear water conditions the influence of surrounding buildings on the impact forces is also highly dependent on the location of channel overtopping fig 10 clearly shows that the impact forces of walls 2 3 and 11 are higher for the case with surrounding buildings while the forces on walls 12 and 13 are mostly lower as expected the influence of surrounding buildings on the forces of the wall elements located very close to the channel is low the developed flow paths on the floodplain influenced by different building structures are a dominant factor on the impact forces for clear water conditions and are more influential than the discharge on the floodplain itself 4 2 experiments with sediment transport the experiments with sediment transport comprise 20 experiments with varying sediment supply although all the results are presented herein we focus on a specific experiment to illustrate the experimental process and its outcomes the development of the impact forces under continuous sediment supply for this specific experimental layout for each of the three buildings is illustrated in fig 11 further the plan views show the development of the regressive deposition on the floodplain at three specific times during the experiment in the same figure pictures of the three buildings during the approaching peak impact forces are shown the impact forces in fig 11 are illustrated in three diagrams each representing one building the beginning and the end of sediment supply are marked as dashed lines in the diagrams due to the regressive deposition in the torrent channel the impacts on the wall elements are temporarily shifted and highly variable during the experiment the intrusion of the flow mixture into the buildings through the openings led to an additional impact force on the wall coming from the inside and resulted in negative force values on the wall elements 1 7 and 16 the highest specific impacts were measured at wall element 11 because of the orientation of the wall with respect to the flow direction for this specific experimental layout as discharge was set to zero again the forces decreased to a specific almost constant value which can be described as a static force resulting from the pressure of the wet sediment deposition pushing against the walls experiments with fluviatile sediment transport clearly showed that the highest impact forces during the flood events are substantially higher than the first impacts on the wall elements and the static forces of deposited sediment in front of the building at the end of the experiment this is evident by the temporal distribution of the impact forces shown in fig 11 the 20 executed experiments with sediment supply clearly showed that the different characteristics e g discharge sediment concentration sediment grain sizes of the fluviatile hazard process in the channel are not significant for the deposition on the floodplain as observed if there is any overtopping of the channel at high flood intensities the impacts are mainly influenced by the sediment depositions on the floodplain which lead to different flow paths on the floodplain and consequently to different approaching flow behaviour decreasing or increasing the impact forces accordingly this confirms the findings of sturm et al 2017a suggesting that the sediment deposition process in a straight rectangular flume in front of the wall element leads to a deflection of the flow and a considerable reduction of the impact forces at certain topographic and hydraulic conditions when depositions in the channel or on the floodplain direct the flow to the wall element the forces increase due to the higher specific discharge on the wall element with the grain size distributions illustrated in fig 1 and maximum sediment concentrations of 15 5 fig 5 impacts of coarser grains were not detected in the measurement results because backwater effects in front of the wall elements decelerate the sediments and reduce the impacts according to the correlation illustrated in fig 7 the measured impact forces and the approaching flow heights of the water sediment mixture of the 20 sediment experiments fig 5 and most relevant wall elements are summarized in fig 12 the approaching flow height is defined as the sum of deposition height and the height of the over flowing liquid solid mixture compared to the clear water depths in fig 7 the illustrated values represent time averaged impacts and flow heights over time steps of 164 s prototype dimensions during the entire duration of each experiment for this diagram the values of the wall elements 1 7 and 16 which may cause negative values due to their orientation and distort the correlation were neglected the spread of the experimental results is significantly higher than the one from the clear water experiments fig 7 however a clear trend of increasing impact forces with increasing approaching flow heights could still clearly be observed a regression curve of the function type as eq 1 of these values expressed by eq 5 was developed where f is the specific normal force in knm 1 and h is the approaching flow height directly at the wall element in meters 5 f 4 47492 h 2 29447 h 2 to compare the impact forces of the water sediment mixture with those of the clear water experiments eq 1 was added to fig 12 the clear water eq 1 leads to slightly lower impact forces especially at lower approaching flow heights the fluctuation of the forces and the maximum impact forces are much higher with sediment loaded discharges as expected an estimation of the impacts of sediment transport processes is more challenging than for clear water conditions due to peculiar phenomena of unconfined biphasic flow such as avulsions channelization and flow diversions at deposition lobes de haas et al 2018 in more detail the maximum impact forces at clear water conditions reach values up to 14knm 1 fig 7 whereas the impacts of the water sediment mixture highly exceed this value and attain a quantity up to 60 kn m 1 the deviation of the measurements from the regression curve has its main spread around 10knm 1 with single outliers up to 50 kn m 1 further statistical analyses show the 95 confidence and prediction intervals of all the 9019 individual measurement points fig 12 although the probability of occurrence of high impact forces is rather low for all measurements points 1 9019 due to the number of investigated flood events 20 this probability is considerably higher 1 20 4 3 main findings and discussion knowledge regarding the interaction between elements at risk and fluviatile hazard process is still limited measuring these interactions in the natural environment is nearly impossible and for this reason laboratory experiments are a feasible alternative to capture interactions the preliminary studies of sturm et al 2017a b aimed at the assessment of impact forces at different flow conditions and its influential parameters at a simple model set up in a confined channel compared to the preliminary studies the conducted experiments at the schnannerbach model provided scale model measurements of impact forces on whole buildings located on a specific torrential fan and captured the extent of the impact forces generated by different flow processes under more natural boundary conditions the experiments clearly showed the development of the impact forces during fluviatile flood events and the interaction between the buildings on the torrential fan and its influence on the impact forces due to the application of 16 measurement devices attached to wall elements exposed differently by the flow provided substantial data for detecting impact forces induced by approaching flow processes a correlation with the approaching flow height as influencing process parameter for clear water conditions and fluviatile sediment transport processes is delivered our study highlights the following key statements and that factors which have a substantial influence on impacts caused by floods and fluviatile hazards 1 a clear relation between the approaching heights and the impact forces for clear water conditions which scatters much wider for fluviatile sediment transport processes 2 the presence of specific neighbouring buildings in reducing the impact force due to deflecting the flow and shielding the element at risk 3 the presence of specific neighbouring buildings in increasing the impact force due to redirecting the flow on the floodplain and forcing it on the element at risk 4 the orientation of walls in relation to the flow direction and minor differences of the impact force under different conditions as far as the sediment transport is concerned the research presented herein has led to some interesting results that could be considered in hazard zone mapping land use planning and the construction of prospective local protection measures the results can be used to inform land use planning decisions and to support engineers in retrofitting buildings during the mitigation and the reconstruction phase the experiments can be extended to include local adaptation measures including simple low cost changes or additions to buildings that may reduce the impact of hazardous processes and consequently reduce the costs the experimental tests would not have been possible without a number of assumptions and limitations these are mainly related to the scaling of the model and the limitation of the range of the sediment grain size used to reproduce sediment transport in more detail the reproduction and calibration of the flow and sediment deposition processes are therefore challenging and based on previous studies rudolf miklau et al 2006 chiari 2008 gems et al 2014 froude similarity was used for scaling the flow processes and the impact forces which was verified to scale the measurements accordingly section 3 1 it was not possible however to reproduce the material behaviour of the building envelope within the scale model the definition of a representative grain size distribution in physical scale modelling is generally influenced by the aims and some basic conditions of the scale model set up and underlies certain scale effects waldron 2008 gill and pugh 2009 oliveto and hager 2005 heller 2011 for the analysis of bedload transport processes in rivers focus is mainly set on the shields diagram which differentiates motion and non motion conditions in terms of the critical shields parameter and depending on the grain related reynolds number ensuring grain related reynolds numbers larger 80 to 100 the critical shields parameter is almost constant at a level of 0 06 shields 1936 to avoid scale effects in the transport of bedload in physical scale models the scale factors have to be defined with respect to the prevailing grain sizes in the river and the grain related reynolds number for the case study of the schnannerbach torrent the defined grain size distributions and the model scale 1 30 led to grain related reynolds numbers above 100 for flood conditions in the rigid torrent channel and thus ensured that there are no scale effects in terms of initial motion conditions a change from bedload transport in prototype dimensions to suspended load transport in the scale model was as well not observed due to the defined minimum grain size of 0 0005 m laboratory dimensions compare kresser 1964 the experimental measurements were calibrated on the detailed flood documentation based on the input quantities the natural flow and sediment depositions could be reproduced with high temporal and spatial accuracy which underpins the scalability of these processes the applicability of the chosen grain size distribution 1 was already proved by previous experiments of gems et al 2014 who focused on the capacity of the rigid torrent channel of the schnannerbach and regressive deposition processes starting from the confluence with the receiving water rosanna river during the flood event in august 2005 however scaling of the field samples to laboratory conditions grain size distributions 1 and 2 fig 1 includes also a certain narrowing of the grain size spectrum as the finest fractions below 0 0005 m laboratory dimensions were added to the next coarser fraction section 3 2 even though it does not relevantly influence bedload transport behaviour and deposition processes in the torrent channel as discussed above the question arises whether a narrowed grain size distribution leads to changes on the impacts at the buildings compared to perfectly real conditions as discussed above limiting to fluviatile transport process with sediment concentrations below 20 results in only marginal influences of grain size distribution and sediment concentration on the impacts compared to the topography and arrangement of buildings on the flood plain the experiments with the grain size distributions 1 and 2 did not show relevant differences of impacts at the buildings even though there are significant differences of characteristic grain diameters amongst the d50 of distribution 1 is 0 039 m compared to the a d50 of 0 960 m of distribution 2 and the fraction finer 0 03 m amounts to 42 for distribution 1 compared to 28 for distribution 2 with this background the narrowing of the grain size distribution does not lead to scale effects as long as the sediment concentration and the maximum grain size do not significantly increase compared to the conditions in the experiments also deposition evolution on the floodplain is only marginally influenced by the narrowing of the grain size since the depositions are initiated by the obstacles on the floodplain and not by low shields parameters however for a quantitative and more profound assessment of the influence of grain size characteristics on the impacts further experiments are mandatory scale models entail considerable effort in construction measurement techniques and calibration however they are prototypes for a specific area and the results are not always transferable nevertheless measurements of scale model experiments could deliver calibration data for numerical models e g basement 2006 2017 the application of numerical methods could be used to reproduce additional experimental scenarios and assign the calibration parameters on similar floodplains which could be further implemented in operational risk management the present study can be expanded in the future to further investigate the influence of openings in the building envelope on the impact forces furthermore future studies may include research on the influences of spatial configurations of the built environment debris flow processes and load distributions concerning static forces of the sediment depositions as well as combined forces with the dynamic impacts of the flow processes additional mechanisms such as abrasion or scouring that may also be responsible for damage should be also analysed further analyses should also focus on comparable experiments on different floodplains and the application of numerical analysis is recommended to make the introduced approaches more accessible to a broader set of endangered areas affected by torrential flooding processes the experiments contained 16 measurement devices with different locations and orientations to different flow intensities and processes which led to a variety of measurements nevertheless the results showed a clear correlation of the approaching flow heights and the impact forces for all measurements figs 7 12 the results can be used for estimations of impact forces of clear water and fluviatile sediment transport processes on buildings located on alluvial fans with comparable gradients and process intensities sturm et al 2017a provide additional studies on the influence of different gradients 4 15 on the impact forces in general further laboratory studies are necessary to shed additional light on the interaction between natural processes and elements at risk additional laboratory experiments may support vulnerability studies and research based on empirical data in order to improve risk assessment and the design of risk reduction strategies as a response to a changing environment 5 conclusions the research presented herein focuses on laboratory experiments aiming at the better understanding of the interaction of buildings with clear water hyper concentrated or debris flows the conducted experiments provide scale model measurements of impact forces on buildings located on a specific torrential fan the study is one of the few studies in the literature using laboratory experiments and scale models to investigate the interaction between buildings and torrential hazards the results are very important for the field of vulnerability research they may contribute to the validation of existing methods of vulnerability assessment e g vulnerability curves but also for the support of newly developed methods in the same field indicator based approaches in more detail vulnerability assessment methods using indicators e g considering building characteristics may benefit from laboratory experiments that can confirm the relevance of some indicators or even contribute to their weighting laboratory experiments in general may give a very good insight to the interaction between natural processes and elements at risk not only in mountain areas but also in other environmental contexts where the built environment is threatened by natural hazards the understanding of this interaction is a prerequisite for the designing of effective risk reduction strategies in a rapidly changing world acknowledgements the study originates from the project vulnerability analysis of
