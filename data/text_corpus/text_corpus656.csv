3280,the present work derives analytical solutions of advection dispersion equation ade with temporal coefficients and a pollutant s point source moving linearly along the axis of a one dimensional semi infinite domain the source is considered a varying and a uniform pulse source respectively the dispersion of pollutant originating from a varying pulse source may be supposed to occur along groundwater flow domain and that from a uniform pulse source in an open medium like air or along a river flow the location of the input concentration that is the pollutant s concentration emanating from the source in an open medium or that reaching the groundwater domain being infiltrated from its source on the ground is considered moving linearly along the flow direction the motion of the source is described through an asymptotically increasing temporal function the illustration of the analytical solution clearly reflects this feature it also renders that the concentration pattern of the proposed solution is proximal to that of an existing solution obtained with the stationary source the pertinent existing solutions may also be derived from the proposed solutions the proposed solutions are found approximate but it is also found that the error of approximation of one of them is too small to have any effect on the concentration pattern to get these solutions firstly the moving source is reduced into a stationary source at the origin then the governing equations including the ade are made free from the three temporal functions one occurring in the time dependent position of the source and the other two as the coefficients of the ade in this process three new position variables and a new time variable are introduced using as many coordinate transformations then the laplace integral transformation technique litt is used to get the final solutions the solution in laplacian domain with uniform pulse source is obtained as a special case of that with the

time variable defined in eq 20 1 introduction the transport of solute or pollutant emanating from a point or surface source through an environment porous or non porous is being studied mathematically with the help of the analytical or numerical solution of advection dispersion equation ade with reference to an initial condition and the two boundary conditions each of first type solution type or second type flux type or third type mixed type since the middle of the twentieth century it took the pace under growing concern for the deteriorating quality of air soil water bodies on the surface and groundwater in particular when such solutions have been found useful in predicting and assessing the pollution level with position and time firstly the ade s with constant coefficients had been solved analytically with the help of laplace integral transform technique litt the methods like the one transforming the ade into two ordinary differential equations by separating the independent variables were also in practice variety of such solutions is reported in van genutchen and alves 1982 javendal et al 1984 and lindstrom and boersma 1989 later spatial temporal or spatio temporal coefficients of hydrological importance have been considered where the basic approach was adapted to reduce such variable coefficients into constant coefficients using coordinate transformations

chaudhary and singh 2020 in most of these works the dispersion rule freeze and cherry 1979 has been followed either the dispersion coefficient was considered proportional to velocity or proportional to the square of velocity the analytical solutions of the ade with spatio temporal coefficients and instantaneous sources in an infinite domain also occur basha and el habel 1993 aral and liao 1996 zamani and bombardelli 2014 sanskrityayn et al 2017 moranda et al 2018 recently analytical solutions have been obtained in the fractal framework of the dispersion theory wheatcraft and tyler 1988 by bharati et al 2018 in which the power index of the variable dispersivity ratio of dispersion coefficient and velocity has been considered fractional between one and two in euclidean framework the index is always a positive integer either one or two the list of such works is copious but a new reader may get sufficient references from the above citations in all these works the source of pollution is stationary or static like smoke coming out from the top of a chimney wastewater meeting a flowing or stagnant water domain through a sewage system contaminants reaching the groundwater at a fixed location through infiltration if the source is moving like a moving vehicle emitting pollutants to the best of the knowledge of the authors neither the analytical nor the numerical solution of the ade has been reported so far motion of the source either linear or rotational may be conceptualized in an another way in which a series of sources like chimneys located at different locations along a direction or on a circular track may be thought of in which chimneys operate at a regular interval of time only one chimney operating at a time in this situation too the pollutant is emitting from a source whose location is changing with time in a uniform pulse source the input concentration is uniform till the source is active and it becomes zero once the source stops to work e g smoke coming out of a vehicle till it is moving the groundwater gets polluted by the pollutants which infiltrate from its source like a garbage disposal site on the ground through the vertical soil column and reaches the groundwater body at a certain location this infiltration referred to as an input concentration spreads along the flow the input concentration may increase with time with decelerating rate leading to the domain to reach a saturation stage of being polluted if its source on the ground is eliminated forever the infiltration hence the input concentration starts decreasing with accelerated pace instead of becoming zero and the rehabilitation of the polluted domain begins such a source is referred to as a varying pulse source in the existing literature it is a challenging task to know the exact location where the infiltrated pollutant meets the groundwater and whether this location remains fixed or shifts along the flow with time in the latter situation it is equally important to know the concentration attenuation pattern in space time domain which remains elusive so far the description of time dependent location of input concentration in variety of dispersion problems looks very much similar to that of a moving interface the first description of a moving interface is available in the mathematically formulated problems of melting polar ice cap stefan 1889a 1889b 1889c in a simple first stefan s model a semi infinite sheet of ice melts due to a uniform temperature introduced at the top of the surface assumed as origin the interface on which melting occurs moves from the top surface into the sheet separating water from ice its time dependent position is defined by x s t the temperature distribution is described by a heat equation in the domain 0 x s t with two boundary conditions one at the origin and the other on the moving interface mathematical developments on stefan s problems may be found in the classical books carslaw and jaeger 1959 rubinsteĭn 1971 hoffman 1977 crank 1981 1984 recently rodrigo and thamwattana 2021 have listed the limited known solutions of stefan problems and moving boundary problems but these are mainly based on numerical simulations they have proposed a unified approach of solving fixed and moving boundary problems for the one dimensional heat equation by imbedding a given initial boundary value problem into an initial value problem and have discussed two stefan s problems as the special cases there are plenty of examples in environmental and biological domains in which the interface separating the two distinct phases as in the stefan problem is moving during an epidermal wound healing the wound boundary which is the source of the normal cell density moves towards the wound s center ehrlich 1998 enoch and leaper 2008 in a controlled release of nutrients from a spherical granule the boundary shrinks radially basu et al 2010 cloud is a moving source of rain and the front rain interface is moving forward engulfing a larger domain area rainstorms are often accompanied by wind and when a storm moves over a watershed along the longitudinal direction the interface between the wet surface and the dry surface is the moving boundary when water infiltrates through the soil the wetting front separating the saturated soil from the unsaturated soil is a free moving boundary during dissolution transport of dissolved substance takes place from a moving lnapl low non aqueous phase liquid when lnapl mass is floating over a water table with groundwater flowing horizontally bortoni et al 2019 when chemical spills from a moving vehicle which is not unusual the boundary between the chemically polluted surface and the unpolluted surface is a moving boundary similarly if a dam breaks the water gushes down the river channel the front wall of this moving gush is a moving boundary in an unconfined aquifer rising or falling water table is an example of a moving interface several moving boundary problems in surface water and unsaturated flow have been dealt with by singh 1995 1996 similarly in many pollutants dispersion problems the source of pollution is moving linearly or is rotating examples of moving sources may be counted as moving cars trains ships polluting the domain runoff spraying fog with a moving vehicle for the control of mosquitoes the smoke coming out of the firecrackers fixed on a rotating frame the pollutants infiltrating from garbage disposal sites meet the groundwater level at a uniform or varying rate at a position this position may shift forward or backward along or against the flow in that case it is another example of a moving source an environmental domain particularly a porous medium is seldom homogeneous heterogeneity is its key feature to take care of it in the present work the coefficients of the one dimensional ade are considered temporally dependent matheron and de marsily 1980 dagan 1984 aral and liao 1996 its analytical solutions are proposed with a linearly moving point source of pollutant the position variable of the moving source is considered time dependent described by the equation x α f 1 β t similar to that of the moving interface in the stefan problem stated above where α 0 is a reference position variable and β 0 is an unsteady parameter of dimension inverse of the time variable an important feature may be observed from the existing analytical solutions of the ade with stationary sources obtained by using litt that if the stationary source is situated at the domain s origin x 0 then the solutions occur in terms of error function in x if the source is located at x x 0 the solution may be obtained in terms of x x 0 likewise the analytical solutions in the present work are obtained in terms of x α f 1 β t to get it one cannot use a coordinate transformation like y x α f 1 β t to shift the location at the origin for the obvious reasons as y x x 0 may be used to shift the location x x 0 at x 0 it is done using a different transformation but similar to one introduced a decade earlier which helped reduce the spatio temporal coefficients of the ade into constant coefficients to get the analytical solutions references are cited at a later stage in sub section 2 1 this transformation introduces a new position variable and shifts the time dependent source location at the origin in the process the temporal function f 1 β t comes as a coefficient of the ade this function and the already existing two temporal coefficients of the ade are reduced into constant coefficients through similar three more transformations applied on the governing equations one by one two of them introduce another position variables and the last one a new time variable the point source of pollution is assumed a pulse source the solutions are obtained with varying pulse source apropos to assess groundwater pollution as discussed in the last but one paragraph and with the uniform pulse source in context of pollutant s dispersion in air soil or river bed in two separate sub sections respectively using litt the solution in laplacian domain with the uniform source is obtained as a special case of that obtained with the varying source the proposed solution exhibits a concentration pattern exactly similar to that obtained in the existing solution of the same dispersion problem but with a stationary source with the only difference that in the present work the concentration curves are emanating from time dependent locations whereas in case of the stationary source they originate from the origin the assumption of moving source does not allow getting the exact solution which satisfies the ade but it is found that the error of approximation of one of the proposed solutions is negligible hence does not have any effect on the concentration level along the domain at any time 2 analytical solution of ade with linearly moving source the pollutant s source is assumed moving linearly along the x axis longitudinal direction its location is described by a time dependent position coordinate x t in the cartesian system similar to that in the stefan problems articles 1 2 and 3 2 in crank 1984 let the pollutant s source location at time t be given by x t α f 1 β t where α 0 be a reference position coordinate β 0 be an unsteady parameter of dimension inverse of time variable that is β t is a non dimensional term and f 1 β t be an asymptotically increasing function the advection dispersion equation ade with temporal coefficients in a semi infinite is considered as 1 c t x d t c x u t c α f 1 β t x let d t d 0 f 2 γ t and u u 0 f 3 γ t where f 2 γ t and f 3 γ t are two different temporal functions in which γ 0 is another unsteady parameter of dimension inverse of time variable that is γ t is a dimensionless term d 0 is initial dispersion coefficient and u 0 is the initial advective velocity in context of groundwater hydrology u 0 represents darcy velocity through a saturated aquifer dispersion along a heterogeneous medium particulary a porous medium may be described by the temporal coefficients of the ade matheron and de marsily 1980 dagan 1984 aral and liao 1996 the two temporal functions are chosen such that for zero value of γ each of the two has the value 1 0 and the temporal coefficients reduce to constant coefficients so eq 1 may be written in simplified form as 2 c t d 0 f 2 γ t 2 c x 2 u 0 f 3 γ t c x α f 1 β t x let the domain be initially solute free described by a homogeneous first type condition 3 c x t 0 a t t 0 x α f 1 β t let a zero flux condition as the second boundary condition occur at the far end described as 4 c x t x 0 a s x t 0 to complete the dispersion problem the pollutant s source is considered a pulse source of varying and uniform source the solutions with each are obtained in the next two sub sections respectively 2 1 varying pulse source it is supposed that the infiltrated pollutant reaching the groundwater domain that is the input concentration be increasing at decelerating rate approaching to c 0 till its source on some municipal surface area is abandoned forever at t t 0 in the time domain t t 0 the input concentration decreases at an accelerated rate leading to the rehabilitation of the polluted domain the location of the input concentration in both the time domains is supposed to be shifting linearly this scenario may be described mathematically by a third type condition a non homogeneous condition in the presence of the source and a homogeneous condition in the absence of the source as in problem a2 in van genutchen and alves 1982 let it be written as 5 d c x u c x t u c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 a t x α f 1 β t where the coefficients in eq 5 are the same as in the ade in eq 1 hence it may be written as 6 d 0 f 2 γ t c x u 0 f 3 γ t c x t u 0 f 3 γ t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 a t x α f 1 β t for β 0 either f 1 β t 0 or f 1 β t 0 e g let it be 1 0 then in either case the source s location in eq 6 becomes stationary in the former case it will be situated at the origin x 0 and in the latter case at a non origin point x α firstly the moving source is transformed into a stationary source for it a new position variable ξ is introduced in terms of position variable x through a transformation 7 ξ dx f 1 β t α ξ x f 1 β t α then 8 d ξ dx 1 f 1 β t so we have c x c ξ d ξ dx 1 f 1 β t c ξ and 2 c x 2 1 f 1 β t ξ c ξ d ξ dx 1 f 1 2 β t 2 c ξ 2 also we may derive from eq 7 that for x α f 1 β t ξ 0 and as x ξ thus the time dependent source location x α f 1 β t reduces into a static location at the origin ξ 0 an ordinary differential equation ode like that in eq 8 occurs as one of the three odes referred to as an auxiliary system equivalent to a linear first order partial differential equation pde in independent variables x and ξ with coefficients f 1 β t and 1 of the two derivative terms respectively any two of the three such solutions as in eq 7 of the auxiliary system form the general solution of the pde in the process of getting analytical solutions of the ades with spatio temporal coefficients of hydrogeological importance similar transformations have been used to reduce the variable coefficients into constant coefficients in the works of kumar et al 2010 jaiswal et al 2011a jaiswal et al 2011b kumar et al 2012 yadav et al 2012 and singh et al 2012 the use genesis and correctness of such a coordinate transformation are also discussed in these works and later in sanskrityayn and kumar 2018 and jaiswal et al 2020 kumar 2020 appraises this type of transformation in detail which introduces a new position variable accommodating the variable coefficient s of space derivatives of a parabolic partial differential equation using derivations after eq 8 the ade in eq 2 may be written as 9 f 1 β t c t d 0 f 2 γ t f 1 β t 2 c ξ 2 u 0 f 3 γ t c ξ 0 ξ the initial condition in eq 3 may be written as 10 c ξ t 0 a t t 0 ξ 0 the first boundary condition in eq 6 may be written at the origin of ξ domain as 11 d 0 f 2 γ t f 1 β t c ξ u 0 f 3 γ t c ξ t u 0 f 3 γ t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 a t ξ 0 and the second boundary condition in eq 4 as 12 c ξ 0 a s ξ t 0 to get rid of the temporal function f 1 β t in eq 9 and the condition in eq 11 second new position variable is introduced using another transformation similar to one in eq 7 13 η f 1 β t d ξ f 1 β t ξ it is evident from eq 13 that the domain of η is also a semi infinite domain as that of ξ the ade in the η t domain may be written as 14 c t d 0 f 2 γ t 2 c η 2 u 0 f 3 γ t c η 0 η and the initial and the two boundary conditions may respectively be written as 15 c η t 0 a t t 0 η 0 16 d 0 f 2 γ t c η u 0 f 3 γ t c η t u 0 f 3 γ t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 a t η 0 and 17 c η 0 a s η t 0 further to transform the temporal coefficients of space derivative terms in the ade in eq 14 and the condition in eq 16 into constant coefficients the third and the last new position variable χ is introduced using a transformation 18 χ f 3 γ t f 2 γ t d η f 3 γ t f 2 γ t η o r d χ d η f 3 γ t f 2 γ t as a result eq 14 may be written as 19 f 2 γ t f 3 2 γ t c t d 0 2 c χ 2 u 0 c χ 0 χ now the temporal coefficient on the left hand side of eq 19 is accommodated in a new time variable τ through the kirchhoff s transformation crank 1975 20 τ 0 t f 3 2 γ ν f 2 γ ν d ν since the initial condition is defined at t 0 so the lower limit of the integral in eq 20 is zero at which the value of the function after integral will be a constant see section 2 3 so d τ dt f 3 2 γ t f 2 γ t and c t c τ d τ dt thus using the transformations in eqs 18 and 20 the ade in eq 19 may be obtained as an ade with constant coefficients in the new space time domain χ τ as 21 c τ d 0 2 c χ 2 u 0 c χ 0 χ and the initial and boundary conditions may be written as 22 c χ τ 0 a t τ 0 f o r χ 0 23 d 0 c χ u 0 c χ τ u 0 c 0 0 τ τ 0 0 τ τ 0 χ 0 and 24 c χ 0 a s χ a t τ 0 where τ 0 is the time corresponding to t 0 the time at which the source stops emitting the pollution thus we get the governing equations of the dispersion problem under consideration with constant coefficients in eqs 21 24 it is the same problem stated in section a2 of van genutchen and alves 1982 but in x t domain whose solution obtained through litt is also reported there hence the solution of the eqs 21 24 may be written as given below however the derivational procedure of getting the following solution using litt is also given in the appendix of the present work from where eq a19 may be taken into consideration to write it as 25 c χ τ h χ τ 0 τ τ 0 h χ τ h χ τ τ 0 τ τ 0 0 χ where 26 h χ τ c 0 2 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ 2 u 0 2 τ π d 0 1 2 exp χ u 0 τ 2 4 d 0 τ 1 u 0 χ d 0 u 0 2 τ d 0 exp u 0 χ d 0 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ 27 χ f 3 γ t f 2 γ t x α f 1 β t the new time variable τ may be obtained in terms of t from eq 20 for the given expressions of two temporal functions in it and τ 0 may be obtained from the expression of τ corresponding to t 0 the time at which the pollution source ceases to exist the expression for χ in eq 27 may be obtained in terms of x from eqs 18 13 and 7 using them in order in this way the desired analytical solution c x t may be obtained in terms of x α f 1 β t the space domain of the solution in both the time domains will be α f 1 β t 0 2 2 uniform pulse source in a linearly moving uniform pulse point source e g a moving fossil fuel vehicle let the input concentration remain uniform c 0 in the presence of the source fig 1 and once the source is eliminated at t t 0 it become zero this scenario is described by a first type condition a non homogeneous condition in the presence of the source and a homogeneous condition in the absence of the source as in problem a1 in van genutchen and alves 1982 the moving source is described in the same way as in the case of varying source in eq 5 this boundary condition may be defined as 28 c x t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 x α f 1 β t using transformations in eqs 7 13 18 and 20 above condition will assume the form in χ τ domain as 29 c χ τ c 0 0 τ τ 0 0 τ τ 0 χ 0 the solution of the problem comprised of the ade in eq 21 initial condition in eq 22 source boundary condition in eq 29 and second boundary condition in eq 24 using litt is also obtained in the appendix from where eq a25 may be taken into acoount to write the desired solution it is the same problem stated in problem a1 of van genutchen and alves 1982 in x t domain as 30 c χ τ f χ τ 0 τ τ 0 f χ τ f χ τ τ 0 τ τ 0 0 χ where 31 f χ τ c 0 2 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ exp u 0 d 0 χ erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ χ is given in terms of x in eq 27 and expression for τ may be obtained in terms of t from eq 20 as stated with the solution of varying source in eq 25 the domain of the proposed solution in eq 30 in the presence of the uniform source will be α f 1 β t x but in its absence will be α f 1 β t 0 x 2 2 1 special cases analytical solutions in the following five cases are obtained from eq 30 of which first two cases are with linearly moving uniform pulse source and the next three cases are with stationary uniform pulse or continuous source more cases may also be considered and solutions for them may be obtained for particular values of the different parameters occurring in the proposed solution case 1 let f 2 γ t f 3 γ t f γ t then f γ t may be taken on left hand side of the ade in eq 2 and at the same stage the new time variable τ ν 0 t f γ ν d ν may be introduced resulting in the solution c η τ as a special case of that in eq 30 32 c η τ f η τ 0 τ τ 0 f η τ f η τ τ 0 τ τ 0 0 η where 33 f η τ c 0 2 erfc η u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ exp u 0 d 0 η erfc η u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ and 34 η x α f 1 β t case 2 let γ 0 and f 2 γ t f 3 γ t 1 then the coefficients of the ade in eq 2 will be constants and the solution obtained will be in terms of independent variables η t as 35 c η t f η t 0 t t 0 f η t f η t t 0 t t 0 0 η where 36 f η t c 0 2 erfc η u 0 t 2 d 0 t exp u 0 d 0 η erfc η u 0 t 2 d 0 t and η is given in eq 34 case 3 let β 0 such that f 1 β t 0 then the solution in eq 30 will become that for a stationary source at the origin in which the expressionof thenew space variable may be obtained from eq 27 as χ x f 3 γ t f 2 γ t this particular solution in the presence of the source is an existing solution obtained for a continuous uniform source provided by jaiswal et al 2011 case 4 let γ 0 f 2 γ t f 3 γ t 1 and also β 0 such that f 1 β t 0 then the moving pulse uniform source becomes a stationary source at the origin x 0 and the solution in eq 30 reduces to an existing solution in the section a1 of van genutchen and alves 1982 as 37 c x t f x t 0 t t 0 f x t f x t t 0 t t 0 0 x where 38 f x t c 0 2 erfc x u 0 t 2 d 0 t exp u 0 d 0 x erfc x u 0 t 2 d 0 t case 5 let γ 0 f 2 γ t f 3 γ t 1 and β 0 such that f 1 β t 0 let f 1 β t 1 then the uniform moving source will reduce to a stationary source at x α and the solution in eq 30 reduces to the solution 39 c x t g x α t 0 t t 0 g x α t g x α t t 0 t t 0 α x where 40 g x α t c 0 2 erfc x α u 0 t 2 d 0 t exp u 0 d 0 x α erfc x α u 0 t 2 d 0 t this solution in the domain α x may also be derived separately by applying litt and using a coordinate transformation y x α in the cases 2 4 and 5 d 0 and u 0 will be constant dispersion coefficient and velocity respectively similarly the analytical solutions in special cases with varying pulse source or varying continuous source may also be derived from the solution in eq 25 of section 2 1 for example for γ 0 f 2 γ t f 3 γ t 1 and β 0 such that f 1 β t 0 then from eq 27 we have χ x and from eq 20 τ t t see the last lines of next sub section 2 3 using them in eqs 25 and 26 we get another existing solution of the ade with constant coefficients with the varying pulse source at the origin for non adsorbing porous medium for which adsorption coefficient r 1 reported as problem a2 of van genutchen and alves 1982 2 3 temporal functions and expressions for new time variable two asymptotically increasing expressions for the temporal function f 1 β t introduced in eq 1 are considered as follows i f 1 β t 1 exp β t its range being 0 1 and ii f 1 β t 1 β t 1 β t its range being 1 2 for β 0 expression i yields stationary source at x 0 and the expression ii gives that at a non zero point x α both functions represent the linear motion of the source of the pollutants along the axis the function in i is used to illustrate the proposed solutions through the figures and that in ii is used to evaluate the error of approximation of the proposed solution obtained as a special case in eq 35 iii further in eq 2 let temporally dependent dispersion coefficient and advective velocity be considered exponentially accelerating and exponentially decelerating respectively that is let f 2 γ t exp γ t and f 3 γ t exp γ t then the expression of the new time variable occurring in the solutions in eqs 26 and 31 may be obtained from eq 20 as 41 τ 0 t f 3 2 γ ν f 2 γ ν d ν 0 t exp 3 γ ν d ν 1 3 γ 1 exp 3 γ t iv in eq 2 considering f 2 γ t exp γ t and f 3 γ t exp γ t we will have 42 τ 0 t exp 3 γ ν d ν 1 3 γ exp 3 γ t 1 v in the case f 2 γ t f 3 γ t exp γ t let the expression for the new time variable in eq 33 will be 43 τ 0 t exp γ ν d ν 1 γ 1 exp γ t vi if f 2 γ t f 3 γ t exp γ t then in eq 33 we will have 44 τ 0 t exp γ ν d ν 1 γ exp γ t 1 it may be derived from each of the four expressions of the new time variables in eqs 41 44 that at t 0 τ 0 so nature of the initial condition does not alter in the new time domain further for γ 0 each of the integrand in iii vi will be 1 0 so τ t also applying ľ hospital s rule it may be verified that each of the expressions of τ in these cases tend to t as γ 0 it may be noted that all the three temoral functions f 1 β t f 2 γ t and f 3 γ t occur explicitly in the proposed solutions so expressions for these functions other than those considered above may be considered according to the need at the most eq 20 may not be integrable in closed form function for any expression s in that case the integral may be integrated numerically 2 4 error of approximation the analytical solution of the ade with constant coefficients obtained for a stationary source at the origin is exact because it satisfies the ade it means it bears no error of approximation whereas the solution of the same ade with a linearly moving source may not satisfy the ade though it may satisfy the two boundary conditions the consideration of the moving source may introduce some error of approximation to check it the solution in eq 35 is considered it is the solution of following ade 45 c t d 0 2 c η 2 u 0 c η 0 η subject to initial condition 46 c η t 0 0 η 0 uniform pulse source condition 47 c η 0 t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 and the second boundary condition 48 c η 0 a s η t 0 the remainder term responsible for the error of approximation in this solution may be written as 49 r c t d 0 2 c η 2 u 0 c t where c η t has the expression in eq 35 substituting it in eq 49 if we get r 0 then the solution in eq 35 is exact otherwise not in the present case we get it as 50 r η t e η t 0 t t 0 e η t e η t t 0 t t 0 in which the expression for e η t may be derived as 51 e η t 2 α β f 1 β t 1 π d 0 t exp η u 0 t 2 4 d 0 t u 0 2 d 0 exp u 0 d 0 η erfc η u 0 t 2 d 0 t where η x α f 1 β t and f 1 β t represents the first order derivative of f 1 β t with respect to the time variable it may be concluded that the remainder terms will vanish that is r 0 if either α 0 or β 0 or f 1 β t 0 or f β t is constant in any of these cases the point source will reduce to a stationary source it means this error is introduced due to the consideration of the moving source the values of this expression are put with the respective concentration value in table 1 the table shows the error is negligible at any time and position compared to the respective concentration value although the solution in eq 35 satisfies both conditions in eqs 47 and 48 3 illustration and discussion the analytical solutions of the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with temporally dependent dispersion along an unsteady advection derived and proposed in eqs 25 and 30 with linearly moving varying and uniform pulse point sources respectively are illustrated in the space domain α f 1 β t x 1 0 except in the case of uniform pulse source the rehabilitation pattern is drawn in the domain α f 1 β t 0 x 1 0 once the source stops emitting pollutants after t t 0 the source s location is changing with time along the x axis governed by an asymptotically increasing temporal function f 1 β t 1 exp β t fig 1 the dispersion coefficient and advective velocity are considered exponentially accelerating and exponentially decelerating respectively that is in eq 2 we consider d t d 0 exp γ t and u t u 0 exp γ t for the two expressions the dispersivity d u increases with time the other common input values used in evaluating the concentration values from the proposed solutions are considered as c 0 1 0 α 1 0 km β 0 1 day 1 γ 0 5 day 1 and t 0 0 6 days fig 2 a and 2b illustrate the analytical solutions in eq 25 obtained for the linearly moving varying source in the presence and during the absence of the source respectively both figures compare the concentration levels evaluated in three situations i shown by full line curves with the dispersion dominated data in which value of initial dispersion coefficient d 0 is higher than that of initial advective velocity u 0 d 0 0 56 km2 day u 0 0 45 km day ii shown by dashed line curves with the advection dominated data d 0 0 45 km2 day u 0 0 56 km day and iii the curves depicted by symbol cross with the stationary source at the origin and the dispersion dominated data β γ 0 d 0 0 56 km2 day u 0 0 45 km day the last set represents the existing solution of problem a2 of van genutchen and alves 1982 which is the same dispersion problem as of the present work but with constant coefficients of the ade and the stationary source at the origin for these sets the values of initial dispersivity d 0 u 0 are 1 24 km and 0 80 km respectively due to the existence of the dispersivity term d u with a negative sign as a coefficient of the derivative term in the condition in eq 6 the input concentration hence the concentration distribution along the domain depends upon it it has been observed that if the difference in the values of dispersivities for dispersion dominated data and advection dominated data is large then the respective input concentration values too occur with a big difference so to keep the concentration curves closer at any time the initial values of dispersion coefficient and velocity are chosen with smaller difference in the presence of the moving source concentration curves are drawn at t 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 days in fig 2a while the rehabilitation process of the polluted domain is drawn in fig 2b at t 0 7 0 9 and 1 1 days once the source stops emitting the pollutants just after t t 0 0 6 days the respective values of the new time variable τ are evaluated using its expression in terms of t obtained from eq 20 see section 2 3 and also the fourth paragraph of this section the locations of the input concentration in fig 1a are 0 019 0 039 and 0 58 km and in fig 2b these are 0 067 0 086 and 0 104 km at the respective time values evaluated from x α 1 exp β t for α 1 0 km β 0 1 day 1 whereas in both figures the curves shown by crosses representing the existing solution start from the origin fig 2a exhibits the increasing input concentration with time but with decreasing rate tending to c 0 1 0 as a result the polluting domain achieves saturation after quite some time and will have no further effect of the presence of the source in the absence of the source it may be viewed from fig 2b that the input concentration decreases with time with increasing rate resulting in faster rehabilitation it may be observed that the dispersion dominated pollution level of the domain is lower than advection dominated level fig 2a hence the rehabilitation process is slower in the former case than that in the latter case fig 2b when the curves drawn for sets i and iii both using the same dispersion dominated data are compared with each other it may be seen that at a time input concentration in case of static source originating from the origin is slightly higher than that with the moving source though the curve in the former situation lags behind of that in the latter case from an intermediate position of the domain that difference increases with time fig 2a in fig 2b this trend is reversed after quite some time in both the figures the variation in input concentration is on the expected lines desired by the varying pulse source condition also the concentration distribution pattern with position and time with moving source full line curves and dashed line curves are very much similar to the curves of the existing solution of the problem a2 of van genutchen and alves 1982 originating from the origin the concentration curves described by the solution in eq 30 derived with a uniform pulse source are drawn at t 0 2 and 0 6 days in fig 3 a in the presence of the source and at t 0 7 and 1 1 days in fig 3b in the absence of the source fig 3a and 3b compare the concentration level for three sets of values of unsteady parameter β day 1 initial dispersion coefficient d 0 km2 day and initial advected velocity u 0 km day i shown by full line curves β 0 1 d 0 0 56 u 0 0 20 ii by dashed curves β 0 1 d 0 0 20 u 0 0 56 and iii by curves shown by crosses β 0 0 d 0 0 56 u 0 0 20 the sets i and iii for which the initial dispersivity d 0 u 0 is 2 8 km results in a dispersion dominated concentration while the set ii for which the initial dispersivity is 0 35 km depicts the advection dominated concentration transport the source is considered moving in sets i and ii represented by a non zero value of β and set iii in which β 0 represents an existing solution of jaiswal et al 2011 see case 3 of sub section 2 2 1 with stationary static source the value γ 0 5 day 1 occur in all the three sets from fig 3a it may be observed that i the input concentration the concentration at the source location for all the sets of data is 1 0 originating from the same locations as in fig 2a at t 0 2 and 0 6 days when the source is moving whereas it originates from x 0 when the source is stationary ii due to this fact at any time the concentration curve originating from the stationary source slightly lags behind the concentration curves emanating from the moving source iii concentration value at any position increases with time iv it decreases with position at any time and v the dispersion dominated concentration level is higher than that in the advection dominance situation a trend opposite of that in fig 2a because at any time the input concentration in fig 2a in the former case is much less than that in the latter case whereas it is uniform in fig 3a this difference reduces as the domain gets polluted fig 3b exhibits the rehabilitation pattern of the polluted domain once the source has been removed it may be observed that i at any time the input concentration is zero at the location x 0 058 km evaluated from x α 1 exp β t 0 using t 0 0 6 days α 1 0 km β 0 1 day 1 in the case of moving source and it is zero at the origin in the case of stationary source and ii it is faster in the case of dispersion dominated data than that in the case of the advection dominated data the concentration attenuation pattern in both the figures for moving source follows the same of the existing solution jaiswal et al 2011a jaiswal et al 2011b with the stationary source the values of new time variable τ are evaluated using eq 41 for each of the six values of t and the two temporal functions with which the above four figures are drawn these are put in an ordered pair t τ as 0 2 0 17 0 4 0 30 0 6 0 39 0 7 0 43 0 9 0 49 and 1 1 0 53 from eq 41 it may be observed that as t τ 0 66 for the chosen value γ 0 5 this fast convergence of new time variable to a stable value which is inversely proportional to the unsteady parameter is very much evident from the above set of ordered pairs it means soon exponentially decelerating groundwater velocity becomes constant and the flow domain will attain a saturation stage in the presence of the source on the other hand with reversed combination that is with exponentially decelerating dispersion coefficient and accelerating velocity the expression for τ is obtained in eq 42 from that it may be seen that as t τ however there is no possibility of groundwater velocity increasing exponentially with time neither this situation may occur in a laminar flow in an open medium at the most a time dependent velocity may increase marginally and asymptotically hence the temporal functions chosen to illustrate the proposed solutions are in accordance with the hydrological perspective similarly we may analyze that the temporal functions in iv of section 2 3 form a viable combination whereas that in v is another hypothetical one numerical solutions are not obtained in the present work the currently existing numerical codes like mt3dms matlab pdepe modflow feflow use a space domain with fixed ends hence cannot be used to get numerical solution of such a problem like the present one framed in a domain with a time dependent starting point the same issue persists while getting the numerical solution using a finite difference method the moving source keeps the number of nodes along the position domain changing it affects the stability criterion and might be introducing much error in the numerical solution so the authenticity of the proposed solution is ensured through getting its error of approximation that has been found negligible discussed in next paragraph an exact solution does not require validation through numerical solution on the other side no numerical solution is exact neither one can figure out the error of approximation associated with a numerical solution except managing it through grid sizes however in due course of time the proposed solutions may be beneficial in developing the numerical codes with time dependent space domain to get the numerical solutions obtained from the codes or by using finite difference methods in section 2 4 it is enucleated that the proposed solutions with moving source are not exact the effect of the error of approximation introduced due to the consideration of a moving source is shown in table 1 the second temporal function written in section 2 3 f 1 β t α 1 β t 1 β t is chosen to render the motion of the source for it the solution in eq 35 is considered this solution occurs for the ade with constant coefficients describing the pollutant s transport emanating from a linearly moving uniform pulse point source the error of approximation of this solution r η t has the expression given in eq 50 it is evaluated at t 0 4 and 0 6 days in the presence of the source and at t 0 9 and 1 1 days in the absence of the source assuming the source stops emanating pollution at t t 0 0 6 days in addition to the values of the error term concentration values are also evaluated from the proposed solutions in the three cases i from the solution in eq 30 when d t d 0 exp γ t and u u 0 exp γ t that is when dispersivity d u is accelerating denoted by c 1 χ τ ii from the same solution in eq 30 but when d d 0 exp γ t and u u 0 exp γ t that is when the dispersivity is decelerating denoted by c 2 χ τ and iii from the solution in eq 35 when both dispersion coefficient and advection velocity are constants hence the dispersivity is constant denoted by c η t the input values used are α 0 1 km β 0 1 day 1 γ 0 5 day 1 d 0 0 20 km2 day and u 0 0 56 km day the location of the source at each time is denoted by x 0 evaluated from x 0 α f 1 β t in the presence of the source and from x 0 α f 1 β t 0 in the absence of the source for the chosen expression of f 1 β t the concentration values in the three stated situations are put in the first three rows respectively whereas the error values in the respective concentration values c η t are put below it in the fourth row it is very much evident from table 1 that the error introduced in the concentration values for uniform dispersivity evaluated from eq 35 is negligible hence has no effect on the concentration level as it is also evident from the table 1 that the concentration values evaluated for time dependent dispersivity are in the proximity of those for uniform dispersivity that being the maximum in the case of accelerating dispersivity and the least in the case of decelerating dispersivity hence it will be apropos to conclude that the proposed solutions of the ade with temporal coefficients and moving source also bears negligible error of approximation as is the case with the ade with constant coefficients and moving source 4 conclusions in conclusion the present work provides an analytical solution of the ade with a linearly moving source in explicit form using litt in conformity of its existing solution with stationary source such a solution is especially significant in assessing groundwater pollution and its rehabilitation pattern in context of the barrier in identifying the exact location where the infiltrated pollution meets its domain and whether it remains same over the time period or shifts to assess it a field data may be compared with the solutions obtained under inclinable conditions with moving source condition and stationary source condition respectively the latter may also be obtained as a special case of the former as discussed in sub section 2 2 1 to present it a varying pulse source condition is considered simultaneously solutions are obtained using a moving uniform pulse source as a special case of that obtained with varying source condition relevant to the similar dispersion problems in an open medium like air soil and rivers the same approach may allow examining the actual effect of a rotating source as well as of a moving boundary in most of the naturally occurring events cited in the introduction it is evident from the present study that assuming a moving source stationary will only yield the deficient results the only extra configuration of the present analysis is to reduce the moving source into a stationary using a pertinent transformation rest of the steps are the same as in getting the solutions with a stationary source using litt the consideration of moving source introduces some negligible error but this error may further be taken care of by using an appropriate coefficient in the first transformation in eq 7 as the three temporal functions considered in the problem appear explicitly in the proposed solutions so they will be equally good to be used with a suitable time dependent expression at regular or non regular time intervals or with a duly interpolated function according to the need credit authorship contribution statement naveen kumar conceptualization writing review and editing dilip kumar

journal for fruitful comments which influenced greatly in revising the earlier submissions twice appendix this appendix provides the detailed derivation of the final solutions in sections 2 1 and 2 2 to get the solutions laplace integral transformation technique litt is used the particular solution in the laplacian domain in which the litt reduces the original governing equations into an ode of second order along with the two boundary conditions with the uniform source section 2 2 is obtained as a special case from that obtained in the laplacian domain with the varying source section 2 1 simultaneously it also answers whether the final solutions obtained after taking the laplace inverse transformation of the solutions in the laplacian domain of the ade with the uniform and varying sources respectively may be obtained as special cases of the final solution of the same ade with a varying source condition but with coefficients other than those of the ade to keep derivations shorter occupying less space we choose a varying continuous source condition with constant but different coefficients at the origin in place of varying pulse source in eq 23 and get the solution the ade in eq 21 with it along with the initial condition in eq 22 and second boundary condition in eq 24 the ade in eq 21 is a1 c τ d 0 2 c χ 2 u 0 c χ 0 χ and the initial condition in eq 22 is a2 c χ 0

χ 0 χ τ 0 to reduce the convective term from the ade in eq a1 let us use a transformation a5 c χ τ k χ τ exp u 0 χ 2 d 0 u 0 2 τ 4 d 0 as a result governing equations a1 a4 become a6 k τ d 0 2 k χ 2 a7 k χ 0 0 a8 θ k χ ϕ θ u 0 2 d 0 k u 0 c 0 exp u 0 2 τ 4 d 0 χ 0 a9 k χ u 0 2 d 0 k 0 χ applying laplace integral transformation on eqs a6 a8 and a9 for which we multiply each of these three equations by e p τ integrate each from 0 to and use 0 k τ e p τ d τ k χ τ e p τ τ 0 τ p 0 k χ τ e p τ d τ p k χ p as e p τ 0 when τ and by eq a7 k χ τ 0 0 we get the respective equations as a10 d 2 k

p τ d τ and μ u 0 2 d 0 are assumed the general solution of eq a10 may be written with two arbitrary constants a and b as a13 k χ p a e χ p d 0 b e χ p d 0 so d k d χ μ d 0 k a p d 0 μ d 0 e χ p d 0 b p d 0 μ d 0 e χ p d 0 0 or a p d 0 μ d 0 e 2 χ p d 0 b p d 0 μ d 0 0 as χ e 2 χ p d 0 0 so using condition a12 on eq a13 we get b 0 as p d 0 μ d 0 0 so the general solution in eq a13 becomes a14 k χ p

substituting θ d 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a3 we get the varying continuous source condition as a16 d 0 c χ u 0 c u 0 c 0 τ 0 χ 0 which is the same in the presence of the source in eq 23 substituting θ d 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a15 we get a17 k χ p u 0 c 0 e χ p d 0 d 0 p μ p μ 2 μ u 0 2 d 0 taking the laplace inverse transformation of a17 by using the following formula in the independent variables χ τ van

in eq a5 we get c χ τ as a19 c χ τ c 0 2 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ 2 u 0 2 τ π d 0 1 2 exp χ u 0 τ 2 4 d 0 τ 1 u 0 χ d 0 u 0 2 τ d 0 exp u 0 χ d 0 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ which is h χ τ in eq 26 for the varying pulse source in eq 23 the solution will be written as in eq 25 the solution with uniform source let us put θ 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a3 we get a20 c χ τ c 0 χ 0 τ 0 which is the condition for uniform continuous source at the origin using eq a5 on it we get a21 k χ τ c 0 exp u 0 2 τ 4 d 0 applying laplace integral transformation on eq a21 we get a22 k χ p c 0 p μ 2 a t χ 0 μ u 0 2 d 0 using the condition in eq a22 in the general solution in eq a14 we get the particular solution of eqs a10 a12 and a22 as a23 k χ p c 0 e χ p d 0 p μ 2 it may be noted that eq a23 may directly be obtained by substituting θ 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a15 using the following formula in the independent variables χ τ van genutchen and alves 1982 a24 l 1 e χ p p μ 2 1 2 l 1 l 2 where the expressions for l 1 and l 2 are given in eq a18 and taking the laplace inverse transformation of a23 we get k χ τ substituting which in eq a5 we get the solution of the ade in eq a1 subject to the conditions in eqs a2 a4 and a20 as follows a25 c χ τ c 0 2 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ exp u 0 χ d 0 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ which is f χ τ in eq 31 for the uniform pulse source in eq 28 the solution will be written as in eq 30 to get the final solution of eqs a1 a4 we have to take the laplace inverse transformation of eq a15 for which we may use following formula a26 l 1 e χ p p λ p μ 2 1 2 μ λ l 1 1 2 μ λ l 2 λ μ 2 λ 2 exp λ χ λ 2 τ erfc χ

following the formula in eq a26 to write the laplace inverse transformation of eq a15 we may get a28 k χ τ u 0 c 0 d 0 2 1 ϕ d 0 l 1 1 2 μ θ ϕ d 0 l 2 2 ϕ d 0 μ θ μ θ 2 ϕ d 0 μ θ 2 exp λ χ λ 2 τ erfc χ λ τ 2 τ using the expressions of l 1 and l 2 from eq a18 we may write k χ τ in eq a28 substituting it in eq a5 we may get c χ τ the solution of eqs a1 a4 putting θ 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a28 and using the property erfc 0 as the argument of complementary error function in the third term of eq a28 will become infinity by putting θ 0 in it the solution c χ τ of eqs a1 a4 will reduce into the solution of eqs a1 a2 a20 and a4 given in eq a25 thus the solution of the ade with uniform continuous source may be obtained as a special case from the solution of the same ade with varying continuous source with coefficients different than those of the diffusive and advective terms of the ade the same will apply with the pulse source however putting θ d 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a28 we observe that the denominator of the coefficients of second and third terms become zero so the solution in eq a19 obtained with the source condition in eq a16 cannot be obtained as a special case from eq a28 thus the solution of the ade with the varying continuous source both having the same two coefficients cannot be obtained as a special case from that of the same ade with the varying continuous source having the two coefficients different from those of the ade 
3280,the present work derives analytical solutions of advection dispersion equation ade with temporal coefficients and a pollutant s point source moving linearly along the axis of a one dimensional semi infinite domain the source is considered a varying and a uniform pulse source respectively the dispersion of pollutant originating from a varying pulse source may be supposed to occur along groundwater flow domain and that from a uniform pulse source in an open medium like air or along a river flow the location of the input concentration that is the pollutant s concentration emanating from the source in an open medium or that reaching the groundwater domain being infiltrated from its source on the ground is considered moving linearly along the flow direction the motion of the source is described through an asymptotically increasing temporal function the illustration of the analytical solution clearly reflects this feature it also renders that the concentration pattern of the proposed solution is proximal to that of an existing solution obtained with the stationary source the pertinent existing solutions may also be derived from the proposed solutions the proposed solutions are found approximate but it is also found that the error of approximation of one of them is too small to have any effect on the concentration pattern to get these solutions firstly the moving source is reduced into a stationary source at the origin then the governing equations including the ade are made free from the three temporal functions one occurring in the time dependent position of the source and the other two as the coefficients of the ade in this process three new position variables and a new time variable are introduced using as many coordinate transformations then the laplace integral transformation technique litt is used to get the final solutions the solution in laplacian domain with uniform pulse source is obtained as a special case of that with the

time variable defined in eq 20 1 introduction the transport of solute or pollutant emanating from a point or surface source through an environment porous or non porous is being studied mathematically with the help of the analytical or numerical solution of advection dispersion equation ade with reference to an initial condition and the two boundary conditions each of first type solution type or second type flux type or third type mixed type since the middle of the twentieth century it took the pace under growing concern for the deteriorating quality of air soil water bodies on the surface and groundwater in particular when such solutions have been found useful in predicting and assessing the pollution level with position and time firstly the ade s with constant coefficients had been solved analytically with the help of laplace integral transform technique litt the methods like the one transforming the ade into two ordinary differential equations by separating the independent variables were also in practice variety of such solutions is reported in van genutchen and alves 1982 javendal et al 1984 and lindstrom and boersma 1989 later spatial temporal or spatio temporal coefficients of hydrological importance have been considered where the basic approach was adapted to reduce such variable coefficients into constant coefficients using coordinate transformations taylor 1953 scheidegger 1957 rumer 1962 bear and bachmat 1964 crank 1975 selim and mansell 1976 al niami and rushton 1977 lin 1977 marino 1978 hunt 1978 matheron and de marsily 1980 kumar 1983 carnahan and remer 1984 yates 1990 cotta 1993 logan 1996 zoppou and knight 1997 neelz 2006 sirin 2006 kumar et al 2010 jaiswal et al 2011a jaiswal et al 2011b yadav et al 2011 yadav et al 2012 chaudhary and singh 2020 in most of these works the dispersion rule freeze and cherry 1979 has been followed either the dispersion coefficient was considered proportional to velocity or proportional to the square of velocity the analytical solutions of the ade with spatio temporal coefficients and instantaneous sources in an infinite domain also occur basha and el habel 1993 aral and liao 1996 zamani and bombardelli 2014 sanskrityayn et al 2017 moranda et al 2018 recently analytical solutions have been obtained in the fractal framework of the dispersion theory wheatcraft and tyler 1988 by bharati et al 2018 in which the power index of the variable dispersivity ratio of dispersion coefficient and velocity has been considered fractional between one and two in euclidean framework the index is always a positive integer either one or two the list of such works is copious but a new reader may get sufficient references from the above citations in all these works the source of pollution is stationary or static like smoke coming out from the top of a chimney wastewater meeting a flowing or stagnant water domain through a sewage system contaminants reaching the groundwater at a fixed location through infiltration if the source is moving like a moving vehicle emitting pollutants to the best of the knowledge of the authors neither the analytical nor the numerical solution of the ade has been reported so far motion of the source either linear or rotational may be conceptualized in an another way in which a series of sources like chimneys located at different locations along a direction or on a circular track may be thought of in which chimneys operate at a regular interval of time only one chimney operating at a time in this situation too the pollutant is emitting from a source whose location is changing with time in a uniform pulse source the input concentration is uniform till the source is active and it becomes zero once the source stops to work e g smoke coming out of a vehicle till it is moving the groundwater gets polluted by the pollutants which infiltrate from its source like a garbage disposal site on the ground through the vertical soil column and reaches the groundwater body at a certain location this infiltration referred to as an input concentration spreads along the flow the input concentration may increase with time with decelerating rate leading to the domain to reach a saturation stage of being polluted if its source on the ground is eliminated forever the infiltration hence the input concentration starts decreasing with accelerated pace instead of becoming zero and the rehabilitation of the polluted domain begins such a source is referred to as a varying pulse source in the existing literature it is a challenging task to know the exact location where the infiltrated pollutant meets the groundwater and whether this location remains fixed or shifts along the flow with time in the latter situation it is equally important to know the concentration attenuation pattern in space time domain which remains elusive so far the description of time dependent location of input concentration in variety of dispersion problems looks very much similar to that of a moving interface the first description of a moving interface is available in the mathematically formulated problems of melting polar ice cap stefan 1889a 1889b 1889c in a simple first stefan s model a semi infinite sheet of ice melts due to a uniform temperature introduced at the top of the surface assumed as origin the interface on which melting occurs moves from the top surface into the sheet separating water from ice its time dependent position is defined by x s t the temperature distribution is described by a heat equation in the domain 0 x s t with two boundary conditions one at the origin and the other on the moving interface mathematical developments on stefan s problems may be found in the classical books carslaw and jaeger 1959 rubinsteĭn 1971 hoffman 1977 crank 1981 1984 recently rodrigo and thamwattana 2021 have listed the limited known solutions of stefan problems and moving boundary problems but these are mainly based on numerical simulations they have proposed a unified approach of solving fixed and moving boundary problems for the one dimensional heat equation by imbedding a given initial boundary value problem into an initial value problem and have discussed two stefan s problems as the special cases there are plenty of examples in environmental and biological domains in which the interface separating the two distinct phases as in the stefan problem is moving during an epidermal wound healing the wound boundary which is the source of the normal cell density moves towards the wound s center ehrlich 1998 enoch and leaper 2008 in a controlled release of nutrients from a spherical granule the boundary shrinks radially basu et al 2010 cloud is a moving source of rain and the front rain interface is moving forward engulfing a larger domain area rainstorms are often accompanied by wind and when a storm moves over a watershed along the longitudinal direction the interface between the wet surface and the dry surface is the moving boundary when water infiltrates through the soil the wetting front separating the saturated soil from the unsaturated soil is a free moving boundary during dissolution transport of dissolved substance takes place from a moving lnapl low non aqueous phase liquid when lnapl mass is floating over a water table with groundwater flowing horizontally bortoni et al 2019 when chemical spills from a moving vehicle which is not unusual the boundary between the chemically polluted surface and the unpolluted surface is a moving boundary similarly if a dam breaks the water gushes down the river channel the front wall of this moving gush is a moving boundary in an unconfined aquifer rising or falling water table is an example of a moving interface several moving boundary problems in surface water and unsaturated flow have been dealt with by singh 1995 1996 similarly in many pollutants dispersion problems the source of pollution is moving linearly or is rotating examples of moving sources may be counted as moving cars trains ships polluting the domain runoff spraying fog with a moving vehicle for the control of mosquitoes the smoke coming out of the firecrackers fixed on a rotating frame the pollutants infiltrating from garbage disposal sites meet the groundwater level at a uniform or varying rate at a position this position may shift forward or backward along or against the flow in that case it is another example of a moving source an environmental domain particularly a porous medium is seldom homogeneous heterogeneity is its key feature to take care of it in the present work the coefficients of the one dimensional ade are considered temporally dependent matheron and de marsily 1980 dagan 1984 aral and liao 1996 its analytical solutions are proposed with a linearly moving point source of pollutant the position variable of the moving source is considered time dependent described by the equation x α f 1 β t similar to that of the moving interface in the stefan problem stated above where α 0 is a reference position variable and β 0 is an unsteady parameter of dimension inverse of the time variable an important feature may be observed from the existing analytical solutions of the ade with stationary sources obtained by using litt that if the stationary source is situated at the domain s origin x 0 then the solutions occur in terms of error function in x if the source is located at x x 0 the solution may be obtained in terms of x x 0 likewise the analytical solutions in the present work are obtained in terms of x α f 1 β t to get it one cannot use a coordinate transformation like y x α f 1 β t to shift the location at the origin for the obvious reasons as y x x 0 may be used to shift the location x x 0 at x 0 it is done using a different transformation but similar to one introduced a decade earlier which helped reduce the spatio temporal coefficients of the ade into constant coefficients to get the analytical solutions references are cited at a later stage in sub section 2 1 this transformation introduces a new position variable and shifts the time dependent source location at the origin in the process the temporal function f 1 β t comes as a coefficient of the ade this function and the already existing two temporal coefficients of the ade are reduced into constant coefficients through similar three more transformations applied on the governing equations one by one two of them introduce another position variables and the last one a new time variable the point source of pollution is assumed a pulse source the solutions are obtained with varying pulse source apropos to assess groundwater pollution as discussed in the last but one paragraph and with the uniform pulse source in context of pollutant s dispersion in air soil or river bed in two separate sub sections respectively using litt the solution in laplacian domain with the uniform source is obtained as a special case of that obtained with the varying source the proposed solution exhibits a concentration pattern exactly similar to that obtained in the existing solution of the same dispersion problem but with a stationary source with the only difference that in the present work the concentration curves are emanating from time dependent locations whereas in case of the stationary source they originate from the origin the assumption of moving source does not allow getting the exact solution which satisfies the ade but it is found that the error of approximation of one of the proposed solutions is negligible hence does not have any effect on the concentration level along the domain at any time 2 analytical solution of ade with linearly moving source the pollutant s source is assumed moving linearly along the x axis longitudinal direction its location is described by a time dependent position coordinate x t in the cartesian system similar to that in the stefan problems articles 1 2 and 3 2 in crank 1984 let the pollutant s source location at time t be given by x t α f 1 β t where α 0 be a reference position coordinate β 0 be an unsteady parameter of dimension inverse of time variable that is β t is a non dimensional term and f 1 β t be an asymptotically increasing function the advection dispersion equation ade with temporal coefficients in a semi infinite is considered as 1 c t x d t c x u t c α f 1 β t x let d t d 0 f 2 γ t and u u 0 f 3 γ t where f 2 γ t and f 3 γ t are two different temporal functions in which γ 0 is another unsteady parameter of dimension inverse of time variable that is γ t is a dimensionless term d 0 is initial dispersion coefficient and u 0 is the initial advective velocity in context of groundwater hydrology u 0 represents darcy velocity through a saturated aquifer dispersion along a heterogeneous medium particulary a porous medium may be described by the temporal coefficients of the ade matheron and de marsily 1980 dagan 1984 aral and liao 1996 the two temporal functions are chosen such that for zero value of γ each of the two has the value 1 0 and the temporal coefficients reduce to constant coefficients so eq 1 may be written in simplified form as 2 c t d 0 f 2 γ t 2 c x 2 u 0 f 3 γ t c x α f 1 β t x let the domain be initially solute free described by a homogeneous first type condition 3 c x t 0 a t t 0 x α f 1 β t let a zero flux condition as the second boundary condition occur at the far end described as 4 c x t x 0 a s x t 0 to complete the dispersion problem the pollutant s source is considered a pulse source of varying and uniform source the solutions with each are obtained in the next two sub sections respectively 2 1 varying pulse source it is supposed that the infiltrated pollutant reaching the groundwater domain that is the input concentration be increasing at decelerating rate approaching to c 0 till its source on some municipal surface area is abandoned forever at t t 0 in the time domain t t 0 the input concentration decreases at an accelerated rate leading to the rehabilitation of the polluted domain the location of the input concentration in both the time domains is supposed to be shifting linearly this scenario may be described mathematically by a third type condition a non homogeneous condition in the presence of the source and a homogeneous condition in the absence of the source as in problem a2 in van genutchen and alves 1982 let it be written as 5 d c x u c x t u c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 a t x α f 1 β t where the coefficients in eq 5 are the same as in the ade in eq 1 hence it may be written as 6 d 0 f 2 γ t c x u 0 f 3 γ t c x t u 0 f 3 γ t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 a t x α f 1 β t for β 0 either f 1 β t 0 or f 1 β t 0 e g let it be 1 0 then in either case the source s location in eq 6 becomes stationary in the former case it will be situated at the origin x 0 and in the latter case at a non origin point x α firstly the moving source is transformed into a stationary source for it a new position variable ξ is introduced in terms of position variable x through a transformation 7 ξ dx f 1 β t α ξ x f 1 β t α then 8 d ξ dx 1 f 1 β t so we have c x c ξ d ξ dx 1 f 1 β t c ξ and 2 c x 2 1 f 1 β t ξ c ξ d ξ dx 1 f 1 2 β t 2 c ξ 2 also we may derive from eq 7 that for x α f 1 β t ξ 0 and as x ξ thus the time dependent source location x α f 1 β t reduces into a static location at the origin ξ 0 an ordinary differential equation ode like that in eq 8 occurs as one of the three odes referred to as an auxiliary system equivalent to a linear first order partial differential equation pde in independent variables x and ξ with coefficients f 1 β t and 1 of the two derivative terms respectively any two of the three such solutions as in eq 7 of the auxiliary system form the general solution of the pde in the process of getting analytical solutions of the ades with spatio temporal coefficients of hydrogeological importance similar transformations have been used to reduce the variable coefficients into constant coefficients in the works of kumar et al 2010 jaiswal et al 2011a jaiswal et al 2011b kumar et al 2012 yadav et al 2012 and singh et al 2012 the use genesis and correctness of such a coordinate transformation are also discussed in these works and later in sanskrityayn and kumar 2018 and jaiswal et al 2020 kumar 2020 appraises this type of transformation in detail which introduces a new position variable accommodating the variable coefficient s of space derivatives of a parabolic partial differential equation using derivations after eq 8 the ade in eq 2 may be written as 9 f 1 β t c t d 0 f 2 γ t f 1 β t 2 c ξ 2 u 0 f 3 γ t c ξ 0 ξ the initial condition in eq 3 may be written as 10 c ξ t 0 a t t 0 ξ 0 the first boundary condition in eq 6 may be written at the origin of ξ domain as 11 d 0 f 2 γ t f 1 β t c ξ u 0 f 3 γ t c ξ t u 0 f 3 γ t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 a t ξ 0 and the second boundary condition in eq 4 as 12 c ξ 0 a s ξ t 0 to get rid of the temporal function f 1 β t in eq 9 and the condition in eq 11 second new position variable is introduced using another transformation similar to one in eq 7 13 η f 1 β t d ξ f 1 β t ξ it is evident from eq 13 that the domain of η is also a semi infinite domain as that of ξ the ade in the η t domain may be written as 14 c t d 0 f 2 γ t 2 c η 2 u 0 f 3 γ t c η 0 η and the initial and the two boundary conditions may respectively be written as 15 c η t 0 a t t 0 η 0 16 d 0 f 2 γ t c η u 0 f 3 γ t c η t u 0 f 3 γ t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 a t η 0 and 17 c η 0 a s η t 0 further to transform the temporal coefficients of space derivative terms in the ade in eq 14 and the condition in eq 16 into constant coefficients the third and the last new position variable χ is introduced using a transformation 18 χ f 3 γ t f 2 γ t d η f 3 γ t f 2 γ t η o r d χ d η f 3 γ t f 2 γ t as a result eq 14 may be written as 19 f 2 γ t f 3 2 γ t c t d 0 2 c χ 2 u 0 c χ 0 χ now the temporal coefficient on the left hand side of eq 19 is accommodated in a new time variable τ through the kirchhoff s transformation crank 1975 20 τ 0 t f 3 2 γ ν f 2 γ ν d ν since the initial condition is defined at t 0 so the lower limit of the integral in eq 20 is zero at which the value of the function after integral will be a constant see section 2 3 so d τ dt f 3 2 γ t f 2 γ t and c t c τ d τ dt thus using the transformations in eqs 18 and 20 the ade in eq 19 may be obtained as an ade with constant coefficients in the new space time domain χ τ as 21 c τ d 0 2 c χ 2 u 0 c χ 0 χ and the initial and boundary conditions may be written as 22 c χ τ 0 a t τ 0 f o r χ 0 23 d 0 c χ u 0 c χ τ u 0 c 0 0 τ τ 0 0 τ τ 0 χ 0 and 24 c χ 0 a s χ a t τ 0 where τ 0 is the time corresponding to t 0 the time at which the source stops emitting the pollution thus we get the governing equations of the dispersion problem under consideration with constant coefficients in eqs 21 24 it is the same problem stated in section a2 of van genutchen and alves 1982 but in x t domain whose solution obtained through litt is also reported there hence the solution of the eqs 21 24 may be written as given below however the derivational procedure of getting the following solution using litt is also given in the appendix of the present work from where eq a19 may be taken into consideration to write it as 25 c χ τ h χ τ 0 τ τ 0 h χ τ h χ τ τ 0 τ τ 0 0 χ where 26 h χ τ c 0 2 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ 2 u 0 2 τ π d 0 1 2 exp χ u 0 τ 2 4 d 0 τ 1 u 0 χ d 0 u 0 2 τ d 0 exp u 0 χ d 0 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ 27 χ f 3 γ t f 2 γ t x α f 1 β t the new time variable τ may be obtained in terms of t from eq 20 for the given expressions of two temporal functions in it and τ 0 may be obtained from the expression of τ corresponding to t 0 the time at which the pollution source ceases to exist the expression for χ in eq 27 may be obtained in terms of x from eqs 18 13 and 7 using them in order in this way the desired analytical solution c x t may be obtained in terms of x α f 1 β t the space domain of the solution in both the time domains will be α f 1 β t 0 2 2 uniform pulse source in a linearly moving uniform pulse point source e g a moving fossil fuel vehicle let the input concentration remain uniform c 0 in the presence of the source fig 1 and once the source is eliminated at t t 0 it become zero this scenario is described by a first type condition a non homogeneous condition in the presence of the source and a homogeneous condition in the absence of the source as in problem a1 in van genutchen and alves 1982 the moving source is described in the same way as in the case of varying source in eq 5 this boundary condition may be defined as 28 c x t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 x α f 1 β t using transformations in eqs 7 13 18 and 20 above condition will assume the form in χ τ domain as 29 c χ τ c 0 0 τ τ 0 0 τ τ 0 χ 0 the solution of the problem comprised of the ade in eq 21 initial condition in eq 22 source boundary condition in eq 29 and second boundary condition in eq 24 using litt is also obtained in the appendix from where eq a25 may be taken into acoount to write the desired solution it is the same problem stated in problem a1 of van genutchen and alves 1982 in x t domain as 30 c χ τ f χ τ 0 τ τ 0 f χ τ f χ τ τ 0 τ τ 0 0 χ where 31 f χ τ c 0 2 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ exp u 0 d 0 χ erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ χ is given in terms of x in eq 27 and expression for τ may be obtained in terms of t from eq 20 as stated with the solution of varying source in eq 25 the domain of the proposed solution in eq 30 in the presence of the uniform source will be α f 1 β t x but in its absence will be α f 1 β t 0 x 2 2 1 special cases analytical solutions in the following five cases are obtained from eq 30 of which first two cases are with linearly moving uniform pulse source and the next three cases are with stationary uniform pulse or continuous source more cases may also be considered and solutions for them may be obtained for particular values of the different parameters occurring in the proposed solution case 1 let f 2 γ t f 3 γ t f γ t then f γ t may be taken on left hand side of the ade in eq 2 and at the same stage the new time variable τ ν 0 t f γ ν d ν may be introduced resulting in the solution c η τ as a special case of that in eq 30 32 c η τ f η τ 0 τ τ 0 f η τ f η τ τ 0 τ τ 0 0 η where 33 f η τ c 0 2 erfc η u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ exp u 0 d 0 η erfc η u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ and 34 η x α f 1 β t case 2 let γ 0 and f 2 γ t f 3 γ t 1 then the coefficients of the ade in eq 2 will be constants and the solution obtained will be in terms of independent variables η t as 35 c η t f η t 0 t t 0 f η t f η t t 0 t t 0 0 η where 36 f η t c 0 2 erfc η u 0 t 2 d 0 t exp u 0 d 0 η erfc η u 0 t 2 d 0 t and η is given in eq 34 case 3 let β 0 such that f 1 β t 0 then the solution in eq 30 will become that for a stationary source at the origin in which the expressionof thenew space variable may be obtained from eq 27 as χ x f 3 γ t f 2 γ t this particular solution in the presence of the source is an existing solution obtained for a continuous uniform source provided by jaiswal et al 2011 case 4 let γ 0 f 2 γ t f 3 γ t 1 and also β 0 such that f 1 β t 0 then the moving pulse uniform source becomes a stationary source at the origin x 0 and the solution in eq 30 reduces to an existing solution in the section a1 of van genutchen and alves 1982 as 37 c x t f x t 0 t t 0 f x t f x t t 0 t t 0 0 x where 38 f x t c 0 2 erfc x u 0 t 2 d 0 t exp u 0 d 0 x erfc x u 0 t 2 d 0 t case 5 let γ 0 f 2 γ t f 3 γ t 1 and β 0 such that f 1 β t 0 let f 1 β t 1 then the uniform moving source will reduce to a stationary source at x α and the solution in eq 30 reduces to the solution 39 c x t g x α t 0 t t 0 g x α t g x α t t 0 t t 0 α x where 40 g x α t c 0 2 erfc x α u 0 t 2 d 0 t exp u 0 d 0 x α erfc x α u 0 t 2 d 0 t this solution in the domain α x may also be derived separately by applying litt and using a coordinate transformation y x α in the cases 2 4 and 5 d 0 and u 0 will be constant dispersion coefficient and velocity respectively similarly the analytical solutions in special cases with varying pulse source or varying continuous source may also be derived from the solution in eq 25 of section 2 1 for example for γ 0 f 2 γ t f 3 γ t 1 and β 0 such that f 1 β t 0 then from eq 27 we have χ x and from eq 20 τ t t see the last lines of next sub section 2 3 using them in eqs 25 and 26 we get another existing solution of the ade with constant coefficients with the varying pulse source at the origin for non adsorbing porous medium for which adsorption coefficient r 1 reported as problem a2 of van genutchen and alves 1982 2 3 temporal functions and expressions for new time variable two asymptotically increasing expressions for the temporal function f 1 β t introduced in eq 1 are considered as follows i f 1 β t 1 exp β t its range being 0 1 and ii f 1 β t 1 β t 1 β t its range being 1 2 for β 0 expression i yields stationary source at x 0 and the expression ii gives that at a non zero point x α both functions represent the linear motion of the source of the pollutants along the axis the function in i is used to illustrate the proposed solutions through the figures and that in ii is used to evaluate the error of approximation of the proposed solution obtained as a special case in eq 35 iii further in eq 2 let temporally dependent dispersion coefficient and advective velocity be considered exponentially accelerating and exponentially decelerating respectively that is let f 2 γ t exp γ t and f 3 γ t exp γ t then the expression of the new time variable occurring in the solutions in eqs 26 and 31 may be obtained from eq 20 as 41 τ 0 t f 3 2 γ ν f 2 γ ν d ν 0 t exp 3 γ ν d ν 1 3 γ 1 exp 3 γ t iv in eq 2 considering f 2 γ t exp γ t and f 3 γ t exp γ t we will have 42 τ 0 t exp 3 γ ν d ν 1 3 γ exp 3 γ t 1 v in the case f 2 γ t f 3 γ t exp γ t let the expression for the new time variable in eq 33 will be 43 τ 0 t exp γ ν d ν 1 γ 1 exp γ t vi if f 2 γ t f 3 γ t exp γ t then in eq 33 we will have 44 τ 0 t exp γ ν d ν 1 γ exp γ t 1 it may be derived from each of the four expressions of the new time variables in eqs 41 44 that at t 0 τ 0 so nature of the initial condition does not alter in the new time domain further for γ 0 each of the integrand in iii vi will be 1 0 so τ t also applying ľ hospital s rule it may be verified that each of the expressions of τ in these cases tend to t as γ 0 it may be noted that all the three temoral functions f 1 β t f 2 γ t and f 3 γ t occur explicitly in the proposed solutions so expressions for these functions other than those considered above may be considered according to the need at the most eq 20 may not be integrable in closed form function for any expression s in that case the integral may be integrated numerically 2 4 error of approximation the analytical solution of the ade with constant coefficients obtained for a stationary source at the origin is exact because it satisfies the ade it means it bears no error of approximation whereas the solution of the same ade with a linearly moving source may not satisfy the ade though it may satisfy the two boundary conditions the consideration of the moving source may introduce some error of approximation to check it the solution in eq 35 is considered it is the solution of following ade 45 c t d 0 2 c η 2 u 0 c η 0 η subject to initial condition 46 c η t 0 0 η 0 uniform pulse source condition 47 c η 0 t c 0 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 and the second boundary condition 48 c η 0 a s η t 0 the remainder term responsible for the error of approximation in this solution may be written as 49 r c t d 0 2 c η 2 u 0 c t where c η t has the expression in eq 35 substituting it in eq 49 if we get r 0 then the solution in eq 35 is exact otherwise not in the present case we get it as 50 r η t e η t 0 t t 0 e η t e η t t 0 t t 0 in which the expression for e η t may be derived as 51 e η t 2 α β f 1 β t 1 π d 0 t exp η u 0 t 2 4 d 0 t u 0 2 d 0 exp u 0 d 0 η erfc η u 0 t 2 d 0 t where η x α f 1 β t and f 1 β t represents the first order derivative of f 1 β t with respect to the time variable it may be concluded that the remainder terms will vanish that is r 0 if either α 0 or β 0 or f 1 β t 0 or f β t is constant in any of these cases the point source will reduce to a stationary source it means this error is introduced due to the consideration of the moving source the values of this expression are put with the respective concentration value in table 1 the table shows the error is negligible at any time and position compared to the respective concentration value although the solution in eq 35 satisfies both conditions in eqs 47 and 48 3 illustration and discussion the analytical solutions of the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with temporally dependent dispersion along an unsteady advection derived and proposed in eqs 25 and 30 with linearly moving varying and uniform pulse point sources respectively are illustrated in the space domain α f 1 β t x 1 0 except in the case of uniform pulse source the rehabilitation pattern is drawn in the domain α f 1 β t 0 x 1 0 once the source stops emitting pollutants after t t 0 the source s location is changing with time along the x axis governed by an asymptotically increasing temporal function f 1 β t 1 exp β t fig 1 the dispersion coefficient and advective velocity are considered exponentially accelerating and exponentially decelerating respectively that is in eq 2 we consider d t d 0 exp γ t and u t u 0 exp γ t for the two expressions the dispersivity d u increases with time the other common input values used in evaluating the concentration values from the proposed solutions are considered as c 0 1 0 α 1 0 km β 0 1 day 1 γ 0 5 day 1 and t 0 0 6 days fig 2 a and 2b illustrate the analytical solutions in eq 25 obtained for the linearly moving varying source in the presence and during the absence of the source respectively both figures compare the concentration levels evaluated in three situations i shown by full line curves with the dispersion dominated data in which value of initial dispersion coefficient d 0 is higher than that of initial advective velocity u 0 d 0 0 56 km2 day u 0 0 45 km day ii shown by dashed line curves with the advection dominated data d 0 0 45 km2 day u 0 0 56 km day and iii the curves depicted by symbol cross with the stationary source at the origin and the dispersion dominated data β γ 0 d 0 0 56 km2 day u 0 0 45 km day the last set represents the existing solution of problem a2 of van genutchen and alves 1982 which is the same dispersion problem as of the present work but with constant coefficients of the ade and the stationary source at the origin for these sets the values of initial dispersivity d 0 u 0 are 1 24 km and 0 80 km respectively due to the existence of the dispersivity term d u with a negative sign as a coefficient of the derivative term in the condition in eq 6 the input concentration hence the concentration distribution along the domain depends upon it it has been observed that if the difference in the values of dispersivities for dispersion dominated data and advection dominated data is large then the respective input concentration values too occur with a big difference so to keep the concentration curves closer at any time the initial values of dispersion coefficient and velocity are chosen with smaller difference in the presence of the moving source concentration curves are drawn at t 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 days in fig 2a while the rehabilitation process of the polluted domain is drawn in fig 2b at t 0 7 0 9 and 1 1 days once the source stops emitting the pollutants just after t t 0 0 6 days the respective values of the new time variable τ are evaluated using its expression in terms of t obtained from eq 20 see section 2 3 and also the fourth paragraph of this section the locations of the input concentration in fig 1a are 0 019 0 039 and 0 58 km and in fig 2b these are 0 067 0 086 and 0 104 km at the respective time values evaluated from x α 1 exp β t for α 1 0 km β 0 1 day 1 whereas in both figures the curves shown by crosses representing the existing solution start from the origin fig 2a exhibits the increasing input concentration with time but with decreasing rate tending to c 0 1 0 as a result the polluting domain achieves saturation after quite some time and will have no further effect of the presence of the source in the absence of the source it may be viewed from fig 2b that the input concentration decreases with time with increasing rate resulting in faster rehabilitation it may be observed that the dispersion dominated pollution level of the domain is lower than advection dominated level fig 2a hence the rehabilitation process is slower in the former case than that in the latter case fig 2b when the curves drawn for sets i and iii both using the same dispersion dominated data are compared with each other it may be seen that at a time input concentration in case of static source originating from the origin is slightly higher than that with the moving source though the curve in the former situation lags behind of that in the latter case from an intermediate position of the domain that difference increases with time fig 2a in fig 2b this trend is reversed after quite some time in both the figures the variation in input concentration is on the expected lines desired by the varying pulse source condition also the concentration distribution pattern with position and time with moving source full line curves and dashed line curves are very much similar to the curves of the existing solution of the problem a2 of van genutchen and alves 1982 originating from the origin the concentration curves described by the solution in eq 30 derived with a uniform pulse source are drawn at t 0 2 and 0 6 days in fig 3 a in the presence of the source and at t 0 7 and 1 1 days in fig 3b in the absence of the source fig 3a and 3b compare the concentration level for three sets of values of unsteady parameter β day 1 initial dispersion coefficient d 0 km2 day and initial advected velocity u 0 km day i shown by full line curves β 0 1 d 0 0 56 u 0 0 20 ii by dashed curves β 0 1 d 0 0 20 u 0 0 56 and iii by curves shown by crosses β 0 0 d 0 0 56 u 0 0 20 the sets i and iii for which the initial dispersivity d 0 u 0 is 2 8 km results in a dispersion dominated concentration while the set ii for which the initial dispersivity is 0 35 km depicts the advection dominated concentration transport the source is considered moving in sets i and ii represented by a non zero value of β and set iii in which β 0 represents an existing solution of jaiswal et al 2011 see case 3 of sub section 2 2 1 with stationary static source the value γ 0 5 day 1 occur in all the three sets from fig 3a it may be observed that i the input concentration the concentration at the source location for all the sets of data is 1 0 originating from the same locations as in fig 2a at t 0 2 and 0 6 days when the source is moving whereas it originates from x 0 when the source is stationary ii due to this fact at any time the concentration curve originating from the stationary source slightly lags behind the concentration curves emanating from the moving source iii concentration value at any position increases with time iv it decreases with position at any time and v the dispersion dominated concentration level is higher than that in the advection dominance situation a trend opposite of that in fig 2a because at any time the input concentration in fig 2a in the former case is much less than that in the latter case whereas it is uniform in fig 3a this difference reduces as the domain gets polluted fig 3b exhibits the rehabilitation pattern of the polluted domain once the source has been removed it may be observed that i at any time the input concentration is zero at the location x 0 058 km evaluated from x α 1 exp β t 0 using t 0 0 6 days α 1 0 km β 0 1 day 1 in the case of moving source and it is zero at the origin in the case of stationary source and ii it is faster in the case of dispersion dominated data than that in the case of the advection dominated data the concentration attenuation pattern in both the figures for moving source follows the same of the existing solution jaiswal et al 2011a jaiswal et al 2011b with the stationary source the values of new time variable τ are evaluated using eq 41 for each of the six values of t and the two temporal functions with which the above four figures are drawn these are put in an ordered pair t τ as 0 2 0 17 0 4 0 30 0 6 0 39 0 7 0 43 0 9 0 49 and 1 1 0 53 from eq 41 it may be observed that as t τ 0 66 for the chosen value γ 0 5 this fast convergence of new time variable to a stable value which is inversely proportional to the unsteady parameter is very much evident from the above set of ordered pairs it means soon exponentially decelerating groundwater velocity becomes constant and the flow domain will attain a saturation stage in the presence of the source on the other hand with reversed combination that is with exponentially decelerating dispersion coefficient and accelerating velocity the expression for τ is obtained in eq 42 from that it may be seen that as t τ however there is no possibility of groundwater velocity increasing exponentially with time neither this situation may occur in a laminar flow in an open medium at the most a time dependent velocity may increase marginally and asymptotically hence the temporal functions chosen to illustrate the proposed solutions are in accordance with the hydrological perspective similarly we may analyze that the temporal functions in iv of section 2 3 form a viable combination whereas that in v is another hypothetical one numerical solutions are not obtained in the present work the currently existing numerical codes like mt3dms matlab pdepe modflow feflow use a space domain with fixed ends hence cannot be used to get numerical solution of such a problem like the present one framed in a domain with a time dependent starting point the same issue persists while getting the numerical solution using a finite difference method the moving source keeps the number of nodes along the position domain changing it affects the stability criterion and might be introducing much error in the numerical solution so the authenticity of the proposed solution is ensured through getting its error of approximation that has been found negligible discussed in next paragraph an exact solution does not require validation through numerical solution on the other side no numerical solution is exact neither one can figure out the error of approximation associated with a numerical solution except managing it through grid sizes however in due course of time the proposed solutions may be beneficial in developing the numerical codes with time dependent space domain to get the numerical solutions obtained from the codes or by using finite difference methods in section 2 4 it is enucleated that the proposed solutions with moving source are not exact the effect of the error of approximation introduced due to the consideration of a moving source is shown in table 1 the second temporal function written in section 2 3 f 1 β t α 1 β t 1 β t is chosen to render the motion of the source for it the solution in eq 35 is considered this solution occurs for the ade with constant coefficients describing the pollutant s transport emanating from a linearly moving uniform pulse point source the error of approximation of this solution r η t has the expression given in eq 50 it is evaluated at t 0 4 and 0 6 days in the presence of the source and at t 0 9 and 1 1 days in the absence of the source assuming the source stops emanating pollution at t t 0 0 6 days in addition to the values of the error term concentration values are also evaluated from the proposed solutions in the three cases i from the solution in eq 30 when d t d 0 exp γ t and u u 0 exp γ t that is when dispersivity d u is accelerating denoted by c 1 χ τ ii from the same solution in eq 30 but when d d 0 exp γ t and u u 0 exp γ t that is when the dispersivity is decelerating denoted by c 2 χ τ and iii from the solution in eq 35 when both dispersion coefficient and advection velocity are constants hence the dispersivity is constant denoted by c η t the input values used are α 0 1 km β 0 1 day 1 γ 0 5 day 1 d 0 0 20 km2 day and u 0 0 56 km day the location of the source at each time is denoted by x 0 evaluated from x 0 α f 1 β t in the presence of the source and from x 0 α f 1 β t 0 in the absence of the source for the chosen expression of f 1 β t the concentration values in the three stated situations are put in the first three rows respectively whereas the error values in the respective concentration values c η t are put below it in the fourth row it is very much evident from table 1 that the error introduced in the concentration values for uniform dispersivity evaluated from eq 35 is negligible hence has no effect on the concentration level as it is also evident from the table 1 that the concentration values evaluated for time dependent dispersivity are in the proximity of those for uniform dispersivity that being the maximum in the case of accelerating dispersivity and the least in the case of decelerating dispersivity hence it will be apropos to conclude that the proposed solutions of the ade with temporal coefficients and moving source also bears negligible error of approximation as is the case with the ade with constant coefficients and moving source 4 conclusions in conclusion the present work provides an analytical solution of the ade with a linearly moving source in explicit form using litt in conformity of its existing solution with stationary source such a solution is especially significant in assessing groundwater pollution and its rehabilitation pattern in context of the barrier in identifying the exact location where the infiltrated pollution meets its domain and whether it remains same over the time period or shifts to assess it a field data may be compared with the solutions obtained under inclinable conditions with moving source condition and stationary source condition respectively the latter may also be obtained as a special case of the former as discussed in sub section 2 2 1 to present it a varying pulse source condition is considered simultaneously solutions are obtained using a moving uniform pulse source as a special case of that obtained with varying source condition relevant to the similar dispersion problems in an open medium like air soil and rivers the same approach may allow examining the actual effect of a rotating source as well as of a moving boundary in most of the naturally occurring events cited in the introduction it is evident from the present study that assuming a moving source stationary will only yield the deficient results the only extra configuration of the present analysis is to reduce the moving source into a stationary using a pertinent transformation rest of the steps are the same as in getting the solutions with a stationary source using litt the consideration of moving source introduces some negligible error but this error may further be taken care of by using an appropriate coefficient in the first transformation in eq 7 as the three temporal functions considered in the problem appear explicitly in the proposed solutions so they will be equally good to be used with a suitable time dependent expression at regular or non regular time intervals or with a duly interpolated function according to the need credit authorship contribution statement naveen kumar conceptualization writing review and editing dilip kumar

second order along with the two boundary conditions with the uniform source section 2 2 is obtained as a special case from that obtained in the laplacian domain with the varying source section 2 1 simultaneously it also answers whether the final solutions obtained after taking the laplace inverse transformation of the solutions in the laplacian domain of the ade with the uniform and varying sources respectively may be obtained as special cases of the final solution of the same ade with a varying source condition but with coefficients other than those of the ade to keep derivations shorter occupying less space we choose a varying continuous source condition with constant but different coefficients at the origin in place of varying pulse source in eq 23 and get the solution the ade in eq 21 with it along with the initial condition in eq 22 and second boundary condition in eq 24 the ade in eq 21 is a1 c τ d 0 2 c χ 2 u 0 c χ 0 χ and the initial condition in eq 22 is a2 c χ 0

substituting θ d 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a3 we get the varying continuous source condition as a16 d 0 c χ u 0 c u 0 c 0 τ 0 χ 0 which is the same in the presence of the source in eq 23 substituting θ d 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a15 we get a17 k χ p u 0 c 0 e χ p d 0 d 0 p μ p μ 2 μ u 0 2 d 0 taking the laplace inverse transformation of a17 by using the following formula in the independent variables χ τ van

in eq a5 we get c χ τ as a19 c χ τ c 0 2 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ 2 u 0 2 τ π d 0 1 2 exp χ u 0 τ 2 4 d 0 τ 1 u 0 χ d 0 u 0 2 τ d 0 exp u 0 χ d 0 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ which is h χ τ in eq 26 for the varying pulse source in eq 23 the solution will be written as in eq 25 the solution with uniform source let us put θ 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a3 we get a20 c χ τ c 0 χ 0 τ 0 which is the condition for uniform continuous source at the origin using eq a5 on it we get a21 k χ τ c 0 exp u 0 2 τ 4 d 0 applying laplace integral transformation on eq a21 we get a22 k χ p c 0 p μ 2 a t χ 0 μ u 0 2 d 0 using the condition in eq a22 in the general solution in eq a14 we get the particular solution of eqs a10 a12 and a22 as a23 k χ p c 0 e χ p d 0 p μ 2 it may be noted that eq a23 may directly be obtained by substituting θ 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a15 using the following formula in the independent variables χ τ van genutchen and alves 1982 a24 l 1 e χ p p μ 2 1 2 l 1 l 2 where the expressions for l 1 and l 2 are given in eq a18 and taking the laplace inverse transformation of a23 we get k χ τ substituting which in eq a5 we get the solution of the ade in eq a1 subject to the conditions in eqs a2 a4 and a20 as follows a25 c χ τ c 0 2 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ exp u 0 χ d 0 erfc χ u 0 τ 2 d 0 τ which is f χ τ in eq 31 for the uniform pulse source in eq 28 the solution will be written as in eq 30 to get the final solution of eqs a1 a4 we have to take the laplace inverse transformation of eq a15 for which we may use following formula a26 l 1 e χ p p λ p μ 2 1 2 μ λ l 1 1 2 μ λ l 2 λ μ 2 λ 2 exp λ χ λ 2 τ erfc χ

following the formula in eq a26 to write the laplace inverse transformation of eq a15 we may get a28 k χ τ u 0 c 0 d 0 2 1 ϕ d 0 l 1 1 2 μ θ ϕ d 0 l 2 2 ϕ d 0 μ θ μ θ 2 ϕ d 0 μ θ 2 exp λ χ λ 2 τ erfc χ λ τ 2 τ using the expressions of l 1 and l 2 from eq a18 we may write k χ τ in eq a28 substituting it in eq a5 we may get c χ τ the solution of eqs a1 a4 putting θ 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a28 and using the property erfc 0 as the argument of complementary error function in the third term of eq a28 will become infinity by putting θ 0 in it the solution c χ τ of eqs a1 a4 will reduce into the solution of eqs a1 a2 a20 and a4 given in eq a25 thus the solution of the ade with uniform continuous source may be obtained as a special case from the solution of the same ade with varying continuous source with coefficients different than those of the diffusive and advective terms of the ade the same will apply with the pulse source however putting θ d 0 and ϕ u 0 in eq a28 we observe that the denominator of the coefficients of second and third terms become zero so the solution in eq a19 obtained with the source condition in eq a16 cannot be obtained as a special case from eq a28 thus the solution of the ade with the varying continuous source both having the same two coefficients cannot be obtained as a special case from that of the same ade with the varying continuous source having the two coefficients different from those of the ade

density driven flow tidal effects multi species fate and transport artificial neural networks contaminant source characterization constrained dual restart ensemble kalman filter 1 introduction aquifers are susceptible to accidental and intentional contamination that could result in adverse impacts to both the environment and water consumers identification of contaminant sources in terms of location and strength and reconstruction of their release history plays an important role in the success of pollution control and remediation strategies it is also an important environmental forensics problem for identifying responsible parties and allocating remediation costs however groundwater movement is slow and it often takes a considerable time several years or even decades for contamination to become noticeable in downgradient well after which the pollution source may have disappeared li et al 2019 moreover underground sources of contamination such as pipeline leakage are commonly very difficult to identify directly in these circumstances the only data that could be obtained for contaminant source characterization csc is the time series of concentration downgradient of the source characterizing the contaminant source using such data often involves solving an inverse modeling problem michalak and kitanidis 2004 xu and gómez hernández 2015 xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 this includes developing a numerical model of groundwater flow and contaminant transport with the unknown contaminant source characteristics as the input parameters and the concentration of contaminant s in downgradient wells as the outputs or state variables these model outputs are measured through field surveys and then an inverse algorithm is used to adjust the model input contaminant source characteristics within reasonable ranges to enable the model to reproduce the measured data 1 1 review of groundwater csc studies providing accurate and reliable solutions with proper quantification of the associated uncertainties is highly crucial in csc because of the practical role it plays in environmental forensics and remediation hence improving inverse algorithms for csc has been the subject of research for the past several decades with studies going back as far as the early 1980 s e g gorelick et al 1983 a review of a number of key studies on numerical model based groundwater csc is provided in table 1 the table shows that methods developed in this context can be categorized into two main groups 1 frequentist methods which assume that the contaminant source characteristics are unknown but have deterministic values the dominant approach in this context is to cast the problem in a simulation optimization setting in which the parameters related to the unknown contaminant source s are adjusted to minimize the discrepancy between observed and simulated concentrations commonly using the maximum likelihood e g wagner 1992 sun 2007 or least squares criteria e g gorelick et al 1983 sun et al 2006 these were the first methods to be used in groundwater csc and are still being widely employed by research government and consulting communities optimization algorithms used in the context of the frequentist approach include genetic algorithm aral et al 2001 and the gauss levenberg marquardt algorithm essouayed et al 2020 the main shortcoming of methods in this category is their limited ability in the quantification of associated uncertainties 2 bayesian methods in which the unknown contaminant source characteristics are assumed to be random variables to account for the effect of uncertainty methods in this context include a batch bayesian methods such as markov chain monte carlo methods e g zhang et al 2020 where data obtained at different time steps are simultaneously taken into account as a single dataset and b recursive or sequential bayesian estimation methods also known as bayesian filtering methods which allow for considering time varying pollution sources a method of the latter group which has recently gained increasing attention in csc is the ensemble kalman filter enkf used in e g xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 chen et al 2018 and xu et al 2022 in groundwater models the relationship between input parameter such as the contaminant source characteristics and state variable such as heads and concentrations is non linear and the enkf is well capable of handle this nonlinearity furthermore it allows for quantification of multiple sources of uncertainty rajabi et al 2018 bateni et al 2012 the classic enkf cannot handle non gaussianity of the uncertain variables hence studies such as xu and gómez hernández 2016 2018 employ variants of the enkf e g the normal score enkf to address the issue of non gaussianity in groundwater csc most previous studies on groundwater csc are based on two dimensional 2d hypothetical problems e g aral et al 2001 ayvaz 2010 butera et al 2013 ayvaz 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 zhang et al 2020 essouayed et al 2020 mirghani et al 2009 and wang and jin 2013 are some of the few studies focusing on three dimensional 3d problems a number of studies have employed laboratory e g cupola et al 2015 chen et al 2018 or field data e g gzyl et al 2014 for csc in previous studies the focus is often on the estimation of one or several of the following parameters source spatial location geometry of the contaminant source initial release time duration of the release constant or time dependent solute concentration and the mass load of a contamination event see the last column of table 1 previous studies have assumed that the number of the contamination sources is known e g xu and gómez hernández 2016 chen et al 2018 some studies aim to combine csc with identification of the best location for additional measurement points e g mahar and datta 1997 essouayed et al 2020 or the selection of the optimal monitoring time interval e g zhang et al 2020 observations used in csc are often the piezometric head and concentration history of the contaminant in downgradient wells the aquifer is commonly assumed to be either entirely homogeneous or divided into a few homogeneous subzones e g gorelick et al 1983 mahar and datta 2000 sun et al 2006 cupola et al 2015 chen et al 2018 with some studies addressing the effect of heterogeneity e g ayvaz 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 essouayed et al 2020 furthermore the majority of studies assume that all hydrogeological and contaminant transport parameters are known e g chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 and a few studies have attempted to simultaneously estimate source characteristics and aquifer parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity field e g xu and gómez hernández 2018 and dispersivity e g essouayed et al 2020 the rest of parameters controlling flow and contaminant transport such as the initial conditions and external forcing terms are assumed to be known in all previous studies reviewed in table 1 in most previous studies the contaminant release is time dependent and transient often following a rectangle function as in xu and gómez hernández 2016 chen et al 2018 but some studies have addressed continuous sources e g mahar and datta 1997 essouayed et al 2020 past studies commonly solve the csc problem in case studies where simple groundwater velocity fields with e g parallel velocity vectors prevail under steady state conditions e g sun et al 2006 cupola et al 2015 xu and gómez hernández 2016 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2021 a few studies have addressed csc in cases where the effect of smooth as in e g essouayed et al 2020 or discontinuous e g channelized geology as in xu and gómez hernández 2018 heterogeneity or water injection wells as in zhang et al 2020 causes the velocity vectors to deviate from a parallel alignment more complex transient velocity fields are yet to be addressed in groundwater csc studies one key example is coastal aquifers where density driven flow and the effect of oceanic forces e g tides and waves create complex transient velocity fields that lead to deformation of contaminant plumes and enhance mixing processes in porous media bakhtyar et al 2013 geng et al 2020 hence solving the csc problem in coastal aquifers which requires incorporation of coupled processes is a challenging task this paper aims to address this challenge by developing and validating a novel solution method for csc in a coastal aquifer under the effect of tidal forces and density driven flow to the author s knowledge csc in coastal aquifers has not been the subject of any previous study in the next sub section past studies on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers are reviewed to set the stage for solving the describe problem 1 2 review of studies on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers localized contamination of coastal aquifers due to accidental pollutant release from industrial plants port storage facilities oil storage tanks pipelines landfills etc is a widespread phenomenon geng et al 2017 it affects groundwater quality as well as the quality of coastal waters as submarine groundwater discharge has been recognized as an important pathway for contaminant flux to the sea robinson et al 2009 oceanic forcing in the form of tidal fluctuation and wave set up together with the density difference between seawater and fresh groundwater and the associated buoyancy forces result in complex hydrodynamics in coastal aquifers which in turn influence contaminant transport brovelli et al 2007 density difference between contaminant plumes and the ambient groundwater further complicates the migration pattern of the plumes zhang et al 2002 hence simulation of such localized contaminant transport in coastal aquifers is intrinsically complex and computationally expensive a number of key studies addressing this issue and published after 2002 are reviewed in table 2 these studies employ numerical models of density dependent flow and multiple species transport such as seawat e g robinson et al 2007 la licata et al 2011 bakhtyar et al 2013 guo et al 2021 sutra e g yu et al 2019 and feflow e g liu et al 2016 for simulations of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers all the studies reviewed in table 2 simulate 2d cross sections of coastal aquifers perhaps because in absence of lateral flows due to wells and heterogeneity it provides a good representation of the underlying processes and is also simpler and computationally less demanding to simulate compared to 3d models these investigations are based on hypothetical problems e g liu et al 2016 shen et al 2019 laboratory experiments e g zhang et al 2002 brovelli et al 2007 geng et al 2020 or field data e g robinson et al 2009 la licata et al 2011 colombani et al 2015 geng et al 2017 most studies address idealized homogeneous and isotropic unconfined coastal aquifers e g robinson et al 2009 anwar et al 2014 yu et al 2019 with a few studies focusing on the effect of heterogeneity and anisotropic on contaminant migration e g murgulet and tick 2016 guo et al 2021 effect of beach slope is considered in most studies reviewed in table 2 the majority of these studies simulate the transfer of conservative solutes as tracers or generic contaminates but some have gone a step further to consider organic contaminates e g colombani et al 2015 petroleum hydrocarbons robinson et al 2009 geng et al 2017 and nutrients e g anwar et al 2014 which undergo biodegradation and chemical reactions in the transport process from previous studies on seawater intrusion see bear et al 1999 and the reviews by werner et al 2013 it is known that in coastal aquifers a saltwater wedge and dispersion zone forms due to density driven seawater recirculation tide and wave induced flows widen the dispersion zone and leads to formation of an upper saline plume usp over this saltwater wedge and above the discharging fresh groundwater kuan et al 2012 studies reviewed in table 2 show that when the contaminant is released into the groundwater the resulting plume travels seaward with the groundwater flow and exit to the sea with discharging fresh groundwater near the low tide mark in a location between the usp and the saltwater wedge the contaminant plume moves downward during the rising tide period and towards the sea during falling tide period resulting in a complex migration pattern that increases its residence time it also intensifies the level of mixing between the contaminant plume and groundwater near the intertidal zone robinson et al 2007 bakhtyar et al 2013 further complication of the migration pattern occurs when the contaminant plumes is dense in which case a wider diffusive front is formed in the seaward direction when the plume approaches the saltwater interface robinson et al 2007 bakhtyar et al 2013 1 3 study objective and structure of the paper in presence of the complex velocity field and migration patterns described in sub section 1 2 solving the csc problem in coastal aquifers requires a tailored approach for several reasons an enkf method is employed in the current study 1 it has proven to be very effective for the identification of contaminant source in previous studies such as xu and gomez hernandez 2016 2018 chen et al 2018 2021 2 it is flexible in its treatment of errors in model dynamics and parameters 3 apart from the gaussian assumption it does not incorporate any other major limiting assumption regarding the unknown source characteristics or the groundwater model 4 it paves the way for online learning as new observations become available and 5 it allows for considering the temporal evolution of parameters a specific variant of the enkf is employed in the current study and the behavior of the proposed enkf method in identifying several parameters related to the unknown contaminant source is investigated by assimilating salinity and contaminant concentration data four parameters related to the contaminant source are to be identified they are the contaminant source location in the horizontal and vertical directions x s and z s respectively the injection concentration c s and the injection rate q s parameters related to groundwater flow and solute transport including the hydraulic conductivity distribution are not subject to identification and are assumed known values a synthetic test case involving a 2d cross section of a coastal aquifer is used to validate the proposed approach the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the numerical model equations and the proposed enkf method in section 3 the hypothetical test case and its numerical model are explained then in section 4 the proposed enkf method is tested with data from the synthetic experiment and a discussion of various related issues including the value of different types of observation data and effect of heterogeneity is provided the paper ends with a summary and conclusions of the main findings 2 theoretical framework 2 1 numerical modeling approach in this study seawat langevin et al 2003 is used to simulate density dependent groundwater flow and multi species solute transport in a coastal aquifer across a sloping beach boundary with inland fresh groundwater discharge with without tide seawat is a variable density saturated flow model that couples the groundwater flow code modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and the solute transport code mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the governing equation for density dependent groundwater flow is langevin et al 2003 robinson et al 2007 1 ρ k f h f ρ ρ f ρ f z ρ s f h f t θ ρ t ρ s q s where is the divergence operator is the gradient operator z l is the vertical co ordinate in the upward direction k f l t 1 the equivalent freshwater hydraulic conductivity h f l the equivalent freshwater head ρ m l 3 the fluid density ρ f m l 3 the freshwater density s f l 1 the equivalent freshwater storage coefficient t t the time θ the effective porosity and ρ s m l 3 and q s t 1 are the density and flow rate per unit volume of aquifer of the source or sink the governing equation for multi species conservative transport in the system is robinson et al 2007 xu and gómez hernández 2018 2 θ c k t θ d m α ν c k θ ν c k q s c s k where c k m l 3 is aqueous concentration of species k d m l 2 t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient α l is the dispersivity tensor ν l t 1 is the flow velocity vector related to the hydraulic head c s k m l 3 is the concentration of species k from the source or sink 2 2 ensemble kalman filtering approach the standard enkf algorithm is explained by evensen 1994 and burgers et al 1998 to deal with difficulties associated with csc in a coastal aquifer setting modifications to the classical enkf are necessary the following three modifications to the classic enkf are combined to get a customized version of the enkf the classic enkf is intended for state updating and so it must be modified to enable parameter estimation in previous applications of the enkf in groundwater csc e g xu and gómez hernández 2018 this is mostly done by augmenting the states and parameters as a single vector this is known as the joint or state augmentation method however it has been shown that the results of this method are prone to instability in highly nonlinear problems moradkhani et al 2005 so an alternative called the dual estimation approach rajabi et al 2020 is adopted in the current study in the dual enkf approach two parallel filters are employed a filter for artificial evolution or random walk of the parameters and another for the conventional in the enkf sense update of the state variables due to the strong dependence of downgradient concentrations on the contaminant source characteristics the updated states can only remain coherent with mass transfer equation if the state forecast for the next observation time is restarted from time zero this is known as the restart enkf r enkf and has been successfully adopted in previous applications of the enkf in groundwater csc e g chen et al 2018 this method is also employed in the current study to limit the solution instability and prevent parameter values from wandering off into unrealistic values in both the random walk and the parameter update process see the subsequent explanations a constrained version of the enkf based on the works of bavdekar et al 2013 and liu et al 2021 is employed in the current study the combination of the above concepts results in a constrained restart dual enkf crd enkf rajabi et al 2020 the crd enkf algorithm is illustrated in the flowchart of fig 1 and consists of the following sequential steps 1 algorithm initiation which involves statistical sampling from the prior probability distributions of the unknown model input parameters i e contaminant source characteristics this results in the generation of an initial ensemble of parameter realizations represented here by ϕ t 0 where each member is a vector of the of the following form 3 ϕ t 0 c s q s x s z s 2 the ensemble of realizations ϕ t 0 for the initial time step or ϕ t i u for the subsequent time steps then goes through an artificial evolution or random walk by adding a normally distributed noise term ϑ t with zero mean and a predefined covariance 4 ϕ t i 1 p ϕ t 0 ϑ t f o r t 1 ϕ t i 1 p ϕ t i u ϑ t f o r t i i 1 in eq 4 the superscripts p refers to the random walk values 3 for each vector of parameter realizations a numerical simulation is subsequently performed to predict the state variables i e concentration in downgradient wells in time t i 1 a stochastic model error vector ω t which is often assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and a predefined covariance cov t i 1 f is then added to the model predictions to represent the effect of structural uncertainty the resulting state ensemble denoted by s t i 1 p is as follows 5 s t i 1 p f s t 0 ϕ t i 1 p ω t where f is a function representing the groundwater flow and mass transport model and s t 0 denotes the model initial conditions steps 2 and 3 jointly form the prediction stage 4 to account for observation error in the measurements of the state variables denoted by o t i 1 a stochastic term η t often assumed to have a gaussian distribution is added to each measurement it is assumed that the mean value of η t is zero no bias and its covariance has a predefined value represented by cov t i 1 m hence 6 m t i 1 o t i 1 η t where m t i 1 is the measurement ensemble 5 next these m t i 1 values are employed for the estimation of the following two kalman gains for the parameters and states respectively 7 k t i 1 ϕ cov t i 1 ϕ m cov t i 1 mm cov t i 1 m 1 8 k t i 1 s cov t i 1 sm cov t i 1 mm cov t i 1 m 1 where cov t i 1 ϕ m is the cross covariance of the parameter and measurement ensembles cov t i 1 mm is the forecast error covariance matrix of the measurements and cov t i 1 sm is the cross covariance of state and measurement ensembles 6 the state and parameter ensembles are subsequently updated using the standard kf equation 9 ϕ t

the algorithm the remaining four steps are repeated sequentially for every time steps in which observations are available until the last observation time in drawing random samples for algorithm initiation and also in the parameter prediction and updates resulting from applying eqs 4 and 9 if any of the parameter realizations violates its constraints it is projected back to the boundary of the constrained space this approach is similar to bavdekar et al 2013 2 3 metamodeling approach a common challenge in the implementation of the enkf is the computational burden imposed by the need to perform a large ensemble of simulations to obtain accurate estimates this problem is exacerbated when the enkf is used for estimation of the input parameters of the computationally heavy model of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers artificial neural networks anns are employed to tackle this computational challenge the idea is to train an ann to estimate the time series of each model output quantity of interest qoi using a set of numerical model input output pairs and then use the resulting anns as metamodels in enkf computations in this study anns are built using python s tensorflow framework and keras library 3 application fig 2 shows the flowchart of the proposed csc methodology a synthetic test case is employed to analyze how effective this methodology is in solving the csc problem in coastal aquifers our synthetic test case represents a 2d cross section of an unconfined coastal aquifer where a generic contaminant migrates due to the complex velocity field induced by density driven flow simulations are conducted for two different conditions i no oceanic forcing and ii oceanic forcing due to tide the schematic of problem is demonstrated in fig 3 the test case is partially adopted from the classic henry problem with modifications based on several studies on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers e g zhang et al 2002 brovelli et al 2007 liu et al 2017 in this study the effects of inland water level oscillation wind waves and multi constituent tides on groundwater flow and contaminant transport as investigated in e g liu et al 2016 yu et al 2019 guo et al 2021 are not considered the contaminant plume like many previous studies e g brovelli et al 2007 bakhtyar et al 2013 shen et al 2019 guo et al 2021 is assumed conservative and degradation is neglected dimensions of the domain are 200 100 cm with the origin of the coordinate system located at the upper left corner of the rectangular problem domain which are the same as dimensions of the classic henry problem note that this is a scaled down version of a real coastal aquifer the domain is discretized with a regular mesh size of 1 1 cm resulting in 20 000 square elements the contaminant source is assigned to a single cell of the numerical grid the beach slope is assumed to be 1 5 in an approach similar to robinson et al 2007 and anwar et al 2014 the model domain is divided along the aquifer ocean interface into a sea zone and an aquifer zone a very high hydraulic conductivity 23 148 c m s 1 20000 m d 1 a porosity of one and a constant saline concentration of 0 035 k g k g is assigned to the sea zone the coastal aquifer has a hydraulic conductivity k of 0 2 c m s porosity θ of 0 37 longitudinal dispersivity α l of 0 2 c m and transverse dispersivity α t of 0 02 c m other aquifer parameter values are presented in table 3 key simplifying assumptions in numerical modeling of the test case are as follows a the model does not consider unsaturated flow as demonstrated by xin et al 2010 unsaturated flow does not have a considerable impact on flow and chemical transport except in the immediate vicinity of the sediment water interface b wind waves and the non periodic term in sea level variations is ignored c the contaminant is conservative and degradation is neglected d processes that cause lateral flows such as pumping have been omitted hence a 2d model is sufficient to describe the flow field and migration pathway in the coastal aquifer for both cases i and ii a constant head of 0 98 m is applied at the inland boundary ib in fig 3 and no flow boundaries were set at the bottom bc and upper ig boundaries of the aquifer and also at the sloping beach from hg surface recharge to the aquifer is not considered here a constant head of 0 90 m is assigned at the seaward boundary fe and ec in case i and a time varying cosine type tidal fluctuation is implemented at this boundary in case ii anwar et al 2014 liu et al 2016 11 h tide a c o s ω t h msl where h tide l is the sea level changing with time t h msl l is the mean sea level msl a l is the amplitude of the tide ω t 1 is the angular frequency and expressed as ω 2 π t t with t t t being the period of the tidal fluctuation tidal parameters used in the current study are presented in table 4 and compared with two key previous experimental studies in these studies the ratio of height to length is approximately equal to 2 which is relatively similar to this ratio in the current study according to the last column of table 4 a ratio of tidal amplitude to mean sea level 2 a h 0 similar to previous studies has been employed the resulting head fluctuation is depicted in fig 4 the source of contaminant release is located at x s 20 cm and z s 31 cm the source has an outflow of q s 0 5 m 3 d with a concentration of c s 20 m g l i t for the contaminant see fig 5 and table 5 the system is assumed to be initially filled with saline water and the formation of a freshwater aquifer as the result of saline water being flushed out by freshwater recharge from the inland boundary is simulated the simulation time is continued long enough for the salinity concentration distribution to become steady state this steady state groundwater flow and salt distributions is used as initial conditions for the subsequent simulations it is assumed that the concentration of both salinity and contaminant in the freshwater entering the system from the inland boundary is negligible after applying the initial condition simulations are conducted for the two previously described oceanic forcing conditions by considering the tidal force in case ii the system will take some time to reach a new quasi steady state where quasi refers to the fact that the tide prevent the prevalence of complete steady state conditions after which the contaminant is injected into the aquifer to make the results of the two cases comparable the same time lag is also applied to the case of no oceanic forcing the release of the contaminant starts at time 90 min and ends at time 110 min see fig 5 in both cases i and ii the total simulation time is 240 min which is discretized into 192 equal time steps of 1 25 min as previously mentioned x s z s q s and c s are assumed to be the unknown variables in solving the csc problem and their target values are presented in table 5 in the metamodeling process these four variables serve as the inputs to the ann and the output qoi are the time series of salinity and contaminant concentrations in the observation wells the number of input output pairs used for ann training validation and testing are 100 30 and 20 respectively 4 results and discussion in this section the numerical simulation outputs are analyzed and the ann metamodels are validated the a metamodels are subsequently employ in the enkf algorithm to estimate the characteristics of the contaminant source in different scenarios and the resulting estimates are compare with the known target values 4 1 numerical simulation results fig 6 depicts the seawat based simulation results for the salinity and contaminant distributions when oceanic forcing is omitted a steady saltwater wedge forms in the absence of tidal forcing and the density difference between fresh and saline water drives the circulation of groundwater after contaminant injection at t 90 m i n fig 6a the plume first moves horizontally towards the sea fig 6b c d by the time it approaches the saltwater zone its pathway ascends in a curve and the shape of the plume gradually takes the form of a spindle fig 6e f g the contaminant is then gradually discharged to the sea fig 6g h at t 170 min 90 of the contaminant mass has been discharged to the sea fig 6i these results resembles that of robinson et al 2007 and bakhtyar et al 2013 fig 7 shows the simulated salinity and contaminant distributions in presence of tidal forcing in addition to the classical saltwater wedge a usp has formed over the discharging fresh groundwater due to the tidal forcing previous studies have shown that this usp represents a potentially more dynamic zone for mixing and reaction than the dispersion zone of the salt wedge robinson et al 2007 bakhtyar et al 2013 anwar et al 2014 liu et al 2016 moreover the system becomes quasi steady state and the saltwater wedge and usp oscillate in response to the tidal fluctuations the amplitude of this oscillation decreases with the increase of the offshore distance the flow path of the contaminant plume is also affected by tide after entering the groundwater system at t 90 m i n fig 7a the plume first moves horizontally towards the sea fig 7b c by the time it approaches the usp zone the contaminant gradually changes direction due to the usp flow field and follows an arc like path around the usp fig 7d e f g the contaminant is then discharged to the sea along the curved edge of the usp above the saltwater wedge fig 7h i at t 240 min the plume has almost disappeared fig 7j in this test case the residence time of the contaminant in the coastal aquifer increases by about 35 due to the effect of tide 4 2 metamodel development and validation to monitor the concentration variations of both salinity and the contaminant 17 and 32 observing locations are employed for simulations with and without tide respectively the larger number of observation locations for the case with tidal forcing is due to the larger dispersion zone as shown in fig 8 the observation locations in both cases are located in the transition zone between saline and freshwater and or along the migration path of the contaminant plume using the flopy python package bakker et al 2016 the seawat model is executed for 150 random samples of the input parameters c s q s x s z s in the range mentioned in table 5 and the simulated salinity and contaminant concentration time series in the above described monitoring locations are extracted from the model output this process is repeated for both with and without tide cases the resulting input output pairs are used for ann model training several experiments were performed by training different candidate networks and observing the behavior of the loss curve before settling upon the final ann architecture the final architecture is a multilayer perceptron mlp type neural networks with 9 layers including an input layer an output layer and 7 hidden layers the rectified linear unit relu is used as the activation function for the first 8 layers and the linear activation function is employed for the output layer the adam optimizer is used for model training it takes 900 epochs for training to convergence the quality of the trained ann metamodels is measured by comparison with the sewat model outputs using the test samples the following five statistical diagnostics are used for the comparison 1 the fraction of predictions within a factor of two fac2 2 the normalize mean square error nmse 3 the mean absolute error mae 4 the fractional bias fb and 5 the correlation coefficient r the ideal and acceptable range of values for these statistical indicators are presented in table 6 the table also demonstrates the value of the statistical diagnostics for our trained anns except for minor violations of nmse for the contaminant concentration the range of values for the statistical diagnostics fall within the acceptable intervals and lie close to the ideal values the ann outputs are free from bias since both fb is close to zero and fac2 is one r values close to one suggest a high degree of correlation between the numerical model and ann meta model outputs 4 3 csc using the crd enkf algorithm after validation of the trained ann metamodels they are employed within the framework of the crd enkf algorithm by replacing the function f in eq 5 with the trained anns the values of a number of filter parameters including the initial ensemble ensemble size and parameter variation range must be decide before the algorithm can be initiated in this study the target values of the contaminant source variables c s q s x s z s are known a priori so their initial values are defined by shifting away from the relevant target values and are assumed to be as follows c s 26 5 q s 1 3 x s 24 and z s 27 the enkf constraints are defined as 10 c s 35 0 1 q s 1 5 12 x s 30 and 22 z s 36 assuming that these constraints reflect prior knowledge on the parameter variation ranges theoretically the ensemble size should be sufficiently large to accurately represent the probability density function using the computationally cheap ann metamodels an ensemble size of 300 is used other filter parameter values are chosen as follows the covariance of the artificial evolution term is equal to 0 5 c s 0 2 q s 0 35 x s 0 35 z s model error ω t covariance equals 0 002 and observation error η t covariance equals 10 2 after choosing the filter parameter values the salinity and contaminant concentration data is used for the estimation of unknown contaminant source characteristics the total number of assimilation time steps are 104 and 120 for simulations with and without tide respectively all the assimilation steps are 1 25 min long and the assimilation time starts at t 90 min i e initiation of contaminant release in both cases in fig 9 presents the timeline of important events during the assimilation time for the cases with and without tide fig 10 shows the time evaluation of the ensemble means i e enkf based estimates of the contaminant source variables as demonstrated the crd enkf algorithm is able to significantly improve the wrong initial values using salinity and contaminant concentration data in both with and without tide simulations in absence of tide the ensemble mean graphs terminate at t 220 min due to the shorter residence time of the contaminant plume in the aquifer the convergence properties are not the same for the different variables q s x s and z s ensemble means demonstrate smoother convergence behavior compared to c s for both with and without tide simulations in the presence of tidal forcing the parameter estimation convergence for x s and z s representing the contaminant source location is generally slower and shows more fluctuations over time in comparison to the same graphs for the case in which tide is neglected the convergence behavior of c s and q s graphs are not significantly different for the two cases furthermore the estimation errors are slightly higher for q s x s and z s in simulation with tide though the opposite is true for c s beside fig 10 this can also be inferred from the values of absolute percentage estimation error e in table 7 in presence of tide all four ensemble mean graphs of fig 10 show sudden step variation around t 142 min this is due to the fact that at this time the contamination plume reaches the strong flow field caused by the usp which leads to a sudden change in the path of the contaminant plume this behavior is not observed for simulations without tide as the usp is non existent in this case fig 11 shows the probability distribution of the initial and final ensembles of the four contaminant source variables the figure further illustrates how the ensemble mean moves to the vicinity of the target values and the probability distribution spread or standard deviation σ as a measure of the estimation uncertainties decreases in the final ensemble fig 11 and table 7 also show that estimates pertaining to without tide simulations have a higher percent reduction in standard deviation prsd for the final ensemble compared to the initial ensemble for all four contaminant source variables so it can be concluded that the tidal force which leads to a more complex flow field makes the process of estimating unknown contaminant source variables slightly more difficult compared to the situation where there is no oceanic force 4 4 effect of salinity data assimilation the results discussed in the previous subsection where based on the assimilation of both salinity and contaminant concentration data in this subsection the salinity data are omitted and the crd enkf results that are solely based on the contaminant concentration time series in the observation wells are analyzed this is done in presence of tidal forces the results are shown in figs 10 and 11 for the ensemble mean temporal evolutions and the ensemble probability distributions respectively the associated error statistics are also provided in table 7 the overall convergence behavior of the ensemble mean is rather similar with and without salinity data assimilation the most significant outcome of omitting salinity data seems not to be an increase in the estimation error but instead a marginal increase in the uncertainty of estimations this is signified by the larger spreads in the probability distributions of all four uncertain variables in fig 11 and the associated larger σ values of table 7 in this sense salinity observations acts as axillary data to reduce uncertainty in csc 4 5 effect of heterogeneity heterogeneity plays a significant role in controlling the processes of flow and mass transfer in all kinds of aquifers but it is especially relevant in coastal aquifers where heterogeneity may cause instability to test the ability of the proposed methodology in a heterogeneous setting an alternative test case of a layered coastal aquifer with the soil particle size increasing from top to bottom as in e g gassiat et al 2013 zheng et al 2019 guo et al 2021 is considered as demonstrated in fig 12 the aquifer is composed of four inclined layers with hydraulic conductivities equal to 0 05 cm s 0 1 cm s 0 2 cm s and 0 4 cm s all other characteristics of this hypothetical case are the same as those described in section 3 oceanic forcing due to tide is considered and concentration variations of both salinity and contaminant are monitored in 32 observing points as in case ii numerical modeling results for this heterogeneous test case are presented in supplementary fig s1 note that the hydraulic conductivity field is assumed to be known the assumed heterogeneity moves the saltwater wedge towards the sea and increases the residence time of the contaminant plume though the travel path is similar to the homogeneous case as illustrated in fig 13 the temporal evolution of the crd enkf ensemble means for the heterogeneous test case are similar to those of case ii with the same sudden step variation around the time the plume reaches the strong flow field caused by the usp and show significant improvement of the wrong initial parameter values with increasing assimilation time table 8 shows that the absolute percentage estimation error e of the final ensemble for the heterogeneous case are close but slightly larger to those of the homogeneous case ii however in the heterogeneous case the prsd values are much smaller and are close to zero for 3 out of 4 estimated parameters namely c s q s and z s this shows that the algorithm didn t reduce the estimation uncertainty relative to the prior values except for the parameter x s 5 conclusion in this study a sequential data assimilation approach was developed for the estimation of contaminant source characteristics in a coastal aquifer influenced by density driven flow and tidal forcing for this purpose the study combines a numerical model of density dependent flow and multiple species solute transport ann metamodeling and a customized kalman filter technique in this approach the time series of contaminant concentration downgradient of the source and salinity concentrations in the transition zone between fresh and saline groundwater is employed for the estimation of contaminant source location and strength the proposed methodology is validated by using a benchmark problem of a coastal aquifer with sloping beach and tide induced pressure oscillation at the beach face it was demonstrated that the use of salinity data contributes to the reduction of estimation uncertainty it was also shown that the tidal force which leads to a more complex flow field makes the process of estimating unknown contaminant source variables slightly more difficult compared to the situation where there is no oceanic force and this elevated difficulty materializes in marginally higher estimation errors and uncertainties this study is significant for two reasons first it addresses a specific context for csc which has not been studied before in the literature coastal regions are some of the most populated areas in the world and as a result coastal aquifers are highly prone to contamination from inland sources successful csc in coastal aquifers is vital for environmental forensics and effective pollution control and remediation second the study shows that despite the presence of a complex transient velocity field in coastal aquifers a customized version of the enkf is capable of effectively estimating the contaminant source location and strength this shows the high potential of the enkf for csc in new and challenging contexts a number of phenomena not considered in this study such as inland head fluctuations groundwater pumping and spatial variability in contaminant degradation rates further contribute to the complexity of csc in coastal aquifers hence in order to make the proposed method applicable to real world problems further research on the effect of such phenomena is crucial moreover a precisely known hydraulic conductivity field as assumed in the current study is hardly the case in the real world hence avenues for future research may include taking into account the effect of hydraulic conductivity uncertainty in csc through e g multiple realization methods or attempting to jointly estimate the hydraulic conductivity field and the contaminant source characteristics future studies may also consider the estimation of other contaminant source characteristics such as geometry and release history of constant or time dependent releases focus on sensitivity analysis of the csc results with respect to various model parameters or perform a

aquifers are susceptible to accidental and intentional contamination that could result in adverse impacts to both the environment and water consumers identification of contaminant sources in terms of location and strength and reconstruction of their release history plays an important role in the success of pollution control and remediation strategies it is also an important environmental forensics problem for identifying responsible parties and allocating remediation costs however groundwater movement is slow and it often takes a considerable time several years or even decades for contamination to become noticeable in downgradient well after which the pollution source may have disappeared li et al 2019 moreover underground sources of contamination such as pipeline leakage are commonly very difficult to identify directly in these circumstances the only data that could be obtained for contaminant source characterization csc is the time series of concentration downgradient of the source characterizing the contaminant source using such data often involves solving an inverse modeling problem michalak and kitanidis 2004 xu and gómez hernández 2015 xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 this includes developing a numerical model of groundwater flow and contaminant transport with the unknown contaminant source characteristics as the input parameters and the concentration of contaminant s in downgradient wells as the outputs or state variables these model outputs are measured through field surveys and then an inverse algorithm is used to adjust the model input contaminant source characteristics within reasonable ranges to enable the model to reproduce the measured data 1 1 review of groundwater csc studies providing accurate and reliable solutions with proper quantification of the associated uncertainties is highly crucial in csc because of the practical role it plays in environmental forensics and remediation hence improving inverse algorithms for csc has been the subject of research for the past several decades with studies going back as far as the early 1980 s e g gorelick et al 1983 a review of a number of key studies on numerical model based groundwater csc is provided in table 1 the table shows that methods developed in this context can be categorized into two main groups 1 frequentist methods which assume that the contaminant source characteristics are unknown but have deterministic values the dominant approach in this context is to cast the problem in a simulation optimization setting in which the parameters related to the unknown contaminant source s are adjusted to minimize the discrepancy between observed and simulated concentrations commonly using the maximum likelihood e g wagner 1992 sun 2007 or least squares criteria e g gorelick et al 1983 sun et al 2006 these were the first methods to be used in groundwater csc and are still being widely employed by research government and consulting communities optimization algorithms used in the context of the frequentist approach include genetic algorithm aral et al 2001 and the gauss levenberg marquardt algorithm essouayed et al 2020 the main shortcoming of methods in this category is their limited ability in the quantification of associated uncertainties 2 bayesian methods in which the unknown contaminant source characteristics are assumed to be random variables to account for the effect of uncertainty methods in this context include a batch bayesian methods such as markov chain monte carlo methods e g zhang et al 2020 where data obtained at different time steps are simultaneously taken into account as a single dataset and b recursive or sequential bayesian estimation methods also known as bayesian filtering methods which allow for considering time varying pollution sources a method of the latter group which has recently gained increasing attention in csc is the ensemble kalman filter enkf used in e g xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 chen et al 2018 and xu et al 2022 in groundwater models the relationship between input parameter such as the contaminant source characteristics and state variable such as heads and concentrations is non linear and the enkf is well capable of handle this nonlinearity furthermore it allows for quantification of multiple sources of uncertainty rajabi et al 2018 bateni et al 2012 the classic enkf cannot handle non gaussianity of the uncertain variables hence studies such as xu and gómez hernández 2016 2018 employ variants of the enkf e g the normal score enkf to address the issue of non gaussianity in groundwater csc most previous studies on groundwater csc are based on two dimensional 2d hypothetical problems e g aral et al 2001 ayvaz 2010 butera et al 2013 ayvaz 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 zhang et al 2020 essouayed et al 2020 mirghani et al 2009 and wang and jin 2013 are some of the few studies focusing on three dimensional 3d problems a number of studies have employed laboratory e g cupola et al 2015 chen et al 2018 or field data e g gzyl et al 2014 for csc in previous studies the focus is often on the estimation of one or several of the following parameters source spatial location geometry of the contaminant source initial release time duration of the release constant or time dependent solute concentration and the mass load of a contamination event see the last column of table 1 previous studies have assumed that the number of the contamination sources is known e g xu and gómez hernández 2016 chen et al 2018 some studies aim to combine csc with identification of the best location for additional measurement points e g mahar and datta 1997 essouayed et al 2020 or the selection of the optimal monitoring time interval e g zhang et al 2020 observations used in csc are often the piezometric head and concentration history of the contaminant in downgradient wells the aquifer is commonly assumed to be either entirely homogeneous or divided into a few homogeneous subzones e g gorelick et al 1983 mahar and datta 2000 sun et al 2006 cupola et al 2015 chen et al 2018 with some studies addressing the effect of heterogeneity e g ayvaz 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2016 xu and gómez hernández 2018 essouayed et al 2020 furthermore the majority of studies assume that all hydrogeological and contaminant transport parameters are known e g chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 and a few studies have attempted to simultaneously estimate source characteristics and aquifer parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity field e g xu and gómez hernández 2018 and dispersivity e g essouayed et al 2020 the rest of parameters controlling flow and contaminant transport such as the initial conditions and external forcing terms are assumed to be known in all previous studies reviewed in table 1 in most previous studies the contaminant release is time dependent and transient often following a rectangle function as in xu and gómez hernández 2016 chen et al 2018 but some studies have addressed continuous sources e g mahar and datta 1997 essouayed et al 2020 past studies commonly solve the csc problem in case studies where simple groundwater velocity fields with e g parallel velocity vectors prevail under steady state conditions e g sun et al 2006 cupola et al 2015 xu and gómez hernández 2016 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2021 a few studies have addressed csc in cases where the effect of smooth as in e g essouayed et al 2020 or discontinuous e g channelized geology as in xu and gómez hernández 2018 heterogeneity or water injection wells as in zhang et al 2020 causes the velocity vectors to deviate from a parallel alignment more complex transient velocity fields are yet to be addressed in groundwater csc studies one key example is coastal aquifers where density driven flow and the effect of oceanic forces e g tides and waves create complex transient velocity fields that lead to deformation of contaminant plumes and enhance mixing processes in porous media bakhtyar et al 2013 geng et al 2020 hence solving the csc problem in coastal aquifers which requires incorporation of coupled processes is a challenging task this paper aims to address this challenge by developing and validating a novel solution method for csc in a coastal aquifer under the effect of tidal forces and density driven flow to the author s knowledge csc in coastal aquifers has not been the subject of any previous study in the next sub section past studies on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers are reviewed to set the stage for solving the describe problem 1 2 review of studies on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers localized contamination of coastal aquifers due to accidental pollutant release from industrial plants port storage facilities oil storage tanks pipelines landfills etc is a widespread phenomenon geng et al 2017 it affects groundwater quality as well as the quality of coastal waters as submarine groundwater discharge has been recognized as an important pathway for contaminant flux to the sea robinson et al 2009 oceanic forcing in the form of tidal fluctuation and wave set up together with the density difference between seawater and fresh groundwater and the associated buoyancy forces result in complex hydrodynamics in coastal aquifers which in turn influence contaminant transport brovelli et al 2007 density difference between contaminant plumes and the ambient groundwater further complicates the migration pattern of the plumes zhang et al 2002 hence simulation of such localized contaminant transport in coastal aquifers is intrinsically complex and computationally expensive a number of key studies addressing this issue and published after 2002 are reviewed in table 2 these studies employ numerical models of density dependent flow and multiple species transport such as seawat e g robinson et al 2007 la licata et al 2011 bakhtyar

guo et al 2021 effect of beach slope is considered in most studies reviewed in table 2 the majority of these studies simulate the transfer of conservative solutes as tracers or generic contaminates

biodegradation and chemical reactions in the transport process from previous studies on seawater intrusion see bear et al 1999 and the reviews by werner et al 2013 it is known that in coastal aquifers a saltwater wedge and dispersion zone forms due to density driven seawater recirculation tide and wave induced flows widen the dispersion zone and leads to formation of an upper saline plume usp over this saltwater wedge and above the discharging fresh groundwater kuan et al 2012 studies reviewed in table 2 show that when the contaminant is released into the groundwater the resulting plume travels seaward with the groundwater flow and exit to the sea with discharging fresh groundwater near the low tide mark in a location between the usp and the saltwater wedge the contaminant plume moves downward during the rising tide period and towards the sea during falling tide period resulting in a complex migration pattern that increases its residence time it also intensifies the level of mixing between the contaminant plume and groundwater near the intertidal zone robinson et al 2007 bakhtyar et al 2013 further complication of the migration pattern occurs when the contaminant plumes is dense in which case a wider diffusive front is formed in the seaward direction when the plume approaches the saltwater interface robinson et al 2007 bakhtyar et al 2013 1 3 study objective and structure of the paper in presence of the complex velocity field and migration patterns described in sub section 1 2 solving the csc problem in coastal aquifers requires a tailored approach for several reasons an enkf method is employed in the current study 1 it has proven to be very effective for the identification of contaminant source in previous studies such as xu and gomez hernandez 2016 2018 chen et al 2018 2021 2 it is flexible in its treatment of errors in model dynamics and parameters 3 apart from the gaussian assumption it does not incorporate any other major limiting assumption regarding the unknown source characteristics or the groundwater model 4 it paves the way for online learning as new observations become available and 5 it allows for considering the temporal evolution of parameters a specific variant of the enkf is employed in the current study and the behavior of the proposed enkf method in identifying several parameters related to the unknown contaminant source is investigated by assimilating salinity and contaminant concentration data four parameters related to the contaminant source are to be identified they are the contaminant source location in the horizontal and vertical directions x s and z s respectively the injection concentration c s and the injection rate q s parameters related to groundwater flow and solute transport including the hydraulic conductivity distribution are not subject to identification and are assumed known values a synthetic test case involving a 2d cross section of a coastal aquifer is used to validate the proposed approach the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of the numerical model equations and the proposed enkf method in section 3 the hypothetical test case and its numerical model are explained then in section 4 the proposed enkf method is tested with data from the synthetic experiment and a discussion of various related issues including the value of different types of observation data and effect of heterogeneity is provided the paper ends with a summary and conclusions of the main findings 2 theoretical framework 2 1 numerical modeling approach in this study seawat langevin et al 2003 is used to simulate density dependent groundwater flow and multi species solute transport in a coastal aquifer across a sloping beach boundary with inland fresh groundwater discharge with without tide seawat is a variable density saturated flow model that couples the groundwater flow code modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and the solute transport code mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 the governing equation for density dependent groundwater flow is langevin et al 2003 robinson et al 2007 1 ρ k f h f ρ ρ f ρ f z ρ s f h f t θ ρ t ρ s q s where is the divergence operator is the gradient operator z l is the vertical co ordinate in the upward direction k f l t 1 the equivalent freshwater hydraulic conductivity h f l the equivalent freshwater head ρ m l 3 the fluid density ρ f m l 3 the freshwater density s f l 1 the equivalent freshwater storage coefficient t t the time θ the effective porosity and ρ s m l 3 and q s t 1 are the density and flow rate per unit volume of aquifer of the source or sink the governing equation for multi species conservative transport in the system is robinson et al 2007 xu and gómez hernández 2018 2 θ c k t θ d m α ν c k θ ν c k q s c s k where c k m l 3 is aqueous concentration of species k d m l 2 t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient α l is the dispersivity tensor ν l t 1 is the flow velocity vector related to the hydraulic head c s k m l 3 is the concentration of species k from the source or sink 2 2 ensemble kalman filtering approach the standard enkf algorithm is explained by evensen 1994 and burgers et al 1998 to deal with difficulties associated with csc in a coastal aquifer setting modifications to the classical enkf are necessary the following three modifications to the classic enkf are combined to get a customized version of the enkf the classic enkf is intended for state updating and so it must be modified to enable parameter estimation in previous applications of the enkf in groundwater csc e g xu and gómez hernández 2018 this is mostly done by augmenting the states and parameters as a single vector this is known as the joint or state augmentation method however it has been shown that the results of this method are prone to instability in highly nonlinear problems moradkhani et al 2005 so an alternative called the dual estimation approach rajabi et al 2020 is adopted in the current study in the dual enkf approach two parallel filters are employed a filter for artificial evolution or random walk of the parameters and another for the conventional in the enkf sense update of the state variables due to the strong dependence of downgradient concentrations on the contaminant source characteristics the updated states can only remain coherent with mass transfer equation if the state forecast for the next observation time is restarted from time zero this is known as the restart enkf r enkf and has been successfully adopted in previous applications of the enkf in groundwater csc e g chen et al 2018 this method is also employed in the current study to limit the solution instability and prevent parameter values from wandering off into unrealistic values in both the random walk and the parameter update process see the subsequent explanations a constrained version of the enkf based on the works of bavdekar et al 2013 and liu et al 2021 is employed in the current study the combination of the above concepts results in a constrained restart dual enkf crd enkf rajabi et al 2020 the crd enkf algorithm is illustrated in the flowchart of fig 1 and consists of the following sequential steps 1 algorithm initiation which involves statistical sampling from the prior probability distributions of the unknown model input parameters i e contaminant source characteristics this results in the generation of an initial ensemble of parameter realizations represented here by ϕ t 0 where each member is a vector of the of the following form 3 ϕ t 0 c s q s x s z s 2 the ensemble of realizations ϕ t 0 for the initial time step or ϕ t i u for the subsequent time steps then goes through an artificial evolution or random walk by adding a normally distributed noise term ϑ t with zero mean and a predefined covariance 4 ϕ t i 1 p ϕ t 0 ϑ t f o r t 1 ϕ t i 1 p ϕ t i u ϑ t f o r t i i 1 in eq 4 the superscripts p refers to the random walk values 3 for each vector of parameter realizations a numerical simulation is subsequently performed to predict the state variables i e concentration in downgradient wells in time t i 1 a stochastic model error vector ω t which is often assumed to be gaussian with zero mean and a predefined covariance cov t i 1 f is then added to the model predictions to represent the effect of structural uncertainty the resulting state ensemble denoted by s t i 1 p is as follows 5 s t i 1 p f s t 0 ϕ t i 1 p ω t where f is a function representing the groundwater flow and mass transport model and s t 0 denotes the model initial conditions steps 2 and 3 jointly form the prediction stage 4 to account for observation error in the measurements of the state variables denoted by o t i 1 a stochastic term η t often assumed to have a gaussian distribution is added to each measurement it is assumed that the mean value of η t is zero no bias and its covariance has a predefined value represented by cov t i 1 m hence 6 m t i 1 o t i 1 η t where m t i 1 is the measurement ensemble 5 next these m t i 1 values are employed for the estimation of the following two kalman gains for the parameters and states respectively 7 k t i 1 ϕ cov t i 1 ϕ m cov t i 1 mm cov t i 1 m 1 8 k t i 1 s cov t i 1 sm cov t i 1 mm cov t i 1 m 1 where cov t i 1 ϕ m is the cross covariance of the parameter and measurement ensembles cov t i 1 mm is the forecast error covariance matrix of the measurements and cov t i 1 sm is the cross covariance of state and measurement ensembles 6 the state and parameter ensembles are subsequently updated using the standard kf equation 9 ϕ t i 1 u ϕ t i 1 p k t i 1 ϕ o t i 1 m t i 1 10 s t i 1 u s t i 1 p k t i 1 s o t i 1 m t i 1 steps 4 5 and 6 together form the update stage apart from step 1 which is performed only once at the onset of the algorithm the remaining four steps are repeated sequentially for every time steps in which observations are available until the last observation time in drawing random samples for algorithm initiation and also in the parameter prediction and updates resulting from applying eqs 4 and 9 if any of the parameter realizations violates its constraints it is projected back to the boundary of the constrained space this approach is similar to bavdekar et al 2013 2 3 metamodeling approach a common challenge in the implementation of the enkf is the computational burden imposed by the need to perform a large ensemble of simulations to obtain accurate estimates this problem is exacerbated when the enkf is used for estimation of the input parameters of the computationally heavy model of contaminant transport in coastal aquifers artificial neural networks anns are employed to tackle this computational challenge the idea is to train an ann to estimate the time series of each model output quantity of interest qoi using a set of numerical model input output pairs and then use the resulting anns as metamodels in enkf computations in this study anns are built using python s tensorflow framework and keras library 3 application fig 2 shows the flowchart of the proposed csc methodology a synthetic test case is employed to analyze how effective this methodology is in solving the csc problem in coastal aquifers our synthetic test case represents a 2d cross section of an unconfined coastal aquifer where a generic contaminant migrates due to the complex velocity field induced by density driven flow simulations are conducted for two different conditions i no oceanic forcing and ii oceanic forcing due to tide the schematic of problem is demonstrated in fig 3 the test case is partially adopted from the classic henry problem with modifications based on several studies on contaminant transport in coastal aquifers e g zhang et al 2002 brovelli et al 2007 liu et al 2017 in this study the effects of inland water level oscillation wind waves and multi constituent tides on groundwater flow and contaminant transport as investigated in e g liu et al 2016 yu et al 2019 guo et al 2021 are not considered the contaminant plume like many previous studies e g brovelli et al 2007 bakhtyar et al 2013 shen et al 2019 guo et al 2021 is assumed conservative and degradation is neglected dimensions of the domain are 200 100 cm with the origin of the coordinate system located at the upper left corner of the rectangular problem domain which are the same as dimensions of the classic henry problem note that this is a scaled down version of a real coastal aquifer the domain is discretized with a regular mesh size of 1 1 cm resulting in 20 000 square elements the contaminant source is assigned to a single cell of the numerical grid the beach slope is assumed to be 1 5 in an approach similar to robinson et al 2007 and anwar et al 2014 the model domain is divided along the aquifer ocean interface into a sea zone and an aquifer zone a very high hydraulic conductivity 23 148 c m s 1 20000 m d 1 a porosity of one and a constant saline concentration of 0 035 k g k g is assigned to the sea zone the coastal aquifer has a hydraulic conductivity k of 0 2 c m s porosity θ of 0 37 longitudinal dispersivity α l of 0 2 c m and transverse dispersivity α t of 0 02 c m other aquifer parameter values are presented in table 3 key simplifying assumptions in numerical modeling of the test case are as follows a the model does not consider unsaturated flow as demonstrated by xin et al 2010 unsaturated flow does not have a considerable impact on flow and chemical transport except in the immediate vicinity of the sediment water interface b wind waves and the non periodic term in sea level variations is ignored c the contaminant is conservative and degradation is neglected d processes that cause lateral flows such as pumping have been omitted hence a 2d model is sufficient to describe the flow field and migration pathway in the coastal aquifer for both cases i and ii a constant head of 0 98 m is applied at the inland boundary ib in fig 3 and no flow boundaries were set at the bottom bc and upper ig boundaries of the aquifer and also at the sloping beach from hg surface recharge to the aquifer is not considered here a constant head of 0 90 m is assigned at the seaward boundary fe and ec in case i and a time varying cosine type tidal fluctuation is implemented at this boundary in case ii anwar et al 2014 liu et al 2016 11 h tide a c o s ω t h msl where h tide l is the sea level changing with time t h msl l is the mean sea level msl a l is the amplitude of the tide ω t 1 is the angular frequency and expressed as ω 2 π t t with t t t being the period of the tidal fluctuation tidal parameters used in the current study are presented in table 4 and compared with two key previous experimental studies in these studies the ratio of height to length is approximately equal to 2 which is relatively similar to this ratio in the current study according to the last column of table 4 a ratio of tidal amplitude to mean sea level 2 a h 0 similar to previous studies has been employed the resulting head fluctuation is depicted in fig 4 the source of contaminant release is located at x s 20 cm and z s 31 cm the source has an outflow of q s 0 5 m 3 d with a concentration of c s 20 m g l i t for the contaminant see fig 5 and table 5 the system is assumed to be initially filled with saline water and the formation of a freshwater aquifer as the result of saline water being flushed out by freshwater recharge from the inland boundary is simulated the simulation time is continued long enough for the salinity concentration distribution to become steady state this steady state groundwater flow and salt distributions is used as initial conditions for the subsequent simulations it is assumed that the concentration of both salinity and contaminant in the freshwater entering the system from the inland boundary is negligible after applying the initial condition simulations are conducted for the two previously described oceanic forcing conditions by considering the tidal force in case ii the system will take some time to reach a new quasi steady state where quasi refers to the fact that the tide prevent the prevalence of complete steady state conditions after which the contaminant is injected into the aquifer to make the results of the two cases comparable the same time lag is also applied to the case of no oceanic forcing the release of the contaminant starts at time 90 min and ends at time 110 min see fig 5 in both cases i and ii the total simulation time is 240 min which is discretized into 192 equal time steps of 1 25 min as previously mentioned x s z s q s and c s are assumed to be the unknown variables in solving the csc problem and their target values are presented in table 5 in the metamodeling process these four variables serve as the inputs to the ann and the output qoi are the time series of salinity and contaminant concentrations in the observation wells the number of input output pairs used for ann training validation and testing are 100 30 and 20 respectively 4 results and discussion in this section the numerical simulation outputs are analyzed and the ann metamodels are validated the a metamodels are subsequently employ in the enkf algorithm to estimate the characteristics of the contaminant source in different scenarios and the resulting estimates are compare with the known target values 4 1 numerical simulation results fig 6 depicts the seawat based simulation results for the salinity and contaminant distributions when oceanic forcing is omitted a steady saltwater wedge forms in the absence of tidal forcing and the density difference between fresh and saline water drives the circulation of groundwater after contaminant injection at t 90 m i n fig 6a the plume first moves horizontally towards the sea fig 6b c d by the time it approaches the saltwater zone its pathway ascends in a curve and the shape of the plume gradually takes the form of a spindle fig 6e f g the contaminant is then gradually discharged to the sea fig 6g h at t 170 min 90 of the contaminant mass has been discharged to the sea fig 6i these results resembles that of robinson et al 2007 and bakhtyar et al 2013 fig 7 shows the simulated salinity and contaminant distributions in presence of tidal forcing in addition to the classical saltwater wedge a usp has formed over the discharging fresh groundwater due to the tidal forcing previous studies have shown that this usp represents a potentially more dynamic zone for mixing and reaction than the dispersion zone of the salt wedge robinson et al 2007 bakhtyar et al 2013 anwar et al 2014 liu et al 2016 moreover the system becomes quasi steady state and the saltwater wedge and usp oscillate in response to the tidal fluctuations the amplitude of this oscillation decreases with the increase of the offshore distance the flow path of the contaminant plume is also affected by tide after entering the groundwater system at t 90 m i n fig 7a the plume first moves horizontally towards the sea fig 7b c by the time it approaches the usp zone the contaminant gradually changes direction due to the usp flow field and follows an arc like path around the usp fig 7d e f g the contaminant is then discharged to the sea along the curved edge of the usp above the saltwater wedge fig 7h i at t 240 min the plume has almost disappeared fig 7j in this test case the residence time of the contaminant in the coastal aquifer increases by about 35 due to the effect of tide 4 2 metamodel development and validation to monitor the concentration variations of both salinity and the contaminant 17 and 32 observing locations are employed for simulations with and without tide respectively the larger number of observation locations for the case with tidal forcing is due to the larger dispersion zone as shown in fig 8 the observation locations in both cases are located in the transition zone between saline and freshwater and or along the migration path of the contaminant plume using the flopy python package bakker et al 2016 the seawat model is executed for 150 random samples of the input parameters c s q s x s z s in the range mentioned in table 5 and the simulated salinity and contaminant concentration time series in the above described monitoring locations are extracted from the model output this process is repeated for both with and without tide cases the resulting input output pairs are used for ann model training several experiments were performed by training different candidate networks and observing the behavior of the loss curve before settling upon the final ann architecture the final architecture is a multilayer perceptron mlp type neural networks with 9 layers including an input layer an output layer and 7 hidden layers the rectified linear unit relu is used as the activation function for the first 8 layers and the linear activation function is employed for the output layer the adam optimizer is used for model training it takes 900 epochs for training to convergence the quality of the trained ann metamodels is measured by comparison with the sewat model outputs using the test samples the following five statistical diagnostics are used for the comparison 1 the fraction of predictions within a factor of two fac2 2 the normalize mean square error nmse 3 the mean absolute error mae 4 the fractional bias fb and 5 the correlation coefficient r the ideal and acceptable range of values for these statistical indicators are presented in table 6 the table also demonstrates the value of the statistical diagnostics for our trained anns except for minor violations of nmse for the contaminant concentration the range of values for the statistical diagnostics fall within the acceptable intervals and lie close to the ideal values the ann outputs are free from bias since both fb is close to zero and fac2 is one r values close to one suggest a high degree of correlation between the numerical model and ann meta model outputs 4 3 csc using the crd enkf algorithm after validation of the trained ann metamodels they are employed within the framework of the crd enkf algorithm by replacing the function f in eq 5 with the trained anns the values of a number of filter parameters including the initial ensemble ensemble size and parameter variation range must be decide before the algorithm can be initiated in this study the target values of the contaminant source variables c s q s x s z s are known a priori so their initial values are defined by shifting away from the relevant target values and are assumed to be as follows c s 26 5 q s 1 3 x s 24 and z s 27 the enkf constraints are defined as 10 c s 35 0 1 q s 1 5 12 x s 30 and 22 z s 36 assuming that these constraints reflect prior knowledge on the parameter variation ranges theoretically the ensemble size should be sufficiently large to accurately represent the probability density function using the computationally cheap ann metamodels an ensemble size of 300 is used other filter parameter values are chosen as follows the covariance of the artificial evolution term is equal to 0 5 c s 0 2 q s 0 35 x s 0 35 z s model error ω t covariance equals 0 002 and observation error η t covariance equals 10 2 after choosing the filter parameter values the salinity and contaminant concentration data is used for the estimation of unknown contaminant source characteristics the total number of assimilation time steps are 104 and 120 for simulations with and without tide respectively all the assimilation steps are 1 25 min long and the assimilation time starts at t 90 min i e initiation of contaminant release in both cases in fig 9 presents the timeline of important events during the assimilation time for the cases with and without tide fig 10 shows the time evaluation of the ensemble means i e enkf based estimates of the contaminant source variables as demonstrated the crd enkf algorithm is able to significantly improve the wrong initial values using salinity and contaminant concentration data in both with and without tide simulations in absence of tide the ensemble mean graphs terminate at t 220 min due to the shorter residence time of the contaminant plume in the aquifer the convergence properties are not the same for the different variables q s x s and z s ensemble means demonstrate smoother convergence behavior compared to c s for both with and without tide simulations in the presence of tidal forcing the parameter estimation convergence for x s and z s representing the contaminant source location is generally slower and shows more fluctuations over time in comparison to the same graphs for the case in which tide is neglected the convergence behavior of c s and q s graphs are not significantly different for the two cases furthermore the estimation errors are slightly higher for q s x s and z s in simulation with tide though the opposite is true for c s beside fig 10 this can also be inferred from the values of absolute percentage estimation error e in table 7 in presence of tide all four ensemble mean graphs of fig 10 show sudden step variation around t 142 min this is due to the fact that at this time the contamination plume reaches the strong flow field caused by the usp which leads to a sudden change in the path of the contaminant plume this behavior is not observed for simulations without tide as the usp is non existent in this case fig 11 shows the probability distribution of the initial and final ensembles of the four contaminant source variables the figure further illustrates how the ensemble mean moves to the vicinity of the target values and the probability distribution spread or standard deviation σ as a measure of the estimation uncertainties decreases in the final ensemble fig 11 and table 7 also show that estimates pertaining to without tide simulations have a higher percent reduction in standard deviation prsd for the final ensemble compared to the initial ensemble for all four contaminant source variables so it can be concluded that the tidal force which leads to a more complex flow field makes the process of estimating unknown contaminant source variables slightly more difficult compared to the situation where there is no oceanic force 4 4 effect of salinity data assimilation the results discussed in the previous subsection where based on the assimilation of both salinity and contaminant concentration data in this subsection the salinity data are omitted and the crd enkf results that are solely based on the contaminant concentration time series in the observation wells are analyzed this is done in presence of tidal forces the results are shown in figs 10 and 11 for the ensemble mean temporal evolutions and the ensemble probability distributions respectively the associated error statistics are also provided in table 7 the overall convergence behavior of the ensemble mean is rather similar with and without salinity data assimilation the most significant outcome of omitting salinity data seems not to be an increase in the estimation error but instead a marginal increase in the uncertainty of estimations this is signified by the larger spreads in the probability distributions of all four uncertain variables in fig 11 and the associated larger σ values of table 7 in this sense salinity observations acts as axillary data to reduce uncertainty in csc 4 5 effect of heterogeneity heterogeneity plays a significant role in controlling the processes of flow and mass transfer in all kinds of aquifers but it is especially relevant in coastal aquifers where heterogeneity may cause instability to test the ability of the proposed methodology in a heterogeneous setting an alternative test case of a layered coastal aquifer with the soil particle size increasing from top to bottom as in e g gassiat et al 2013 zheng et al 2019 guo et al 2021 is considered as demonstrated in fig 12 the aquifer is composed of four inclined layers with hydraulic conductivities equal to 0 05 cm s 0 1 cm s 0 2 cm s and 0 4 cm s all other characteristics of this hypothetical case are the same as those described in section 3 oceanic forcing due to tide is considered and concentration variations of both salinity and contaminant are monitored in 32 observing points as in case ii numerical modeling results for this heterogeneous test case are presented in supplementary fig s1 note that the hydraulic conductivity field is assumed to be known the assumed heterogeneity moves the saltwater wedge towards the sea and increases the residence time of the contaminant plume though the travel path is similar to the homogeneous case as illustrated in fig 13 the temporal evolution of the crd enkf ensemble means for the heterogeneous test case are similar to those of case ii with the same sudden step variation around the time the plume reaches the strong flow field caused by the usp and show significant improvement of the wrong initial parameter values with increasing assimilation time table 8 shows that the absolute percentage estimation error e of the final ensemble for the heterogeneous case are close but slightly larger to those of the homogeneous case ii however in the heterogeneous case the prsd values are much smaller and are close to zero for 3 out of 4 estimated parameters namely c s q s and z s this shows that the algorithm didn t reduce the estimation uncertainty relative to the prior values except for the parameter x s 5 conclusion in this study a sequential data assimilation approach was developed for the estimation of contaminant source characteristics in a coastal aquifer influenced by density driven flow and tidal forcing for this purpose the study combines a numerical model of density dependent flow and multiple species solute transport ann metamodeling and a customized kalman filter technique in this approach the time series of contaminant concentration downgradient of the source and salinity concentrations in the transition zone between fresh and saline groundwater is employed for the estimation of contaminant source location and strength the proposed methodology is validated by using a benchmark problem of a coastal aquifer with sloping beach and tide induced pressure oscillation at the beach face it was demonstrated that the use of salinity data contributes to the reduction of estimation uncertainty it was also shown that the tidal force which leads to a more complex flow field makes the process of estimating unknown contaminant source variables slightly more difficult compared to the situation where there is no oceanic force and this elevated difficulty materializes in marginally higher estimation errors and uncertainties this study is significant for two reasons first it addresses a specific context for csc which has not been studied before in the literature coastal regions are some of the most populated areas in the world and as a result coastal aquifers are highly prone to contamination from inland sources successful csc in coastal aquifers is vital for environmental forensics and effective pollution control and remediation second the study shows that despite the presence of a complex transient velocity field in coastal aquifers a customized version of the enkf is capable of effectively estimating the contaminant source location and strength this shows the high potential of the enkf for csc in new and challenging contexts a number of phenomena not considered in this study such as inland head fluctuations groundwater pumping and spatial variability in contaminant degradation rates further contribute to the complexity of csc in coastal aquifers hence in order to make the proposed method applicable to real world problems further research on the effect of such phenomena is crucial moreover a precisely known hydraulic conductivity field as assumed in the current study is hardly the case in the real world hence avenues for future research may include taking into account the effect of hydraulic conductivity uncertainty in csc through e g multiple realization methods or attempting to jointly estimate the hydraulic conductivity field and the contaminant source characteristics future studies may also consider the estimation of other contaminant source characteristics such as geometry and release history of constant or time dependent releases focus on sensitivity analysis of the csc results with respect to various model parameters or perform a comparison study between the proposed method and other published methods in the context of csc credit authorship contribution statement aref panjehfouladgaran formal analysis visualization writing

of precipitation and streamflow mishra and singh 2010 demonstrated applications of copula based models for multivariate drought characterization mallya et al 2013 proposed a hidden markov model based drought index to account for the spatio temporal dependence in meteorological and hydrological variables among the meteorological drought indices spei rdi and sddi are multivariate and hence are deemed more effective than univariate indices like spi in characterizing monitoring and forecasting drought events estimates of the multivariate indices depend on precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet whereas the estimate of spi depends only on precipitation the pet accounts for different hydrometeorological variables e g temperatures wind speed relative humidity solar radiation affecting droughts globally the loss of approximately 60 of land surface precipitation water from river basins is attributable to evapotranspiration an increase in potential reference evapotranspiration can intensify dry conditions in arid and semi arid regions of the world where water resources are limited masanta and srinivas 2021 computation of the aforementioned multivariate drought indices involves fitting a stationary frequency distribution to the historical time series of a reference variable corresponding to different accumulation periods aps e g 1 3 6 months the reference variable is climatic water balance cwb i e p pet in the case of spei the ratio of p to pet for rdi whereas it is a function of cwb and its historical maximum and minimum values in the case of sddi the distributions originally suggested for fitting the reference variable to compute spei rdi and sddi are log logistic vicente serrano et al 2010 lognormal tsakiris and vangelis 2005 and normal weibull respectively stagge et al 2015 suggested using the generalized extreme value gev distribution instead of log logistic for computing spei as it provides the best goodness of fit to cwb time series across different aps mathematically the gev distribution is appealing because its inverse has a closed form expression the parameters of the aforementioned distributions can be easily estimated using widely used l moments hosking et al 1985 and maximum likelihood methods conventionally practitioners fit a stationary distribution to the reference variable considering parameters as time invariant in recent decades there has been growth in evidence of climate change studies e g ipcc 2021 indicate an increase in temperatures intensification of the hydrological cycle and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in different parts of the globe if the reference variable exhibits nonstationarity due to a significant trend in p and or pet owing to climate change it is inappropriate to fit a stationary distribution to the reference variable for computing the drought index recently there have been attempts to model nonstationarity in the hydroclimatic system using time varying network based approaches e g han et al 2018 dutta and maity 2020a 2020b 2021 graphical modeling based networks were developed through the bayesian model averaging procedure to model the complex relationships between the causal variables e g rainfall precipitable water relative humidity and hydrological drought for the purpose of drought prediction dutta and maity 2021 there is growth in interest to develop nonstationary versions of various conventional drought indices for use in nonstationary environments nonstationary versions of spi were developed by considering either climate indices e g li et al 2015 das et al 2020 song et al 2020 or time e g wang et al 2015 as covariate s or explanatory variable s analogously nonstationary rdi das et al 2021 was proposed using climate indices or time e g bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 as covariate s a nonstationary standardized streamflow index wang et al 2020 was developed to monitor hydrological droughts considering climate indices and factors depicting human influences as covariates drought indices derived by considering time as a covariate generally assume monotonic relation between time and parameters of the fitted frequency distribution wang et al 2015 which may not be appropriate as the relation might evolve dynamically in a climate change scenario in literature it is established that teleconnections exist between large scale climate patterns and regional hydrologic extremes like floods and droughts throughout the world e g maity and nagesh kumar 2006 interannual and interdecadal variations in regional and global precipitation which influences droughts are associated with variations of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure hu and feng 2001 therefore climate indices could be a better choice as covariates nevertheless the chosen set of climate covariates should be exhaustive which is often not the case currently there is a need to develop nonstationary versions of several existing multivariate meteorological drought indices for use in climate change scenarios masanta and srinivas 2020a against this backdrop the first objective of this article is an extension of spei and sddi for use in a nonstationary framework the proposed indices account for nonstationarities in precipitation and evapotranspiration which depend on several other meteorological variables e g wind speed temperature relative humidity and net solar radiation affecting drought they are estimated using a time varying probability distribution function whose location parameter is considered a function of large scale climate indices there is a dearth of knowledge on relative performances of various multivariate drought indices in different climate regions arid semi arid humid across the globe in a recent study vergni et al 2021 the performance of sddi and spei is found to be better than rdi das et al 2021 compared nonstationary versions of spi and rdi and reported that the latter index identifies drought affected areas more effectively than the former index during the monsoon months june and july the second objective of this article is set to evaluate relative performances of the newly contributed nonstationary versions of spei and sddi with their stationary counterparts and stationary and nonstationary rdi there is no prior attempt to compare the performances of stationary and nonstationary versions of various multivariate standardized drought indices in literature it is also worth noting that regional analysis of droughts e g bharath and srinivas 2015 sadri and burn 2011 could provide more insight than at site analysis in understanding drought phenomena it requires delineation of the study area into homogeneous drought regions i e regionalization and analyzing them to discern regional drought characteristics intensity severity duration and develop severity area frequency saf and intensity area duration iad relationships however in literature studies focused on nonstationary meteorological drought indices are few and confined to at site scale there is no prior attempt to account for temporal variations in attributes covariates for regionalization in the context of drought analysis against this backdrop as the third objective this study proposes using multivariate time varying clustering masanta and srinivas 2020b to delineate homogeneous drought regions for regional drought analysis nonstationarity stationarity in the reference variable of a drought index needs to be tested at the regional scale for each of the delineated regions before proceeding to regional drought analysis to the best of our knowledge there is no prior attempt in this direction though drought is a regional phenomenon a modified version of the regional mann kendall rmk test burn and elnur 2002 is proposed for this purpose the rmk test was originally developed for application at an annual scale e g to annual streamflows the proposed modification facilitates extending its application to the reference variable of a drought index at the monthly seasonal scale the modified test considers i an extended form of seasonal mk test hirsch and slack 1984 in place of its standard form in rmk test and ii the multi site block bootstrap resampling in lieu of jack knife resampling in rmk test to account for the serial and intersite dependence structures of drought reference variable at monthly seasonal scale 2 methodologies methodologies for proposed nonstationary versions of spei and sddi are presented along with their stationary counterparts in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively fig 1 subsequently the methodology of existing nonstationary and stationary rdi is presented in section 2 3 following that the methodology considered for regional trend analysis of reference variable time series in the case of spei sddi and rdi is provided in section 2 4 2 1 nonstationary and stationary spei this section presents a novel methodology proposed to compute nonstationary spei based on the gamlss framework it includes stationary spei as its special case the steps involved in the methodology are as follows 1 preparation of cumulative climate water balance cwb time series let p υ τ and pe t υ τ denote the precipitation and pet corresponding to month τ 1 12 in the year υ 1 n at a location for a chosen ap of m months e g 1 3 6 9 and 12 months calculate the reference variable cumulative cwb ccwb for each month τ in the year υ as 1 d υ τ m t n y 12 1 m τ 12 p υ n y t p e t υ n y t n 1 n y 1 t 1 12 p υ n t p e t υ n t t 1 τ p υ t p e t υ t if τ m t τ m 1 τ p υ t p e t υ t if τ m where n y m 12 divide the time series of the reference variable d υ τ m into subseries d m τ corresponding to each month τ 2 check for nonstationarity in time series of d υ τ m using the regional mann kendall nonparametric test section 2 4 by considering the null hypothesis of no trend in the data if the hypothesis is rejected fit nonstationary time varying gev distribution to d m τ otherwise fit stationary gev distribution to d m τ the cdf cumulative distribution function of the distribution can be expressed as 2 f gev d m τ exp 1 k τ α τ d m τ ξ τ 1 k τ k τ 0 exp exp d m τ ξ τ α τ k τ 0 where ξ τ α τ and k τ are respectively the location scale and shape parameters of the gev distribution for the month τ optimal values of those parameters can be estimated using the method of maximum likelihood 3 frequency analysis of d m τ for each month τ analysis with nonstationary gev distribution could be performed by considering climate indices as covariates as described in a or considering time as a covariate as explained in b furthermore if analysis with stationary gev distribution is desired proceed as described in c a analysis with nonstationary gev distribution considering climate indices as covariates the cdf appears as eq 2 with time varying location parameter ξ τ t replacing ξ τ it can be determined as a linear combination of the predictors explanatory variables covariates in the gamlss generalized additive model in location scale and shape regression framework rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 mathematically this can be expressed as 3 ξ τ t β τ c t β τ 0 β τ 1 β τ n 1 c τ 1 t c τ n t β τ 0 j 1 n β τ j c τ j t where β τ 0 β τ n are parameters and c τ 1 t c τ n t are n explanatory variables for the month τ which could be chosen as climate indices corresponding to the month τ and its preceding 12 months that have high and significant correlation with d m τ for estimating correlation any effective measure e g kendall s tau can be considered furthermore the indices could include those related to large scale climate oscillations e g el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod pacific decadal oscillation pdo arctic oscillation ao northern atlantic oscillation nao equatorial indian ocean monsoon oscillation equinoo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo literature reveals that these indices could influence droughts e g nguyen et al 2021 estimate optimal values of the parameters ξ τ t α τ k τ in eq 2 and β τ 0 β τ 1 β τ n in eq 3 by maximum likelihood approach the log likelihood function of nonstationary gev distribution is expressed as 4 l d m τ ξ τ t α τ k τ t 1 ω m 1 k τ α τ d m τ t ξ τ t 1 k τ if k τ 0 t 1 ω m 1 k τ α τ d m τ t β τ 0 β τ 1 c τ 1 t β τ n c τ n t 1 k τ t 1 ω m exp d m τ ξ τ t α τ if k τ 0 t 1 ω m exp d m τ β τ 0 β τ 1 c τ 1 t β τ n c τ n t α τ where ω m denotes the number of datapoints in a time series corresponding to ap of m months solve n 3 equations i e dl d β τ i 0 i 0 n dl d α τ 0 and dl d k τ 0 to arrive at estimates of the parameters β τ 0 β τ n α τ and k τ subsequently use those estimates in eq 3 to determine the estimate of the parameter ξ τ t consider several subsets of covariates explanatory climate variables for developing relationships having the form given in eq 3 identify the parsimonious relationship using an effective strategy such as stepwise aic akaike information criterion 5 aic 2 η 2 l d m τ ξ τ t α τ k τ where η denotes the number of parameters parsimonious best relationship yields minimum least value for aic and the corresponding subset of covariates can be noted if δ denotes the arithmetic difference between aic values of two statistical models thumb rules suggest that there is i substantial evidence of their similarity when δ 2 ii considerably less evidence of their similarity when 4 δ 7 and iii no evidence of their similarity when δ greater than 10 e g burnham and anderson 2004 b analysis with nonstationary gev distribution considering time as covariate if time alone is considered as an explanatory variable instead of climate indices then β τ 2 β τ n 0 in eq 3 which reduces it to the form ξ τ t β τ 0 β τ 1 t four equations i e dl d β τ 0 0 dl d β τ 1 0 dl d α τ 0 and dl d k τ 0 are solved to determine estimates of β τ 0 and β τ 1 for use in arriving at location parameter ξ τ t and scale and shape parameters α τ and k τ respectively c frequency analysis of d m τ with stationary gev distribution in this case β τ 1 β τ n 0 in eq 3 which reduces it to the form ξ τ t β τ 0 t ξ τ say three equations i e dl d β τ 0 0 dl d α τ 0 and dl d k τ 0 are solved to determine estimates of β τ 0 or location parameter ξ τ and scale and shape parameters α τ and k τ respectively 4 in analysis with nonstationary gev distribution perform likelihood ratio chi squared test with significance level α lr to ascertain if opting for the distribution instead of its stationary counterpart results in a significant improvement in log likelihood estimate of the fitted distribution the test compares two nested models including a complex model and a simpler model that can be derived by imposing constraints on the complex model s parameters the test is based on the null hypothesis that the simpler model is the best the hypothesis is rejected when the test statistic value is large indicating that the complex model is a significant improvement over the simpler model in the present case the complex and simpler models refer to nonstationary and stationary gev distributions respectively the latter can be derived from the former by considering β τ 1 β τ n 0 in eq 3 the test statistic λ lr for the null hypothesis is computed as 6 λ lr 2 ln sup θ s θ s l θ s sup θ ns θ ns l θ ns χ k 2 where sup refers to the supremum θ s and θ ns denote the domains parameter spaces and θ s and θ ns the parameter vectors corresponding to the stationary and nonstationary gev models respectively λ lr converges asymptotically to χ2 distribution with k degrees of freedom if the null hypothesis is true herein k is equal to n which is the arithmetic difference in the number of parameters for the stationary and nonstationary gev models 5 determine non exceedance probability f corresponding to each value in the d m τ time series and transform it to a standard normal variate z as z w 2 515517 0 802853 w 0 010328 w 2 1 1 432788 w 0 189269 w 2 0 001308 w 3 7 where w ln 1 1 f 2 for 0 5 f 1 0 ln 1 f 2 for f 0 5 the z estimated using i stationary gev distribution is called stationary spei sspei ii time alone as an explanatory variable is referred to as nspei t and iii climate indices as covariates is referred to as nspei c based on the values of msdi months can be classified into seven intensity levels extreme wet msdi 2 0 severe wet 1 5 msdi 2 0 moderate wet 1 0 msdi 1 5 normal 1 0 msdi 1 0 moderate dry 1 5 msdi 1 0 severe dry 2 0 msdi 1 5 and extreme dry msdi 2 this classification is considered in analysis with all the msdis in this article a location grid is said to be in drought condition when at site msdi value drops below 1 a drought event comprises one or more consecutive months for which msdi is below 1 and the count of those consecutive months is called the duration of the event intensity severity of the event refers to the arithmetic average cumulative sum of drought intensity values corresponding to all the months within the duration of the event 2 2 nonstationary and stationary sddi the steps involved in the methodology proposed to determine the nonstationary version of the standardized deficit distance index sddi vergni et al 2021 are provided below the methodology could be used to arrive at stationary sddi as its special case 1 prepare cwb time series for each month τ 1 12 in the year υ 1 n at a location as 8 d υ τ p υ τ p e t υ τ 2 determine the maximum d max τ and minimum values d min τ in the monthly cwb time series corresponding to each month as 9 d max τ max d 1 τ d n τ and d min τ min d 1 τ d n τ 3 derive a new monthly time series δ max υ τ by taking the difference between d max τ and each of the values in the cwb time series 10 δ max υ τ d max τ d υ τ υ 1 n τ 1 12 4 for a chosen ap of m months e g 1 3 6 9 and 12 months calculate the reference variable for each month τ in the year υ as 11 d d υ τ m t n y 12 1 m τ 12 δ max υ n y t d max τ d min τ 2 n 1 n y 1 t 1 12 δ max υ n t d max τ d min τ 2 t 1 τ δ max υ t d max τ d min τ 2 if τ m t τ m 1 τ δ max υ t d max τ d min τ 2 if τ m divide the time series of d d υ τ m into subseries d d m τ corresponding to each month τ 5 check for nonstationarity in time series of d d υ τ m using the regional mann kendall nonparametric test section 2 4 by considering the hypothesis of no trend in the data the null hypothesis of stationarity is not rejected when there is no trend in most or all of the seasons helsel and frans 2006 then fit a stationary distribution to d d m τ if the hypothesis is rejected fit nonstationary time varying frequency distribution to d d m τ considering climate indices as covariates for estimating the time varying location parameter of the distribution possible choices for the frequency distribution could be normal or weibull as suggested by vergni et al 2021 in the stationary framework 6 determine non exceedance probability corresponding to each value in the d d m τ time series using the fitted distribution and transform it to a standard normal variate z as in step 5 of section 2 1 a negative value of the estimated z is referred to as nonstationary sddi nsddi or stationary sddi ssddi depending on whether the analysis is based on a nonstationary or stationary frequency distribution 2 3 nonstationary and stationary rdi recently das et al 2021 proposed a nonstationary version of the rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 its estimation involves the following steps 1 for a chosen ap of m months e g 1 3 6 9 and 12 months obtain the ratio of precipitation and pet for each month τ in the year υ as 12 α υ τ m t n y 12 1 m τ 12 p υ n y t n 1 n y 1 t 1 12 p υ n t t 1 τ p υ t t n y 12 1 m τ 12 pe t υ n y t n 1 n y 1 t 1 12 pe t υ n t t 1 τ pe t υ t if τ m t τ m 1 τ p υ t t τ m 1 τ pe t υ t if τ m divide the time series of α υ τ m into subseries α m τ corresponding to each month τ 2 check for nonstationarity in time series of α υ τ m using the regional mann kendall nonparametric test section 2 4 by considering the hypothesis of no trend in the data if the hypothesis is rejected fit nonstationary time varying lognormal distribution to α m τ considering climate indices as covariates for estimating time varying location parameter of the distribution otherwise fit the lognormal distribution to α m τ 3 determine non exceedance probability corresponding to each value in the α m τ time series using the fitted distribution and transform it to a standard normal variate z as in step 5 of section 2 1 if the analysis is based on nonstationary lognormal distribution the estimated z is called nonstationary rdi nrdi otherwise it is called stationary rdi srdi 2 4 regional trend analysis of the reference variable of msdi the regional mann kendall rmk nonparametric test mann 1945 kendall 1975 could be considered to examine whether there is consistency in the direction of monotonic trend i e increasing or decreasing of observations on the reference variable i e ccwb for spei d d υ τ m for sddi α υ τ m for rdi time series at different grids in the region the test requires performing trend analysis at each grid using conventional at site mann kendall test and assimilating the information to infer the trend at the regional scale the rmk test is based on the hypothesis of no trend in the data it assumes i serial independence among observations at each site and ii independence between contemporaneous observations at different sites in the study area both the assumptions are violated in analysis with the reference variable time series as it has serial and inter site dependence structures it needs to be circumvented to arrive at a reliable estimate for the rmk test statistic the dependence between contemporaneous observations at sites grids in the region indicates redundancy of information which enhances the count of sites grids exhibiting trends in a particular direction lettenmaier et al 1994 the issue with the violation of inter site dependence assumption can be addressed by considering a bootstrap resampling approach for determining the field significance livezey and chen 1983 associated with the rmk test field significance indicates the percentage of grids sites in a region expected to show a trend at a given local nominal significance level against random chance burn and elnur 2002 considered the bootstrap resampling approach in analysis with annual streamflow data in the present study the approach is adapted for use with monthly reference variable time series corresponding to different aps in drought analysis multi site block bootstrap technique instead of random jackknife resampling is considered for mimicking the inter site dependence structure of the reference variable time series in the derived bootstrap samples realizations jackknife block bootstrap resampling refers to drawing individual blocks of datapoints randomly from the time series of the reference variable with replacement resampling techniques are nonparametric data driven and can be effective when the frequency distribution of the reference variable is unknown however adequate datapoints are needed for resampling furthermore in the adapted approach the issue with violation of serial independence assumption is overcome by considering an extension of the at site mann kendall test hirsch and slack 1984 that accounts for covariance structure between the test statistic estimate corresponding to different seasons since the mann kendall test is nonparametric in nature it does not require any a priori information about the distribution of the test sample the proposed bootstrap approach involves the following steps 1 simulate a large number of realizations n sim 1000 of the target region comprising n sites grids by using the multi site block bootstrap technique msbb srinivas and srinivasan 2006 it involves randomly resampling contemporaneous yearly blocks of the reference variable values corresponding to all the locations grids in the target region each realization has n sites which resemble their real world counterparts in record length and at site and inter site correlation structures 2 in each of the n sim realizations the null hypothesis of no trend is tested on each site s simulated reference variable values using the seasonal mann kendall test modified for serial correlation hirsch and slack 1984 by considering α 1 local significance level let γ i denote the percentage of sites for which the null hypothesis is rejected in a realization i 1 n sim 3 from the distribution of γ 1 γ n sim determine the critical value p crit percentage of the stations expected to show a trend by chance as the γ value that is exceeded α f percent e g 5 of the time the value α f is referred to as the field global significance level in analysis with real world data if the percentage of stations showing a significant trend is larger than p crit then the regional trend is considered significant at α f field significance level 2 5 kullback leibler divergence kld with k nearest neighbor knn approach in analysis with nspei c the difference between cdfs of the observed and simulated d m τ ccwb values can be estimated using the kld estimator the d m τ values were simulated using eq 2 by considering estimates of parameters ξ τ t α τ and k τ obtained using the developed gamlss relationship eq 3 and f gev d m τ values as those corresponding to the observed d m τ values conventional kld estimator requires knowledge of i the distribution of the sample and ii the size of the histogram bins which is unknown in a real world scenario to avert making any assumptions in this regard kld was computed considering knn density estimator pérez cruz 2008 if χ and χ denote random variables depicting the observed ccwb sample x 1 x n and the corresponding simulated values x 1 x m respectively the kld can be quantified using the k nearest neighbor approach as 13 kld p q d n i 1 n log r k x i s k x i log m n 1 where p and q are respectively the cdfs of χ and χ r k x i and s k x i are respectively the euclidean distances to the k th nearest neighbor of x i in χ and χ and d 1 is the dimensionality of the data space 3 study area and data the performances of the proposed nspei and nsddi are compared with those of their stationary counterparts spei and sddi along with nrdi and rdi through a case study on karnataka state fig 2 a which extends over 1 91 791 km2 in india different parts of the state witness different climate conditions that range from arid to semi arid in the plateau region 75 of the geographic area sub humid to humid tropical in the western ghats adjoining the arabian sea and humid tropical monsoon in the coastal plains most of the state s districts 16 of 30 are among 24 eternally drought prone districts in the country icar 2018 the northeast part of the state has possibly the largest arid region in india outside the thar desert whereas the western ghats area receives copious precipitation a major part of annual rainfall 73 occurs during the southwest monsoon june to september a deficit in monsoon rainfall coupled with an increase in evapotranspiration losses due to changes in the climate conditions is believed to be the main factor leading to frequent drought conditions in the state whose population about 71 mostly depends on rainfed agriculture for its livelihood effective drought characterization in the area is essential to provide decision makers with the desired information to devise drought mitigation and management measures for use in the case study 0 5 resolution cru climatic research unit monthly precipitation and pet reanalysis data harris et

al 1998 harris et al 2020 analysis on the cru data indicated that i the annual rainfall in karnataka varies from 51 cm in the north east to 325 cm in the south west western ghats whereas ii the annual potential evapotranspiration pet losses vary from 138 cm in the south west to 190 cm in north east fig 2b c the spatial average estimate of pet for the study area is highest 150 mm during april month

with pdo and nao kumar et al 2013 pdo and ao are known to influence droughts worldwide including in india e g krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 wang et al 2019 furthermore nao and amo are suspected of affecting the variability of the hydrological system and drought recurrence in decadal or even larger time scales sheffield and wood 2011 recent studies indicate a possible influence of emi on drought characteristics in india himayoun and roshni 2019 and nearby china deng et al 2018 among the enso indices nino3 is estimated from monthly sea surface temperature sst anomaly data over 17 e 120 w 5 s 5 n region the soi quantifies the large scale fluctuations in sea level air pressure between the western tahiti and eastern tropical pacific darwin australia during el niño and la niña episodes the mei index is based on the five different observed oceanic and atmospheric variables sea level pressure sea surface temperature zonal and meridional components of the surface wind and outgoing longwave radiation over the tropical pacific basin 30 s 30 n and 100 e 70 w the emi is associated with strong anomalous cooling in the eastern and western tropical pacific and warming in the central tropical pacific ashok and yamagata 2009 among the remaining explanatory variables the dmi represents the strength of the indian ocean dipole it is determined by sst departures from their average in the western 10 s 10 n 50 70 e and eastern indian ocean 10 s 0 90 108 e saji et al 1999 the pdo index which considers the inter decadal drought variability is estimated as the leading empirical orthogonal function eof of monthly sst anomalies in the north pacific polewards of 20 n furthermore the nao index is obtained by projecting daily anomalies of 500 hpa geopotential height field over 0 equator 90 n latitudes onto the first mode of a rotated eof of monthly mean 500 hpa geopotential height anomaly data for the period 1950 2000 over the same latitude range similarly the ao index is obtained by projecting the daily anomalies of 1000 hpa geopotential height field over 20 n 90 n latitudes onto the first mode of eof of monthly mean 1000 hpa geopotential height during the period 1979 2000 following gadgil et al 2004 the equinoo index is estimated as the negative anomaly of zonal surface wind normalized by its standard deviation in the equatorial indian ocean 60 e 90 e 2 5 s 2 5 n finally the amo is estimated based on the average sst anomalies in the north atlantic ocean 0 equator 80 n 4 results and discussion 4 1 regionalization of droughts drought is a regional phenomenon therefore it is meaningful to analyze the properties characteristics of droughts at a regional scale as the study area karnataka state has a large spatial extent and complex topography it cannot be considered a single homogeneous drought region hence it was delineated into homogeneous drought regions corresponding to different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months to facilitate meaningful interpretation of the regional drought characteristics for this purpose multivariate time varying fuzzy clustering mtfc d urso 2004 methodology described in appendix a 2 was considered due to its ability to account for temporal dynamics of attributes the attributes were considered as accumulated cwb time series corresponding to the chosen ap and three location indicators latitude longitude and mean elevation for each of the 81 grids fig 2d in the study area as the number of clusters c and fuzzifier μ were not known a priori c was varied from 2 to 5 at the unit interval and μ was varied from 1 1 to 1 5 with an increment of 0 1 optimal values of c and μ were found to be 3 and 1 1 respectively using xie beni cluster validity index in analysis with different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months the geographic locations of those three clusters regions obtained for the chosen aps were similar fig 2e i the regions were referred to as coastal region cr south region sr and north region nr the homogeneity of the delineated clusters regions was tested using a graphical procedure analysis of variance anova and spectral homogeneity test masanta and srinivas 2020b brief details on the latter two are provided in appendices a 3 and a 4 respectively the graphical procedure involved i construction of ensemble mean probability density function pdf for each region by fitting gaussian kernel density function to the arithmetic mean of the ccwb time series for grids in the region and ii verifying if there are differences in pdfs corresponding to different regions for each of the aps the ensemble mean pdfs constructed for the three regions were quite different from each other in terms of their characteristics location of mode peakedness and asymmetry indicating that the regions formed are distinct fig 3 a e in the case of anova appendix a 3 boxplots exhibiting variation of 36 w index values obtained for the three delineated regions corresponding to 12 months appear closer to 1 0 when compared to those obtained for the undelimitated study area fig 3f the spectral homogeneity test s f statistic estimates obtained for grids in the study area appendix a 4 have increased substantially after regionalization it is evident from inter quartile and inter whisker ranges of boxplots exhibiting variation of those estimates across grids fig 3g the foregoing inferences were consistent in analysis with all the aps i e 1 3 6 9 and 12 months indicating that regionalization yielded homogeneous drought regions henceforth results obtained for the three regions and the undelimitated karnataka state are presented and discussed to illustrate differences in discerned drought characteristics with and without regionalization in analysis with various drought indices 4 2 computation of drought indices the hypothesis of no trend in the reference variable ccwb for spei d d υ τ m for sddi α υ τ m for rdi time series was tested for 0 5 resolution grids in the study area using the at site seasonal mann kendal trend test considering 10 significance level the results corresponding to 1 3 6 9 and 12 months aps indicate that i for spei and rdi there is a decreasing negative trend in the reference variable for the majority of grids located in the west and central parts of karnataka and ii for sddi there is an increasing positive trend in the reference variable throughout the karnataka except few parts in the northeast fig 4 a negative trend in spei and rdi and a positive trend in sddi indicate a reduction in water availability with time thus all three drought indices consistently indicate an intensification of at site drought conditions in karnataka in recent decades a contrasting trend implying intensification of at site wet condition was noted for i several grids in the northeast part of the study area for the one month ap in the case of rdi and ii a few typical grids in the eastern part for rdi over all aps and southern part for both spei and rdi over 9 and 12 month aps the hypothesis was also tested at a regional scale using the regional mann kendall nonparametric test section 2 4 which indicated statistically significant decreasing increasing regional trends for spei sddi in the case of all three regions i e cr sr and nr at 10 field significance level implying intensification of regional drought with time over all aps even in analysis with rdi intensification i e significantly decreasing trend of the regional drought was noted in all the regions for higher aps 6 9 and 12 months and also for 3 months ap in the coastal region in the simulations performed for regional trend analysis the realizations of a reference variable obtained based on the proposed msbb technique were better than those based on the jackknife resampling technique in reproducing the inter site dependence structure of the observed reference variable up to several lags as expected furthermore the simulations based on both techniques msbb and jackknife could mimic the at site correlation structure fairly well for brevity this is illustrated for simulations obtained in the analysis with spei where the reference variable is ccwb time series figure s1 the presence of a significant trend necessitates using a nonstationary approach for quantifying a drought index hence four drought indices nspei t nspei c nsddi and nrdi were estimated for sites grids in the study area corresponding to different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months following the procedure described in section 2 estimation of nspei c nsddi and nrdi involved finding the best parsimonious relationship between the location parameter of the distribution of the relevant reference variable and climate indices for each grid using the stepwise aic for this purpose two r packages namely extremes gilleland and katz 2016 and gamlss stasinopoulos and rigby 2008 were considered the climate indices that are mostly chosen as covariates for developing the relationships to compute nspei c nsddi and nrdi for grids in the three homogenous drought regions were noted corresponding to different months and aps tables s1 to s3 in supplementary material in general the chosen climate indices differed across different regions and months in the case of nspei c the most selected climate indices for lower aps 1 3 and 6 months were equinoo and mei whereas those chosen for higher aps 9 and 12 months were emi and equinoo similarly the most selected indices were ao nino3 and dmi for nrdi whereas nino3 nao and ao for nsddi herein for each drought index the explanatory climate indices were arranged in order of the frequency of their selection across different aps 4 3 investigating advantage in using climate indices as covariates the advantage of preferring climate indices to time as covariates was investigated in the case of nspei nrdi and nsddi for brevity it is illustrated in this section by comparing the three relationships eq 3 developed to compute nspei c nspei t and sspei fig 5 following step 3 a c of section 2 1 three aic values aic nspei c aic nspei t and aic sspei were computed for each grid corresponding to the three relationships subsequently boxplots were prepared to investigate the variation of aic nspei c aic sspei and aic nspei t aic sspei across grids in the study area for each month the boxplots based on aic nspei c aic sspei were farthest from zero when compared to those based on aic nspei t aic sspei on the negative aic axis fig 5a it indicates that aic values for the relationships developed to compute nspei c are the least implying the relationships are parsimonious and those for nspei t and sspei are relatively higher and mostly comparable indicating they are inferior in general aic nspei c aic sspei is greater than 2 for a majority of grids in several months greater than 7 for february to july indicating there is a substantial difference in the relationships fitted to compute nspei c and sspei fig 5 b demonstrates the superiority of the relationship eq 3 fitted to the observed cwb 6 cumulative cwb corresponding to 6 months ap time series in computing nspei c for a typical grid centered at 14 75 n 74 75 e cwb 6 estimates obtained based on relationship fitted in the case of i nspei c closely mimicked the variability and trend exhibited by the observed cwb 6 time series ii nspei t reproduced only the monotonic trend iii sspei were time invariant it indicates the superiority of nspei c compared to nspei t and sspei the inferior performance of nspei t could be attributed to its underlying assumption of linear monotonic trend in a data sample and its inability to model nonlinear trends periodicity and variability fluctuations in the time series of the sample on the other hand the inferior performance of sspei is due to its underlying assumption of time invariance the difference between cdfs of the observed and simulated ccwb values corresponding to the three different indices nspei c nspei t and sspei was determined in terms of the kld estimator using the procedure described in section 2 5 in this analysis the number of observed and simulated ccwb values were the same i e n m the estimated kld values were lower in analysis with nspei c fig 6 whereas those for nspei t and sspei were relatively higher in that order it indicates that cdfs of the ccwb at grids are modeled better in the estimation of nspei c than in the estimation of nspei t and sspei for the different aps considered thus the proposed nspei c could be considered as a potential alternative to nspei t and sspei the advantages of considering climate indices as covariates were evident even in the case of nrdi and nsddi henceforth results obtained based on the nspei c nrdi and nsddi and their conventional counterparts sspei rdi and sddi are presented and discussed results obtained by considering time as a covariate are not presented to save space 4 4 determining agreement between different drought indices at at site scale time series of stationary indices sspei srdi ssddi and their nonstationary versions nspei c nrdi nsddi determined corresponding to different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months for the period 1951 2018 were used to investigate the strength of the linear relationship between the indices and the strength of agreement between the indices in terms of i the occurrence of drought and non drought periods and ii classification of months into seven different intensity levels extreme severe moderate wet normal moderate severe extreme dry section 2 1 the linear relationship was investigated by computing correlation between the time series corresponding to i all possible pairs of stationary indices ii all possible pairs of nonstationary versions of the indices and iii pairs comprising stationary and nonstationary versions of each index further the strengths of agreement in the occurrence of drought and non drought periods were analyzed by considering binary versions of the time series corresponding to the aforementioned pairs of indices the binary version of a time series was determined by replacing the drought index value corresponding to each month by 0 for moderate severe extreme drought conditions or 1 for non drought conditions furthermore the strength of agreement between indices of each pair in terms of monthly drought intensity levels during the period 1951 2018 was assessed in terms of coefficient of agreement coa determined using weighted cohen s kappa cohen 1968 and scott s pi scott 1955 values of coa range from 0 to 1 and a higher value indicates strong agreement between the pair of indices estimates of coa were determined using the r package irr gamer et al 2012 in general the results indicated a strong linear relationship and reasonably good agreement in the occurrences of drought and non drought periods identified based on indices in the drought index pairs i sspei and srdi ii nspei c and nrdi and iii sspei and nspei c fig 7 a d g the strength of relationship and agreement in drought non drought periods were marginally lower for the pairs i srdi and nrdi ii sspei and ssddi and iii srdi and ssddi iv ssddi and nsddi for 1 month ap fig 7 h b c i the strength of the relationship was weak and agreement in drought non drought periods was less for the pairs i nspei c and nsddi and ii nrdi and nsddi fig 7 e f in general estimates of coa obtained with weighted cohen s kappa and scott s pi for different pairs of indices indicate that the strength of agreement is moderate to fair implying that the indices do not have substantial redundant information the sspei s coa is marginally higher with srdi fig 8 i ii a than with ssddi fig 8 i ii b similarly nspei s coa is marginally higher with nrdi fig 8 i ii d than with nsddi fig 8 i ii e except for 3 months ap furthermore coa of sddi with rdi fig 8 i ii c f appeared higher than coa of sddi with spei fig 8 i ii b e in analysis based on stationary and nonstationary versions of the indices except for 1 month ap the coas for pairs of nonstationary indices are generally lower than those for the corresponding pairs of stationary indices fig 8 i ii a f furthermore coa between stationary and nonstationary versions of each drought index generally dropped with an increase in ap fig 8 i ii g i and it was highest for spei compared to rdi and sddi in that order consequences of meteorological drought are closer to those of agricultural and hydrological droughts for the 6 months ap world meteorological organization wmo 2012 diaz et al 2020 all the major droughts witnessed in literature e g guha sapir 2018 mishra et al 2018 mishra 2020 during 67 years 1951 2018 period were discernable from estimates of all the indices corresponding to the 6 months ap the number of drought events affecting more than 50 of the study area during 1951 2018 was found to be i 24 based on estimates of nspei c and sspei ii 22 from estimates of nrdi and srdi and iii 21 considering ssddi and 25 using nsddi in analysis with each msdi the variability in the percentage of the area under drought for months during 1951 2018 was visualized in the form of boxplots medians of boxplots indicated that the percentage of area under drought is marginally higher i for nsddi among all msdis and ii for nonstationary msdis than for their stationary counterparts however no specific relationship was found in 75 and 95 percentiles of the boxplots across different aps figure s2 in supplementary material estimates of the drought characteristics intensity duration length severity were obtained as defined in section 2 1 for drought events during 1951 2018 at each of the 81 grids in the study area in analysis with nonstationary msdis nspei c nrdi nsddi and their stationary counterparts sspei srdi ssddi corresponding to different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months subsequently at site mean values of each drought characteristic were estimated over all the drought events and they were compared across the 81 grids drought characteristics discerned based on different msdis exhibited general behavior for 3 to 12 months aps estimates of mean and maximum severity and mean duration of drought events are higher for stationary msdis than their nonstationary counterparts in contrast i mean intensity of drought events and ii frequency count of moderate severe and extreme drought events were higher in analysis with nonstationary msdis than their stationary counterparts the differences in estimates of severity and duration were higher for higher aps fig 9 s3 and s4 in analysis with spei mean intensity is found to be higher for stationary version than its nonstationary counterpart for i 1 9 and 12 months aps in the case of the coastal region and ii 12 months ap in the case of the north region not shown for brevity 4 5 analyzing regional drought characteristics drought saf and iad curves were constructed for each of the delineated regions as well as the undelimited study area by using nonstationary versions nspei c nrdi nsddi and stationary versions sspei srdi ssddi of all the considered drought indices as described in appendices a 5 and a 6 respectively in the analysis for saf curve construction appropriate frequency distribution to fit weighted cumulative drought severity values was identified as generalized extreme value gev in maximum likelihood framework using kolmogorov smirnov ks goodness of fit test with 95 confidence level other distributions that were considered as possible candidates included generalized normal generalized pareto generalized logistic and pearson type 3 the saf and iad curves corresponding to 6 months ap are presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively whereas those for other aps are provided in the supplementary material figures s5 and s6 as expected saf curves indicate an increase in regional drought severity with the return period whereas iad curves indicate a decrease in regional drought intensity with an increase in drought duration for all the aps saf curves indicated that estimates of regional drought severity based on nonstationary msdis were generally lower than those based on their stationary counterparts for any specified areal extent and return period in the case of 6 12 months aps severity estimates based on i nsddi and ssddi exhibited behavior similar to the general behavior for 3 months ap ii nspei c and sspei showed contrasting behavior for 1 month ap nevertheless no specific pattern was evident in relative magnitudes of severity estimates based on stationary and nonstationary versions of all other drought indices for 1 and 3 months aps fig 10 the iad curves indicated that regional drought intensity estimates obtained based on nonstationary msdis i e nspei c nrdi nsddi are generally lower than those based on their stationary counterparts sspei srdi ssddi for each of the chosen durations irrespective of the region s areal extent it is valid for the undelimited study area and each delineated region except for the coastal region in analysis with spei and rdi in the case of iad curves corresponding to nonstationary drought indices there was a marginal increase in the maximum intensity of droughts of all durations with an increase in ap similar behavior was witnessed in the case of stationary drought indices for 1 to 6 months aps beyond 6 months ap an increase in the maximum intensity of drought with ap was witnessed for only the higher duration 12 months there is an absence of any major changes in maximum intensity with ap for lower duration droughts fig 12 consequently differences in maximum drought intensity corresponding to different drought durations were reduced with an increase in the ap fig 12 furthermore analysis with both nonstationary and stationary drought indices indicated that the estimates of severity and intensity of drought based on saf and iad curves respectively are the highest for the arid northern region and lower for the humid coastal region for aps 6 months corresponding to any specified areal extent nonstationary and stationary versions of rdi yielded higher drought intensity values than the corresponding versions of spei and sddi in that order for aps 6 months 5 discussion and conclusions methodologies are proposed to arrive at nonstationary versions of two multivariate drought indices spei and sddi they consider time varying probability distributions whose parameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood framework by considering large scale climate indices as covariates the advantage of preferring climate indices to time as covariates to compute a nonstationary version of a multivariate drought index was demonstrated through spei performances of nonstationary spei and sddi were compared with their stationary counterparts and stationary and nonstationary versions of rdi through a case study on karnataka state india in literature there is no such prior attempt comparing various stationary and nonstationary multivariate drought indices furthermore as regional analysis is appropriate for analyzing drought characteristics phenomena it is suggested to form homogeneous drought regions by clustering time series of msdi related reference variable using fuzzy dynamic clustering approach there is no such prior attempt to account for temporal dynamics of a reference variable for drought related regionalization the approach yielded three homogeneous drought regions in karnataka in addition a multi site block bootstrap based modified seasonal mann kendall test was proposed for detecting regional trends in the reference variable of each msdi the strength of agreement between different nonstationary and stationary pairs of msdis and differences in various drought characteristics determined using the same were analyzed at at site and regional scales overall the following conclusions were drawn 1 the geographical locations of the three homogeneous drought regions delineated in the study area corresponding to different aps i e 1 3 6 9 and 12 months were similar 2 seasonal mann kendall trend test revealed statistically significant i decreasing negative temporal trend in the reference variables of nspei sspei and nrdi srdi and ii increasing positive trend in the reference variable of nsddi ssddi indicating increasing drought condition the trend was evident at i at site scale for grids located in the west and central parts of the undelimited study area karnataka state and ii regional scale for all three regions delineated in the state at 10 field significance level it was consistent across all the higher aps i e 6 9 and 12 months 3 the realizations of a reference variable obtained in modified seasonal mann kendall test for regional trend analysis based on the proposed multi site block bootstrap technique were better than those based on the jackknife resampling technique in reproducing the inter site dependence structure of the observed reference variable up to several lags 4 the procedures considered in the case of nonstationary indices nspei c nrdi nsddi outperform their stationary counterparts sspei srdi ssddi in fitting frequency distribution to data points of the reference variable furthermore climate indices chosen for estimation of the nonstationary msdis differ across regions and months 5 the strength of agreement between different pairs of msdis determined using cohen s kappa and scott s pi is moderate to fair implying the indices do not have substantial redundant information the drought non drought periods identified based on sspei and srdi nspei c and nrdi and sspei and nspei c had good consistency whereas those identified based on nspei c and nsddi and nrdi and nsddi showed relatively weak consistency 6 grid at site scale estimates of the mean drought intensity and frequency count of moderate severe and extreme drought events were higher whereas estimates of mean drought duration mean and maximum severities were lower in analysis with nonstationary versions of drought indices when compared to their stationary counterparts for 3 to 12 months aps 7 in regional scale analysis saf curves indicated that estimates of regional drought severity based on nonstationary versions of drought indices are generally lower than those based on their stationary counterparts for all areal extents and return periods in the case of 6 12 months aps similarly iad curves indicated that estimates of regional drought intensity are lower with nonstationary drought indices than with their stationary counterparts for all the chosen durations and areal extents the stationary form of msdi assumes time invariance in the parameters of frequency distribution fitted to the reference variable consequently it cannot model nonlinear trends periodicity and variability fluctuations whenever evident in the time series of the reference variable in contrast nonstationary forms of msdis overcome these issues in modeling thus the variation in estimates of drought characteristics discerned using stationary and non stationary forms is expected however the specific observations concerning relative magnitudes of mean and maximum severity and mean duration corresponding to the stationary and nonstationary forms of msdis appear to be conditional on the nature of the trend in the reference variable which varies across different parts of the world further investigations are needed to assess the effect of different types of trends on the relative magnitude of various drought characteristics for different climatic regions around the globe stationary msdis can be considered a special case of nonstationary versions of msdis nspei c nrdi nsddi various avenues could be explored to extend the procedures proposed for the estimation of nonstationary msdis in addition to the location parameter the scale parameter of the time varying probability distribution fitted to the reference variable could also be considered a function of climate indices furthermore one may account for uncertainty in parameter estimates while determining nonstationary msdis this could involve generating synthetic replicates from the reference variable time series using a bootstrap technique and analyzing variability in estimates of the parameters corresponding to the replicates alternatively the uncertainty can be quantified in the bayesian framework where a set of prior distributions of the parameters are assumed and the posterior distributions of the parameters are obtained through an iterative strategy cheng and aghakouchak 2014 in addition there is scope for arriving at future projections of nonstationary msdis by using climate indices estimated from gcms general circulation models as covariates moreover the analysis could be extended to locations with different climatic conditions to strengthen the conclusions drawn some studies advocated the use of actual evapotranspiration aet in lieu of pet for estimation of drought indices e g joetzjer et al 2013 liu et al 2016 homdee et al 2016 rehana and monish 2020 pet represents the atmospheric water demand or maximum possible moisture loss from a region which would be the upper limit of aet in a humid climate on the other hand aet represents the moisture loss from a region to the atmosphere which depends on available energy and moisture supply typical indices developed using aet include spaei standardized precipitation actual evapotranspiration index joetzjer et al 2013 sedi standardized evapotranspiration deficit index kim and rhee 2016 and swbi standardized water budget index liu et al 2016 recently rehana and monish 2020 compared the drought characteristics discerned using both pet and aet based drought indices spei and spaei for various water limited and energy limited zones of india during 1980 2014 spaei was found to be more effective than spei in water limited zones the difference in extreme drought affected areas discerned based on the indices was considerable for water limited zones but insignificant for energy limited zones aet records are often limited which becomes a constraint in using aet based indices for long period analysis of droughts one of the future scopes of the present study is to develop nonstationary versions of aet based drought indices and compare their performances with nonstationary

considers multivariate time varying fuzzy clustering mtfc d urso 2004 algorithm to delineate homogeneous drought regions the approach was found effective for the regionalization of evapotranspiration in a recent study masanta and srinivas 2020b suppose there are n grids sites in the study area which are to be delineated into homogeneous drought regions let n denote the number of attributes selected for regionalization the set of potential attributes could include ccwb and location indicators latitude longitude and elevation attribute vector depicting i th site could be prepared as y i y

differences in their distribution and units of measurement mean y j and unbiased standard deviation σ j corresponding to each attribute j could be used to rescale the attribute as a1 x i j t y i j t y

could be estimated using welch s method with hanning window welch 1967 in the welch method psd is estimated by averaging periodograms corresponding to several possibly overlapping segments of length l

duration sheffield et al 2009 the steps involved in constructing these curves for a region corresponding to any chosen msdi and ap e g 1 3 6 9 12 months are as follows 1 at each grid in the study area determine the monthly time series of drought index comprising n ap values corresponding to the chosen ap using the procedure described in section 2 on the time series apply a sliding window of size d

months i e months having msdi 1 compute the arithmetic average of drought index intensity values for those months to arrive at the average drought intensity s ap i otherwise consider s ap i 0 2 analyze the spatial distribution of s ap i across grids in the study area for each sliding window i 1 n ap d 1 and determine the spatial extent of drought using the contiguous drought area cda clustering algorithm andreadis et al 2005 the algorithm identifies grids in the drought condition i e having s ap i 1 and the grid that has the highest drought intensity i e least s ap i value is identified as the drought cluster s center if any of the adjacent grids of the cluster center are in drought condition they are assigned to the drought cluster the procedure is repeated with each grid in the cluster until no more grids can be assigned to the cluster if grids in the drought condition exist outside the delineated cluster s a new cluster is created by applying the aforementioned procedure on those beginning with the grid having the least s ap i value the procedure thus results in a set of contiguous drought clusters corresponding to each of the n ap d 1 sliding windows 3 construct drought iad curve corresponding to each cluster identified in step 2 for this determine the average drought intensity associated with various areal extents 0 to 100 at an interval of 10 from

3282,multivariate standardized drought indices msdis are helpful in effectively characterizing monitoring and forecasting drought events over various spatial temporal scales currently there is a need to develop nonstationary versions of such indices for use in climate change scenarios to account for nonstationarities in different hydrometeorological variables e g precipitation evapotranspiration affecting droughts this article contributes nonstationary versions of two drought indices spei standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index and sddi standardized deficit distance index they consider time varying probability distribution whose location parameter is determined using climate covariates it is suggested to delineate homogeneous drought regions using a fuzzy dynamic clustering approach to characterize regional droughts furthermore a multi site block bootstrap based modified seasonal mann kendall test is proposed to detect regional trends in drought analysis for the first time the performances and agreement of different pairs of stationary and nonstationary versions of three msdis namely spei sddi rdi reconnaissance drought index are analyzed at at site and regional scales through a case study on karnataka state india the strength of agreement between different pairs of msdis is moderate to fair and climate indices chosen for their estimation differed across regions and months in analysis with nonstationary msdis i at site mean intensity and frequency of moderate severe extreme drought events were higher whereas ii at site mean duration and mean maximum severity and regional drought severity and intensity discerned using severity area frequency and intensity area duration relationships were generally lower relative to their stationary counterparts furthermore nonstationary and stationary versions of rdi yielded higher regional drought intensity values for higher accumulation periods keywords nonstationary spei nonstationary sddi regional mann kendall test drought regionalization severity area frequency curves intensity area duration curves 1 introduction droughts are the most complex natural hazards whose onset is often followed by a trail of impacts on society ecology environment and the economy the spatial temporal characteristics of droughts differ significantly across different regions in the world herrera estrada et al 2017 the complexity of drought characterization increases due to the difficulty in formulating the proper definition of drought soľáková et al 2014 in general the onset of meteorological drought occurs due to adverse meteorological situations e g a deficit of precipitation and humidity increase in temperature persistence of meteorological drought anywhere from i 1 month to 6 months impacts the agricultural productivity causing agricultural drought ii about 6 months to 24 months or more could lead to hydrological drought through a deficit in both surface and groundwaters world meteorological organization wmo 2012 causing a reduction in the availability of water for drinking irrigation industrial needs and hydropower production subsequently it leads to socio economic drought although there is no precise definition of the drought conventionally the drought condition is monitored through several indices e g kao and govindaraju 2010 mishra and singh 2010 li et al 2015 zarch et al 2015 mallya et al 2013 examples include standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 and standardized deficit distance index sddi vergni et al 2021 for meteorological droughts standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 and standardized hydrological index shi sharma and panu 2010 for hydrological droughts palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao and aghakouchak 2013 and agricultural standardized precipitation index aspi tigkas et al 2019 for agricultural droughts kao and govindaraju 2010 proposed a joint deficit index using the distribution function of copulas to capture the joint behaviors of precipitation and streamflow mishra and singh 2010 demonstrated applications of copula based models for multivariate drought characterization mallya et al 2013 proposed a hidden markov model based drought index to account for the spatio temporal dependence in meteorological and hydrological variables among the meteorological drought indices spei rdi and sddi are multivariate and hence are deemed more effective than univariate indices like spi in characterizing monitoring and forecasting drought events estimates of the multivariate indices depend on precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet whereas the estimate of spi depends only on precipitation the pet accounts for different hydrometeorological variables e g temperatures wind speed relative humidity solar radiation affecting droughts globally the loss of approximately 60 of land surface precipitation water from river basins is attributable to evapotranspiration an increase in potential reference evapotranspiration can intensify dry conditions in arid and semi arid regions of the world where water resources are limited masanta and srinivas 2021 computation of the aforementioned multivariate drought indices involves fitting a stationary frequency distribution to the historical time series of a reference variable corresponding to different accumulation periods aps e g 1 3 6 months the reference variable is climatic water balance cwb i e p pet in the case of spei the ratio of p to pet for rdi whereas it is a function of cwb and its historical maximum and minimum values in the case of sddi the distributions originally suggested for fitting the reference variable to compute spei rdi and sddi are log logistic vicente serrano et al 2010 lognormal tsakiris and vangelis 2005 and normal weibull respectively stagge et al 2015 suggested using the generalized extreme value gev distribution instead of log logistic for computing spei as it provides the best goodness of fit to cwb time series across different aps mathematically the gev distribution is appealing because its inverse has a closed form expression the parameters of the aforementioned distributions can be easily estimated using widely used l moments hosking et al 1985 and maximum likelihood methods conventionally practitioners fit a stationary distribution to the reference variable considering parameters as time invariant in recent decades there has been growth in evidence of climate change studies e g ipcc 2021 indicate an increase in temperatures intensification of the hydrological cycle and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in different parts of the globe if the reference variable exhibits nonstationarity due to a significant trend in p and or pet owing to climate change it is inappropriate to fit a stationary distribution to the reference variable for computing the drought index recently there have been attempts to model nonstationarity in the hydroclimatic system using time varying network based approaches e g han et al 2018 dutta and maity 2020a 2020b 2021 graphical modeling based networks were developed through the bayesian model averaging procedure to model the complex relationships between the causal variables e g rainfall precipitable water relative humidity and hydrological drought for the purpose of drought prediction dutta and maity 2021 there is growth in interest to develop nonstationary versions of various conventional drought indices for use in nonstationary environments nonstationary versions of spi were developed by considering either climate indices e g li et al 2015 das et al 2020 song et al 2020 or time e g wang et al 2015 as covariate s or explanatory variable s analogously nonstationary rdi das et al 2021 was proposed using climate indices or time e g bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 as covariate s a nonstationary standardized streamflow index wang et al 2020 was developed to monitor hydrological droughts considering climate indices and factors depicting human influences as covariates drought indices derived by considering time as a covariate generally assume monotonic relation between time and parameters of the fitted frequency distribution wang et al 2015 which may not be appropriate as the relation might evolve dynamically in a climate change scenario in literature it is established that teleconnections exist between large scale climate patterns and regional hydrologic extremes like floods and droughts throughout the world e g maity and nagesh kumar 2006 interannual and interdecadal variations in regional and global precipitation which influences droughts are associated with variations of sea surface temperature and sea level pressure hu and feng 2001 therefore climate indices could be a better choice as covariates nevertheless the chosen set of climate covariates should be exhaustive which is often not the case currently there is a need to develop nonstationary versions of several existing multivariate meteorological drought indices for use in climate change scenarios masanta and srinivas 2020a against this backdrop the first objective of this article is an extension of spei and sddi for use in a nonstationary framework the proposed indices account for nonstationarities in precipitation and evapotranspiration which depend on several other meteorological variables e g wind speed temperature relative humidity and net solar radiation affecting drought they are estimated using a time varying probability distribution function whose location parameter is considered a function of large scale climate indices there is a dearth of knowledge on relative performances of various multivariate drought indices in different climate regions arid semi arid humid across the globe in a recent study vergni et al 2021 the performance of sddi and spei is found to be better than rdi das et al 2021 compared nonstationary versions of spi and rdi and reported that the latter index identifies drought affected areas more effectively than the former index during the monsoon months june and july the second objective of this article is set to evaluate relative performances of the newly contributed nonstationary versions of spei and sddi with their stationary counterparts and stationary and nonstationary rdi there is no prior attempt to compare the performances of stationary and nonstationary versions of various multivariate standardized drought indices in literature it is also worth noting that regional analysis of droughts e g bharath and srinivas 2015 sadri and burn 2011 could provide more insight than at site analysis in understanding drought phenomena it requires delineation of the study area into homogeneous drought regions i e regionalization and analyzing them to discern regional drought characteristics intensity severity duration and develop severity area frequency saf and intensity area duration iad relationships however in literature studies focused on nonstationary meteorological drought indices are few and confined to at site scale there is no prior attempt to account for temporal variations in attributes covariates for regionalization in the context of drought analysis against this backdrop as the third objective this study proposes using multivariate time varying clustering masanta and srinivas 2020b to delineate homogeneous drought regions for regional drought analysis nonstationarity stationarity in the reference variable of a drought index needs to be tested at the regional scale for each of the delineated regions before proceeding to regional drought analysis to the best of our knowledge there is no prior attempt in this direction though drought is a regional phenomenon a modified version of the regional mann kendall rmk test burn and elnur 2002 is proposed for this purpose the rmk test was originally developed for application at an annual scale e g to annual streamflows the proposed modification facilitates extending its application to the reference variable of a drought index at the monthly seasonal scale the modified test considers i an extended form of seasonal mk test hirsch and slack 1984 in place of its standard form in rmk test and ii the multi site block bootstrap resampling in lieu of jack knife resampling in rmk test to account for the serial and intersite dependence structures of drought reference variable at monthly seasonal scale 2 methodologies methodologies for proposed nonstationary versions of spei and sddi are presented along with their stationary counterparts in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively fig 1 subsequently the methodology of existing nonstationary and stationary rdi is presented in section 2 3 following that the methodology considered for regional trend analysis of reference variable time series in the case of spei sddi and rdi is provided in section 2 4 2 1 nonstationary and stationary spei this section presents a novel methodology proposed to compute nonstationary spei based on the gamlss framework it includes stationary spei as its special case the steps involved in the methodology are as follows 1 preparation of cumulative climate water balance cwb time series let p υ τ and pe t υ τ denote the precipitation and pet corresponding to month τ 1 12 in the year υ 1 n at a location for a chosen ap of m months e g 1 3 6 9 and 12 months calculate the reference variable cumulative cwb ccwb for each month τ in the year υ as 1 d υ τ m t n y 12 1 m τ 12 p υ n y t p e t υ n y t n 1 n y 1 t 1 12 p υ n t p e t υ n t t 1 τ p υ t p e t υ t if τ m t τ m 1 τ p υ t p e t υ t if τ m where n y m 12 divide the time series of the reference variable d υ τ m into subseries d m τ corresponding to each month τ 2 check for nonstationarity in time series of d υ τ m using the regional mann kendall nonparametric test section 2 4 by considering the null hypothesis of no trend in the data if the hypothesis is rejected fit nonstationary time varying gev distribution to d m τ otherwise fit stationary gev distribution to d m τ the cdf cumulative distribution function of the distribution can be expressed as 2 f gev d m τ exp 1 k τ α τ d m τ ξ τ 1 k τ k τ 0 exp exp d m τ ξ τ α τ k τ 0 where ξ τ α τ and k τ are respectively the location scale and shape parameters of the gev distribution for the month τ optimal values of those parameters can be estimated using the method of maximum likelihood 3 frequency analysis of d m τ for each month τ analysis with nonstationary gev distribution could be performed by considering climate indices as covariates as described in a or considering time as a covariate as explained in b furthermore if analysis with stationary gev distribution is desired proceed as described in c a analysis with nonstationary gev distribution considering climate indices as covariates the cdf appears as eq 2 with time varying location parameter ξ τ t replacing ξ τ it can be determined as a linear combination of the predictors explanatory variables covariates in the gamlss generalized additive model in location scale and shape regression framework rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 mathematically this can be expressed as 3 ξ τ t β τ c t β τ 0 β τ 1 β τ n 1 c τ 1 t c τ n t β τ 0 j 1 n β τ j c τ j t where β τ 0 β τ n are parameters and c τ 1 t c τ n t are n explanatory variables for the month τ which could be chosen as climate indices corresponding to the month τ and its preceding 12 months that have high and significant correlation with d m τ for estimating correlation any effective measure e g kendall s tau can be considered furthermore the indices could include those related to large scale climate oscillations e g el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod pacific decadal oscillation pdo arctic oscillation ao northern atlantic oscillation nao equatorial indian ocean monsoon oscillation equinoo and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo literature reveals that these indices could influence droughts e g nguyen et al 2021 estimate optimal values of the parameters ξ τ t α τ k τ in eq 2 and β τ 0 β τ 1 β τ n in eq 3 by maximum likelihood approach the log likelihood function of nonstationary gev distribution is expressed as 4 l d m τ ξ τ t α τ k τ t 1 ω m 1 k τ α τ d m τ t ξ τ t 1 k τ if k τ 0 t 1 ω m 1 k τ α τ d m τ t β τ 0 β τ 1 c τ 1 t β τ n c τ n t 1 k τ t 1 ω m exp d m τ ξ τ t α τ if k τ 0 t 1 ω m exp d m τ β τ 0 β τ 1 c τ 1 t β τ n c τ n t α τ where ω m denotes the number of datapoints in a time series corresponding to ap of m months solve n 3 equations i e dl d β τ i 0 i 0 n dl d α τ 0 and dl d k τ 0 to arrive at estimates of the parameters β τ 0 β τ n α τ and k τ subsequently use those estimates in eq 3 to determine the estimate of the parameter ξ τ t consider several subsets of covariates explanatory climate variables for developing relationships having the form given in eq 3 identify the parsimonious relationship using an effective strategy such as stepwise aic akaike information criterion 5 aic 2 η 2 l d m τ ξ τ t α τ k τ where η denotes the number of parameters parsimonious best relationship yields minimum least value for aic and the corresponding subset of covariates can be noted if δ denotes the arithmetic difference between aic values of two statistical models thumb rules suggest that there is i substantial evidence of their similarity when δ 2 ii considerably less evidence of their similarity when 4 δ 7 and iii no evidence of their similarity when δ greater than 10 e g burnham and anderson 2004 b analysis with nonstationary gev distribution considering time as covariate if time alone is considered as an explanatory variable instead of climate indices then β τ 2 β τ n 0 in eq 3 which reduces it to the form ξ τ t β τ 0 β τ 1 t four equations i e dl d β τ 0 0 dl d β τ 1 0 dl d α τ 0 and dl d k τ 0 are solved to determine estimates of β τ 0 and β τ 1 for use in arriving at location parameter ξ τ t and scale and shape parameters α τ and k τ respectively c frequency analysis of d m τ with stationary gev distribution in this case β τ 1 β τ n 0 in eq 3 which reduces it to the form ξ τ t β τ 0 t ξ τ say three equations i e dl d β τ 0 0 dl d α τ 0 and dl d k τ 0 are solved to determine estimates of β τ 0 or location parameter ξ τ and scale and shape parameters α τ and k τ respectively 4 in analysis with nonstationary gev distribution perform likelihood ratio chi squared test with significance level α lr to ascertain if opting for the distribution instead of its stationary counterpart results in a significant improvement in log likelihood estimate of the fitted distribution the test compares two nested models including a complex model and a simpler model that can be derived by imposing constraints on the complex model s parameters the test is based on the null hypothesis that the simpler model is the best the hypothesis is rejected when the test statistic value is large indicating that the complex model is a significant improvement over the simpler model in the present case the complex and simpler models refer to nonstationary and stationary gev distributions respectively the latter can be derived from the former by considering β τ 1 β τ n 0 in eq 3 the test statistic λ lr for the null hypothesis is computed as 6 λ lr 2 ln sup θ s θ s l θ s sup θ ns θ ns l θ ns χ k 2 where sup refers to the supremum θ s and θ ns denote the domains parameter spaces and θ s and θ ns the parameter vectors corresponding to the stationary and nonstationary gev models respectively λ lr converges asymptotically to χ2 distribution with k degrees of freedom if the null hypothesis is true herein k is equal to n which is the arithmetic difference in the number of parameters for the stationary and nonstationary gev models 5 determine non exceedance probability f corresponding to each value in the d m τ time series and transform it to a standard normal variate z as z w 2 515517 0 802853 w 0 010328 w 2 1 1 432788 w 0 189269 w 2 0 001308 w 3 7 where w ln 1 1 f 2 for 0 5 f 1 0 ln 1 f 2 for f 0 5 the z estimated using i stationary gev distribution is called stationary spei sspei ii time alone as an explanatory variable is referred to as nspei t and iii climate indices as covariates is referred to as nspei c based on the values of msdi months can be classified into seven intensity levels extreme wet msdi 2 0 severe wet 1 5 msdi 2 0 moderate wet 1 0 msdi 1 5 normal 1 0 msdi 1 0 moderate dry 1 5 msdi 1 0 severe dry 2 0 msdi 1 5 and extreme dry msdi 2 this classification is considered in analysis with all the msdis in this article a location grid is said to be in drought condition when at site msdi value drops below 1 a drought event comprises one or more consecutive months for which msdi is below 1 and the count of those consecutive months is called the duration of the event intensity severity of the event refers to the arithmetic average cumulative sum of drought intensity values corresponding to all the months within the duration of the event 2 2 nonstationary and stationary sddi the steps involved in the methodology proposed to determine the nonstationary version of the standardized deficit distance index sddi vergni et al 2021 are provided below the methodology could be used to arrive at stationary sddi as its special case 1 prepare cwb time series for each month τ 1 12 in the year υ 1 n at a location as 8 d υ τ p υ τ p e t υ τ 2 determine the maximum d max τ and minimum values d min τ in the monthly cwb time series corresponding to each month as 9 d max τ max d 1 τ d n τ and d min τ min d 1 τ d n τ 3 derive a new monthly time series δ max υ τ by taking the difference between d max τ and each of the values in the cwb time series 10 δ max υ τ d max τ d υ τ υ 1 n τ 1 12 4 for a chosen ap of m months e g 1 3 6 9 and 12 months calculate the reference variable for each month τ in the year υ as 11 d d υ τ m t n y 12 1 m τ 12 δ max υ n y t d max τ d min τ 2 n 1 n y 1 t 1 12 δ max υ n t d max τ d min τ 2 t 1 τ δ max υ t d max τ d min τ 2 if τ m t τ m 1 τ δ max υ t d max τ d min τ 2 if τ m divide the time series of d d υ τ m into subseries d d m τ corresponding to each month τ 5 check for nonstationarity in time series of d d υ τ m using the regional mann kendall nonparametric test section 2 4 by considering the hypothesis of no trend in the data the null hypothesis of stationarity is not rejected when there is no trend in most or all of the seasons helsel and frans 2006 then fit a stationary distribution to d d m τ if the hypothesis is rejected fit nonstationary time varying frequency distribution to d d m τ considering climate indices as covariates for estimating the time varying location parameter of the distribution possible choices for the frequency distribution could be normal or weibull as suggested by vergni et al 2021 in the stationary framework 6 determine non exceedance probability corresponding to each value in the d d m τ time series using the fitted distribution and transform it to a standard normal variate z as in step 5 of section 2 1 a negative value of the estimated z is referred to as nonstationary sddi nsddi or stationary sddi ssddi depending on whether the analysis is based on a nonstationary or stationary frequency distribution 2 3 nonstationary and stationary rdi recently das et al 2021 proposed a nonstationary version of the rdi tsakiris and vangelis 2005 its estimation involves the following steps 1 for a chosen ap of m months e g 1 3 6 9 and 12 months obtain the ratio of precipitation and pet for each month τ in the year υ as 12 α υ τ m t n y 12 1 m τ 12 p υ n y t n 1 n y 1 t 1 12 p υ n t t 1 τ p υ t t n y 12 1 m τ 12 pe t υ n y t n 1 n y 1 t 1 12 pe t υ n t t 1 τ pe t υ t if τ m t τ m 1 τ p υ t t τ m 1 τ pe t υ t if τ m divide the time series of α υ τ m into subseries α m τ corresponding to each month τ 2 check for nonstationarity in time series of α υ τ m using the regional mann kendall nonparametric test section 2 4 by considering the hypothesis of no trend in the data if the hypothesis is rejected fit nonstationary time varying lognormal distribution to α m τ considering climate indices as covariates for estimating time varying location parameter of the distribution otherwise fit the lognormal distribution to α m τ 3 determine non exceedance probability corresponding to each value in the α m τ time series using the fitted distribution and transform it to a standard normal variate z as in step 5 of section 2 1 if the analysis is based on nonstationary lognormal distribution the estimated z is called nonstationary rdi nrdi otherwise it is called stationary rdi srdi 2 4 regional trend analysis of the reference variable of msdi the regional mann kendall rmk nonparametric test mann 1945 kendall 1975 could be considered to examine whether there is consistency in the direction of monotonic trend i e increasing or decreasing of observations on the reference variable i e ccwb for spei d d υ τ m for sddi α υ τ m for rdi time series at different grids in the region the test requires performing trend analysis at each grid using conventional at site mann kendall test and assimilating the information to infer the trend at the regional scale the rmk test is based on the hypothesis of no trend in the data it assumes i serial independence among observations at each site and ii independence between contemporaneous observations at different sites in the study area both the assumptions are violated in analysis with the reference variable time series as it has serial and inter site dependence structures it needs to be circumvented to arrive at a reliable estimate for the rmk test statistic the dependence between contemporaneous observations at sites grids in the region indicates redundancy of information which enhances the count of sites grids exhibiting trends in a particular direction lettenmaier et al 1994 the issue with the violation of inter site dependence assumption can be addressed by considering a bootstrap resampling approach for determining the field significance livezey and chen 1983 associated with the rmk test field significance indicates the percentage of grids sites in a region expected to show a trend at a given local nominal significance level against random chance burn and elnur 2002 considered the bootstrap resampling approach in analysis with annual streamflow data in the present study the approach is adapted for use with monthly reference variable time series corresponding to different aps in drought analysis multi site block bootstrap technique instead of random jackknife resampling is considered for mimicking the inter site dependence structure of the reference variable time series in the derived bootstrap samples realizations jackknife block bootstrap resampling refers to drawing individual blocks of datapoints randomly from the time series of the reference variable with replacement resampling techniques are nonparametric data driven and can be effective when the frequency distribution of the reference variable is unknown however adequate datapoints are needed for resampling furthermore in the adapted approach the issue with violation of serial independence assumption is overcome by considering an extension of the at site mann kendall test hirsch and slack 1984 that accounts for covariance structure between the test statistic estimate corresponding to different seasons since the mann kendall test is nonparametric in nature it does not require any a priori information about the distribution of the test sample the proposed bootstrap approach involves the following steps 1 simulate a large number of realizations n sim 1000 of the target region comprising n sites grids by using the multi site block bootstrap technique msbb srinivas and srinivasan 2006 it involves randomly resampling contemporaneous yearly blocks of the reference variable values corresponding to all the locations grids in the target region each realization has n sites which resemble their real world counterparts in record length and at site and inter site correlation structures 2 in each of the n sim realizations the null hypothesis of no trend is tested on each site s simulated reference variable values using the seasonal mann kendall test modified for serial correlation hirsch and slack 1984 by considering α 1 local significance level let γ i denote the percentage of sites for which the null hypothesis is rejected in a realization i 1 n sim 3 from the distribution of γ 1 γ n sim determine the critical value p crit percentage of the stations expected to show a trend by chance as the γ value that is exceeded α f percent e g 5 of the time the value α f is referred to as the field global significance level in analysis with real world data if the percentage of stations showing a significant trend is larger than p crit then the regional trend is considered significant at α f field significance level 2 5 kullback leibler divergence kld with k nearest neighbor knn approach in analysis with nspei c the difference between cdfs of the observed and simulated d m τ ccwb values can be estimated using the kld estimator the d m τ values were simulated using eq 2 by considering estimates of parameters ξ τ t α τ and k τ obtained using the developed gamlss relationship eq 3 and f gev d m τ values as those corresponding to the observed d m τ values conventional kld estimator requires knowledge of i the distribution of the sample and ii the size of the histogram bins which is unknown in a real world scenario to avert making any assumptions in this regard kld was computed considering knn density estimator pérez cruz 2008 if χ and χ denote random variables depicting the observed ccwb sample x 1 x n and the corresponding simulated values x 1 x m respectively the kld can be quantified using the k nearest neighbor approach as 13 kld p q d n i 1 n log r k x i s k x i log m n 1 where p and q are respectively the cdfs of χ and χ r k x i and s k x i are respectively the euclidean distances to the k th nearest neighbor of x i in χ and χ and d 1 is the dimensionality of the data space 3 study area and data the performances of the proposed nspei and nsddi are compared with those of their stationary counterparts spei and sddi along with nrdi and rdi through a case study on karnataka state fig 2 a which extends over 1 91 791 km2 in india different parts of the state witness different climate conditions that range from arid to semi arid in the plateau region 75 of the geographic area sub humid to humid tropical in the western ghats adjoining the arabian sea and humid tropical monsoon in the coastal plains most of the state s districts 16 of 30 are among 24 eternally drought prone districts in the country icar 2018 the northeast part of the state has possibly the largest arid region in india outside the thar desert whereas the western ghats area receives copious precipitation a major part of annual rainfall 73 occurs during the southwest monsoon june to september a deficit in monsoon rainfall coupled with an increase in evapotranspiration losses due to changes in the climate conditions is believed to be the main factor leading to frequent drought conditions in the state whose population about 71 mostly depends on rainfed agriculture for its livelihood effective drought characterization in the area is essential to provide decision makers with the desired information to devise drought mitigation and management measures for use in the case study 0 5 resolution cru climatic research unit monthly precipitation and pet reanalysis data harris et

potential evapotranspiration pet losses vary from 138 cm in the south west to 190 cm in north east fig 2b c the spatial average estimate of pet for the study area is highest 150 mm during april month and least 90 mm during december the precipitation and pet data were used to arrive at monthly time series of the reference variables desired to compute the seven drought indices nspei c nspei t spei nsddi sddi nrdi rdi at each of the 0 5 resolution grids in the study area for different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months the predictor explanatory climate variables considered for estimation of nonstationary drought indices nspei nsddi nrdi included four indices related to enso nino3 index southern oscillation index soi multivariate enso index mei el niño modoki index emi one related to iod dipole mode index dmi along with one each for pdo nao ao equinoo and amo table 1 summarizes the details on datasets of those climate variables which were procured for the period january 1951 to november 2018 the selection of climate indices is based on literature past studies have associated i temporal variation of indian summer monsoon rainfall with global climatic indices including enso equinoo dutta and maity 2018 emi dutta and maity 2020b and amo dutta and maity 2020b naidu et al 2020 ii interannual monsoon variability with enso and iod ashok and saji 2007 and iii monsoon inter decadal variability with pdo and nao kumar et al 2013 pdo and ao are known to influence droughts worldwide including in india e g krishnamurthy and krishnamurthy 2014 wang et al 2019 furthermore nao and amo are suspected of affecting the variability of the hydrological system and drought recurrence in decadal or even larger time scales sheffield and wood 2011 recent studies indicate a possible influence of emi on drought characteristics in india himayoun and roshni 2019 and nearby china deng et al 2018 among the enso indices nino3 is estimated from monthly sea surface temperature sst anomaly data over 17 e 120 w 5 s 5 n region the soi quantifies the large scale fluctuations in sea level air pressure between the western tahiti and eastern tropical pacific darwin australia during el niño and la niña episodes the mei index is based on the five different observed oceanic and atmospheric variables sea level pressure sea surface temperature zonal and meridional components of the surface wind and outgoing longwave radiation over the tropical pacific basin 30 s 30 n and 100 e 70 w the emi is associated with strong anomalous cooling in the eastern and western tropical pacific and warming in the central tropical pacific ashok and yamagata 2009 among the remaining explanatory variables the dmi represents the strength of the indian ocean dipole it is determined by sst departures from their average in

orthogonal function eof of monthly sst anomalies in the north pacific polewards of 20 n furthermore the nao index is obtained by projecting daily anomalies of 500 hpa geopotential height field over 0 equator 90 n latitudes onto the first mode of a rotated eof of monthly mean 500 hpa geopotential height anomaly data for the period 1950 2000 over the same latitude range similarly the ao index is

finally the amo is estimated based on the average sst anomalies in the north atlantic ocean 0 equator 80 n 4 results and discussion 4 1 regionalization of droughts drought is a regional phenomenon therefore it is meaningful to analyze the properties characteristics of droughts at a regional scale as the study area karnataka state has a large spatial extent and complex topography it cannot be considered a single homogeneous drought region hence it was delineated into homogeneous drought regions corresponding to different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months to facilitate meaningful interpretation of the regional drought characteristics for this purpose multivariate time varying fuzzy clustering mtfc d urso 2004 methodology described in appendix a 2 was considered due to its ability to account for temporal dynamics of attributes the attributes were considered as accumulated cwb time series corresponding to the chosen ap and three location indicators latitude longitude and mean elevation for each of the 81 grids fig 2d in the study area as the number of clusters c and fuzzifier μ were not known a priori c was varied from 2 to 5 at the unit interval and μ was varied from 1 1 to 1 5 with an increment of 0 1 optimal values of c and μ were found to be 3 and 1 1 respectively using xie beni cluster validity index in analysis with different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months the geographic locations of those three clusters regions obtained for the chosen aps were similar fig 2e i the regions were referred to as coastal region cr south region sr and north region nr the homogeneity of the delineated clusters regions was tested using a graphical procedure analysis of variance anova and spectral homogeneity test masanta and srinivas 2020b brief details on the latter two are provided in appendices a 3 and a 4 respectively the graphical procedure involved i construction of ensemble mean probability density function pdf for each region by fitting gaussian kernel density function to the arithmetic mean of the ccwb time series for grids in the region and ii verifying if there are differences in pdfs corresponding to different regions for each of the aps the ensemble mean pdfs constructed for the three regions were quite different from each other in terms of their characteristics location of mode peakedness and asymmetry indicating that the regions formed are distinct fig 3 a e in the case of anova appendix a 3 boxplots exhibiting variation of 36 w index values obtained for the three delineated regions corresponding to 12 months appear closer to 1 0 when compared to those obtained for the undelimitated study area fig 3f the spectral homogeneity test s f statistic estimates obtained for grids in the study area appendix a 4 have increased substantially after regionalization it is evident from inter quartile and inter whisker ranges of boxplots exhibiting variation of those estimates across grids fig 3g the foregoing inferences were consistent in analysis with all the aps i e 1 3 6 9 and 12 months indicating that regionalization yielded homogeneous drought regions henceforth results obtained for the three regions and the undelimitated karnataka state are presented and discussed to illustrate differences in discerned drought characteristics with and without regionalization in analysis with various drought indices 4 2 computation of drought indices the hypothesis of no trend in the reference variable ccwb for spei d d υ τ m for sddi α υ τ m for rdi time series was tested for 0 5 resolution grids in the study area using the at site seasonal mann kendal trend test considering 10 significance level the results corresponding to 1 3 6 9 and 12 months aps indicate that i for spei and rdi there is a decreasing negative trend in the reference variable for the majority of grids located in the west and central parts of karnataka and ii for sddi there is an increasing positive trend in the reference variable throughout the karnataka except few parts in the northeast fig 4 a negative trend in spei and rdi and a positive trend in sddi indicate a reduction in water availability with time thus all three drought indices consistently indicate an intensification of at site drought conditions in karnataka in recent decades a contrasting trend implying intensification of at site wet condition was noted for i several grids in the northeast part of the study area for the one month ap in the case of rdi and ii a few typical grids in the eastern part for rdi over all aps and southern part for both spei and rdi over 9 and 12 month aps the hypothesis was also tested at a regional scale using the regional mann kendall nonparametric test section 2 4 which indicated statistically significant decreasing increasing regional trends for spei sddi in the case of all three regions i e cr sr and nr at 10 field significance level implying intensification of regional drought with time over all aps even in analysis with rdi intensification i e significantly decreasing trend of the regional drought was noted in all the regions for higher aps 6 9 and 12 months and also for 3 months ap in the coastal region in the simulations performed for regional trend analysis the realizations of a reference variable obtained based on the proposed msbb technique were better than those based on the jackknife resampling technique in reproducing the inter site dependence structure of the observed reference variable up to several lags as expected furthermore the simulations based on both techniques msbb and jackknife could mimic the at site correlation structure fairly well for brevity this is illustrated for simulations obtained in the analysis with spei where the reference variable is ccwb time series figure s1 the presence of a significant trend necessitates using a nonstationary approach for quantifying a drought index hence four drought indices nspei t nspei c nsddi and nrdi were estimated for sites grids in the study area corresponding to different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months following the procedure described in section 2 estimation of nspei c nsddi and nrdi involved finding the best parsimonious relationship between the location parameter of the distribution of the relevant reference variable and climate indices for each grid using the stepwise aic for this purpose two r packages namely extremes gilleland and katz 2016 and gamlss stasinopoulos and rigby 2008 were considered the climate indices that are mostly chosen as covariates for developing the relationships to compute nspei c nsddi and nrdi for grids in the three homogenous drought regions were noted corresponding to different months and aps tables s1 to s3 in supplementary material in general the chosen climate indices differed across different regions and months in the case of nspei c the most selected climate indices for lower aps 1 3 and 6 months were equinoo and mei whereas those chosen for higher aps 9 and 12 months were emi and equinoo similarly the most selected indices were ao nino3 and dmi for nrdi whereas nino3 nao and ao for nsddi herein for each drought index the explanatory climate indices were arranged in order of the frequency of their selection across different aps 4 3 investigating advantage in using climate indices as covariates the advantage of preferring climate indices to time as covariates was investigated in the case of nspei nrdi and nsddi for brevity it is illustrated in this section by comparing the three relationships eq 3 developed to compute nspei c nspei t and sspei fig 5 following step 3 a c of section 2 1 three aic values aic nspei c aic nspei t and aic sspei were computed for each grid corresponding to the three relationships subsequently boxplots were prepared to investigate the variation of aic nspei c aic sspei and aic nspei t aic sspei across grids in the study area for each month the boxplots based on aic nspei c aic sspei were farthest from zero when compared to those based on aic nspei t aic sspei on the negative aic axis fig 5a it indicates that aic values for the relationships developed to compute nspei c are the least implying the relationships are parsimonious and those for nspei t and sspei are relatively higher and mostly comparable indicating they are inferior in general aic nspei c aic sspei is greater than 2 for a majority of grids in several months greater than 7 for february to july indicating there is a substantial difference in the relationships fitted to compute nspei c and sspei fig 5 b demonstrates the superiority of the relationship eq 3 fitted to the observed cwb 6 cumulative cwb corresponding to 6 months ap time series in computing nspei c for a typical grid centered at 14 75 n 74 75 e cwb 6 estimates obtained based on relationship fitted in the case of i nspei c closely mimicked the variability and trend exhibited by the observed cwb 6 time series ii nspei t reproduced only the monotonic trend iii sspei were time invariant it indicates the superiority of nspei c compared to nspei t and sspei the inferior performance of nspei t could be attributed to its underlying assumption of linear monotonic trend in a data sample and its inability to model nonlinear trends periodicity and variability fluctuations in the time series of the sample on the other hand the inferior performance of sspei is due to its underlying assumption of time invariance the difference between cdfs of the observed and simulated ccwb values corresponding to the three different indices nspei c nspei t and sspei was determined in terms of the kld estimator using the procedure described in section 2 5 in this analysis the number of observed and simulated ccwb values were the same i e n m the estimated kld values were lower in analysis with nspei c fig 6 whereas those for nspei t and sspei were relatively higher in that order it indicates that cdfs of the ccwb at grids are modeled better in the estimation of nspei c than in the estimation of nspei t and sspei for the different aps considered thus the proposed nspei c could be considered as a potential alternative to nspei t and sspei the advantages of considering climate indices as covariates were evident even in the case of nrdi and nsddi henceforth results obtained based on the nspei c nrdi and nsddi and their conventional counterparts sspei rdi and sddi are presented and discussed results obtained by considering time as a covariate are not presented to save space 4 4 determining agreement between different drought indices at at site scale time series of stationary indices sspei srdi ssddi and their nonstationary versions nspei c nrdi nsddi determined corresponding to different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months for the period 1951 2018 were used to investigate the strength of the linear relationship between the indices and the strength of agreement between the indices in terms of i the occurrence of drought and non drought periods and ii classification of months into seven different intensity levels extreme severe moderate wet normal moderate severe extreme dry section 2 1 the linear relationship was investigated by computing correlation between the time series corresponding to i all possible pairs of stationary indices ii all possible pairs of nonstationary versions of the indices and iii pairs comprising stationary and nonstationary versions of each index further the strengths of agreement in the occurrence of drought and non drought periods were analyzed by considering binary versions of the time series corresponding to the aforementioned pairs of indices the binary version of a time series was determined by replacing the drought index value corresponding to each month by 0 for moderate severe extreme drought conditions or 1 for non drought conditions furthermore the strength of agreement between indices of each pair in terms of monthly drought intensity levels during the period 1951 2018 was assessed in terms of coefficient of agreement coa determined using weighted cohen s kappa cohen 1968 and scott s pi scott 1955 values of coa range from 0 to 1 and a higher value indicates strong agreement between the pair of indices estimates of coa were determined using the r package irr gamer et al 2012 in general the results indicated a strong linear relationship and reasonably good agreement in the occurrences of drought and non drought periods identified based on indices in the drought index pairs i sspei and srdi ii nspei c and nrdi and iii sspei and nspei c fig 7 a d g the strength of relationship and agreement in drought non drought periods were marginally lower for the pairs i srdi and nrdi ii sspei and ssddi and iii srdi and ssddi iv ssddi and nsddi for 1 month ap fig 7 h b c i the strength of the relationship was weak and agreement in drought non drought periods was less for the pairs i nspei c and nsddi and ii nrdi and nsddi fig 7 e f in general estimates of coa obtained with weighted cohen s kappa and scott s pi for different pairs of indices indicate that the strength of agreement is moderate to fair implying that the indices do not have substantial redundant information the sspei s coa is marginally higher with srdi fig 8 i ii a than with ssddi fig 8 i ii b similarly nspei s coa is marginally higher with nrdi fig 8 i ii d than with nsddi fig 8 i ii e except for 3 months ap furthermore coa of sddi with rdi fig 8 i ii c f appeared higher than coa of sddi with spei fig 8 i ii b e in analysis based on stationary and nonstationary versions of the indices except for 1 month ap the coas for pairs of nonstationary indices are generally lower than those for the corresponding pairs of stationary indices fig 8 i ii a f furthermore coa between stationary and nonstationary versions of each drought index generally dropped with an increase in ap fig 8 i ii g i and it was highest for spei compared to rdi and sddi in that order consequences of meteorological drought are closer to those of agricultural and hydrological droughts for the 6 months ap world meteorological organization wmo 2012 diaz et al 2020 all the major droughts witnessed in literature e g guha sapir 2018 mishra et al 2018 mishra 2020 during 67 years 1951 2018 period were discernable from estimates of all the indices corresponding to the 6 months ap the number of drought events affecting more than 50 of the study area during 1951 2018 was found to be i 24 based on estimates of nspei c and sspei ii 22 from estimates of nrdi and srdi and iii 21 considering ssddi and 25 using nsddi in analysis with each msdi the variability in the percentage of the area under drought for months during 1951 2018 was visualized in the form of boxplots medians of boxplots indicated that the percentage of area under drought is marginally higher i for nsddi among all msdis and ii for nonstationary msdis than for their stationary counterparts however no specific relationship was found in 75 and 95 percentiles of the boxplots across different aps figure s2 in supplementary material estimates of the drought characteristics intensity duration length severity were obtained as defined in section 2 1 for drought events during 1951 2018 at each of the 81 grids in the study area in analysis with nonstationary msdis nspei c nrdi nsddi and their stationary counterparts sspei srdi ssddi corresponding to different aps 1 3 6 9 and 12 months subsequently at site mean values of each drought characteristic were estimated over all the drought events and they were compared across the 81 grids drought characteristics discerned based on different msdis exhibited general behavior for 3 to 12 months aps estimates of mean and maximum severity and mean duration of drought events are higher for stationary msdis than their nonstationary counterparts in contrast i mean intensity of drought events and ii frequency count of moderate severe and extreme drought events were higher in analysis with nonstationary msdis than their stationary counterparts the differences in estimates of severity and duration were higher for higher aps fig 9 s3 and s4 in analysis with spei mean intensity is found to be higher for stationary version than its nonstationary counterpart for i 1 9 and 12 months aps in the case of the coastal region and ii 12 months ap in the case of the north region not shown for brevity 4 5 analyzing regional drought characteristics drought saf and iad curves were constructed for each of the delineated regions as well as the undelimited study area by using nonstationary versions nspei c nrdi nsddi and stationary versions sspei srdi ssddi of all the considered drought indices as described in appendices a 5 and a 6 respectively in the analysis for saf curve construction appropriate frequency distribution to fit weighted cumulative drought severity values was identified as generalized extreme value gev in maximum likelihood framework using kolmogorov smirnov ks goodness of fit test with 95 confidence level other distributions that were considered as possible candidates included generalized normal generalized pareto generalized logistic and pearson type 3 the saf and iad curves corresponding to 6 months ap are presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively whereas those for other aps are provided in the supplementary material figures s5 and s6 as expected saf curves indicate an increase in regional drought severity with the return period whereas iad curves indicate a decrease in regional drought intensity with an increase in drought duration for all the aps saf curves indicated that estimates of regional drought severity based on nonstationary msdis were generally lower than those based on their stationary counterparts for any specified areal extent and return period in the case of 6 12 months aps severity estimates based on i nsddi and ssddi exhibited behavior similar to the general behavior for 3 months ap ii nspei c and sspei showed contrasting behavior for 1 month ap nevertheless no specific pattern was evident in relative magnitudes of severity estimates based on stationary and nonstationary versions of all other drought indices for 1 and 3 months aps fig 10 the iad curves indicated that regional drought intensity estimates obtained based on nonstationary msdis i e nspei c nrdi nsddi are generally lower than those based on their stationary counterparts sspei srdi ssddi for each of the chosen durations irrespective of the region s areal extent it is valid for the undelimited study area and each delineated region except for the coastal region in analysis with spei and rdi in the case of iad curves corresponding to nonstationary drought indices there was a marginal increase in the maximum intensity of droughts of all durations with an increase in ap similar behavior was witnessed in the case of stationary drought indices for 1 to 6 months aps beyond 6 months ap an increase in the maximum intensity of drought with ap was witnessed for only the higher duration 12 months there is an absence of any major changes in maximum intensity with ap for lower duration droughts fig 12 consequently differences in maximum drought intensity corresponding to different drought durations were reduced with an increase in the ap fig 12 furthermore analysis with both nonstationary and stationary drought indices indicated that the estimates of severity and intensity of drought based on saf and iad curves respectively are the highest for the arid northern region and lower for the humid coastal region for aps 6 months corresponding to any specified areal extent nonstationary and stationary versions of rdi yielded higher drought intensity values than the corresponding versions of spei and sddi in that order for aps 6 months 5 discussion and conclusions methodologies are proposed to arrive at nonstationary versions of two multivariate drought indices spei and sddi they consider time varying probability distributions whose parameters are estimated in the maximum likelihood framework by considering large scale climate indices as covariates the advantage of preferring climate indices to time as covariates to compute a nonstationary version of a multivariate drought index was demonstrated through spei performances of nonstationary spei and sddi were compared with their stationary counterparts and stationary and nonstationary versions of rdi through a case study on karnataka state india in literature there is no such prior attempt comparing various stationary and nonstationary multivariate drought indices furthermore as regional analysis is appropriate for analyzing drought characteristics phenomena it is suggested to form homogeneous drought regions by clustering time series of msdi related reference variable using fuzzy dynamic clustering approach there is no such prior attempt to account for temporal dynamics of a reference variable for drought related regionalization the approach yielded three homogeneous drought regions in karnataka in addition a multi site block bootstrap based modified seasonal mann kendall test was proposed for detecting regional trends in the reference variable of each msdi the strength of agreement between different nonstationary and stationary pairs of msdis and differences in various drought characteristics determined using the same were analyzed at at site and regional scales overall the following conclusions were drawn 1 the geographical locations of the three homogeneous drought regions delineated in the study area corresponding to different aps i e 1 3 6 9 and 12 months were similar 2 seasonal mann kendall trend test revealed statistically significant i decreasing negative temporal trend in the reference variables of nspei sspei and nrdi srdi and ii increasing positive trend in the reference variable of nsddi ssddi indicating increasing drought condition the trend was evident at i at site scale for grids located in the west and central parts of the undelimited study area karnataka state and ii regional scale for all three regions delineated in the state at 10 field significance level it was consistent across all the higher aps i e 6 9 and 12 months 3 the realizations of a reference variable obtained in modified seasonal mann kendall test for regional trend analysis based on the proposed multi site block bootstrap technique were better than those based on the jackknife resampling technique in reproducing the inter site dependence structure of the observed reference variable up to several lags 4 the procedures considered in the case of nonstationary indices nspei c nrdi nsddi outperform their stationary counterparts sspei srdi ssddi in fitting frequency distribution to data points of the reference variable furthermore climate indices chosen for estimation of the nonstationary msdis differ across regions and months 5 the strength of agreement between different pairs of msdis determined using cohen s kappa and scott s pi is moderate to fair implying the indices do not have substantial redundant information the drought non drought periods identified based on sspei and srdi nspei c and nrdi and sspei and nspei c had good consistency whereas those identified based on nspei c and nsddi and nrdi and nsddi showed relatively weak consistency 6 grid at site scale estimates of the mean drought intensity and frequency count of moderate severe and extreme drought events were higher whereas estimates of mean drought duration mean and maximum severities were lower in analysis with nonstationary versions of drought indices when compared to their stationary counterparts for 3 to 12 months aps 7 in regional scale analysis saf curves indicated that estimates of regional drought severity based on nonstationary versions of drought indices are generally lower than those based on their stationary counterparts for all areal extents and return periods in the case of 6 12 months aps similarly iad curves indicated that estimates of regional drought intensity are lower with nonstationary drought indices than with their stationary counterparts for all the chosen durations and areal extents the stationary form of msdi assumes time invariance in the parameters of frequency distribution fitted to the reference variable consequently it cannot model nonlinear trends periodicity and variability fluctuations whenever evident in the time series of the reference variable in contrast nonstationary forms of msdis overcome these issues in modeling thus the variation in estimates of drought characteristics discerned using stationary and non stationary forms is expected however the specific observations concerning relative magnitudes of mean and maximum severity and mean duration corresponding to the stationary and nonstationary forms of msdis appear to be conditional on the nature of the trend in the reference variable which varies across different parts of the world further investigations are needed to assess the effect of different types of trends on the relative magnitude of various drought characteristics for different climatic regions around the globe stationary msdis can be considered a special case of nonstationary versions of msdis nspei c nrdi nsddi various avenues could be explored to extend the procedures proposed for the estimation of nonstationary msdis in addition to the location parameter the scale parameter of the time varying probability distribution fitted to the reference variable could also be considered a function of climate indices furthermore one may account for uncertainty in parameter estimates while determining nonstationary msdis this could involve generating synthetic replicates from the reference variable time series using a bootstrap technique and analyzing variability in estimates of the parameters corresponding to the replicates alternatively the uncertainty can be quantified in the bayesian framework where a set of prior distributions of the parameters are assumed and the posterior distributions of the parameters are obtained through an iterative strategy cheng and aghakouchak 2014 in addition there is scope for arriving at future projections of nonstationary msdis by using climate indices estimated from gcms general circulation models as covariates moreover the analysis could be extended to locations with different climatic conditions to strengthen the conclusions drawn some studies advocated the use of actual evapotranspiration aet in lieu of pet for estimation of drought indices e g joetzjer et al 2013 liu et al 2016 homdee et al 2016 rehana and monish 2020 pet represents the atmospheric water demand or maximum possible moisture loss from a region which would be the upper limit of aet in a humid climate on the other hand aet represents the moisture loss from a region to the atmosphere which depends on available energy and moisture supply typical indices developed using aet include spaei standardized precipitation actual evapotranspiration index joetzjer et al 2013 sedi standardized evapotranspiration deficit index kim and rhee 2016 and swbi standardized water budget index liu et al 2016 recently rehana and monish 2020 compared the drought characteristics discerned using both pet and aet based drought indices spei and spaei for various water limited and energy limited zones of india during 1980 2014 spaei was found to be more effective than spei in water limited zones the difference in extreme drought affected areas discerned based on the indices was considerable for water limited zones but insignificant for energy limited zones aet records are often limited which becomes a constraint in using aet based indices for long period analysis of droughts one of the future scopes of the present study is to develop nonstationary versions of aet based drought indices and compare their performances with nonstationary

considers multivariate time varying fuzzy clustering mtfc d urso 2004 algorithm to delineate homogeneous drought regions the approach was found effective for the regionalization of evapotranspiration in a recent study masanta and srinivas 2020b suppose there are n grids sites in the study area which are to be delineated into homogeneous drought regions let n denote the number of attributes

determine the monthly time series of drought index comprising n ap values corresponding to the chosen ap using the procedure described in section 2 on the time series apply a sliding window of size d

analyze the spatial distribution of s ap i across grids in the study area for each sliding window i 1 n ap d 1 and determine the spatial extent of drought using the contiguous drought area cda clustering algorithm andreadis et al 2005 the algorithm identifies grids in the drought condition i e having s ap i 1 and the grid that has the highest drought intensity i e least s ap i value is identified as the drought cluster s center if any of the adjacent grids of the cluster center are in drought condition they are assigned to the drought cluster the procedure is repeated with each grid in the cluster until no more grids can be assigned to the cluster if grids in the drought condition exist outside the delineated cluster s a new cluster is created by applying the aforementioned procedure on those beginning with the grid having the least s ap i value the procedure thus results in a set of contiguous drought clusters corresponding to each of the n ap d 1 sliding windows 3 construct drought iad curve corresponding to each cluster identified in step 2 for this determine the average drought intensity associated with various areal extents 0 to 100 at an interval of 10 from

3283,the granitic aquifer of the area under investigation serves as an important source of water supply for the inhabitants however information about groundwater renewability and recharge process has not been defined multi tracers were then applied to determine the residence times and recharge patterns of aquifer systems in this study sulphur hexafluoride sf6 and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs were used to date shallow groundwater in ghana for the first time the tracer concentrations were measured in 38 groundwater wells from 38 sampling sites in northeastern ghana a lump parameter model lpm describing the different age distributions reveals that the groundwater residence times are less than 50 years the sf6 ages obtained were much younger than cfcs an indication of terrigenous source enrichment the young groundwater ages inferred from the dating process indicate modern recharge and this collaborates with the results of the stable isotopes in which there is a direct link between the isotopic composition of the rainfall and the groundwater the results also indicate that the weathered and fractured granitic aquifer in the area enhances rapid and diffuse recharge after precipitation in addition a 3d numerical groundwater model has been developed to simulate groundwater flow under steady state and obtain information on the key aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and recharge rates a comparison of the simulated and observed heads suggests a good match and the developed model can satisfactorily describe groundwater flow in the area a groundwater flow system has been delineated based on the multi tracers sf6 cfc 11 cfc 12 δ18o and the numerical groundwater model the findings of this study will be valuable for water managers and stakeholders to obtain relevant hydrogeological information for improved aquifer resource planning keywords sf6 cfcs northeastern ghana residence time numerical groundwater model lump parameter models lpms 1 introduction investigating which parcel of water enters a groundwater system needs a good understanding of isotopic studies and groundwater age dating iaea 2006 this is essential to know if an aquifer receives modern recharge for improved water resources planning cook and solomon 1997 busenberg and plummer 2000 beyer et al 2014 groundwater age dating can help to decipher dispersion transport process and residence time in an aquifer plummer et al 1998 map the vulnerability of shallow aquifers to contamination böhlke et al 1997 beyerle et al 1999 haase et al 2014 and reveal the consequences of land use patterns on water quality toews et al 2016 comprehension of groundwater age dating allows for the prevention of aquifer overexploitation and contamination before it begins kazemi et al 2006 the past decades have witnessed tritium as an effective and consistent dating tool for groundwater due to its concentrations in precipitation arising from natural cosmic radiations and man made thermonuclear tests that started in 1952 zuber et al 2005 kazemi et al 2006 however its application is limited due to declining concentrations in the atmosphere which has made it very challenging to differentiate the tritium levels in groundwater generated by the artificial sources from the natural sources iaea 2006 so far chlorofluorocarbons cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 13 and sulphur hexafluoride sf6 have been at the forefront of dating groundwater thompson et al 1974 oster et al 1996 busenberg and plummer 2000 it is assumed that these compounds behave conservatively when they enter the saturated zone and travel in the direction of groundwater flow the input functions of cfcs are well established and can be used to date post 1945 waters iaea 2006 a fundamental problem with cfc dating is that the mixing ratios are levelling off and have been replaced temporarily by hydrochlorofluorocarbons such as hcf 22 and hcf 134a haase et al 2014 to compensate for the limitation of cfcs sf6 is often used in conjunction with cfcs to date groundwater and reduce ambiguities beyer et al 2014 sf6 is an anthropogenic and stable gas used to date young groundwaters which are less than 50 years busenberg and plummer 2000 sf6 offers advantages such as no contamination from urban and industrial areas and also unaffected by degradation in comparison with cfcs cook and solomon 1997 furthermore sf6 does not sorb easily on organic matter plummer and busenberg 2000 enrichment of sf6 from igneous and metamorphic rocks can complicate groundwater dating which is a pitfall in using this technique busenberg and plummer 2000 an increasing number of studies have successfully carried out groundwater dating using sf6 and cfcs oster et al 1996 busenberg and plummer 2000 gooddy et al 2006 friedrich et al 2013 kagabu et al 2017 gil márquez et al 2020 coralie et al 2021 these studies often used lump parameter models lpms to explain the different age distributions in a groundwater system maloszewski and zuber 1982 jurgens et al 2012 while many advances have been made in groundwater dating in other parts of the world little has been done in africa lapworth et al 2013 for instance kamtchueng et al 2015 used multi tracers cfcs sf6 and cl to assess the origin and recharge mechanism in the lake nyos catchment northwest cameroon masule 2019 used sf6 to date perched aquifers in the okongo area northcentral namibia apparent ages ranging between 1 and 17 years were measured in these aquifers tindimugaya 2008 employed sf6 and cfcs to determine the groundwater residence time of fewer than 22 years in a weathered crystalline aquifer system in uganda the study area selected for this work is a transboundary basin of the white volta river basin of ghana and is being proposed as managed aquifer recharge mar site the mar aims to make water available all year round to counteract the increasing water scarcity that occurs every dry season there are reported cases of low groundwater yields and groundwater overdraft in the white volta river basin martin and van de giesen 2005 snc lavalin inrs 2011 in addition the semi arid nature of the area coupled with the unfavourable weather condition short rainfall season and high evapotranspiration have had dire consequences on the available water resources ghana statistical service 2014 since groundwater is the only reliable water supply in the area for domestic and irrigation purposes quantification of groundwater is needed to ensure a sustainable water supply to achieve this groundwater age dating is being investigated to obtain relevant hydrogeologic data for the mar project and also to understand the hydrogeological processes of the catchment in ghana groundwater age dating using tritium and carbon 14 dating has so far been studied acheampong and hess 2000 snc lavalin inrs 2011 anornu et al 2017 bam and bansah 2020 when compiling this research no available studies on cfcs and sf6 groundwater age dating were seen in the literature this study is a first of its kind in using cfcs ad sf6 to date groundwater in ghana this study aims to investigate the residence time of the groundwater and recharge patterns in the granitic terrain of northeastern ghana using cfcs and sf6 based on the fewer years of sf6 and the low total dissolved solids of the groundwater samples it is hypothesized that a short residence time of young groundwater would exist along the topographical flow line it is also hypothesized that groundwater recharge in the catchment will come primarily from precipitation therefore stable isotopes δ18o and δd were used complementarily to investigate the different sources of groundwater recharge in the area in addition a numerical groundwater flow model was developed to determine the groundwater flow and the key aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate in the basin characterization of the groundwater using the groundwater flow model gas tracer and isotope techniques would go a long way to provide comprehensive information on the aquifer for improved groundwater resources planning the findings will also serve as a guide for future studies outside the study region 2 study area 2 1 location climate and vegetation of the study area the catchment under investigation comprises two administrative areas the garu and tempane formerly combined as the garu tempane district the area is located in the southeastern part of the upper east region of ghana with an approximate land size of 1230 km2 ghana statistical services 2012 it shares a border with the republic of togo to the east to the north by bawku municipality to the south by bunkpurugu yunyoo district and to the west by bawku west district the catchment falls under the white volta river basin of west africa and comprises three sub basins the tamne river basin morago river and biankuri river basins and the white volta river and nahau river basins snc lavalin inrs 2011 several rivers and streams drain the catchment of which the dominant one is the tamne river which lies in the northern part and is a tributary of the white volta river in the southwestern part fig 1 these water bodies support the indigenes who combine livestock rearing with the cultivation of onions watermelons and vegetables ghana statistical services 2012 the topography is flat with surface elevation varying from 156 m to 350 m above sea level the circulation of the intertropical convergence zone itcz that brings dry northeast trade winds harmattan and moist southwest trade winds mainly controls the climate of the area the itcz affects the rainfall amounts and intensity of an area obuobie 2008 the rainy season is unimodal which occurs from may to september followed by a prolonged dry season that extends from october to april issahaku et al 2016 the rainfall amount ranges between 669 8 mm and 1339 4 mm with an annual mean of 935 mm in contrast the highest temperature of 45 is recorded in march and april and the lowest temperature of 12 c is recorded around december with an annual mean temperature of 28 7 c asamoah and ansah mensah 2020 the potential evapotranspiration rate in the white volta river basin has been reported at around 910 mm yr and this exceeds almost all the monthly rainfall rates except in june july and august where the highest rainfall amounts are recorded wrc 2008 the vegetation cover in the area is predominantly open cultivated savannah woodlands consisting of economic trees such as baobabs shea butter and dawadawa snc lavalin inrs 2011 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the catchment is largely underlain by rocks of the tamnean plutonic suite about 80 these are crystalline basement rocks that have intruded the birimian rocks and were formed during the eburnean orogeny of the paleoproterozoic era ca 2150 2070 ma feybesse et al 2006 this deformational stress has resulted in various degrees of fractures and faults within the rocks the tamnean plutonic suites are mainly granitoids composed of biotite tonalite hornblende biotite tonalite minor granodiorite and minor quartz diorite snc lavalin inrs 2011 the voltaian supergroup about 20 lies in the southeastern part of the catchment and consists exclusively of fine grained and locally bedded sandstones from the tossiego formations fig 2 there are small pockets of mesozoic rocks that are typically rich in mafic dyke and dolerite snc lavalin inrs 2011 hydrogeologically the catchment belongs to crystalline basement granitoid complex province and the voltain province the crystalline basement granitoid complex province are aquifers of the tamnean plutonic suite while the voltain province are aquifers of the voltaian supergroup banoeng yakubu et al 2011 dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 the aquifers in the catchment are commonly semi confined and the mode of groundwater occurrence is controlled by structures such as faults and fractures developed from secondary permeability and porosity the variability of the fractures within the rocks depends on the nature aperture degree of weathering and interconnecting spaces in the voltaian province processes such as compaction and cementation have affected the primary porosity of the rocks and thus groundwater generally occurs in the fracture areas and bedding planes carrier et al 2008 snc lavalin inrs 2011 furthermore the average regolith thickness of the voltain province aquifers is relatively thin circa 9 m due to the mixtures of clay quartz and mudstones materials in the area carrier et al 2008 within the crystalline basement granitoid complex province groundwater occurs in the shallow aquifer regolith aquifer and fractured aquifer the shallow aquifer is ephemeral that quickly dries up in the dry season fig 3 shows the available lithological data in the area that were used to construct multiple 3d strip logs this consists of the topsoil laterite silt sandy clay saprolite highly weathered granite saprock moderately to poorly weathered granite and fresh granite the saprolite and saprock layers are made up of the regolith aquifer the fractured aquifer is made up of weathered granitic bedrock with fractures the regolith thickness ranges from 7 8 m to 37 m with an average value of 25 m high quantities of groundwater usually exist in coarse grained granites and fractured quartz veins groundwater yield varies from 0 36 m3 h to 37 m3 h with a mean yield of 4 2 m3 h banoeng yakubu et al 2011 on average the groundwater table in the catchment varies from 12 m to 25 m acheampong 2017 inflow to the aquifers is mainly through recharge from precipitation and to some extent from the white volta river carrier et al 2008 akurugu et al 2020 there is no established groundwater recharge and groundwater flow regime in the area generally groundwater recharge in the white volta basin ranges between 3 4 and 18 4 of the mean annual precipitation of 980 mm obuobie 2008 groundwater flow in the crystalline basement complex is usually northeast to the southwest flow direction akurugu et al 2020 3 methods of study 3 1 water sampling and field extraction of cfcs and sf6 samples groundwater samples were collected at the beginning of the dry season between october and november 2019 from 38 shallow wells after purging and attaining stability of the on site field parameters the field parameters which are electrical conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen o2 and temperature were measured using calibrated multi probe meter pce 1 the pce 1 multi probe meter was rinsed with de ionized water after each measurement at a sampling location to avoid cross contamination bicarbonate was measured in the field using hach digital titrator groundwater was collected for major cations and anions in a clean 50 ml polyethylene bottle the cations were acidified with a few drops of nitric acid hno3 twelve surface water samples ponds streams rivers and the white volta river and 38 groundwater samples were also collected for stable water isotopes of deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o all the samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm syringe filter before bottling them for analysis the cfc and sf6 sampling were done in the field following the single bottle method described by usgs iaea 2006 for this method 1l glass bottles were cleaned in the laboratory by flushing them with ultrapure nitrogen gas to remove excess air before transporting them to the field the glass bottle was placed in a container under a borehole and was filled with water from the bottom to the top using a connecting rubber tube the water was allowed to overflow the glass bottle by several litres to remove excess air in and around the glass bottle the bottle was closed with a rubber seal cap inside the container in the next step the water sample was turned down to detect any gas bubbles and where gas bubbles were seen the method was repeated while the bottle was inverted a headspace volume approximately 0 2 l was created by adding nitrogen gas and at the same time taking some of the water using a displacement syringe the addition of nitrogen gas ensures that no outside air contaminates the sample the sample was vigorously shaken in the closed bottle and allowed to settle for some minutes to reach equilibration between the gas headspace and the water the gas was then extracted using two end disposable needles one connected to the 1l glass bottle and the other to a 22 ml glass vial containing ultra pure water a gas tight syringe 30 ml was inserted into the 22 ml glass vial to remove the water from the vial and simultaneously draw the gas from the headspace into the vial precautions were undertaken to avoid contamination with the outside air and the samples were taken in triplicate at each sampling site 3 2 analytical procedure and gas detection analyses for major anions cations and stable water isotopes were analyzed in january 2020 at the hydrogeochemistry laboratory institute of applied geoscience technical university of darmstadt germany in addition the concentration of groundwater ions was analyzed using metrohm 882 compact ion chromatography plus all the 50 samples 38 groundwater and 12 surface water were analyzed for stable isotopes 2h and 18o concentrations using the picarro cavity ringdown spectrometer l2130 i equipped with an auto sample the measured stable isotope concentrations were reported in delta per mil in comparison to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow δ2h 0 0 and δ18o 0 0 with analytical reproducibility of 0 025 for 18o and 0 100 for ẟd 1 δ r sample r vsmow 1 1000 where rsample is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of the sample 18o 16o or 2h 1h and rvsmow is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of the vsmow 18o 16o or 2h 1h the resulting isotope results were analyzed by plotting them with the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl the sf6 and cfcs concentrations in groundwater were measured by purge and trap system with electron capture detector ecd gas chromatography gc shimadzu 2014 at the department of biotechnology of water treatment laboratory brandenburg university of technology btu cottbus the method described by busenberg and plummer 2000 was adapted and used for this study the analytical setup consists of a mass flow meter mfc aalborg orangeburg usa and a gc composed of four integrated functions an inlet port a column a detector and an evaluation system the inlet port is equipped with a rheodyne 6 port valve supleco usa model 7000 7010 which is connected to a stainless steel column trap 30 cm long from wicom germany gmbh and filled with porapak t 50 80 mesh the rheodyne 6 port valve can be switched to position a load and position b inject in position a the sample is loaded into the trap while in position b the carrier gas flows through the trap and the samples are thus flushed onto the precolumn in the gas chromatography the carrier gas is helium that flows at a constant rate of 30 ml min the column is 1 m long packed with hayesep q 80 100 mesh and placed inside an oven this allows a temperature gradient to be driven it has a starting temperature of 80 c which is kept for 5 mins and the mixture can be heated up to 180 c the gc is equipped with two detectors an electron capture detector ecd for detecting specific tracer gases co2 n2o sf6 and cfcs and a flame ionization detector fid for measuring organic compounds before injection the gas sample in the vial was purged with nitrogen n2 using the mass flow meter and a syringe hamilton switzerland to remove the gas impurities from the glass vials it was fixed to a trap which was placed in a dry ice and ethanol mixture 70 c for 5 mins and the valve was set to position a while in the cold bath the sample was loaded into the stainless steel loop to be injected into the gc via the 6 port valve subsequently the trap was removed and transferred into a heat bath 95 c for 5 mins to release the immobilized tracer while purging was done with n2 gas in a reverse flow of the gas the temperature of the hot and cold bath was measured with the vario mag electronic stirrer mono thermometer next the batch table and detector response on the computer was started finally the valve was turned to position b so that the carrier gas helium directed the tracer into gc before the experiment the gc was calibrated with standards prepared by the technical university of bremen the analytical uncertainty for the sf6 and cfcs gases was about 2 which corresponds to a dating error of 1 year 3 3 theoretical background sf6 and cfcs are purely synthetic compounds that have been introduced into the atmosphere in numerous ways industrial production of cfcs started in 1930 due to the constant use of cfcs in refrigerators air conditions aerosols propellants and blowing agents for plastic foams iaea 2006 the mixing ratios of cfcs are decreasing due to the ratification of the montreal protocol treaty of 1987 designed progressively to halt the commercial use of cfcs and other substances that depletes the ozone sf6 was introduced into the troposphere as gas filled electrical switches in 1953 iaea 2006 busenberg and plummer 2000 since then the atmospheric mixing ratios of sf6 have risen steadily from a background value of 0 05 pptv in 1953 to about 9 pptv at present 2020 the gradual increase of sf6 is due to its low solubility in water and high soil stability mroczek 1997 busenberg and plummer 2000 this makes sf6 an excellent tracer to date young groundwater because accurate dates would be obtained haase et al 2014 cfc mixing ratios in populated urban areas are sometimes above the background atmospheric concentrations making dating problematic in these areas as the waters are contaminated with younger ages iaea 2006 on the other hand sf6 contamination of groundwater is rarely reported in urban areas however concentrations of sf6 in groundwater have been reported to be higher than atmospheric concentrations due to its natural terrigenous origin frequently found in igneous and volcanic rocks busenberg and plummer 2000 several processes can affect the apparent cfc ages of water to become either old or young if not adequately taken into consideration cook et al 1995 examples of the environmental processes that can make groundwater old are sorption hydrodynamic dispersion matrix diffusion and microbial degradation iaea 2006 under anaerobic conditions cfcs are affected by degradation mainly by dechlorination reactions that yield hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfc iaea 2006 laboratory work has proved that sf6 is highly resistant to degradation again the octanol water partition coefficient demonstrates that sf6 partitions into an aqueous solution more easily than cfcs signifying that sorption of sf6 is limited and doesn t sorb easily onto aquifer materials wilson and mackay 1996 plummer and busenberg 2000 the global atmospheric mixing ratios of cfcs and sf6 have been historically measured and reconstructed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration halocarbons naoo as shown in fig 4 by measuring the cfcs and sf6 concentrations in groundwater and comparing them with the historical dates at which the water was introduced into the saturated zone it can be assumed that the solubility of the groundwater sample equilibrates with the atmospheric air at the time of recharge iaea 2006 groundwater dating with sf6 and cfcs is governed by henry s law of solubility the application required some basic assumptions to be made and important of this is the correction of recharge temperature excess air and the thickness of the unsaturated zone the recharge temperature is usually determined by the concentrations of the dissolved gases in water such as n2 ar ne and xe heaton and vogel 1981 and aeschbach hertig et al 1999 since these gases were not measured the recharge temperature for this study was taken from the groundwater temperature which is almost equal to the mean annual air temperature of the area uncertainties in recharge elevation can affect the apparent age of the water the terrain in the study area is very flat and therefore the uncertainty in recharge elevation cannot introduce dating errors iaea 2006 furthermore mostly fractured granites underlie the area where rapid diffuse recharge occurs across all sites carrier et al 2008 bam and bansah 2020 therefore an excess air of 5 cc l was assumed and corrected for measured sf6 concentrations suggested for fractured rocks wilson and mcneill 1997 the average depth to the groundwater table is 9 m carrier et al 2008 based on this the thickness of the unsaturated zone was not corrected because it is assumed the air in the thin unsaturated zone has the same composition as the atmosphere cook and solomon 1997 oster et al 1996 3 4 calculations the concentrations of cfcs and sf6 obtained from the chromatography were converted to the atmospheric partial pressures pptv by employing a solubility function for a given temperature and salinity warner and weiss 1985 bu and warner 1995 bullister et al 2002 the following sets of the equation eqn 2 to 8 were used to define the apparent age of the sample in the first pace the known mixing ratio of the gas injected into the gc was taken the dry partial pressure p of the cfcs sf6 in the headspace of the bottle was computed by subtracting the vapour pressure ph2o from the total atmospheric pressure patm and multiplying the results by the mixing ratio mr 2 p m r p atm p h 2 o subsequently the concentration of cfcs sf6 x in the water of the bottle was calculated using henry s law kh 3 x k h p atm in the next step the number of moles of cfcs sf6 in the water mw was deduced by multiplying both the concentrations of cfcs sf6 and the volume of water v in the bottle 4 mw x v the number of moles mh of the headspace gas was calculated using the ideal gas law 5 mh pv rt the concentration of cfcs sf6 in the original sample concentration in the aquifer was calculated by dividing the total moles headspace water mass of water 6 x recharge mw m h v finally the partial pressure at recharge was calculated using henry s law 7 p recharge x recharge kh 8 m r recharge p recharge p atm s r where sr is the scale ratio i e 1e12 for parts per trillion 3 5 lumped parameter models lpms lump parameter models lpms are pre defined mathematical models of simplified flow geometry that describe the dispersion and mixing of waters in an aquifer małoszewski and zuber 1982 jurgens et al 2012 groundwater sampled in a catchment may constitute different mixed ages with the mean age and residence time considered as one entity however the apparent age of a sample will not be the same as the mean age because the tracers are non linear functions of time cook and herczeg 2012 the lumped parameter models are thus used to compute the relationship between apparent age and the mean residence time the age frequency distribution influences these in the groundwater sampled at a given time using a convolutional integral that adds up the tracer concentrations under a steady state flow condition małoszewski and zuber 1982 cook and herczeg 2012 9 c out t t c in t e λ t t g t t d t where cout the output tracer concentration cin the input tracer t is the transit time of the tracer t sample date e λ t t decay of the radioactive tracers g t t weighting function of the age frequency distribution the calculated mixing ratios pptv of the sf6 and cfcs and the tracer input history of northern hemisphere data contained in the tracerlpm software were used to model and investigate the age distributions of the samples https www usgs gov software tracerlpm three lpms were selected for this study based on the basin hydrogeological characteristics the piston flow model pfm exponential mixing model emm and the binary mixing model bmm małoszewski and zuber 1982 the pfm considers that a parcel of water moves from a recharge zone to a discharge zone in an aquifer neglecting hydrodynamic dispersion or mixing this model is constrained to a catchment where the travel time of the water is short with a high average linear velocity the emm is characterized by a mixture of different water age distributions a full penetrating aquifer with homogenous thickness and recharge that discharges into springs or rivers can be best represented by the exponential mixing model emm the bmm on the other hand involves two models the pfm and the emm and is applicable for screens that traversed multiple aquifers jurgens et al 2012 4 results and interpretation 4 1 physicochemical parameters of the groundwater and surface waters the groundwater temperature values range from 31 1 c to 32 9 c with an average value of 31 9 c whereas the surface water temperature varies from 33 4 c to 35 1 c with a mean value of 34 7 c table1 the groundwater temperature was higher than the recent average annual temperature 29 c of the area suggesting the local geothermal gradient influences the groundwater reiter 2001 all the surface water temperatures were noticeably higher than the groundwater temperature the electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater is within the range of 85 5 μs cm 593 μs cm with an average value of 249 86 μs cm suggesting a low to slightly mineralized water fig 5a the ec values of the surface water were lower than that of the groundwater with values ranging between 72 μs cm and 192 μs cm with an average value of 120 5 μs cm the groundwater in the study area is moderately acidic to moderately alkaline with ph values ranging from 6 25 to 7 93 with a mean of 7 09 the surface water exhibits alkaline conditions with values ranging from 7 58 to 8 65 with a mean value of 8 04 dissolved oxygen concentrations of the groundwater are mostly anoxic with values varying between 0 4 mg l 1 mg l with a mean of 0 57 mg l the surface waters display oxic conditions due to direct exposure to the atmosphere these values range from 4 0 mg l to 5 4 mg l with an average of 4 6 mg l the total dissolved solids tds as shown in fig 5b have values less than 600 mg l suggesting the water could be fresh and young freeze and cherry 1979 the bicarbonate of the groundwater which was measured as alkalinity in the field ranges from 90 23 mg l to 446 3 mg l with a mean of 188 61 mg l the primary source of bicarbonate in groundwater is attributed to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and in soil gases that dissolve in rain and surface water clark 2015 4 2 numerical groundwater flow model a conceptual model has been developed based on groundwater chemistry isotopes and hydraulic heads data of the area conceptualization was done with the help of a map tool contained in the groundwater modeling system software 10 4 aquaveo 2020 the model domain was conceptualized as a single hydrogeological layer at which the model top was defined as a semi confining condition to reflect the hydrogeological condition of the area the bottom of the model was conceptualized as a confining condition since it is an inherently no flow boundary with low permeabilities and hydraulic conductivities anderson et al 2015 a general head boundary ghb was imposed in the model to simulate groundwater flow across the entire boundary coverages for recharge hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head and abstraction were created and incorporated into the model in the next step the conceptual model was converted into a 3d numerical model consisting of a cell centred finite difference usgs modflow 2000 simulation code mcdonald and harbaugh 1998 the model domain of 1200 km2 was discretized into 1000 uniform cells using a finite difference grid with 100 rows and 100 columns to achieve a good model output the modflow was then used to simulate groundwater flow only under steady state conditions because there are no historical water level measurements of the area for transient simulation the steady state condition of the area represents the water levels taken in 2017 in which groundwater flow was assumed to be constant and show equilibrium condition after a long term pumping thirty hydraulic head data table 1 were used for the steady state simulation and a calibration target of 1 m was set for all the wells in the final step calibration was performed in two parts the manual trial and error and automated calibration using the automated parameter estimation pest interface in gms fig 6 1 shows the spatial hydraulic head distribution of the steady state model different groundwater flow paths are also observed due to the fractured nature of the rocks groundwater movement in the area is mainly dictated by secondary porosities and permeabilities developed from the weathering and fracturing dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 the groundwater contours mimic the geology and surface topography of the area where the highest and lowest hydraulic heads are seen in the northern and southern parts respectively this conforms to the assertion that hydraulic heads in aquifers are generally a subdued replica of the topography haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 simulated flow predominantly shows ne sw preferred flow patterns in ghana the ne sw flow patterns have been reported in many studies kesse 1985 yidana et al 2015 this is due to the tectonic and structural deformation of the rocks both local and regional flow systems controlled by structural entities are observed in the study area a plot of simulated and measured field groundwater heads fig 6 2 significantly correlates with a root mean square residual head of 1 11 m this indicates a good match and the simulated flow can be reliably used to represent the hydrogeological conditions of the area the calibrated recharge values obtained range from 5 0 10 3 mm day to 7 5 10 2 mm day which corresponds to 0 19 and 2 9 of the average annual precipitation in the area the recharge values are consistent with values reported by akurugu et al 2020 these low recharge estimates reflect the prolonged dry season and high evapotranspiration of the area the estimated hydraulic conductivity field shows values ranging from 0 2 m day to 10 m day fig 7 the highest hydraulic conductivity values are found in the southwestern parts and this can be explained as enhanced fractures of the rocks that permit rapid vertical groundwater recharge and enough groundwater storage this development indicates a piston flow model with a short groundwater residence time kamtchueng et al 2015 this also ties with low ec and tds values observed in the southwestern part of the area as shown in figs 5a and 5b the surrounding terrains mostly have hk values less than 2 m day which is within the range of literature values for granitic rocks these lowest hydraulic conductivities may be associated with massive rocks and fine particles from the weathering processes which might have filled the interconnecting spaces precluding free circulation of water and allowing rapid lateral flow lapworth et al 2013 addai et al 2016 the groundwater chemistry in this terrain is characterized by varying ec values with the highest concentrations and enriched isotopic values occurring in the northern part the weathered layers in this area may intercept high groundwater concentrations facilitating prolonged residence time resulting in different groundwater ages 4 3 groundwater recharge estimate the groundwater recharge estimation in the area was investigated from the chloride mass balance cmb approach several assumptions are made in using the cmb these are 1 the area is under state 2 chloride does not change in composition acts conservatively in the groundwater along its flow path 3 chloride source is only from precipitation and 4 there is no surface runoff cook et al 2017 if all the assumptions are satisfied then groundwater recharge can be computed using the relation in eqn 10 10 recharge c p c gw p where cp and cgw are chlorides in precipitation and chloride in groundwater respectively and p is the average annual precipitation the average chloride content in precipitation 1 31 mg l was taken from the nearest basin in northern ghana and this was used in the calculation chloride concentrations from 37 wells were used in the computation since one borehole bugri dam view was too low and not included in the analysis based on the annual average precipitation 938 mm year of the area the computed percentage recharge ranges from 0 2 to 24 8 with an average of 7 fig 8 this suggests the fraction of precipitation that enters the unsaturated zone and reaches the groundwater system as effective recharge these values are consistent with cmb values reported by different researchers in the white volta river basin and northern ghana obuobie et al 2012 afrifa et al 2017 akurugu et al 2020 4 4 stable isotopes analysis the monthly isotopic composition of precipitation n 70 measured at dapaong station in northern togo from 2015 to 2019 and integrated into the iaea gnip database was adopted as a local meteoric water line lmwl due to its proximity and similar climatic conditions to the study area the local precipitation has δ2h and δ18o values ranging between 60 39 and 28 15 and 8 93 and 2 91 respectively the positive and negative values recorded can be described as the seasonal changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation this is mainly controlled by the temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation effect in which negative values are typically recorded in the rainy season more negative in july and positive values recorded in the dry season clark and fritz 1997 the regression equation of lmwl is presented in eqn 11 which is consistent with the values obtained by different researchers in northern ghana oteng mensah et al 2014 addai et al 2016 akurugu et al 2020 the global meteoric water line gmwl after craig 1961 is also presented in eqn 12 11 δ 2 h 7 45 δ 18 o 6 48 12 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 the lmwl deviates slightly from the gmwl with a lower slope and intercept of 7 4 and 6 4 respectively this indicates a slight enrichment in heavy isotopes of the lmwl which is caused by the evaporation of the rain droplets at the local scale during the dry season low relative humidity coupled with high rising temperatures is recorded leading to the secondary evaporation of rain droplets in the air a consequence of this leads to a smaller slope less than 8 as observed in eqn 11 relative to the slope of gmwl leibundgut et al 2009 another factor for the modification of the lmwl is the differences in air masses which is the dry continental air mass and maritime air mass from the atlantic ocean that bring seasonal variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation in the area the air masses usually come from the sea and ocean and as they move inland with increasing distance from the ocean a progressive depletion in 18o and 2h is recorded clark and fritz 1997 the area is mainly flat in topography and as such altitude effect has minimal or no consequences on the isotopic composition of precipitation aggarwal et al 2005 4 5 stable isotopes of surface water mixing and evaporative enrichment the 18o composition of the surface waters ranges between 2 99 and 2 74 with an average of 1 33 whereas the δ2h composition shows 15 96 and 17 68 with an average of 8 10 almost all the surface waters are below the gmwl and lmwl indicating evaporation the evaporation produces characteristic enrichment in heavier isotopes along the evaporation line at a lower slope and intercept than the gmwl and lmwl the equation of the surface evaporation line is shown in eqn 13 13 δ 2 h 5 66 δ 18 o 0 59 the surface waters were sampled in november at the driest time of the year and conform to the assertion that surface waters are subjected to modification by evaporative fractionation during the dry season clark and fritz 1997 the effects of the evaporative enrichment of the surface waters tend to have a shallower slope under a high temperature and low relative humidity in the area darling et al 2003 however two of the samples are depleted in heavier isotopes relative to the other surface water samples these are large rivers located in the northwestern part of the area and are tributaries of the white volta which is also depleted as they flow naturally towards the white volta river with trees and vegetation cover they are subjected to minimal evaporation since they are not exposed much to sunlight gampson et al 2017 the samples also fall on the lmwl suggesting precipitation is the primary source of recharge for these surface waters it might be possible that the two samples are affected by kinetic evaporation but the infiltrating rainfall is enough to buffer the isotopic enrichment of the water that is caused by evaporation the two samples are close to the groundwater samples and exhibit a similar pattern to the latter indicating a groundwater discharge into the surface water during summer the surface waters are subjected to evaporation making the surface waters level much lower than the groundwater the groundwater then serves as a baseflow that feeds the surface water leibundgut et al 2009 most surface water samples are positive and shifted to the right side of the evaporation line which suggests significant enrichment in heavier isotopes than the two samples discussed above this enrichment is because most of the samples are from ponds dams and ephemeral streams that are standing waters with slow discharge these have more time to undergo considerable evaporation documented with low deuterium excesses table 2 than the other surface waters furthermore the water from the dams is used for irrigation and the available data suggest no interaction between the irrigated water and the groundwater the intersection points for the surface water evaporation line and the lmwl fig 9 correspond to 15 68 and 2 99 for δ2h and δ18o respectively this indicates the source of the isotopic composition of surface water before undergoing kinetic fractionation when compared to the intersection point values the high variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation may suggest the mixing of diverse isotopic signatures afrifa et al 2017 during evaporation the water vapour in the atmosphere becomes depleted in heavy isotopes due to its low pressure leaving the residual water on the land surface enriched in heavy isotopes this pattern of fractionation processes in the hydrological cycle leads to global and local isotope effects leibundgut et al 2009 the point of intersection also indicates that the surface waters in the catchment are recharged by the precipitation bam and bansah 2020 the isotopic composition of the white volta river flowing in two communities kpinkpan yug and songo guur ranges from 21 84 to 21 75 for δ2h and 2 96 to 2 76 for δ18o these are depleted in heavier isotopes than the surface waters and near the lmwl which could suggest minimal evaporation and a hydraulic connection between the white volta river and the groundwater 4 6 isotopic composition of groundwater the stable isotope composition of the granitic aquifer in the area has 18o values ranging between 4 30 and 2 89 with an average of 3 78 fig 10a whereas the deuterium composition varies between 23 63 and 17 17 with an average of 21 76 fig 10b the groundwater samples have relatively similar isotopic values with an average standard deviation of 0 30 and 0 05 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the seeming homogeneity of the aquifer samples suggests that groundwater recharge possibly comes from similar precipitation events addai et al 2016 the groundwater produces an evaporation line with a regression equation as shown in eqn 14 14 δ 2 h 4 16 δ 18 o 6 03 as illustrated in fig 9 almost all the groundwaters samples are clustered close to the gmwl and lmwl indicates the recharge source is of meteoric origin in addition this suggests that recharge is influenced by local precipitation gat 2010 the groundwater samples are depleted in heavier isotopes relative to the surface waters implying that fractionation does not affect the recharge processes considerably the area has a short rainy season between may to august with virtually no or little rains in the dry season the rains recharging the aquifer carry equilibrium isotopes signals into the groundwater thus explaining the closeness of the groundwater to the lmwl the surface water inflows to the groundwater which is much enriched due to evaporation do not significantly affect the groundwater recharge the data show that there is groundwater surface water interaction where groundwater discharges into the surface water this is in line with the regional hydrogeology knowledge that the exchange is constrained to groundwater discharging into the surface waters because the aquifer samples do not plot substantially under the lmwl rey et al 2018 groundwater recharge occurs through joints and fractures in the weathered granitic rocks resulting from secondary porosity of the underlying bedrock carrier et al 2008 these structures may receive high preferential flow from rainfall thus precluding surface pounding causing significant evaporation even though the area is found in a semi arid dry climatic zone where there are high evaporation and greater interception of plants before groundwater recharge the isotopic data of the groundwater do not support this hypothesis jasechko et al 2014 4 7 relationship between chloride and stable isotopes the relationship between δ18o and cl was examined to understand the sources of groundwater salinity and recharge areas in the aquifer system chloride and oxygen 18 are conservative tracers that aid in understanding the evaporation process before groundwater recharge bam and bansah 2020 in principle evaporation occurs when chloride and δ18o concentrations increase an event where chloride ion increases without a corresponding enrichment in δ18o will imply a dissolution of chloride salts such as halite in the unsaturated portion the plot of δ18o and cl fig 11 follows this trend in which most groundwater samples are clustered together without a significant increase in cl concentration from 0 3 mg l to 16 98 mg l whereas the δ18o values tend to increase slightly from 4 40 to 2 89 this trend cannot be related to halite dissolution since no halite salts have been reported to exist in the area it is therefore suggested that the possible source of chloride is precipitation which carries an equilibrium chloride signal into the groundwater the anomalous high chloride concentrations 25 mg l and 42 mg l can be attributed to anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer application or cattle rearing in the area that might contaminate the groundwater bam and bansah 2020 4 8 groundwater residence time and mixing sulphur hexafluoride sf6 and chlorofluorocarbons cfc 12 cfc 11 concentrations in the groundwaters are presented in part per trillion by volume pptv as shown in table 2 this ensures that the measured concentrations are comparable with the northern hemisphere atmospheric curves and avoid local recharge variations iaea 2006 the results show that most sf6 and cfcs samples are in equilibrium with the northern hemisphere air mixing ratios twenty six percent of the samples have no concentrations or are below detection limits and few samples exceed the recent air water equilibrium concentrations possibly indicating contamination iaea 2006 furthermore the average ages of the groundwater modelled for piston flow pfm exponential mixing emm and binary mixing emm indicate modern waters are less than 30 years a plot of cfc 12 against cfc 11 shows that most of the samples agree with the piston flow model fig 12 a this indicates that infiltration in the catchment occurs in pronounced recharge sources and travels towards the discharge source a well without mixing or dispersion conversely some samples are found around and on exponential mixing emm curves suggesting water mixing within the borehole jurgens et al 2012 the samples found on the bmm line suggest a binary mixture of young waters diluted with old cfc free waters samples plotted outside the model curves indicate degradation or contamination of cfcs the low dissolved oxygen concentrations 0 5 mg l in most of the analyzed groundwater samples table 1 imply a degradation of cfcs particularly cfc 11 under anaerobic conditions oster et al 1996 iaea 2006 cfc 11 appears to be biased old relative to cfc 12 in almost all the analyzed samples table 2 and such instances indicate degradation according to deipser and stegmann 1997 cfc 11 degrades almost 16 fold more than cfc 12 in addition the study area is far from an urban area and landfill sites and as such anthropogenic inputs may have little influence on the age determination therefore the possible source of cfcs contamination may be introduced during sampling and the sampling materials in contact with the outside air reynolds et al 1990 as shown in fig 12a almost all the samples are found between 1990 and 2007 representing modern recharge waters with few samples between the early and mid 1980s and one sample in the mid 1970s based on the analysis presented above cfc 12 is considered more stable and reliable in the dating process showing age ranges between 5 42 years with an average age of 24 years whereas cfc 11 has age ranges between 14 44 years with an average age of 28 years it must be noted that the post 1995 levelling of cfcs gases makes it largely uncertain to date groundwaters recharged in the last decades plummer et al 1998 a cross plot of sf6 versus cfc 12 and sf6 versus cfc 11 are presented in fig 12b and fig 12c respectively it can be seen that the majority of the samples are plotted outside the curve suggesting cfc reduction and contamination busenberg and plummer 2000 lapworth et al 2013 again few samples are scattered around the pfm bmm and emm lines and therefore cannot represent any of the flow regimes the modelled sf6 ages range from 5 years to 32 years with an average age of 15 years these ages were younger than the modelled cfcs ages and can be explained as anoxic biodegradation at the discharge point oster et al 1996 another reason is the additional inputs of sf6 derived from the granitic rocks in the catchment busenberg and plummer 2000 terrigenous enrichment of sf6 in granitic areas is usually invoked to account for the additional and high inputs of sf6 in groundwater this is evident in some communities such as napadi yapala dusbuliga and kogri which have elevated sf6 concentrations in the groundwater there is no agreement between the sf6 and cfcs model ages as the water in the catchment is characterized by different groundwater ages the aquifer in the area is mainly fractured granite where diffuse flow systems occur in all parts therefore groundwater pumped from the aquifer may constitute apparent ages affected by mixing shapiro 2002 iaea 2006 5 conceptual model of groundwater recharge and flow mechanisms the weathered granitic aquifer studied is largely heterogeneous and conditioned by different flow patterns multi tracers investigations coupled with the steady state flow model and ec of the groundwater collaborate with the data and study hypothesis the similar isotopic signatures of the groundwater close to the lmwl support the hypothesis that recharge in the area is primarily from rainfall with little contribution from surface waters water infiltration from high elevations occurs diffusely and rapidly via fractures and pores in the shallow aquifer where low mineralized water low ec and tds and short residence time are pronounced in recharge areas as groundwater transits towards discharge areas increasing residence time and high mineralized groundwater are observed based on the numerical model surface topography dictates groundwater flow with preferred ne sw flow directions in addition it was hypothesized that young groundwater less than 50 years would travel along the topographical flow line this is in good agreement with the results inferred from the modelled groundwater ages here three groundwater flow regimes can be delineated fig 13 the first flow regime is the piston flow model that occurs in deep groundwater recharge zones high cfcs and sf6 values are present implying the circulation of young groundwater ages in the middle of the basin the exponential flow model occurs characterized by mixtures of old water and modern recharged water of different ages the final flow regime is a local flow in a discharge area where there are interactions between the surface water and groundwater over several years this is supported by low sf6 and cfcs concentrations suggesting less recharge of young groundwater in the discharge area gooddy et al 2006 the local flow occurs downstream of the catchment in the southern part where the white volta river flows the mixing process or interaction of the white volta river with the groundwater is consistent with the results of the stable isotopes analysis fig 9 and other studies in northern ghana afrifa et al 2017 bam and bansah 2020 in summary the findings presented in this study show a varying range of groundwater residence times in the granitic aquifer this implies the aquifer has enough storage to accommodate different ages of water which would be helpful for mar water infiltration piloting in the area a successful mar scheme depends on an aquifer having enough storage capacity and hydraulic conductivity the study area experiences water scarcity during the dry season due to the short unimodal rainfall season and high evapotranspiration ghana statistical service 2014 these have led to the drying up of the surface waters as evident in the enrichment of the heavy isotope of these water bodies even though modern recharged waters enter the catchment and can safeguard any short term groundwater withdrawals future water supply remains uncertain mainly from population growth and increasing water demand on this basis managed aquifer recharge can be a good technique to increase agricultural water supply reliability in the region in the future looking at the promising aquifer hydraulic properties and young groundwater ages obtained from this study 6 conclusions this study has underlined the importance of using multi tracers to understand groundwater residence time and recharge patterns of the shallow groundwater in northeastern ghana the granitic aquifer receives diffuse recharge mainly from precipitation with little contribution from the white volta river there is no noticeable link between the groundwater and the ephemeral streams and ponds as these show much enrichment in heavier isotopes groundwater recharge through chloride mass balance cmb ranges from 0 2 to 24 8 average 7 of the average annual precipitation of the area the calibrated steady state model reveals a preferred northeast southwest flow direction which is topographical driven aquifer hydraulic conductivity ranging from 0 2 m day to 10 m day exhibits many heterogeneity values attributed to the weathering and fracturing of the basement rocks the lump parameter model shows different age distributions of very young and old groundwater and some mixing processes the results indicate young biased ages of sf6 relative to the cfcs this suggests terrigenous source enrichment and leaves much in question the effectiveness of using sf6 as a dating tool in the area the conceptual groundwater model describing groundwater flow patterns reveals piston flow exponential mixing and local flow surface water and groundwater interactions despite some uncertainties in the groundwater age interpretations and the methods applied it is believed that this research could be a springboard for future related research outside the region and also the country as a whole credit authorship contribution statement louis boansi okofo

3283,the granitic aquifer of the area under investigation serves as an important source of water supply for the inhabitants however information about groundwater renewability and recharge process has not been defined multi tracers were then applied to determine the residence times and recharge patterns of aquifer systems in this study sulphur hexafluoride sf6 and chlorofluorocarbons cfcs were used to date shallow groundwater in ghana for the first time the tracer concentrations were measured in 38 groundwater wells from 38 sampling sites in northeastern ghana a lump parameter model lpm describing the different age distributions reveals that the groundwater residence times are less than 50 years the sf6 ages obtained were much younger than cfcs an indication of terrigenous source enrichment the young groundwater ages inferred from the dating process indicate modern recharge and this collaborates with the results of the stable isotopes in which there is a direct link between the isotopic composition of the rainfall and the groundwater the results also indicate that the weathered and fractured granitic aquifer in the area enhances rapid and diffuse recharge after precipitation in addition a 3d numerical groundwater model has been developed to simulate groundwater flow under steady state and obtain information on the key aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and recharge rates a comparison of the simulated and observed heads suggests a good match and the developed model can satisfactorily describe groundwater flow in the area a groundwater flow system has been delineated based on the multi tracers sf6 cfc 11 cfc 12 δ18o and the numerical groundwater model the findings of this study will be valuable for water managers and stakeholders to obtain relevant hydrogeological information for improved aquifer resource planning keywords sf6 cfcs northeastern ghana residence time numerical groundwater model lump parameter models lpms 1 introduction investigating which parcel of water enters a groundwater system needs a good understanding of isotopic studies and groundwater age dating iaea 2006 this is essential to know if an aquifer

of land use patterns on water quality toews et al 2016 comprehension of groundwater age dating allows for the prevention of aquifer overexploitation and contamination before it begins kazemi et al 2006 the past decades have witnessed tritium as an effective and consistent dating tool for groundwater due to its concentrations in precipitation arising from natural cosmic radiations and man made thermonuclear tests that started in 1952 zuber et al 2005 kazemi et al 2006 however its application is limited due to declining concentrations in the atmosphere which has made it very challenging to differentiate the tritium levels in groundwater generated by the artificial sources from the natural sources iaea 2006 so far chlorofluorocarbons cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 13 and sulphur hexafluoride sf6 have been at the forefront of dating groundwater thompson et al 1974 oster et al 1996 busenberg and plummer 2000 it is assumed that these compounds behave conservatively when they enter the saturated zone and travel in the direction of groundwater flow the input functions of cfcs are well established and can be used to date post 1945 waters iaea 2006 a fundamental problem with cfc dating is that the mixing ratios are levelling off and have been replaced temporarily by hydrochlorofluorocarbons such as hcf 22 and hcf 134a haase et al 2014 to compensate for the limitation of cfcs sf6 is often used in conjunction with cfcs to date groundwater and reduce ambiguities beyer et al 2014 sf6 is an anthropogenic and stable gas used to date young groundwaters which are less than 50 years busenberg and plummer 2000 sf6 offers advantages such as no contamination from urban and industrial areas and also unaffected by degradation in comparison with cfcs cook and solomon 1997 furthermore sf6 does not sorb easily on organic matter plummer and busenberg 2000 enrichment of sf6 from igneous and metamorphic rocks can complicate groundwater dating which is a pitfall in using this technique busenberg and plummer 2000 an increasing number of studies have successfully carried out groundwater dating using sf6 and cfcs oster et al 1996 busenberg and plummer 2000 gooddy et al 2006 friedrich et al 2013 kagabu et al 2017 gil márquez et al 2020 coralie et al 2021 these studies often used lump parameter models lpms to explain the different age distributions in a groundwater system maloszewski and zuber 1982 jurgens et al 2012 while many advances have been made in groundwater dating in other parts of the world little has been done in africa lapworth et al 2013 for instance kamtchueng et al 2015 used multi tracers cfcs sf6 and cl to assess the origin and recharge mechanism in the lake nyos catchment northwest cameroon masule 2019 used sf6 to date perched aquifers in the okongo area northcentral namibia apparent ages ranging between 1 and 17 years were measured in these aquifers tindimugaya 2008 employed sf6 and cfcs to determine the groundwater residence time of fewer than 22 years in a weathered crystalline aquifer system in uganda the study area selected for this work is a transboundary basin of the white volta river basin of ghana and is being proposed as managed aquifer recharge mar site the mar aims to make water available all year round to counteract the increasing water scarcity that occurs every dry season there are reported cases of low groundwater yields and groundwater overdraft in the white volta river basin martin and van de giesen 2005 snc lavalin inrs 2011 in addition the semi arid nature of the area coupled with the unfavourable weather condition short rainfall season and high evapotranspiration have had dire consequences on the available water resources ghana statistical service 2014 since groundwater is the only reliable water supply in the area for domestic and irrigation purposes quantification of groundwater is needed to ensure a sustainable water supply to achieve this groundwater age dating is being investigated to obtain relevant hydrogeologic data for the mar project and also to understand the hydrogeological processes of the catchment in ghana groundwater age dating using tritium and carbon 14 dating has so far been studied acheampong and hess 2000 snc lavalin inrs 2011 anornu et al 2017 bam and bansah 2020 when compiling this research no available studies on cfcs and sf6 groundwater age dating were seen in the literature this study is a first of its kind in using cfcs ad sf6 to date groundwater in ghana this study aims to investigate the residence time of the groundwater and recharge patterns in the granitic terrain of northeastern ghana using cfcs and sf6 based on the fewer years of sf6 and the low total dissolved solids of the groundwater samples it is hypothesized that a short residence time of young groundwater would exist along the topographical flow line it is also hypothesized that groundwater recharge in the catchment will come primarily from precipitation therefore stable isotopes δ18o and δd were used complementarily to investigate the different sources of groundwater recharge in the area in addition a numerical groundwater flow model was developed to determine the groundwater flow and the key aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate in the basin characterization of the groundwater using the groundwater flow model gas tracer and isotope techniques would go a long way to provide comprehensive information on the aquifer for improved groundwater resources planning the findings will also serve as a guide for future studies outside the study region 2 study area 2 1 location climate and vegetation of the study area the catchment under investigation comprises two administrative areas the garu and tempane formerly combined as the garu tempane district the area is located in the southeastern part of the upper east region of ghana with an approximate land size of 1230 km2 ghana statistical services 2012 it shares a border with the republic of togo to the east to the north by bawku municipality to the south by bunkpurugu yunyoo district and to the west by bawku west district the catchment falls under the white volta river basin of west africa and comprises three sub basins the tamne river basin morago river and biankuri river basins and the white volta river and nahau river basins snc lavalin inrs 2011 several rivers and streams drain the catchment of which the dominant one is the tamne river which lies in the northern part and is a tributary of the white volta river in the southwestern part fig 1 these water bodies support the indigenes who combine livestock rearing with the cultivation of onions watermelons and vegetables ghana statistical services 2012 the topography is flat with surface elevation varying from 156 m to 350 m above sea level the circulation of the intertropical convergence zone itcz that brings dry northeast trade winds harmattan and moist southwest trade winds mainly controls the climate of the area the itcz affects the rainfall amounts and intensity of an area obuobie 2008 the rainy season is unimodal which occurs from may to september followed by a prolonged dry season that extends from october to april issahaku et al 2016 the rainfall amount ranges between 669 8 mm and 1339 4 mm with an annual mean of 935 mm in contrast the highest temperature of 45 is recorded in march and april and the lowest temperature of 12 c is recorded around december with an annual mean temperature of 28 7 c asamoah and ansah mensah 2020 the potential evapotranspiration rate in the white volta river basin has been reported at around 910 mm yr and this exceeds almost all the monthly rainfall rates except in june july and august where the highest rainfall amounts are recorded wrc 2008 the vegetation cover in the area is predominantly open cultivated savannah woodlands consisting of economic trees such as baobabs shea butter and dawadawa snc lavalin inrs 2011 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the catchment is largely underlain by rocks of the tamnean plutonic suite about 80 these are crystalline basement rocks that have intruded the birimian rocks and were formed during the eburnean orogeny of the paleoproterozoic era ca 2150 2070 ma feybesse et al 2006 this deformational stress has resulted in various degrees of fractures and faults within the rocks the tamnean plutonic suites are mainly granitoids composed of biotite tonalite hornblende biotite tonalite minor granodiorite and minor quartz diorite snc lavalin inrs 2011 the voltaian supergroup about 20 lies in the southeastern part of the catchment and consists exclusively of fine grained and locally bedded sandstones from the tossiego formations fig 2 there are small pockets of mesozoic rocks that are typically rich in mafic dyke and dolerite snc lavalin inrs 2011 hydrogeologically the catchment belongs to crystalline basement granitoid complex province and the voltain province the crystalline basement granitoid complex province are aquifers of the tamnean plutonic suite while the voltain province are aquifers of the voltaian supergroup banoeng yakubu et al 2011 dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 the aquifers in the catchment are commonly semi confined and the mode of groundwater occurrence is controlled by structures such as faults and fractures developed from secondary permeability and porosity the variability of the fractures within the rocks depends on the nature aperture degree of weathering and interconnecting spaces in the voltaian province processes such as compaction and cementation have affected the primary porosity of the rocks and thus groundwater generally occurs in the fracture areas and bedding planes carrier et al 2008 snc lavalin inrs 2011 furthermore the average regolith thickness of the voltain province aquifers is relatively thin circa 9 m due to the mixtures of clay quartz and mudstones materials in the area carrier et al 2008 within the crystalline basement granitoid complex province groundwater occurs in the shallow aquifer regolith aquifer and fractured aquifer the shallow aquifer is ephemeral that quickly dries up in the dry season fig 3 shows the available lithological data in the area that were used to construct multiple 3d strip logs this consists of the topsoil laterite silt sandy clay saprolite highly weathered granite saprock moderately to poorly weathered granite and fresh granite the saprolite and saprock layers are made up of the regolith aquifer the fractured aquifer is made up of weathered granitic bedrock with fractures the regolith thickness ranges from 7 8 m to 37 m with an average value of 25 m high quantities of groundwater usually exist in coarse grained granites and fractured quartz veins groundwater yield varies from 0 36 m3 h to 37 m3 h with a mean yield of 4 2 m3 h banoeng yakubu et al 2011 on average the groundwater table in the catchment varies from 12 m to 25 m acheampong 2017 inflow to the aquifers is mainly through recharge from precipitation and to some extent from the white volta river carrier et al 2008 akurugu et al 2020 there is no established groundwater recharge and groundwater flow regime in the area generally groundwater recharge in the white volta basin ranges between 3 4 and 18 4 of the mean annual precipitation of 980 mm obuobie 2008 groundwater flow in the crystalline basement complex is usually northeast to the southwest flow direction akurugu et al 2020 3 methods of study 3 1 water sampling and field extraction of cfcs and sf6 samples groundwater samples were collected at the beginning of the dry season between october and november 2019 from 38 shallow wells after purging and attaining stability of the on site field parameters the field parameters which are electrical conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen o2 and temperature were measured using calibrated multi probe meter pce 1 the pce 1 multi probe meter was rinsed with de ionized water after each measurement at a sampling location to avoid cross contamination bicarbonate was measured in the field using hach digital titrator groundwater was collected for major cations and anions in a clean 50 ml polyethylene bottle the cations were acidified with a few drops of nitric acid hno3 twelve surface water samples ponds streams rivers and the white volta river and 38 groundwater samples were also collected for stable water isotopes of deuterium 2h and oxygen 18 18o all the samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm syringe filter before bottling them for analysis the cfc and sf6 sampling were done in the field following the single bottle method described by usgs iaea 2006 for this method 1l glass bottles were cleaned in the laboratory by flushing them with ultrapure nitrogen gas to remove excess air before transporting them to the field the glass bottle was placed in a container under a borehole and was filled with water from the bottom to the top using a connecting rubber tube the water was allowed to overflow the glass bottle by several litres to remove excess air in and around the glass bottle the bottle was closed with a rubber seal cap inside the container in the next step the water sample was turned down to detect any gas bubbles and where gas bubbles were seen the method was repeated while the bottle was inverted a headspace volume approximately 0 2 l was created by adding nitrogen gas and at the same time taking some of the water using a displacement syringe the addition of nitrogen gas ensures that no outside air contaminates the sample the sample was vigorously shaken in the closed bottle and allowed to settle for some minutes to reach equilibration between the gas headspace and the water the gas was then extracted using two end disposable needles one connected to the 1l glass bottle and the other to a 22 ml glass vial containing ultra pure water a gas tight syringe 30 ml was inserted into the 22 ml glass vial to remove the water from the vial and simultaneously draw the gas from the headspace into the vial precautions were undertaken to avoid contamination with the outside air and the samples were taken in triplicate at each sampling site 3 2 analytical procedure and gas detection analyses for major anions cations and stable water isotopes were analyzed in january 2020 at the hydrogeochemistry laboratory institute of applied geoscience technical university of darmstadt germany in addition the concentration of groundwater ions was analyzed using metrohm 882 compact ion chromatography plus all the 50 samples 38 groundwater and 12 surface water were analyzed for stable isotopes 2h and 18o concentrations using the picarro cavity ringdown spectrometer l2130 i equipped with an auto sample the measured stable isotope concentrations were reported in delta per mil in comparison to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow δ2h 0 0 and δ18o 0 0 with analytical reproducibility of 0 025 for 18o and 0 100 for ẟd 1 δ r sample r vsmow 1 1000 where rsample is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of the sample 18o 16o or 2h 1h and rvsmow is the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of the vsmow 18o 16o or 2h 1h the resulting isotope results were analyzed by plotting them with the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl the sf6 and cfcs concentrations in groundwater were measured by purge and trap system with electron capture detector ecd gas chromatography gc shimadzu 2014 at the department of biotechnology of water treatment laboratory brandenburg university of technology btu cottbus the method described by busenberg and plummer 2000 was adapted and used for this study the analytical setup consists of a mass flow meter mfc aalborg orangeburg usa and a gc composed of four integrated functions an inlet port a column a detector and an evaluation system the inlet port is equipped with a rheodyne 6 port valve supleco usa model 7000 7010 which is connected to a stainless steel column trap 30 cm long from wicom germany gmbh and filled with porapak t 50 80 mesh the rheodyne 6 port valve can be switched to position a load and position b inject in position a the sample is loaded into the trap while in position b the carrier gas flows through the trap and the samples are thus flushed onto the precolumn in the gas chromatography the carrier gas is helium that flows at a constant rate of 30 ml min the column is 1 m long packed with hayesep q 80 100 mesh and placed inside an oven this allows a temperature gradient to be driven it has a starting temperature of 80 c which is kept for 5 mins and the mixture can be heated up to 180 c the gc is equipped with two detectors an electron capture detector ecd for detecting specific tracer gases co2 n2o sf6 and cfcs and a flame ionization detector fid for measuring organic compounds before injection the gas sample in the vial was purged with nitrogen n2 using the mass flow meter and a syringe hamilton switzerland to remove the gas impurities from the glass vials it was fixed to a trap which was placed in a dry ice and ethanol mixture 70 c for 5 mins and the valve was set to position a while in the cold bath the sample was loaded into the stainless steel loop to be injected into the gc via the 6 port valve subsequently the trap was removed and transferred into a heat bath 95 c for 5 mins to release the immobilized tracer while purging was done with n2 gas in a reverse flow of the gas the temperature of the hot and cold bath was measured with the vario mag electronic stirrer mono thermometer next the batch table and detector response on the computer was started finally the valve was turned to position b so that the carrier gas helium directed the tracer into gc before the experiment the gc was calibrated with standards prepared by the technical university of bremen the analytical uncertainty for the sf6 and cfcs gases was about 2 which corresponds to a dating error of 1 year 3 3 theoretical background sf6 and cfcs are purely synthetic compounds that have been introduced into the atmosphere in numerous ways industrial production of cfcs started in 1930 due to the constant use of cfcs in refrigerators air conditions aerosols propellants and blowing agents for plastic foams iaea 2006 the mixing ratios of cfcs are decreasing due to the ratification of the montreal protocol treaty of 1987 designed progressively to halt the commercial use of cfcs and other substances that depletes the ozone sf6 was introduced into the troposphere as gas filled electrical switches in 1953 iaea 2006 busenberg and plummer 2000 since then the atmospheric mixing ratios of sf6 have risen steadily from a background value of 0 05 pptv in 1953 to about 9 pptv at present 2020 the gradual increase of sf6 is due to its low solubility in water and high soil stability mroczek 1997 busenberg and plummer 2000 this makes sf6 an excellent tracer to date young groundwater because accurate dates would be obtained haase et al 2014 cfc mixing ratios in populated urban areas are sometimes above the background atmospheric concentrations making dating problematic in these areas as the waters are contaminated with younger ages iaea 2006 on the other hand sf6 contamination of groundwater is rarely reported in urban areas however concentrations of sf6 in groundwater have been reported to be higher than atmospheric concentrations due to its natural terrigenous origin frequently found in igneous and volcanic rocks busenberg and plummer 2000 several processes can affect the apparent cfc ages of water to become either old or young if not adequately taken into consideration cook et al 1995 examples of the environmental processes that can make groundwater old are sorption hydrodynamic dispersion matrix diffusion and microbial degradation iaea 2006 under anaerobic conditions cfcs are affected by degradation mainly by dechlorination reactions that yield hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfc iaea 2006 laboratory work has proved that sf6 is highly resistant to degradation again the octanol water partition coefficient demonstrates that sf6 partitions into an aqueous solution more easily than cfcs signifying that sorption of sf6 is limited and doesn t sorb easily onto aquifer materials wilson and mackay 1996 plummer and busenberg 2000 the global atmospheric mixing ratios of cfcs and sf6 have been historically measured and reconstructed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration halocarbons naoo as shown in fig 4 by measuring the cfcs and sf6 concentrations in groundwater and comparing them with the historical dates at which the water was introduced into the saturated zone it can be assumed that the solubility of the groundwater sample equilibrates with the atmospheric air at the time of recharge iaea 2006 groundwater dating with sf6 and cfcs is governed by henry s law of solubility the application required some basic assumptions to be made and important of this is the correction of recharge temperature excess air and the thickness of the unsaturated zone the recharge temperature is usually determined by the concentrations of the dissolved gases in water such as n2 ar ne and xe heaton and vogel 1981 and aeschbach hertig et al 1999 since these gases were not measured the recharge temperature for this study was taken from the groundwater temperature which is almost equal to the mean annual air temperature of the area uncertainties in recharge elevation can affect the apparent age of the water the terrain in the study area is very flat and therefore the uncertainty in recharge elevation cannot introduce dating errors iaea 2006 furthermore mostly fractured granites underlie the area where rapid diffuse recharge occurs across all sites carrier et al 2008 bam and bansah 2020 therefore an excess air of 5 cc l was assumed and corrected for measured sf6 concentrations suggested for fractured rocks wilson and mcneill 1997 the average depth to the groundwater table is 9 m carrier et al 2008 based on this the thickness of the unsaturated zone was not corrected because it is assumed the air in the thin unsaturated zone has the same composition as the atmosphere cook and solomon 1997 oster et al 1996 3 4 calculations the concentrations of cfcs and sf6 obtained from the chromatography were converted to the atmospheric partial pressures pptv by employing a solubility function for a given temperature and salinity warner and weiss 1985 bu and warner 1995 bullister et al 2002 the following sets of the equation eqn 2 to 8 were used to define the apparent age of the sample in the first pace the known mixing ratio of the gas injected into the gc was taken the dry partial pressure p of the cfcs sf6 in the headspace of the bottle was computed by subtracting the vapour pressure ph2o from the total atmospheric pressure patm and multiplying the results by the mixing ratio mr 2 p m r p atm p h 2 o subsequently the concentration of cfcs sf6 x in the water of the bottle was calculated using henry s law kh 3 x k h p atm in the next step the number of moles of cfcs sf6 in the water mw was deduced by multiplying both the concentrations of cfcs sf6 and the volume of water v in the bottle 4 mw x v the number of moles mh of the headspace gas was calculated using the ideal gas law 5 mh pv rt the concentration of cfcs sf6 in the original sample concentration in the aquifer was calculated by dividing the total moles headspace water mass of water 6 x recharge mw m h v finally the partial pressure at recharge was calculated using henry s law 7 p recharge x recharge kh 8 m r recharge p recharge p atm s r where sr is the scale ratio i e 1e12 for parts per trillion 3 5 lumped parameter models lpms lump parameter models lpms are pre defined mathematical models of simplified flow geometry that describe the dispersion and mixing of waters in an aquifer małoszewski and zuber 1982 jurgens et al 2012 groundwater sampled in a catchment may constitute different mixed ages with the mean age and residence time considered as one entity however the apparent age of a sample will not be the same as the mean age because the tracers are non linear functions of time cook and herczeg 2012 the lumped parameter models are thus used to compute the relationship between apparent age and the mean residence time the age frequency distribution influences these in the groundwater sampled at a given time using a convolutional integral that adds up the tracer concentrations under a steady state flow condition małoszewski and zuber 1982 cook and herczeg 2012 9 c out t t c in t e λ t t g t t d t where cout the output tracer concentration cin the input tracer t is the transit time of the tracer t sample date e λ t t decay of the radioactive tracers g t t weighting function of the age frequency distribution the calculated mixing ratios pptv of the sf6 and cfcs and the tracer input history of northern hemisphere data contained in the tracerlpm software were used to model and investigate the age distributions of the samples https www usgs gov software tracerlpm three lpms were selected for this study based on the basin hydrogeological characteristics the piston flow model pfm exponential mixing model emm and the binary mixing model bmm małoszewski and zuber 1982 the pfm considers that a parcel of water moves from a recharge zone to a discharge zone in an aquifer neglecting hydrodynamic dispersion or mixing this model is constrained to a catchment where the travel time of the water is short with a high average linear velocity the emm is characterized by a mixture of different water age distributions a full penetrating aquifer with homogenous thickness and recharge that discharges into springs or rivers can be best represented by the exponential mixing model emm the bmm on the other hand involves two models the pfm and the emm and is applicable for screens that traversed multiple aquifers jurgens et al 2012 4 results and interpretation 4 1 physicochemical parameters of the groundwater and surface waters the groundwater temperature values range from 31 1 c to 32 9 c with an average value of 31 9 c whereas the surface water temperature varies from 33 4 c to 35 1 c with a mean value of 34 7 c table1 the groundwater temperature was higher than the recent average annual temperature 29 c of the area suggesting the local geothermal gradient influences the groundwater reiter 2001 all the surface water temperatures were noticeably higher than the groundwater temperature the electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater is within the range of 85 5 μs cm 593 μs cm with an average value of 249 86 μs cm suggesting a low to slightly mineralized water fig 5a the ec values of the surface water were lower than that of the groundwater with values ranging between 72 μs cm and 192 μs cm with an average value of 120 5 μs cm the groundwater in the study area is moderately acidic to moderately alkaline with ph values ranging from 6 25 to 7 93 with a mean of 7 09 the surface water exhibits alkaline conditions with values ranging from 7 58 to 8 65 with a mean value of 8 04 dissolved oxygen concentrations of the groundwater are mostly anoxic with values varying between 0 4 mg l 1 mg l with a mean of 0 57 mg l the surface waters display oxic conditions due to direct exposure to the atmosphere these values range from 4 0 mg l to 5 4 mg l with an average of 4 6 mg l the total dissolved solids tds as shown in fig 5b have values less than 600 mg l suggesting the water could be fresh and young freeze and cherry 1979 the bicarbonate of the groundwater which was measured as alkalinity in the field ranges from 90 23 mg l to 446 3 mg l with a mean of 188 61 mg l the primary source of bicarbonate in groundwater is attributed to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and in soil gases that dissolve in rain and surface water clark 2015 4 2 numerical groundwater flow model a conceptual model has been developed based on groundwater chemistry isotopes and hydraulic heads data of the area conceptualization was done with the help of a map tool contained in the groundwater modeling system software 10 4 aquaveo 2020 the model domain was conceptualized as a single hydrogeological layer at which the model top was defined as a semi confining condition to reflect the hydrogeological condition of the area the bottom of the model was conceptualized as a confining condition since it is an inherently no flow boundary with low permeabilities and hydraulic conductivities anderson et al 2015 a general head boundary ghb was imposed in the model to simulate groundwater flow across the entire boundary coverages for recharge hydraulic conductivity hydraulic head and abstraction were created and incorporated into the model in the next step the conceptual model was converted into a 3d numerical model consisting of a cell centred finite difference usgs modflow 2000 simulation code mcdonald and harbaugh 1998 the model domain of 1200 km2 was discretized into 1000 uniform cells using a finite difference grid with 100 rows and 100 columns to achieve a good model output the modflow was then used to simulate groundwater flow only under steady state conditions because there are no historical water level measurements of the area for transient simulation the steady state condition of the area represents the water levels taken in 2017 in which groundwater flow was assumed to be constant and show equilibrium condition after a long term pumping thirty hydraulic head data table 1 were used for the steady state simulation and a calibration target of 1 m was set for all the wells in the final step calibration was performed in two parts the manual trial and error and automated calibration using the automated parameter estimation pest interface in gms fig 6 1 shows the spatial hydraulic head distribution of the steady state model different groundwater flow paths are also observed due to the fractured nature of the rocks groundwater movement in the area is mainly dictated by secondary porosities and permeabilities developed from the weathering and fracturing dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 the groundwater contours mimic the geology and surface topography of the area where the highest and lowest hydraulic heads are seen in the northern and southern parts respectively this conforms to the assertion that hydraulic heads in aquifers are generally a subdued replica of the topography haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 simulated flow predominantly shows ne sw preferred flow patterns in ghana the ne sw flow patterns have been reported in many studies kesse 1985 yidana et al 2015 this is due to the tectonic and structural deformation of the rocks both local and regional flow systems controlled by structural entities are observed in the study area a plot of simulated and measured field groundwater heads fig 6 2 significantly correlates with a root mean square residual head of 1 11 m this indicates a good match and the simulated flow can be reliably used to represent the hydrogeological conditions of the area the calibrated recharge values obtained range from 5 0 10 3 mm day to 7 5 10 2 mm day which corresponds to 0 19 and 2 9 of the average annual precipitation in the area the recharge values are consistent with values reported by akurugu et al 2020 these low recharge estimates reflect the prolonged dry season and high evapotranspiration of the area the estimated hydraulic conductivity field shows values ranging from 0 2 m day to 10 m day fig 7 the highest hydraulic conductivity values are found in the southwestern parts and this can be explained as enhanced fractures of the rocks that permit rapid vertical groundwater recharge and enough groundwater storage this development indicates a piston flow model with a short groundwater residence time kamtchueng et al 2015 this also ties with low ec and tds values observed in the southwestern part of the area as shown in figs 5a and 5b the surrounding terrains mostly have hk values less than 2 m day which is within the range of literature values for granitic rocks these lowest hydraulic conductivities may be associated with massive rocks and fine particles from the weathering processes which might have filled the interconnecting spaces precluding free circulation of water and allowing rapid lateral flow lapworth et al 2013 addai et al 2016 the groundwater chemistry in this terrain is characterized by varying ec values with the highest concentrations and enriched isotopic values occurring in the northern part the weathered layers in this area may intercept high groundwater concentrations facilitating prolonged residence time resulting in different groundwater ages 4 3 groundwater recharge estimate the groundwater recharge estimation in the area was investigated from the chloride mass balance cmb approach several assumptions are made in using the cmb these are 1 the area is under state 2 chloride does not change in composition acts conservatively in the groundwater along its flow path 3 chloride source is only from precipitation and 4 there is no surface runoff cook et al 2017 if all the assumptions are satisfied then groundwater recharge can be computed using the relation in eqn 10 10 recharge c p c gw p where cp and cgw are chlorides in precipitation and chloride in groundwater respectively and p is the average annual precipitation the average chloride content in precipitation 1 31 mg l was taken from the nearest basin in northern ghana and this was used in the calculation chloride concentrations from 37 wells were used in the computation since one borehole bugri dam view was too low and not included in the analysis based on the annual average precipitation 938 mm year of the area the computed percentage recharge ranges from 0 2 to 24 8 with an average of 7 fig 8 this suggests the fraction of precipitation that enters the unsaturated zone and reaches the groundwater system as effective recharge these values are consistent with cmb values reported by different researchers in the white volta river basin and northern ghana obuobie et al 2012 afrifa et al 2017 akurugu et al 2020 4 4 stable isotopes analysis the monthly isotopic composition of precipitation n 70 measured at dapaong station in northern togo from 2015 to 2019 and integrated into the iaea gnip database was adopted as a local meteoric water line lmwl due to its proximity and similar climatic conditions to the study area the local precipitation has δ2h and δ18o values ranging between 60 39 and 28 15 and 8 93 and 2 91 respectively the positive and negative values recorded can be described as the seasonal changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation this is mainly controlled by the temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation effect in which negative values are typically recorded in the rainy season more negative in july and positive values recorded in the dry season clark and fritz 1997 the regression equation of lmwl is presented in eqn 11 which is consistent with the values obtained by different researchers in northern ghana oteng mensah et al 2014 addai et al 2016 akurugu et al 2020 the global meteoric water line gmwl after craig 1961 is also presented in eqn 12 11 δ 2 h 7 45 δ 18 o 6 48 12 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 the lmwl deviates slightly from the gmwl with a lower slope and intercept of 7 4 and 6 4 respectively this indicates a slight enrichment in heavy isotopes of the lmwl which is caused by the evaporation of the rain droplets at the local scale during the dry season low relative humidity coupled with high rising temperatures is recorded leading to the secondary evaporation of rain droplets in the air a consequence of this leads to a smaller slope less than 8 as observed in eqn 11 relative to the slope of gmwl leibundgut et al 2009 another factor for the modification of the lmwl is the differences in air masses which is the dry continental air mass and maritime air mass from the atlantic ocean that bring seasonal variations in the isotopic composition of precipitation in the area the air masses usually come from the sea and ocean and as they move inland with increasing distance from the ocean a progressive depletion in 18o and 2h is recorded clark and fritz 1997 the area is mainly flat in topography and as such altitude effect has minimal or no consequences on the isotopic composition of precipitation aggarwal et al 2005 4 5 stable isotopes of surface water mixing and evaporative enrichment the 18o composition of the surface waters ranges between 2 99 and 2 74 with an average of 1 33 whereas the δ2h composition shows 15 96 and 17 68 with an average of 8 10 almost all the surface waters are below the gmwl and lmwl indicating evaporation the evaporation produces characteristic enrichment in heavier isotopes along the evaporation line at a lower slope and intercept than the gmwl and lmwl the equation of the surface evaporation line is shown in eqn 13 13 δ 2 h 5 66 δ 18 o 0 59 the surface waters were sampled in november at the driest time of the year and conform to the assertion that surface waters are subjected to modification by evaporative fractionation during the dry season clark and fritz 1997 the effects of the evaporative enrichment of the surface waters tend to have a shallower slope under a high temperature and low relative humidity in the area darling et al 2003 however two of the samples are depleted in heavier isotopes relative to the other surface water samples these are large rivers located in the northwestern part of the area and are tributaries of the white volta which is also depleted as they flow naturally towards the white volta river with trees and vegetation cover they are subjected to minimal evaporation since they are not exposed much to sunlight gampson et al 2017 the samples also fall on the lmwl suggesting precipitation is the primary source of recharge for these surface waters it might be possible that the two samples are affected by kinetic evaporation but the infiltrating rainfall is enough to buffer the isotopic enrichment of the water that is caused by evaporation the two samples are close to the groundwater samples and exhibit a similar pattern to the latter indicating a groundwater discharge into the surface water during summer the surface waters are subjected to evaporation making the surface waters level much lower than the groundwater the groundwater then serves as a baseflow that feeds the surface water leibundgut et al 2009 most surface water samples are positive and shifted to the right side of the evaporation line which suggests significant enrichment in heavier isotopes than the two samples discussed above this enrichment is because most of the samples are from ponds dams and ephemeral streams that are standing waters with slow discharge these have more time to undergo considerable evaporation documented with low deuterium excesses table 2 than the other surface waters furthermore the water from the dams is used for irrigation and the available data suggest no interaction between the irrigated water and the groundwater the intersection points for the surface water evaporation line and the lmwl fig 9 correspond to 15 68 and 2 99 for δ2h and δ18o respectively this indicates the source of the isotopic composition of surface water before undergoing kinetic fractionation when compared to the intersection point values the high variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation may suggest the mixing of diverse isotopic signatures afrifa et al 2017 during evaporation the water vapour in the atmosphere becomes depleted in heavy isotopes due to its low pressure leaving the residual water on the land surface enriched in heavy isotopes this pattern of fractionation processes in the hydrological cycle leads to global and local isotope effects leibundgut et al 2009 the point of intersection also indicates that the surface waters in the catchment are recharged by the precipitation bam and bansah 2020 the isotopic composition of the white volta river flowing in two communities kpinkpan yug and songo guur ranges from 21 84 to 21 75 for δ2h and 2 96 to 2 76 for δ18o these are depleted in heavier isotopes than the surface waters and near the lmwl which could suggest minimal evaporation and a hydraulic connection between the white volta river and the groundwater 4 6 isotopic composition of groundwater the stable isotope composition of the granitic aquifer in the area has 18o values ranging between 4 30 and 2 89 with an average of 3 78 fig 10a whereas the deuterium composition varies between 23 63 and 17 17 with an average of 21 76 fig 10b the groundwater samples have relatively similar isotopic values with an average standard deviation of 0 30 and 0 05 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the seeming homogeneity of the aquifer samples suggests that groundwater recharge possibly comes from similar precipitation events addai et al 2016 the groundwater produces an evaporation line with a regression equation as shown in eqn 14 14 δ 2 h 4 16 δ 18 o 6 03 as illustrated in fig 9 almost all the groundwaters samples are clustered close to the gmwl and lmwl indicates the recharge source is of meteoric origin in addition this suggests that recharge is influenced by local precipitation gat 2010 the groundwater samples are depleted in heavier isotopes relative to the surface waters implying that fractionation does not affect the recharge processes considerably the area has a short rainy season between may to august with virtually no or little rains in the dry season the rains recharging the aquifer carry equilibrium isotopes signals into the groundwater thus explaining the closeness of the groundwater to the lmwl the surface water inflows to the groundwater which is much enriched due to evaporation do not significantly affect the groundwater recharge the data show that there is groundwater surface water interaction where groundwater discharges into the surface water this is in line with the regional hydrogeology knowledge that the exchange is constrained to groundwater discharging into the surface waters because the aquifer samples do not plot substantially under the lmwl rey et al 2018 groundwater recharge occurs through joints and fractures in the weathered granitic rocks resulting from secondary porosity of the underlying bedrock carrier et al 2008 these structures may receive high preferential flow from rainfall thus precluding surface pounding causing significant evaporation even though the area is found in a semi arid dry climatic zone where there are high evaporation and greater interception of plants before groundwater recharge the isotopic data of the groundwater do not support this hypothesis jasechko et al 2014 4 7 relationship between chloride and stable isotopes the relationship between δ18o and cl was examined to understand the sources of groundwater salinity and recharge areas in the aquifer system chloride and oxygen 18 are conservative tracers that aid in understanding the evaporation process before groundwater recharge bam and bansah 2020 in principle evaporation occurs when chloride and δ18o concentrations increase an event where chloride ion increases without a corresponding enrichment in δ18o will imply a dissolution of chloride salts such as halite in the unsaturated portion the plot of δ18o and cl fig 11 follows this trend in which most groundwater samples are clustered together without a significant increase in cl concentration from 0 3 mg l to 16 98 mg l whereas the δ18o values tend to increase slightly from 4 40 to 2 89 this trend cannot be related to halite dissolution since no halite salts have been reported to exist in the area it is therefore suggested that the possible source of chloride is precipitation which carries an equilibrium chloride signal into the groundwater the anomalous high chloride concentrations 25 mg l and 42 mg l can be attributed to anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer application or cattle rearing in the area that might contaminate the groundwater bam and bansah 2020 4 8 groundwater residence time and mixing sulphur hexafluoride sf6 and chlorofluorocarbons cfc 12 cfc 11 concentrations in the groundwaters are presented in part per trillion by volume pptv as shown in table 2 this ensures that the measured concentrations are comparable with the northern hemisphere atmospheric curves and avoid local recharge variations iaea 2006 the results show that most sf6 and cfcs samples are in equilibrium with the northern hemisphere air mixing ratios twenty six percent of the samples have no concentrations or are below detection limits and few samples exceed the recent air water equilibrium concentrations possibly indicating contamination iaea 2006 furthermore the average ages of the groundwater modelled for piston flow pfm exponential mixing emm and binary mixing emm indicate modern waters are less than 30 years a plot of cfc 12 against cfc 11 shows that most of the samples agree with the piston flow model fig 12 a this indicates that infiltration in the catchment occurs in pronounced recharge sources and travels towards the discharge source a well without mixing or dispersion conversely some samples are found around and on exponential mixing emm curves suggesting water mixing within the borehole jurgens et al 2012 the samples found on the bmm line suggest a binary mixture of young waters diluted with old cfc free waters samples plotted outside the model curves indicate degradation or contamination of cfcs the low dissolved oxygen concentrations 0 5 mg l in most of the analyzed groundwater samples table 1 imply a degradation of cfcs particularly cfc 11 under anaerobic conditions oster et al 1996 iaea 2006 cfc 11 appears to be biased old relative to cfc 12 in almost all the analyzed samples table 2 and such instances indicate degradation according to deipser and stegmann 1997 cfc 11 degrades almost 16 fold more than cfc 12 in addition the study area is far from an urban area and landfill sites and as such anthropogenic inputs may have little influence on the age determination therefore the possible source of cfcs contamination may be introduced during sampling and the sampling materials in contact with the outside air reynolds et al 1990 as shown in fig 12a almost all the samples are found between 1990 and 2007 representing modern recharge waters with few samples between the early and mid 1980s and one sample in the mid 1970s based on the analysis presented above cfc 12 is considered more stable and reliable in the dating process showing age ranges between 5 42 years with an average age of 24 years whereas cfc 11 has age ranges between 14 44 years with an average age of 28 years it must be noted that the post 1995 levelling of cfcs gases makes it largely uncertain to date groundwaters recharged in the last decades plummer et al 1998 a cross plot of sf6 versus cfc 12 and sf6 versus cfc 11 are presented in fig 12b and fig 12c respectively it can be seen that the majority of the samples are plotted outside the curve suggesting cfc reduction and contamination busenberg and plummer 2000 lapworth et al 2013 again few samples are scattered around the pfm bmm and emm lines and therefore cannot represent any of the flow regimes the modelled sf6 ages range from 5 years to 32 years with an average age of 15 years these ages were younger than the modelled cfcs ages and can be explained as anoxic biodegradation at the discharge point oster et al 1996 another reason is the additional inputs of sf6 derived from the granitic rocks in the catchment busenberg and plummer 2000 terrigenous enrichment of sf6 in granitic areas is usually invoked to account for the additional and high inputs of sf6 in groundwater this is evident in some communities such as napadi yapala dusbuliga and kogri which have elevated sf6 concentrations in the groundwater there is no agreement between the sf6 and cfcs model ages as the water in the catchment is characterized by different groundwater ages the aquifer in the area is mainly fractured granite where diffuse flow systems occur in all parts therefore groundwater pumped from the aquifer may constitute apparent ages affected by mixing shapiro 2002 iaea 2006 5 conceptual model of groundwater recharge and flow mechanisms the weathered granitic aquifer studied is largely heterogeneous and conditioned by different flow patterns multi tracers investigations coupled with the steady state flow model and ec of the groundwater collaborate with the data and study hypothesis the similar isotopic signatures of the groundwater close to the lmwl support the hypothesis that recharge in the area is primarily from rainfall with little contribution from surface waters water infiltration from high elevations occurs diffusely and rapidly via fractures and pores in the shallow aquifer where low mineralized water low ec and tds and short residence time are pronounced in recharge areas as groundwater transits towards discharge areas increasing residence time and high mineralized groundwater are observed based on the numerical model surface topography dictates groundwater flow with preferred ne sw flow directions in addition it was hypothesized that young groundwater less than 50 years would travel along the topographical flow line this is in good agreement with the results inferred from the modelled groundwater ages here three groundwater flow regimes can be delineated fig 13 the first flow regime is the piston flow model that occurs in deep groundwater recharge zones high cfcs and sf6 values are present implying the circulation of young groundwater ages in the middle of the basin the exponential flow model occurs characterized by mixtures of old water and modern recharged water of different ages the final flow regime is a local flow in a discharge area where there are interactions between the surface water and groundwater over several years this is supported by low sf6 and cfcs concentrations suggesting less recharge of young groundwater in the discharge area gooddy et al 2006 the local flow occurs downstream of the catchment in the southern part where the white volta river flows the mixing process or interaction of the white volta river with the groundwater is consistent with the results of the stable isotopes analysis fig 9 and other studies in northern ghana afrifa et al 2017 bam and bansah 2020 in summary the findings presented in this study show a varying range of groundwater residence times in the granitic aquifer this implies the aquifer has enough storage to accommodate different ages of water which would be helpful for mar water infiltration piloting in the area a successful mar scheme depends on an aquifer having enough storage capacity and hydraulic conductivity the study area experiences water scarcity during the dry season due to the short unimodal rainfall season and high evapotranspiration ghana statistical service 2014 these have led to the drying up of the surface waters as evident in the enrichment of the heavy isotope of these water bodies even though modern recharged waters enter the catchment and can safeguard any short term groundwater withdrawals future water supply remains uncertain mainly from population growth and increasing water demand on this basis managed aquifer recharge can be a good technique to increase agricultural water supply reliability in the region in the future looking at the promising aquifer hydraulic properties and young groundwater ages obtained from this study 6 conclusions this study has underlined the importance of using multi tracers to understand groundwater residence time and recharge patterns of the shallow groundwater in northeastern ghana the granitic aquifer receives diffuse recharge mainly from precipitation with little contribution from the white volta river there is no noticeable link between the groundwater and the ephemeral streams and ponds as these show much enrichment in heavier isotopes groundwater recharge through chloride mass balance cmb ranges from 0 2 to 24 8 average 7 of the average annual precipitation of the area the calibrated steady state model reveals a preferred northeast southwest flow direction which is topographical driven aquifer hydraulic conductivity ranging from 0 2 m day to 10 m day exhibits many heterogeneity values attributed to the weathering and fracturing of the basement rocks the lump parameter model shows different age distributions of very young and old groundwater and some mixing processes the results indicate young biased ages of sf6 relative to the cfcs this suggests terrigenous source enrichment and leaves much in question the effectiveness of using sf6 as a dating tool in the area the conceptual groundwater model describing groundwater flow patterns reveals piston flow exponential mixing and local flow surface water and groundwater interactions despite some uncertainties in the groundwater age interpretations and the methods applied it is believed that this research could be a springboard for future related research outside the region and also the country as a whole credit authorship contribution statement louis boansi okofo

3284,accurate characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity k is essential for understanding groundwater flow and contaminant transport processes deep learning based ensemble smoother methods have proven to be effective in estimating non gaussian k fields by assimilating hydrodynamic measurements however traditional hydrogeological investigations e g hydraulic tomography often suffer from the limited number of invasive borehole data e g hydraulic head making the non gaussian k inversion problem strongly underdetermined as a non invasive and high sampling density geophysical approach the self potential sp method can measure fluctuations of the electrical field caused by subsurface fluid movement thus the recorded sp signals are electro kinetic responses of the groundwater flow and can provide complementary information for delineating non gaussian heterogeneity in this paper we performed a joint hydrogeophysical inversion of hydraulic head and sp data to characterize the non gaussian k field within a deep learning based inversion framework we conducted three synthetic cases in a 3 d non gaussian aquifer with 16 000 unknown k to assess the ability of the proposed joint inversion framework for k imaging by assimilating different types of data the results show that using limited hydraulic head data alone may capture the large scale features of the non gaussian reference field but might lose fine features by integrating the hydraulic head and sp data the non gaussian k field can be reconstructed with an improved accuracy and reduced estimation uncertainty the low cost sp method opens up new opportunities for non gaussian k characterization and fluid dynamic monitoring keywords joint hydrogeophysical inversion non gaussian hydraulic conductivity self potential hydraulic tomography convolutional variational autoencoder 1 introduction numerical modeling has been extensively used in the sustainable management of groundwater and the effective remediation of contaminated aquifers reliable groundwater modeling requires detailed knowledge of subsurface properties such as hydraulic conductivity k gómez hernández et al 2003 zhou et al 2014 maximilian et al 2021 however direct measurements of the relevant parameters are sparse and usually lack spatial representativeness rubin 2003 sassen et al 2012 in addition to these sparse direct measurements indirect observations e g hydraulic head and solute concentration are used to characterize the aquifer structures via stochastic inversion methods two kinds of the stochastic inversion methods have received significant attention over the past years see ghorbanidehno et al 2020 one is the geostatistical approach ga kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 and its variants such as quasi linear geostatistical approach qlga kitanidis 1995 successive linear estimator sle yeh et al 1996 and principal component geostatistical approach pcga kitanidis and lee 2014 their applications in the field of hydraulic tomography ht have been reported in many previous studies e g yeh and liu 2000 illman et al 2009 zha et al 2014 2018 zhao et al 2015 another is the data assimilation method using kalman filtering kf kalman 1960 harvey 1990 in particular the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and its variants such as ensemble smoother es vanleeuwen and evensen 1996 and ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda emerick and reynolds 2013 have been widely applied in many research areas e g hydrogeology petroleum engineering and oceanography chang and zhang 2018 zhang et al 2020 these traditional inversion methods i e both ga and enkf may be most appropriate for gaussian k characterization due to the employed gaussian assumptions or gaussian covariance models zhou et al 2014 kang et al 2021a however in many cases the k field may exhibit non gaussian patterns e g in channelized aquifers of fluvial deposits where several highly contrasting facies coexist zhou et al 2014 directly using traditional inversion methods to estimate a non gaussian k field may fail to produce physically realistic estimates due to a significant deviation of the inherent non gaussian spatial pattern from the assumed gaussian prior distribution bardossy and hoerning 2016 two strategies have been proposed to handle the non gaussianity for data assimilation methods one strategy is based on multiple point statistics mps simulations in which a post processing step is employed to make the posterior parameters preserve the non gaussian properties such as the probability conditioning method pcm jafarpour and khodabakhshi 2011 lan et al 2021 direct sampling ds cao et al 2018 and ensemble pattern enpat search method li et al 2014 although the reliability of such mps based methods has been demonstrated they may be computationally expensive hu and chugunova 2008 laloy et al 2018 mo et al 2020 another strategy is to parameterize the non gaussian k fields into latent gaussian distributed variables i e a pre processing step such as gaussian anamorphosis also referred to as normal score transform zhou et al 2011 schoeniger et al 2012 li et al 2018 optimization based principal component analysis o pca vo and durlofsky 2014 and discrete cosine transform dct jung et al 2017 these methods parameterize geological models in different ways but each has its own limitations for example with little or no hard data o pca shows limited ability to deal with complex geomodels because it entails a post processing of the pca model which uses a point wise histogram transformation emerick 2017 liu et al 2019 more recently deep learning methods have emerged in subsurface inverse modeling and were shown to outperform traditional parameterization methods with respect to the quality of generated realizations the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction and the applicability to prior distributions out of the mps framework chan and elsheikh 2017 laloy et al 2017 liu et al 2019 for instance laloy et al 2017 demonstrated that the convolutional variational autoencoder cvae deep neural network was superior to pca o pca and dct in producing high quality geological model realizations due to these advantages applications of deep learning based parameterization methods have grown very fast in the past few years e g laloy et al 2017 2018 canchumuni et al 2019 canchumuni et al 2021 bao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 kang et al 2021a kang et al 2021b while the aforementioned deep learning based methods can effectively handle the non gaussian k field most of the relevant studies relied solely on hydrogeological measurements from invasive boreholes e g hydraulic head and solute concentration laloy et al 2017 2018 canchumuni et al 2019 mo et al 2020 vu and jardani 2022 however the acquisition of these measurements is time and labor consuming leading to a limited number of observations for data assimilation with limited data the inversion may fail to reproduce the channelized pattern of conductivities e g kang et al 2019 fortunately non intrusive and low cost geophysical methods can serve as an additional information source for subsurface characterization in the past decade geophysical methods have been widely used in estimating k fields with a gaussian distribution such as electrical resistivity tomography ert irving and singha 2010 pollock and cirpka 2012 jardani et al 2013 camporese et al 2015 and self potential sp jardani et al 2013 soueid ahmed et al 2014 2016a b kang et al 2020 nevertheless few studies have attempted to apply geophysical methods to characterize the non gaussian k field zovi et al 2017 used inverted ert images as conditioning data to provide channel shape size and position information for the initial guess of aquifer parameters gottschalk et al 2017 incorporated both lithological data and ert data into mps simulations and they concluded that ert data are beneficial for non gaussian k imaging kang et al 2019 characterized the non gaussian hydraulic conductivity field by joint inversion of tracer concentration and time lapse ert data all these works were based on the ert method however in real world conditions ert surveys might suffer from petrophysical uncertainty between hydraulic conductivity and resistivity resulting in low resolution conductivity mapping revil et al 2017b 2020 linde et al 2017 compared with ert sp is a passive geophysical method and can be performed directly based on pumping tests if a sp survey is conducted together with harmonic hydraulic tomography hht e g cardiff et al 2013 the useful sp information can be separated from ambient noise via signal processing techniques see soueid ahmed et al 2016a to reduce the uncertainty the sp method involves measuring the natural electrical potential signals at a batch of measurement points usually at the ground surface or in boreholes with non polarizing electrodes which are connected to a high impedance 10 mω and a high sensitivity 0 1 mv multichannel voltmeter revil and jardani 2013 sp signals are highly sensitive to groundwater flow since subsurface fluid movement generates an electrical current known as the streaming current that is responsible for sp anomalies as a consequence the sp method is attractive for real time monitoring of groundwater flow dynamics e g linde et al 2007 jardani et al 2009 revil and jardani 2013 revil et al 2017a soueid ahmed et al 2020 utilizing the high sensitivity of sp signals to groundwater flow soueid ahmed et al 2016a integrated sp and hht data via a geostatistical method to improve the characterization of a gaussian distributed k field however the non gaussianity of a k field may pose a great challenge for geostatistical inversions zhou et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge none of the previous studies have investigated the capability of the sp method to characterize a non gaussian k field in this paper we presented the first attempt to characterize the non gaussian channelized k field by conditioning on both hydraulic head and sp measurements within the developed joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework the cvae esmda i e convolutional variational autoencoder ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation method was utilized for non gaussian data assimilation based on a synthetic 3 d heterogeneous aquifer three numerical experiments that incorporate different sources of data were conducted to verify our proposed joint inversion framework we compared the non gaussian k fields estimated from hht alone and from the integration of hht and sp by performing a series of transient pumping injection tests we also tested the predictive capabilities of the estimated k fields in terms of flow and tracer transport 2 methodology in section 2 1 we introduce the forward models of hydraulic heads and sp signals sections 2 2 and 2 3 briefly describe the parameterization method cvae and the inversion scheme es mda respectively a summary of the joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework is presented in section 2 4 2 1 forward modeling in this section we present the governing equations of hydraulic heads and sp signals since sp anomalies arise due to subsurface fluid movement the groundwater flow forward model should be solved first and then the self potential model can be solved based on the calculated flow velocity both the groundwater flow model and the self potential model were solved in comsol multiphysics multiphysics 1994 2 1 1 groundwater flow model assuming the porous media is heterogeneous the governing equation of three dimensional transient saturated groundwater flow with external sources sinks can be described as follows bear 1972 1 s s h t k h q where s s is the specific storage m 1 h is the hydraulic head m t is the time s denotes the divergence operator denotes the gradient operator k is the hydraulic conductivity m s and q represents sources and sinks per unit volume s 1 due to the pumping injection tests eq 1 is subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 2 h h 0 at t 0 3 h h d at γ d 4 n k h 0 at γ n where h 0 is the initial head m h d is the constant head at dirichlet boundaries denoted by γ d m and n represents the outward unit vector normal to neumann boundaries denoted by γ n in this work we used a harmonic pumping source for hydraulic tomography i e hht the pumping rate q is given by the expression below 5 q q 0 cos 2 π t t where q 0 denotes the peak of the volume flow rate s 1 and t is the period s hht is an efficient approach to characterize subsurface hydraulic parameters and its advantages include 1 no net injection or extraction of water is produced during aquifer tests and 2 the measurements are easier to separate from noise with prior known frequencies more details about hht can be found in cardiff et al 2013 and soueid ahmed et al 2016a 2 1 2 self potential model for the sp forward model the total flux of electrical charges in a porous medium is represented by the current density j a m2 which can be expressed as the summation of the conductive current density and the source current density sill 1983 jardani et al 2007 6 j j c j s 7 j c σ φ 8 j s q v q where j c is the conductive current density that can be derived from ohm s law a m2 j s is the source current density a m2 σ represents the electrical conductivity of the porous medium s m φ is the electrical potential v q denotes the darcy velocity given by q k h m s and q v denotes the effective charge density dragged by the groundwater flow c m3 the parameter q v can be related to the intrinsic permeability using the following empirical model jardani et al 2007 jougnot et al 2012 revil 2017 9 log 10 q v 9 2 0 82 log 10 k where k m2 is the intrinsic permeability that can be converted from the hydraulic conductivity k by k ρ g k η where ρ and η denote the density and dynamic viscosity of the pore water respectively by combining eqs 6 8 and the continuity equation for the electrical charge expressed by j 0 sill 1983 the classical equation of the self potential φ field can be obtained 10 σ φ q v q which is subject to the following boundary conditions 11 φ 0 at γ d 12 n σ φ q v q 0 at γ n 2 2 convolutional variational autoencoders cvae ensemble based data assimilation approaches typically rely on gaussian assumptions bardossy and hoerning 2016 canchumuni et al 2021 maximilian et al 2021 rendering them unsuitable for non gaussian field estimations therefore a deep generative model was constructed in this work to parameterize the non gaussian k field and generate realizations with complex spatial patterns found in the training data as a popular generative model the variational autoencoder vae kingma and welling 2014 is a variant of the standard autoencoder ae on the one hand the vae retains the network structure of the standard ae so that it can reconstruct fields with complex distributions on the other hand the vae has an extra layer used to sample the latent vector z as illustrated in fig 1 and an extra term in the loss function that ensures the generation of a continuous and easy to interpolate latent space canchumuni et al 2019 during the training process of a vae the input is encoded as vectors of means μ and log variance ln σ 2 rather than directly encoded as the latent vector z then a random vector z is drawn from the standard normal distribution n 0 i and utilized to generate the latent vector z i e z μ σ z where the symbol denotes the elementwise product after training new realizations can be generated from the decoder by sampling z n 0 i one limitation of the traditional vae is that its neural network is based on fully connected layers which may result in a large number of trainable network parameters for this reason we utilized convolutional neural networks cnns within the vae structure i e cvae cnns can greatly reduce the trainable parameters due to their sparse connectivity and parameter sharing properties e g mo et al 2020 jardani et al 2022 they are especially suitable for image processing since they enforce a local connectivity pattern between neurons of two adjacent layers to exploit the spatially local correlation of the data goodfellow et al 2016 gu et al 2018 the schematic architecture of a cvae is shown in fig 1c for more details on the cvae see canchumuni et al 2019 and kang et al 2021a 2 3 ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda we used es mda as an inverse scheme to estimate the non gaussian k field the es mda can be viewed as an iterative version of the es emerick and reynolds 2013 unlike a single and potentially large gauss newton correction performed in es reynolds et al 2006 multiple smaller corrections in the ensemble are performed in es mda by inflating the data error covariance matrix during iterations to improve data matches emerick 2016 evensen 2018 the number of iterations n i and the inflation coefficient of each iteration α l l 1 2 n i should be predefined under the rule that the reciprocal sum of the inflation coefficients is equal to one i e l 1 n i 1 α l 1 the update equation of es mda for the l th iteration can be written as 13 z i l 1 z i l c yd c dd α l c d 1 d i obs d i l i 1 2 n e 14 c yd 1 n e 1 i 1 n e z i l z l d i l d l

and i denotes the i th realization z i l 1 and z i l are the updated parameters from the current and previous iterations respectively specifically for the first iteration l 1 z i l is the initial guess of the model parameters d i l is the simulated data i e the model output from the previous estimation step based on z i l d l and z l are the ensemble mean of the simulated data and model parameters respectively c yd denotes the cross covariance matrix between the model parameters z l and the predicted data d l c dd denotes the covariance matrix of d l c d denotes the auto covariance matrix of the measurement errors d i obs is the perturbed observation with noise of α l c d 2 4 joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework with cvae esmda in this study we intended to verify the advantages of adding sp data to hht for non gaussian k imaging to effectively integrate these two datasets we developed a joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework with cvae esmda see fig 2 first train the cvae network with a set of non gaussian facies realizations after training the cvae can parameterize the original high dimensional non gaussian k field into a low dimensional gaussian distributed latent vector z then the latent vector z is used as the parameter to be estimated within the es mda inversion instead of the original non gaussian k field second produce the initial guess of latent vectors by sampling from the standard gaussian distribution and reconstruct the corresponding non gaussian fields through the cvae decoder third evaluate the groundwater flow and self potential forward models see eqs 1 4 9 12 to obtain the simulated hydraulic head and sp data finally iteratively update the latent vectors z using es mda until the last iteration the posterior hydraulic conductivity fields can be reconstructed through the cvae decoder using the posterior z 3 numerical experiment 3 1 synthetic aquifer to evaluate the advantage of adding sp data in characterizing the non gaussian k field we considered a synthetic channelized confined aquifer see fig 3 that was discretized into 40 40 10 16 000 gridblocks with the size of each block being 1 m 1 m 1 m the k field was assumed to share the same pattern with the rock facies two facies were considered as shown in fig 4 the channels and the surrounding background region represent the high permeability preferential pathway and the low permeability material respectively for high permeability channels the value of k was set to 10 m d whereas the k value of the background media was set to 0 4 m d such k settings are representative of a conceptual model where sandy channels are embedded in fine grained silt or clay floodplain deposits li et al 2018 the reference true distribution of geological facies is illustrated in fig 4b c the reference image was obtained by randomly cropping from a large training image the way we generate the reference k field will be described in detail in section 3 2 the spatial distributions of specific storage ss and electrical conductivity σ were also assumed to be unknown and in line with facies and their values within each facies were predetermined therefore during the inversion process the spatial distribution of facies was first estimated and then these unknown parameter e g k ss fields could be reconstructed by filling facies with the corresponding parameter values the parameter values used in the simulation are summarized in table 1 to weaken the influence of boundary conditions on the hydraulic and electrical signals the domain of interest is surrounded by an immense homogenous buffer zone with constant hydraulic parameters and electrical conductivity for the groundwater flow modeling the top and bottom sides of the buffer domain are impermeable to flow the sides at x 180 m and x 220 m are defined as constant head boundaries with h 28 m and h 20 m respectively the resulting hydraulic gradient in the research domain is approximately 0 006 which is commonly met in the field e g bilbrey and shafer 2001 no flux boundary conditions are imposed at the remaining sides of the buffer domain the initial head is set to 20 m for the entire aquifer hydrogeophysical experiments i e hht and sp are performed after the flow achieves steady state for the sp modeling insulation boundary conditions are assigned to the top side of the buffer domain the remaining sides of the buffer domain are set as zero potential boundaries 3 2 cvae architecture and training the architecture of the cvae network is described in table s1 in the supporting information for the cvae architecture diagram see fig 1c the input data of the network are facies images where the channel and background correspond to values of 1 and 0 respectively instead of using fully connected layers we utilized 3 d fully convolutional layers in this work to link convolutional output to the latent space to reduce the number of trainable parameters the encoder was composed of six convolutional layers whereas the decoder had a mirror symmetric architecture of the encoder with deconvolutional layers a softmax activation function was used in the last layer of the decoder for facies classification so that the output was composed of two facies probability images for each pixel the facies type with higher probability was chosen as the reconstructed facies in the final output image e g canchumuni et al 2019 the training set for the cvae network was generated by cropping 40 40 10 patches from the 340 200 80 training image shown in fig 4a downloaded from https www trainingimages org training images library html a total of 53 856 facies realizations were obtained by using a uniform cropping stride of 1 1 1 among them 48 380 samples were used for training and the remaining samples were used as testing samples to verify the cvae performance the reference field fig 4b c was randomly selected from the test samples the reconstruction accuracy of the cvae was evaluated using the following expression 16 y 1 1 g s n i 1 s n j 1 g x ij rec x ij ori where y represents the reconstruction accuracy of the cvae g is the total number of gridblocks i e 16 000 in this work sn is the size of the training or testing set and x ij ori and x ij rec denote the facies value 0 or 1 at the j th pixel of the i th sample before and after the cvae reconstruction respectively through a little trial and error the dimension of the latent vector z was specified as 500 to acquire a desirable reconstruction accuracy of the cvae based on the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 with a learning rate of 0 0003 and a batch size of 32 the training process took approximately 7 560 s on an nvidia tesla v100 gpu for 120 epochs the used hyperparameter values i e learning rate batch size and epoch were determined by trial and error one can also determine these hyperparameters by using hyperparameter optimization methods such as sherpa lars et al 2020 to improve the model performance after training the cvae s decoder was combined with es mda for data assimilation the cvae esmda retains the computational advantage of es mda while allowing for the physically realistic representation of the k field via the cvae parameterization and without violating the gaussian assumption of es mda the integration of cvae and es mda can improve the characterization of non gaussian k fields only at the additional one time cost of training the deep neural network in the es mda inversion process the ensemble size was set to 500 the number of iterations was specified as four and the inflation coefficients α l l 1 2 3 4 were set to 9 33 7 4 and 2 respectively as recommended in emerick and reynolds 2013 3 3 generation of monitoring data to obtain characterization data of the aquifer eleven boreholes were considered each of them has eight sampling ports at depths of z 1 2 8 m with 1 m spacing three wells marked with blue circles in fig 3b were not used in the inversion phase and were only used for the cross validation of head predictions 100 nonpolarizable electrodes were placed 0 4 m below the ground surface and 64 nonpolarizable electrodes were installed at the sampling ports of eight wells that were used for inversion the reference electrode was placed in the zone not affected by the flow tests we conducted a set of harmonic pumping injection tests in the case study eight harmonic stimulations were performed successively at the pumping injection ports shown in fig 3a with t 60 s and q 0 5 s 1 for simplicity we only simulated the periodic aquifer response of 60 s we monitored the variations of hydraulic heads at all ports of the aquifer every 10 s except those in the well of being used for harmonic stimulation additionally the sp anomalies induced by the harmonic pumping tests were simultaneously recorded with 100 surface based and 64 borehole based electrodes in this way we obtained a total of 2 688 head and 7 488 sp data from eight sets of hht tests the measurements were generated by adding gaussian white noise with standard deviations of 0 1 m and 0 1 mv soueid ahmed et al 2016b respectively to the head and sp data simulated by the forward model with the reference k field three cases were designed to verify the advantages of integrating the low cost sp data with the hydraulic head data see table 2 in case 1 we used only the hydraulic heads to estimate the non gaussian k field in case 2 we considered only the sp data for the inversion in case 3 both the hydraulic head and sp measurements were utilized 4 results 4 1 parameterization of non gaussian conductivity fields the reconstruction accuracies calculated with eq 16 for the cvae training and testing datasets are 0 9086 and 0 9108 respectively fig 5 illustrates three k realizations randomly chosen from the testing set along with the corresponding cvae reconstructed images and histograms of the latent variables recalling the reconstruction process of the cvae the encoder parameterizes the high dimensional non gaussian k image into low dimensional gaussian distributed latent variables z and these latent variables are then fed to the decoder to generate the reconstructed image the result shows that the trained cvae can successfully reproduce the spatial patterns of channels furthermore the generated latent variables roughly followed the standard normal distribution using these normally distributed latent variables as the parameter to be estimated one can perform data assimilation without violating the gaussian assumption in es mda fig 5 also shows three realizations of facies in the fourth column of the figure that are randomly generated by the decoder of the cvae with the latent variables sampled from n 0 i the result illustrates that the trained cvae s decoder was capable of generating physically realistic facies realizations that honored the channelized patterns observed in the training realizations in summary cvae can serve as an effective parameterization tool for non gaussian inversion additionally it reduces the dimension of unknowns from 16 000 to 500 which significantly reduces the computational cost of the inversion process 4 2 hydraulic conductivity characterization fig 6 displays the ensemble mean one randomly chosen posterior realization and the ensemble variance of the ln k fields estimated by using different types of datasets fig 7 shows the residual ln k fields between the posterior mean and the reference field the prior ensemble considering no conditioning data is also shown for comparison purposes more realizations of the prior and posterior ensembles can be found in fig s1 in the supporting information the mean of hydraulic conductivities through the initial ensemble tended to be a constant value over the research domain as expected because the probability of generating the high permeability channel and the low permeability background in the same pixel was equal in addition the ensemble variance achieved an extremely high level since no measurements were conditioned when using the hydraulic heads in the inversion case 1 the estimated ln k fields preserved the channelized pattern similar to the reference however due to the limited number of piezometers using head data alone may fail to capture the small scale features of the reference field for example the reproduced channel structure within the black dot box in fig 6 only provided a smooth and vague estimation losing the detailed characteristics of the reference in addition the uncertainty map of case 1 showed a high uncertainty in the near surface region e g x 20 m and y 20 m which can be a consequence of insufficient head measurements in this region for the residual map of using hht alone the second row of fig 7 the residual at z 9 m was relatively larger than the residual at z 2 m indicating that the hht method failed to reproduce the ln k field near the ground surface at a high resolution this is due to the limited number of hht sensors near the ground surface in case 2 we utilized the sp measurements alone to estimate the ln k field similar to case 1 the ln k fields estimated from case 2 reconstructed the main pattern of the reference field while losing some fine heterogeneity features however owing to the dense sensors installed at the ground surface lower uncertainty was displayed near the ground surface in case 2 which was especially obvious in the region of x 20 m and y 20 m fig 7 demonstrates that the residual at the lower part of the aquifer see residual at z 2 m in case 2 was larger than that in case 1 probably due to the low resolution of sp data for the upper part of the aquifer sp can produce better estimates of the non gaussian ln k field the residual at z 9 m was significantly diminished in case 2 this is also attributed to the high density of sp electrodes installed at the ground surface by which a higher sensitivity was achieved in the shallow area of the aquifer the results demonstrate that the sp technique can achieve an estimate comparable to that from hht alone on account of the low cost and non invasive nature of the sp survey one can consider this method when invasive hydrogeological measurements are not allowed e g no observation wells in case 3 the hydraulic head and sp measurements were integrated to improve the non gaussian k imaging considering the importance of the initial guess i e prior ensemble to the ensemble based inversion methods we utilized a few posterior realizations from cases 1 and 2 to help accelerate the convergence in case 3 joint inversion and improve the estimation accuracy specifically twenty posterior realizations of the latent vectors z were taken from case 1 and case 2 respectively to replace the same number of prior realizations of case 3 to provide a good starting point for the es mda such a strategy is useful in highly non linear inversion problems e g wen and chen 2005 chang et al 2021 in case 3 the estimated ln k fields reproduced the reference field with a higher resolution compared with using a single dataset i e cases 1 and 2 for instance the detailed channelized pattern within the black dotted box in fig 6 was well recovered when integrating multi source data the advantage of joint inversion can also be verified by the residual ln k field fig 7 shows that for case 3 the residual was reduced remarkably in both the shallow and deep regions of the aquifer the improvement demonstrates that the head and sp data are complementary to each other consistent with the finding in soueid ahmed et al 2014 that the sensitivity maps of hydraulic conductivity to head and sp measurements display different patterns moreover the corresponding estimation uncertainty i e ensemble variance was obviously reduced compared with using a single dataset this is because 1 utilizing the complementarity of information provided by the two datasets can better constrain the inversion and reduce the uncertainty in both shallow and deep regions 2 a better initial ensemble is used in case 3 to avoid redundancy we only showed the estimation of hydraulic conductivity since all the unknown parameters share the same spatial pattern of heterogeneity the estimation results of the specific storage field can be found in the supporting information see fig s2 to further compare the performance of different datasets we introduced a quantitative metric the normalized root mean square error nrmse to assess the accuracy of the estimated ensemble mean ln k fields the nrmse is defined as follows 17 nrmse 1 n u i 1 n u ln k e i ln k r i ln k max ln k min 2 where n u is the number of gridblocks k e i and k r i are the ensemble mean and reference value of hydraulic conductivity in the i th gridblock respectively k max and k min are the hydraulic conductivity values of the channel and background respectively the nrmses for all cases are tabulated in table 2 consistent with previous results cases 1 and 2 had close nrmse values while case 3 joint inversion showed the lowest nrmse indicating that a better characterization of the k field can be achieved when assimilating both the hydraulic head and sp data all the computation was performed in parallel on a workstation with eight core 2 6 ghz cpu and 32 gb ram the computational costs of different cases during the inversion were tabulated in table 3 note that the main computational time of the inversion phase was spent by the iterative runs of forward models the cvae s decoder only took about 1 s to reconstruct the parameter fields i e map from low dimensional z to high dimensional channelized k field in addition to looking at the characterization performance we also tested the predictive capability of the estimated k fields in reproducing the hydraulic heads from the three validation wells see fig 3 the cross validation results are shown in fig 8 the predicted hydraulic heads in case 3 had the lowest rmse in matching the reference heads demonstrating that through the joint inversion of multi source datasets one can better predict the fluid dynamics with the improved k imaging 4 3 solute transport prediction tracer transport experiments were conducted to further test the predictive capability of the estimated k fields like the groundwater flow and self potential problem comsol multiphysics was used for the tracer transport modeling the conservative tracer was uniformly released for 100 days at the side of x 0 m of the research domain see fig 3 with the source concentration being 100 mg l the simulation time was set to 500 d the parameters used for tracer transport are shown in table 1 for each posterior k realization estimated from using different datasets i e cases 1 2 and 3 we evaluated the tracer transport forward model to derive the corresponding concentration fields the ensemble mean of plume distributions at z 5 m after 100 150 and 200 days for the initial fields and three cases are illustrated in fig 9 the fourth column of fig 9 depicts the residual fields between the predicted and reference concentration fields at t 150 d note that the tracer plume predicted from the initial guess migrated with uniform morphology displaying no decent features of the reference concentration fields in contrast the tracer plumes predicted from cases 1 3 can reflect the reference concentration distribution to different extents when using a single dataset cases 1 and 2 the pattern of the reference concentration fields was roughly reproduced but the fine architecture of the plumes was missed for instance large residual regions e g blue and red areas in residual concentration fields were still exhibited in cases 1 and 2 in comparison when considering both hydraulic head and sp data the plume distributions were better predicted and only a few small residuals remained the outperformance of joint inversion was also verified in later periods t 300 400 and 500 days as shown in fig s3 in the supporting information fig 10 shows the breakthrough curves btcs of tracer concentration at two points predicted by using the reference and estimated conductivity fields the coordinates of points 1 and 2 are 25 32 8 m and 15 15 5 m respectively the concentration btcs at more points together with their positions are illustrated in fig s4 and fig s5 in the supporting information the uncertainty of the evolution of tracer concentrations through the initial ensemble was quite large since the initial realizations of conductivity fields were unconditional after incorporating the measurements the spread of predicted concentrations was greatly reduced when using a single dataset i e cases 1 and 2 one can recover the main pattern of the btcs but cannot reproduce all the fine features of the btcs e g the peak concentration values and the peak arrival time a relatively large spread or uncertainty of concentrations still appeared surrounding the peak location by integrating hydraulic head and sp data one can capture all the important features of the concentration btcs e g the overall shape the peak concentration value and the peak arrival time overall the results of tracer transport further demonstrate that the sp method is indeed promising for characterizing complex non gaussian subsurface aquifers along with predicting the flow and transport processes 5 discussion in this work we proposed to leverage the sp method to improve the reconstruction of the non gaussian k field compared with hydraulic tomography ht the sp survey is low cost non intrusive and easy to implement despite all these advantages this hydrogeophysical technique should be applied as a complement instead of a replacement although the ht is relatively expensive and labor intensive on account of the requirement of borehole drilling studies have shown that valuable information of the k heterogeneity is carried in the transient hydraulic heads and one should always take into account the assimilation of head measurements if available xu et al 2013 when the subsurface heterogeneity is relatively weak e g long correlation length using ht alone may reasonably characterize the k field with a limited number of aquifer tests and piezometers e g yeh and zhu 2007 huang et al 2011 for a highly heterogeneous k field e g the non gaussian k field in this work a large number of aquifer tests and piezometers are required for ht to fully resolve the fine features of the k field for instance li et al 2019 performed 20 aquifer tests and recorded head observations from 90 ports to reconstruct a complex non gaussian k field such a number of aquifer tests and observation ports are not always available at many real world sites when using limited head data ht may roughly capture the main pattern of the k field but fail to recover the small scale structures see the results of hht in fig 6 in this case i e complex k and limited data adding sp data may help constrain the complex k inversion problem and improve the characterization this is because the information on k heterogeneity contained in hydraulic heads and sp signals is complementary soueid ahmed et al 2016b kang et al 2020 to tackle the non gaussian k inversion problem previous studies have adapted the traditional geostatistical approaches by utilizing the knowledge of geological structure for parameter zonation e g soueid ahmed et al 2015 tso et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 zha et al 2017 consequently the estimation accuracy of the adapted geostatistical approaches relies primarily on the quantity and quality of prior geological information however in real world conditions the quantity and quality of borehole lithological data or other geological information may be limited in this case the adapted geostatistical approaches may not reconstruct the spatial pattern of a complex non gaussian k field e g the sharp changes between different facies in contrast when borehole data are limited or the prior geological structure suffers from significant uncertainty deep learning based methods are more appropriate since it can well consider this uncertainty by using a diverse set of images as training datasets e g jiang and jafarpour 2021 in other words through learning from the geological continuity models i e training images deep learning based methods can well handle any kind of non gaussian k field even if the prior geological information is limited finally our cases considered that the target aquifer extended to the ground surface where the surface based electrodes were installed to collect the sp data at most real sites the confined layer may be located at a certain depth below the ground surface with the increase of aquifer depth sp signals received at the ground surface would be expected to weaken to take into account the effect of electrical conductivity of the upper layer on the sp method we made an additional test with a 2 0 m thickness unconfined layer and a 0 5 m thickness impermeable confining unit existing above the original confined aquifer the water table of the unconfined layer was established at a depth of 1 m the upper unsaturated zone was assigned a homogeneous water saturation of 40 and the capillary fringe was assumed negligible almpanis et al 2021 the electrical conductivity of the confining unit the saturated zone and the unsaturated zone were 10 3 s m 10 2 s m and 1 6 10 3 s m soueid ahmed et al 2014 2016a respectively the characterization results of the ln k field of the research domain through the assimilation of different datasets are shown in fig 11 the estimated ln k fields using the head data in the new test showed a similar accuracy to case 1 see their nrmses in table 2 and fig 11 however because the surface electrodes were further away from the position where groundwater flow occurred the accuracy of the estimated ln k fields by incorporating the sp data i e using sp data alone or both head and sp data in the new test slightly reduced compared with the original cases 2 and 3 see the nrmses in table 2 and fig 11 note that despite of the reduced accuracy we can still get good estimates from assimilating the sp data furthermore the advantage of adding the sp data was notable as before in other words the estimated ln k fields via the fusion of head and sp data reproduced the reference field in a higher resolution than using a single dataset the results indicate the sp method can be still effective even if the target aquifer is located at a certain depth below the ground surface 6 conclusion in this work we developed a joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework to characterize the non gaussian k field by assimilating both hydraulic heads and self potential sp signals with a deep learning based inversion method i e cvae esmda the motivation of the proposed framework was to overcome the challenge due to the limited number of observations from traditional hydrogeological surveys e g hydraulic tomography ht specifically we applied the low cost and non intrusive sp method to provide an additional source of information and then integrated ht with sp to improve the non gaussian k imaging three numerical experiments were conducted based on a 3 d non gaussian aquifer to investigate the performance of our joint inversion framework in addition flow and transport predictions were performed to further test the predictive capability of the estimated k fields the results show that the cvae esmda method can successfully assimilate multi source hydrogeophysical datasets while preserving the non gaussian features of the k field e g the continuity within the high permeability regions when using limited hydraulic head measurements one can roughly retrieve the main pattern of the non gaussian k field but may lose finer spatial features by integrating both the head and sp measurements the non gaussian channelized k field can be reproduced with a higher resolution due to the complementary information from hydraulic head and sp measurements with this improved k estimation from the joint inversion one can better predict the groundwater flow and solute transport therefore the sp technique can be used as an efficient complement to the ht method for groundwater inverse modeling in a non gaussian aquifer the employed cvae offered a prior constraint for data fusion to produce physically realistic k realizations that honor the non gaussian attribute in the training image for complex field conditions although the training image can be considered a reasonable depiction of the natural system under investigation small scale geological features may be omitted due to subjective simplifications or generalizations ma 2019 in this case the deep learning based inversion may not reproduce a satisfactory k field that correctly represents the natural system more real field studies

3284,accurate characterization of the spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity k is essential for understanding groundwater flow and contaminant transport processes deep learning based ensemble smoother methods have proven to be effective in estimating non gaussian k fields by assimilating hydrodynamic measurements however traditional hydrogeological investigations e g hydraulic tomography often suffer from the limited number of invasive borehole data e g hydraulic head making the non gaussian k inversion problem strongly underdetermined as a non invasive and high sampling density geophysical approach the self potential sp method can measure fluctuations of the electrical field caused by subsurface fluid movement thus the recorded sp signals are electro kinetic responses of the groundwater flow and can provide complementary information for delineating non gaussian heterogeneity in this paper we performed a joint hydrogeophysical inversion of hydraulic head and sp data to characterize the non gaussian k field within a deep learning based inversion framework we conducted three synthetic cases in a 3 d non gaussian aquifer with 16 000 unknown k to assess the ability of the proposed joint inversion framework for k imaging by assimilating different types of data the results show that using limited hydraulic head data alone may capture the large scale features of the non gaussian reference field but might lose fine features by integrating the hydraulic head and sp data the non gaussian k field can be reconstructed with an improved accuracy and reduced estimation uncertainty the low cost sp method opens up new opportunities for non gaussian k characterization and fluid dynamic monitoring keywords joint hydrogeophysical inversion non gaussian hydraulic conductivity self potential hydraulic tomography convolutional variational autoencoder 1 introduction numerical modeling has been extensively used in the sustainable management of groundwater and the effective remediation of contaminated aquifers reliable groundwater modeling requires detailed knowledge of subsurface properties such as hydraulic conductivity k gómez hernández et al 2003 zhou et al 2014 maximilian et al 2021 however direct measurements of the relevant parameters are sparse and usually lack spatial representativeness rubin 2003 sassen et al 2012 in addition to these sparse direct measurements indirect observations e g hydraulic head and solute concentration are used to characterize the aquifer structures via stochastic inversion methods two kinds of the stochastic inversion methods have received significant attention over the past years see ghorbanidehno et al 2020 one is the geostatistical approach ga kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 and its variants such as quasi linear geostatistical approach qlga kitanidis 1995 successive linear estimator sle yeh et al 1996 and principal component geostatistical approach pcga kitanidis and lee 2014 their applications in the field of hydraulic tomography ht have been reported in many previous studies e g yeh and liu 2000 illman et al 2009 zha et al 2014 2018 zhao et al 2015 another is the data assimilation method using kalman filtering kf kalman 1960 harvey 1990 in particular the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 and its variants such as ensemble smoother es vanleeuwen and evensen 1996 and ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda emerick and reynolds 2013 have been widely applied in many research areas e g hydrogeology petroleum engineering and oceanography chang and zhang 2018 zhang et al 2020 these traditional inversion methods i e both ga and enkf may be most appropriate for gaussian k characterization due to the employed gaussian assumptions or gaussian covariance models zhou et al 2014 kang et al 2021a however in many cases the k field may exhibit non gaussian patterns e g in channelized aquifers of fluvial deposits where several highly contrasting facies coexist zhou et al 2014 directly using traditional inversion methods to estimate a non gaussian k field may fail to produce physically realistic estimates due to a significant deviation of the inherent non gaussian spatial pattern from the assumed gaussian prior distribution bardossy and hoerning 2016 two strategies have been proposed to handle the non gaussianity for data assimilation methods one strategy is based on multiple point statistics mps simulations in which a post processing step is employed to make the posterior parameters preserve the non gaussian properties such as the probability conditioning method pcm jafarpour and khodabakhshi 2011 lan et al 2021 direct sampling ds cao et al 2018 and ensemble pattern enpat search method li et al 2014 although the reliability of such mps based methods has been demonstrated they may be computationally expensive hu and chugunova 2008 laloy et al 2018 mo et al 2020 another strategy is to parameterize the non gaussian k fields into latent gaussian distributed variables i e a pre processing step such as gaussian anamorphosis also referred to as normal score transform zhou et al 2011 schoeniger et al 2012 li et al 2018 optimization based principal component analysis o pca vo and durlofsky 2014 and discrete cosine transform dct jung et al 2017 these methods parameterize geological models in different ways but each has its own limitations for example with little or no hard data o pca shows limited ability to deal with complex geomodels because it entails a post processing of the pca model which uses a point wise histogram transformation emerick 2017 liu et al 2019 more recently deep learning methods have emerged in subsurface inverse modeling and were shown to outperform traditional parameterization methods with respect to the quality of generated realizations the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction and the applicability to prior distributions out of the mps framework chan and elsheikh 2017 laloy et al 2017 liu et al 2019 for instance laloy et al 2017 demonstrated that the convolutional variational autoencoder cvae deep neural network was superior to pca o pca and dct in producing high quality geological model realizations due to these advantages applications of deep learning based parameterization methods have grown very fast in the past few years e g laloy et al 2017 2018 canchumuni et al 2019 canchumuni et al 2021 bao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 kang et al 2021a kang et al 2021b while the aforementioned deep learning based methods can effectively handle the non gaussian k field most of the relevant studies relied solely on hydrogeological measurements from invasive boreholes e g hydraulic head and solute concentration laloy et al 2017 2018 canchumuni et al 2019 mo et al 2020 vu and jardani 2022 however the acquisition of these measurements is time and labor consuming leading to a limited number of observations for data assimilation with limited data the inversion may fail to reproduce the channelized pattern of conductivities e g kang et al 2019 fortunately non intrusive and low cost geophysical methods can serve as an additional information source for subsurface characterization in the past decade geophysical methods have been widely used in estimating k fields with a gaussian distribution such as electrical resistivity tomography ert irving and singha 2010 pollock and cirpka 2012 jardani et al 2013 camporese et al 2015 and self potential sp jardani et al 2013 soueid ahmed et al 2014 2016a b kang et al 2020 nevertheless few studies have attempted to apply geophysical methods to characterize the non gaussian k field zovi et al 2017 used inverted ert images as conditioning data to provide channel shape size and position information for the initial guess of aquifer parameters gottschalk et al 2017 incorporated both lithological data and ert data into mps simulations and they concluded that ert data are beneficial for non gaussian k imaging kang et al 2019 characterized the non gaussian hydraulic conductivity field by joint inversion of tracer concentration and time lapse ert data all these works were based on the ert method however in real world conditions ert surveys might suffer from petrophysical uncertainty between hydraulic conductivity and resistivity resulting in low resolution conductivity mapping revil et al 2017b 2020 linde et al 2017 compared with ert sp is a passive geophysical method and can be performed directly based on pumping tests if a sp survey is conducted together with harmonic hydraulic tomography hht e g cardiff et al 2013 the useful sp information can be separated from ambient noise via signal processing techniques see soueid ahmed et al 2016a to reduce the uncertainty the sp method involves measuring the natural electrical potential signals at a batch of measurement points usually at the ground surface or in boreholes with non polarizing electrodes which are connected to a high impedance 10 mω and a high sensitivity 0 1 mv multichannel voltmeter revil and jardani 2013 sp signals are highly sensitive to groundwater flow since subsurface fluid movement generates an electrical current known as the streaming current that is responsible for sp anomalies as a consequence the sp method is attractive for real time monitoring of groundwater flow dynamics e

integrated sp and hht data via a geostatistical method to improve the characterization of a gaussian distributed k field however the non gaussianity of a k field may pose a great challenge for geostatistical inversions zhou et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge none of the previous studies have investigated the capability of the sp method to characterize a non gaussian k field in this paper we presented the first attempt to characterize the non gaussian channelized k field by conditioning on both hydraulic head and sp measurements within the developed joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework the cvae esmda i e convolutional variational autoencoder ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation method was utilized for non gaussian data assimilation based on a synthetic 3 d heterogeneous aquifer three numerical experiments that incorporate different sources of data were conducted to verify our proposed joint inversion framework we compared the non gaussian k fields estimated from hht alone and from the integration of hht and sp by performing a series of transient pumping injection tests we also tested the predictive capabilities of the estimated k fields in terms of flow and tracer transport 2 methodology in section 2 1 we introduce the forward models of hydraulic heads and sp signals sections 2 2 and 2 3 briefly describe the parameterization method cvae and the inversion scheme es mda respectively a summary of the joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework is presented in section 2 4 2 1 forward modeling in this section we present the governing equations of hydraulic heads and sp signals since sp anomalies arise due to subsurface fluid movement the groundwater flow forward model should be solved first and then the self potential model can be solved based on the calculated flow velocity both the groundwater flow model and the self potential model were solved in comsol multiphysics multiphysics 1994 2 1 1 groundwater flow model assuming the porous media is heterogeneous the governing equation of three dimensional transient saturated groundwater flow with external sources sinks can be described as follows bear 1972 1 s s h t k h q where s s is the specific storage m 1 h is the hydraulic head m t is the time s denotes the divergence operator denotes the gradient operator k is the hydraulic conductivity m s and q represents sources and sinks per unit volume s 1 due to the pumping injection tests eq 1 is subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 2 h h 0 at t 0 3 h h d at γ d 4 n k h 0 at γ n where h 0 is the initial head m h d is the constant head at dirichlet boundaries denoted by γ d m and n represents the outward unit vector normal to neumann boundaries denoted by γ n in this work we used a

period s hht is an efficient approach to characterize subsurface hydraulic parameters and its advantages include 1 no net injection or extraction of water is produced during aquifer tests and 2 the measurements are easier to separate from noise with prior known frequencies more details about hht can be found in cardiff et al 2013 and soueid ahmed et al 2016a 2 1 2 self potential model for the sp

typically rely on gaussian assumptions bardossy and hoerning 2016 canchumuni et al 2021 maximilian et al 2021 rendering them unsuitable for non gaussian field estimations therefore a deep generative model was constructed in this work to parameterize the non gaussian k field and generate realizations with complex spatial patterns found in the training data as a popular generative model the variational autoencoder vae kingma and welling 2014 is a variant of the standard autoencoder ae on the one hand the vae retains the network structure of the standard ae so that it can reconstruct fields with complex distributions on the other hand the vae has an extra layer used to sample the latent vector z as illustrated in fig 1 and an extra term in the loss function that ensures the generation of a continuous and easy to interpolate latent space canchumuni et al 2019 during the training process of a vae the input is encoded as vectors of means μ and log variance ln σ 2 rather than directly encoded as the latent vector z then a random vector z is drawn from the standard normal distribution n 0 i and utilized to generate the latent vector z i e z μ σ z where the symbol denotes the elementwise product after training new realizations can be generated from the decoder by sampling z n 0 i one limitation of the traditional vae is that its neural network is based on fully connected layers which may result in a large number of trainable network parameters for this reason we utilized convolutional neural networks cnns within the vae structure i e cvae cnns can greatly reduce the trainable parameters due to their sparse connectivity and parameter sharing properties e g mo et al 2020 jardani et al 2022 they are especially suitable for image processing since they enforce a local connectivity pattern between neurons of two adjacent layers to exploit the spatially local correlation of the data goodfellow et al 2016 gu et al 2018 the schematic architecture of a cvae is shown in fig 1c for more details on the cvae see canchumuni et al 2019 and kang et al 2021a 2 3 ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation es mda we used es mda as an inverse scheme to estimate the non gaussian k field the es mda can be viewed as an iterative version of the es emerick and reynolds 2013 unlike a single and potentially large gauss newton correction performed in es reynolds et al 2006 multiple smaller corrections in the ensemble are performed in es mda by inflating the data error covariance matrix during iterations to improve data matches emerick 2016 evensen 2018 the number of iterations n i and the inflation coefficient of each iteration α l l 1 2 n i should be predefined under the rule that the reciprocal sum of the inflation coefficients is equal to one i e l 1 n i 1 α l 1 the update equation of es mda for the l th iteration can be written as 13 z i l 1 z i l c yd c dd α l c d 1 d i obs d i l i 1 2 n e 14 c yd 1 n e 1 i 1 n e z i l z l d i l d l

advantages of adding sp data to hht for non gaussian k imaging to effectively integrate these two datasets we developed a joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework with cvae esmda see fig 2 first train the cvae network with a set of non gaussian facies realizations after training the cvae can parameterize the original high dimensional non gaussian k field into a low dimensional gaussian distributed latent vector z then the latent vector z is used as the parameter to be estimated within the es mda inversion instead of the original non gaussian k field second produce the initial guess of latent vectors by sampling from the standard gaussian distribution and reconstruct the corresponding non gaussian fields through the cvae decoder third evaluate the groundwater flow and self potential forward models see eqs 1 4 9 12 to obtain the simulated hydraulic head and sp data finally iteratively update the latent vectors z using es mda until the last iteration the posterior hydraulic conductivity fields can be reconstructed through the cvae decoder using the posterior z 3 numerical experiment 3 1 synthetic aquifer to evaluate the advantage of adding sp data in characterizing the non gaussian k field we considered a synthetic channelized confined aquifer see fig 3 that was discretized into 40 40 10 16 000 gridblocks with the size of each block being 1 m 1 m 1 m the k field was assumed to share the same pattern with the rock facies two facies were considered as shown in fig 4 the channels and the surrounding background region represent the high permeability preferential pathway and the low permeability material respectively for high permeability channels the value of k was set to 10 m d whereas the k value of the background media was set to 0 4 m d such k settings are representative of a conceptual model where sandy channels are embedded in fine grained silt or clay floodplain deposits li et al 2018 the reference true distribution of geological facies is illustrated in fig 4b c the reference image was obtained by randomly cropping from a large training image the way we generate the reference k field will be described in detail in section 3 2 the spatial distributions of specific storage ss and electrical conductivity σ were also assumed to be unknown and in line with facies and their values within each facies were predetermined therefore during the inversion process the spatial distribution of facies was first estimated and then these unknown parameter e g k ss fields could be reconstructed by filling facies with the corresponding parameter values the parameter values used in the simulation are summarized in table 1 to weaken the influence of boundary conditions on the hydraulic and electrical signals the domain of interest is surrounded by an immense homogenous buffer zone with constant hydraulic parameters and electrical conductivity for the groundwater flow modeling the top and bottom sides of the buffer domain are impermeable to flow the sides at x 180 m and x 220 m are defined as constant head boundaries with h 28 m and h 20 m respectively the resulting hydraulic gradient in the research domain is approximately 0 006 which is commonly met in the field e g bilbrey and shafer 2001 no flux boundary conditions are imposed at the remaining sides of the buffer domain the initial head is set to 20 m for the entire aquifer hydrogeophysical experiments i e hht and sp are performed after the flow achieves steady state for the sp modeling insulation boundary conditions are assigned to the top side of the buffer domain the remaining sides of the buffer domain are set as zero potential boundaries 3 2 cvae architecture and training the architecture of the cvae network is described in table s1 in the supporting information for the cvae architecture diagram see fig 1c the input data of the network are facies images where the channel and background correspond to values of 1 and 0 respectively instead of using fully connected layers we utilized 3 d fully convolutional layers in this work to link convolutional output to the latent space to reduce the number of trainable parameters the encoder was composed of six convolutional layers whereas the decoder had a mirror symmetric architecture of the encoder with deconvolutional layers a softmax activation function was used in the last layer of the decoder for facies classification so that the output was composed of two facies probability images for each pixel the facies type with higher probability was chosen as the reconstructed facies in the final output image e g canchumuni et al 2019 the training set for the cvae network was generated by cropping 40 40 10 patches from the 340 200 80 training image shown in fig 4a downloaded from https www trainingimages org training images library html a total of 53 856 facies realizations were obtained by using a uniform cropping stride of 1 1 1 among them 48 380 samples were used for training and the remaining samples were used as testing samples to verify the cvae performance the reference field fig 4b c was randomly selected from the test samples the reconstruction accuracy of the cvae was evaluated using the following expression 16 y 1 1 g s n i 1 s n j 1 g x ij rec x ij ori where y represents the reconstruction accuracy of the cvae g is the total number of gridblocks i e 16 000 in this work sn is the size of the training or testing set and x ij ori and x ij rec denote the facies value 0 or 1 at the j th pixel of the i th sample before and after the cvae reconstruction respectively through a little trial and error the dimension of the latent vector z was specified as 500 to acquire a desirable reconstruction accuracy of the cvae based on the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 with a learning rate of 0 0003 and a batch size of 32 the training process took approximately 7 560 s on an nvidia tesla v100 gpu for 120 epochs the used hyperparameter values i e learning rate batch size and epoch were determined by trial and error one can also determine these hyperparameters by using hyperparameter optimization methods such as sherpa lars et al 2020 to improve the model performance after training the cvae s decoder was combined with es mda for data assimilation the cvae esmda retains the computational advantage of es mda while allowing for the physically realistic representation of the k field via the cvae parameterization and without violating the gaussian assumption of es mda the integration of cvae and es mda can improve the characterization of non gaussian k fields only at the additional one time cost of training the deep neural network in the es mda inversion process the ensemble size was set to 500 the number of iterations was specified as four and the inflation coefficients α l l 1 2 3 4 were set to 9 33 7 4 and 2 respectively as recommended in emerick and reynolds 2013 3 3 generation of monitoring data to obtain characterization data of the aquifer eleven boreholes were considered each of them has eight sampling ports at depths of z 1 2 8 m with 1 m spacing three wells marked with blue circles in fig 3b were not used in the inversion phase and were only used for the cross validation of head predictions 100 nonpolarizable electrodes were placed 0 4 m below the ground surface and 64 nonpolarizable electrodes were installed at the sampling ports of eight wells that were used for inversion the reference electrode was placed in the zone not affected by the flow tests we conducted a set of harmonic pumping injection tests in the case study eight harmonic stimulations were performed successively at the pumping injection ports shown in fig 3a with t 60 s and q 0 5 s 1 for simplicity we only simulated the periodic aquifer response of 60 s we monitored the variations of hydraulic heads at all ports of the aquifer every 10 s except those in the well of being used for harmonic stimulation additionally the sp anomalies induced by the harmonic pumping tests were simultaneously recorded with 100 surface based and 64 borehole based electrodes in this way we obtained a total of 2 688 head and 7 488 sp data from eight sets of hht tests the measurements were generated by adding gaussian white noise with standard deviations of 0 1 m and 0 1 mv soueid ahmed et al 2016b respectively to the head and sp data simulated by the forward model with the reference k field three cases were designed to verify the advantages of integrating the low cost sp data with the hydraulic head data see table 2 in case 1 we used only the hydraulic heads to estimate the non gaussian k field in case 2 we considered only the sp data for the inversion in case 3 both the hydraulic head and sp measurements were utilized 4 results 4 1 parameterization of non gaussian conductivity fields the reconstruction accuracies calculated with eq 16 for the cvae training and testing datasets are 0 9086 and 0 9108 respectively fig 5 illustrates three k realizations randomly chosen from the testing set along with the corresponding cvae reconstructed images and histograms of the latent variables recalling the reconstruction process of the cvae the encoder parameterizes the high dimensional non gaussian k image into low dimensional gaussian distributed latent variables z and these latent variables are then fed to the decoder to generate the reconstructed image the result shows that the trained cvae can successfully reproduce the spatial patterns of channels furthermore the generated latent variables roughly followed the standard normal distribution using these normally distributed latent variables as the parameter to be estimated one can perform data assimilation without violating the gaussian assumption in es mda fig 5 also shows three realizations of facies in the fourth column of the figure that are randomly generated by the decoder of the cvae with the latent variables sampled from n 0 i the result illustrates that the trained cvae s decoder was capable of generating physically realistic facies realizations that honored the channelized patterns observed in the training realizations in summary cvae can serve as an effective parameterization tool for non gaussian inversion additionally it reduces the dimension of unknowns from 16 000 to 500 which significantly reduces the computational cost of the inversion process 4 2 hydraulic conductivity characterization fig 6 displays the ensemble mean one randomly chosen posterior realization and the ensemble variance of the ln k fields estimated by using different types of datasets fig 7 shows the residual ln k fields between the posterior mean and the reference field the prior ensemble considering no conditioning data is also shown for comparison purposes more realizations of the prior and posterior ensembles can be found in fig s1 in the supporting information the mean of hydraulic conductivities through the initial ensemble tended to be a constant value over the research domain as expected because the probability of generating the high permeability channel and the low permeability background in the same pixel was equal in addition the ensemble variance achieved an extremely high level since no measurements were conditioned when using the hydraulic heads in the inversion case 1 the estimated ln k fields preserved the channelized pattern similar to the reference however due to the limited number of piezometers using head data alone may fail to capture the small scale features of the reference field for example the reproduced channel structure within the black dot box in fig 6 only provided a smooth and vague estimation losing the detailed characteristics of the reference in addition the uncertainty map of case 1 showed a high uncertainty in the near surface region e g x 20 m and y 20 m which can be a consequence of insufficient head measurements in this region for the residual map of using hht alone the second row of fig 7 the residual at z 9 m was relatively larger than the residual at z 2 m indicating that the hht method failed to reproduce the ln k field near the ground surface at a high resolution this is due to the limited number of hht sensors near the ground surface in case 2 we utilized the sp measurements alone to estimate the ln k field similar to case 1 the ln k fields estimated from case 2 reconstructed the main pattern of the reference field while losing some fine heterogeneity features however owing to the dense sensors installed at the ground surface lower uncertainty was displayed near the ground surface in case 2 which was especially obvious in the region of x 20 m and y 20 m fig 7 demonstrates that the residual at the lower part of the aquifer see residual at z 2 m in case 2 was larger than that in case 1 probably due to the low resolution of sp data for the upper part of the aquifer sp can produce better estimates of the non gaussian ln k field the residual at z 9 m was significantly diminished in case 2 this is also attributed to the high density of sp electrodes installed at the ground surface by which a higher sensitivity was achieved in the shallow area of the aquifer the results demonstrate that the sp technique can achieve an estimate comparable to that from hht alone on account of the low cost and non invasive nature of the sp survey one can consider this method when invasive hydrogeological measurements are not allowed e g no observation wells in case 3 the hydraulic head and sp measurements were integrated to improve the non gaussian k imaging considering the importance of the initial guess i e prior ensemble to the ensemble based inversion methods we utilized a few posterior realizations from cases 1 and 2 to help accelerate the convergence in case 3 joint inversion and improve the estimation accuracy specifically twenty posterior realizations of the latent vectors z were taken from case 1 and case 2 respectively to replace the same number of prior realizations of case 3 to provide a good starting point for the es mda such a strategy is useful in highly non linear inversion problems e g wen and chen 2005 chang et al 2021 in case 3 the estimated ln k fields reproduced the reference field with a higher resolution compared with using a single dataset i e cases 1 and 2 for instance the detailed channelized pattern within the black dotted box in fig 6 was well recovered when integrating multi source data the advantage of joint inversion can also be verified by the residual ln k field fig 7 shows that for case 3 the residual was reduced remarkably in both the shallow and deep regions of the aquifer the improvement demonstrates that the head and sp data are complementary to each other consistent with the finding in soueid ahmed et al 2014 that the sensitivity maps of hydraulic conductivity to head and sp measurements display different patterns moreover the corresponding estimation uncertainty i e ensemble variance was obviously reduced compared with using a single dataset this is because 1 utilizing the complementarity of information provided by the two datasets can better constrain the inversion and reduce the uncertainty in both shallow and deep regions 2 a better initial ensemble is used in case 3 to avoid redundancy we only showed the estimation of hydraulic conductivity since all the unknown parameters share the same spatial pattern of heterogeneity the estimation results of the specific storage field can be found in the supporting information see fig s2 to further compare the performance of different datasets we introduced a quantitative metric the normalized root mean square error nrmse to assess the accuracy of the estimated ensemble mean ln k fields the nrmse is defined as follows 17 nrmse 1 n u i 1 n u ln k e i ln k r i ln k max ln k min 2 where n u is the number of gridblocks k e i and k r i are the ensemble mean and reference value of hydraulic conductivity in the i th gridblock respectively k max and k min are the hydraulic conductivity values of the channel and background respectively the nrmses for all cases are tabulated in table 2 consistent with previous results cases 1 and 2 had close nrmse values while case 3 joint inversion showed the lowest nrmse indicating that a better characterization of the k field can be achieved when assimilating both the hydraulic head and sp data all the computation was performed in parallel on a workstation with eight core 2 6 ghz cpu and 32 gb ram the computational costs of different cases during the inversion were tabulated in table 3 note that the main computational time of the inversion phase was spent by the iterative runs of forward models the cvae s decoder only took about 1 s to reconstruct the parameter fields i e map from low dimensional z to high dimensional channelized k field in addition to looking at the characterization performance we also tested the predictive capability of the estimated k fields in reproducing the hydraulic heads from the three validation wells see fig 3 the cross validation results are shown in fig 8 the predicted hydraulic heads in case 3 had the lowest rmse in matching the reference heads demonstrating that through the joint inversion of multi source datasets one can better predict the fluid dynamics with the improved k imaging 4 3 solute transport prediction tracer transport experiments were conducted to further test the predictive capability of the estimated k fields like the groundwater flow and self potential problem comsol multiphysics was used for the tracer transport modeling the conservative tracer was uniformly released for 100 days at the side of x 0 m of the research domain see fig 3 with the source concentration being 100 mg l the simulation time was set to 500 d the parameters used for tracer transport are shown in table 1 for each posterior k realization estimated from using different datasets i e cases 1 2 and 3 we evaluated the tracer transport forward model to derive the corresponding concentration fields the ensemble mean of plume distributions at z 5 m after 100 150 and 200 days for the initial fields and three cases are illustrated in fig 9 the fourth column of fig 9 depicts the residual fields between the predicted and reference concentration fields at t 150 d note that the tracer plume predicted from the initial guess migrated with uniform morphology displaying no decent features of the reference concentration fields in contrast the tracer plumes predicted from cases 1 3 can reflect the reference concentration distribution to different extents when using a single dataset cases 1 and 2 the pattern of the reference concentration fields was roughly reproduced but the fine architecture of the plumes was missed for instance large residual regions e g blue and red areas in residual concentration fields were still exhibited in cases 1 and 2 in comparison when considering both hydraulic head and sp data the plume distributions were better predicted and only a few small residuals remained the outperformance of joint inversion was also verified in later periods t 300 400 and 500 days as shown in fig s3 in the supporting information fig 10 shows the breakthrough curves btcs of tracer concentration at two points predicted by using the reference and estimated conductivity fields the coordinates of points 1 and 2 are 25 32 8 m and 15 15 5 m respectively the concentration btcs at more points together with their positions are illustrated in fig s4 and fig s5 in the supporting information the uncertainty of the evolution of tracer concentrations through the initial ensemble was quite large since the initial realizations of conductivity fields were unconditional after incorporating the measurements the spread of predicted concentrations was greatly reduced when using a single dataset i e cases 1 and 2 one can recover the main pattern of the btcs but cannot reproduce all the fine features of the btcs e g the peak concentration values and the peak arrival time a relatively large spread or uncertainty of concentrations still appeared surrounding the peak location by integrating hydraulic head and sp data one can capture all the important features of the concentration btcs e g the overall shape the peak concentration value and the peak arrival time overall the results of tracer transport further demonstrate that the sp method is indeed promising for characterizing complex non gaussian subsurface aquifers along with predicting the flow and transport processes 5 discussion in this work we proposed to leverage the sp method to improve the reconstruction of the non gaussian k field compared with hydraulic tomography ht the sp survey is low cost non intrusive and easy to implement despite all these advantages this hydrogeophysical technique should be applied as a complement instead of a replacement although the ht is relatively expensive and labor intensive on account of the requirement of borehole drilling studies have shown that valuable information of the k heterogeneity is carried in the transient hydraulic heads and one should always take into account the assimilation of head measurements if available xu et al 2013 when the subsurface heterogeneity is relatively weak e g long correlation length using ht alone may reasonably characterize the k field with a limited number of aquifer tests and piezometers e g yeh and zhu 2007 huang et al 2011 for a highly heterogeneous k field e g the non gaussian k field in this work a large number of aquifer tests and piezometers are required for ht to fully resolve the fine features of the k field for instance li et al 2019 performed 20 aquifer tests and recorded head observations from 90 ports to reconstruct a complex non gaussian k field such a number of aquifer tests and observation ports are not always available at many real world sites when using limited head data ht may roughly capture the main pattern of the k field but fail to recover the small scale structures see the results of hht in fig 6 in this case i e complex k and limited data adding sp data may help constrain the complex k inversion problem and improve the characterization this is because the information on k heterogeneity contained in hydraulic heads and sp signals is complementary soueid ahmed et al 2016b kang et al 2020 to tackle the non gaussian k inversion problem previous studies have adapted the traditional geostatistical approaches by utilizing the knowledge of geological structure for parameter zonation e g soueid ahmed et al 2015 tso et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 zha et al 2017 consequently the estimation accuracy of the adapted geostatistical approaches relies primarily on the quantity and quality of prior geological information however in real world conditions the quantity and quality of borehole lithological data or other geological information may be limited in this case the adapted geostatistical approaches may not reconstruct the spatial pattern of a complex non gaussian k field e g the sharp changes between different facies in contrast when borehole data are limited or the prior geological structure suffers from significant uncertainty deep learning based methods are more appropriate since it can well consider this uncertainty by using a diverse set of images as training datasets e g jiang and jafarpour 2021 in other words through learning from the geological continuity models i e training images deep learning based methods can well handle any kind of non gaussian k field even if the prior geological information is limited finally our cases considered that the target aquifer extended to the ground surface where the surface based electrodes were installed to collect the sp data at most real sites the confined layer may be located at a certain depth below the ground surface with the increase of aquifer depth sp signals received at the ground surface would be expected to weaken to take into account the effect of electrical conductivity of the upper layer on the sp method we made an additional test with a 2 0 m thickness unconfined layer and a 0 5 m thickness impermeable confining unit existing above the original confined aquifer the water table of the unconfined layer was established at a depth of 1 m the upper unsaturated zone was assigned a homogeneous water saturation of 40 and the capillary fringe was assumed negligible almpanis et al 2021 the electrical conductivity of the confining unit the saturated zone and the unsaturated zone were 10 3 s m 10 2 s m and 1 6 10 3 s m soueid ahmed et al 2014 2016a respectively the characterization results of the ln k field of the research domain through the assimilation of different datasets are shown in fig 11 the estimated ln k fields using the head data in the new test showed a similar accuracy to case 1 see their nrmses in table 2 and fig 11 however because the surface electrodes were further away from the position where groundwater flow occurred the accuracy of the estimated ln k fields by incorporating the sp data i e using sp data alone or both head and sp data in the new test slightly reduced compared with the original cases 2 and 3 see the nrmses in table 2 and fig 11 note that despite of the reduced accuracy we can still get good estimates from assimilating the sp data furthermore the advantage of adding the sp data was notable as before in other words the estimated ln k fields via the fusion of head and sp data reproduced the reference field in a higher resolution than using a single dataset the results indicate the sp method can be still effective even if the target aquifer is located at a certain depth below the ground surface 6 conclusion in this work we developed a joint hydrogeophysical inversion framework to characterize the non gaussian k field by assimilating both hydraulic heads and self potential sp signals with a deep learning based inversion method i e cvae esmda the motivation of the proposed framework was to overcome the challenge due to the limited number of observations from traditional hydrogeological surveys e g hydraulic tomography ht specifically we applied the low cost and non intrusive sp method to provide an additional source of information and then integrated ht with sp to improve the non gaussian k imaging three numerical experiments were conducted based on a 3 d non gaussian aquifer to investigate the performance of our joint inversion framework in addition flow and transport predictions were performed to further test the predictive capability of the estimated k fields the results show that the cvae esmda method can successfully assimilate multi source hydrogeophysical datasets while preserving the non gaussian features of the k field e g the continuity within the high permeability regions when using limited hydraulic head measurements one can roughly retrieve the main pattern of the non gaussian k field but may lose finer spatial features by integrating both the head and sp measurements the non gaussian channelized k field can be reproduced with a higher resolution due to the complementary information from hydraulic head and sp measurements with this improved k estimation from the joint inversion one can better predict the groundwater flow and solute transport therefore the sp technique can be used as an efficient complement to the ht method for groundwater inverse modeling in a non gaussian aquifer the employed cvae offered a prior constraint for data fusion to produce physically realistic k realizations that honor the non gaussian attribute in the training image for complex field conditions although the training image can be considered a reasonable depiction of the natural system under investigation small scale geological features may be omitted due to subjective simplifications or generalizations ma 2019 in this case the deep learning based inversion may not reproduce a satisfactory k field that correctly represents the natural system more real field studies are required to further explore the applicability and limitations of deep learning methods in subsurface inverse modeling credit authorship contribution statement zheng han investigation data curation
