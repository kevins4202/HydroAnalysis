3100,the cumulative costs associated with frequent small scale flash floods have been calculated for kuala lumpur malaysia to get an insight on damages and losses there is limited information on the impact of frequently occurring small scale events compared to large scale or catastrophic disasters particularly with respect to its overall implications on the economy at the city level such information would support the formulation of effective disaster risk reduction strategies the study evaluated the direct and indirect damage cost of 204 flash floods in kuala lumpur between 2010 and 2016 using a heuristic approach to compensate for data scarcity and drawing on the market price and restoration cost method the assessment relied primarily on secondary data from various government departments and relevant authorities the results revealed that the total flash flood damage was as high as rm48 7 million which represented 0 04 of the gross domestic product gdp of kuala lumpur in 2016 direct costs were associated with damage to roads as well as commercial and residential areas to a lesser extent while loss of productive time was the leading factor for indirect costs indirect damage costs are up to four times higher than direct damages with disrupted road networks being the highest contributor to both costs moving forward risk reduction strategies should focus the transportation sector the findings of this study is useful baseline information for future projection of damages and losses due to small scale flash floods in kuala lumpur keywords damage estimation flash floods small scale disasters disaster risk reduction disaster loss malaysia 1 introduction the frequency and damage due to disasters arising from climate hazards have been increasing over the past decades attary et al 2020 hallegatte 2014 shabnam 2014 one reason for this is the increase in temperature of the earth s surface air and water the continuation of increasing temperature trends is likely to cause further increases in the frequency and intensity of various climate related extreme events runkle et al 2018 ipcc 2021 the risks to densely populated areas are expected to be magnified ipcc 2022 while major and catastrophic disasters with casualties are severe enough to attract attention small scale climate related events are often overlooked despite their higher frequency the cumulative impact of the small scale events merits further investigation especially in urban areas to better understand and implement more efficient risk reduction measures flash floods generally result from intense rainfall dam or levee failure or rapid snowmelt with less than six hours of duration samsuri et al 2018 they are characterized by sudden rise in the water level relatively high velocity large amounts of debris and short duration with high frequency buslima et al 2018 they are mostly unpredictable and may have a detrimental cumulative impact on the affected community flood events with pluvial characteristics have a short duration of about less than six hours with relatively shallow floodwater depths nizam et al 2019 in this study small scale flash floods are defined as short duration events of about less than six hours with shallow depths of flood waters generally less than two meters with limited spatial extent and without associated fatalities the occurrence of flash floods in urban areas are expected to increase with extreme rainfall events due to global warming making it imperative for such localised events be assessed retrospectively and prospectively malaysia is adversely affected by extreme weather events between 1998 and 2018 the country experienced approximately 51 major disasters affecting 3 million people with 281 deaths with total damages estimated at us 2 billion ringgit malaysia rm 8 billion zurairi 2018 floods are the most common disaster in the country yusoff et al 2018 the rapid economic development of kuala lumpur has also contributed to uncontrolled structural development and environmental degradation pereira et al 2010 vaghefi et al 2017 in conjunction with extreme rainfall events this has contributed to increased incidences of flash floods while no fatalities have been reported flash floods have affected the city centre by causing heavy traffic jams and hindering mobility which disrupts daily activities in the city bhuiyan et al 2018a 2018b in the context of those affected the flash floods are disaster events their livelihood is affected and there is massive clean up of impacted areas including repair or replacement of damaged property such as cars appliances and houses the coverage of the impacts of flash floods has been minimal in the literature the cumulative economic costs of frequent small scale events are unknown hence it is largely unclear how these impacts can be evaluated in the future climate related disaster events disrupt various productive activities therefore analysing the costs involved with that disruption and damage is important to build resilience and achieve the goals of a sustainable city the purpose of this study is to provide baseline information on costs associated with frequent small scale flash floods in kuala lumpur the damages and losses associated with 204 flash flood events between 2010 and 2016 in the city will be evaluated the proportionate costs in terms of the city s gross domestic product gdp which has never been reported previously will also be determined the ensuing section presents a review of the literature followed by the methodology that was used in the study this is followed by results and discussion and a final section on the conclusions of this study 2 literature review 2 1 disaster impact assessment framework disaster impacts can be represented by direct and indirect damages and distinguished further with respect to the tangibility and intangibility of the damage elements this approach includes economic and non economic impacts ema 2002 garcia aristizabal and marzocchi 2012 hallegatte 2014 hochrainer stigler 2012 mechler et al 2010 meyer et al 2013 safaie et al 2017 un general assembly 2016 direct and indirect damages are distinguished based on the occurrence time of damage direct contact of the hazard and the location whether in a disaster area or not of the damage the tangibility of the damages is decided based on marketability measurability and monetary value of the affected items hochrainer stigler 2012 jonkman et al 2008 mckenzie et al 2005 in this framework all physical stock monetisable and priceable elements are denoted as tangible they are further classified as direct if the elements were caused by direct contact within the hazard area during the hazard event ema 2002 garcia aristizabal and marzocchi 2012 hochrainer stigler 2012 mechler et al 2010 meyer et al 2013 as well as during the hazard event hallegatte 2014 similarly all affected elements that are not physical not traded in the market unmeasurable and not monetisable are categorised as direct intangible damage the indirect damage elements are those affected due to the consequence of the direct damages of the disaster not necessarily within the hazard area and during the time of the hazard this is supported by the theories that the total direct damage will have a consequential impact that is indirect damage mechler hochrainer 2010 this study conceptualises disaster impacts due to flash floods where such events are considered disasters in the local context specifically for the affected population of kuala lumpur the city s susceptibility refers to its sensitivity to the hazards its vulnerability includes the damageability of the physical elements such as several types of houses i e single story houses landed houses bungalow and multi story buildings with respect to their damage rate road and transportation network clean up costs and traffic congestion related costs including repair and replacement costs the cost and damage rates can differ across land use classes and types of houses and assets for example the cleaning cost of single story houses landed houses in residential areas will differ from the cost for the same type of house in commercial areas as the rates for basic amenities and services are higher for areas classified as commercial 2 2 data scarcity in flash flood damage estimation flash flood impacts differ from place to place in europe between 1950 and 2006 about 40 of the total casualties from all types of disasters arising from natural hazards were due to flash floods barredo 2007 comparatively in malaysia flash floods only caused 3 of the total fatalities from all types of disasters em dat 2020 furthermore fatalities are not associated with small scale flash floods in malaysia bhuiyan et al 2018a however despite very insignificant casualties the risk of social and economic damage may still be significant even though early warning systems have been improved marchi et al 2010 montz and gruntfest 2002 ten veldhuis 2011 in kuala lumpur the adversity associated with flash floods is reflected through physical damage clean up costs mobility disruption and traffic congestion samsuri et al 2018 some of these impacts have further adverse consequences such as delays in getting to work spending more time idly on the road additional fuel cost disruption of daily activities and the opportunity cost of productive work this type of impact which happens due to the direct or immediate destruction or disruption caused by the disaster events is called an indirect impact hallegatte 2014 hochrainer stigler 2012 koks et al 2015 kousky 2014 kreibich et al 2014 meyer et al 2013 safaie et al 2017 un general assembly 2016 many of the indirect impacts are short term losses which may not be measurable by stock losses kajitani and tatano 2018 most flash flood impact studies cover historical events ex post that are severe widespread and involving fatalities or large insurance claims table 1 with respect to damage related information and extent of affected elements the assessments have notable property damage elements and other impact volume i e affecting larger areas higher death toll and larger number of affected people grahn and nyberg 2014 spekkers et al 2011 vozinaki et al 2015 flash floods that cause deaths and injuries are given serious attention and studied with greater urgency li et al 2019 špitalar et al 2014 terti et al 2017 however flash floods have become an important research area due to their wide range of impacts and damage capabilities as well as anticipated increase in frequency and intensity due to global warming looking at the methodological approaches most studies require extensive data and a combination of hydrological information garrote et al 2016 kefi et al 2018 le bihan et al 2016 the required data includes insurance data which has limited accessibility due to privacy policy of insurance companies grahn and nyberg 2014 spekkers et al 2011 digital topographic map flood water depth and flow velocity land use information and simulated flood inundation parameters vozinaki et al 2015 fatalities data flood points event data li et al 2019 špitalar et al 2014 terti et al 2017 population statistics topographic map drainage pattern data land use map damage map and primary survey bari et al 2021 mahmood et al 2016 such a high amount of data may not be available for all cases in reality many developing countries have an extremely limited amount of the relevant information for conventional evaluation therefore approaches that require both primary field survey data and secondary data data collected by third party as well as the incorporation of hydraulic information and depth damage curves have extremely limited applicability when data is scarce as such several impact assessment studies use insurance claims grahn and nyberg 2014 spekkers et al 2011 synthetic flow velocity flood depth crop damage curves vozinaki et al 2015 and hydraulic models for simulating flood damage assessment kefi et al 2018 le bihan et al 2016 vozinaki et al 2015 xia et al 2011 zeng et al 2019 such detailed information is generally available for major flood events or catastrophic flash flood events where the stakeholders record and have access to more useful information although the stage damage functions are well designed the damage results are affected by uncertainties and questionable transferability of the models arnell 1989 cammerer et al 2013 de moel and aerts 2011 büchele kreibich et al 2006 the models and methodologies used in above mentioned studies require integration of hydraulic aspects and physical sciences which may not be possible for small scale events due to insufficient information availability such information is certainly unavailable in the context of malaysian flash floods there is a gap in the literature on damage assessment of flash flood events for which information is limited in addition the usability of these models also becomes limited due to unavailability of specific depth damage or stage damage functions romali et al 2018 therefore this study uses the best available secondary data for calculating the direct and indirect damage related cost of flash floods it contributes to the literature by assessing small scale events which have been largely overlooked and addresses the methodological limitations due to data scarcity by implementing a heuristic approach for assessing disaster damage with limited data availability 3 methodology 3 1 location and description of the study site the study was conducted in the federal territory of kuala lumpur the capital city of malaysia the city is located in the centre of selangor state and covers an area of 243 km2 with an estimated population of 1 79 million as of 2015 department of statistics malaysia official portal 2015 the city hall of kuala lumpur dbkl administers 11 parliamentary constituencies fig 1 there are two major rivers in kuala lumpur the sungai klang and the sungai gombak the rapid pace of development has contributed to the problem clogged drainage in the area around this confluence thus the rivers overflow due to high precipitation and often cause flash floods in low lying areas hong hong 2016 extreme weather conditions such as greater intensity of rainfall is expected to increase in the future this has been supported by drainage and irrigation department did reports that estimated that the one hour rainfall intensity in 2000 2007 period increased by 17 compared to the past ismail et al 2018 3 2 data collection this study used secondary data for calculating the cost of flash flood damages the secondary data include land use classes flash flood maps and damage unit values duvs for different assets and property types such as roads landed single story houses bungalows kampung houses village houses flats apartments terraced houses and commercial buildings however there are no damage and loss value available for industrial buildings factories shops hospitals and schools the damage values of commercial building were used for estimating the cost of these items this was considered acceptable as the buildings are similar and the difference in the damage caused by shallow levels of flood waters over a short duration is expected to be minimal furthermore the majority of areas in kuala lumpur are classified as commercial areas with minimal industrial zones information was also collected on clean up costs for roads rivers drains and parking areas according to the land use classes cleaning costs were estimated based on quoted prices from the cleaning companies that were accepted by dbkl see table 2 for the respective values for indirect tangible costs the number of cars passing through the affected roads vehicle occupancy rate economic time value for kuala lumpur fuel price and vehicle operating cost were used various data points descriptions sources and unit of measurements were used to calculate flash flood damages table 2 the country has specific damage factors for different types of damage to properties and assets for calculating the cost of major flood events did 2012 however these factors cannot be used for small scale flash flood events without information on duration and depth of inundation which is rarely available the flood damage estimation guideline for the country did 2003 indicates that 1 of damage unit values of major floods can be used for flash floods there is no explanation on how the percentage was derived but this is the general assumption by the national government agency in charge of floods this value was adopted to calculate the building damage ratio for different types of houses the building damage ratio is the estimated flash flood damage for each type of structure i e houses commercial block etc the estimated damage value for a house is only a portion of the entire value of the structure the assumption is that flash floods do not destroy an entire house but rather damages it to different degrees depending on the type of house as kampung houses village houses are generally old and made of wood they are more vulnerable and it is expected that the damage will be comparatively higher compared to other houses the land use map of the federal territory of kuala lumpur has the following classes institutional residential trade industry green area and others the institutional land use class includes all institutional areas in the city such as schools colleges universities hospitals and other kinds of institutions the residential land use class includes all housing areas the trade areas include the busiest parts of the city which are characterised by shopping malls mini malls shops and places where business activities are held the industrial land use class includes firms and factories the green areas include parks and land with trees plants and grass the other land use class includes mixed used areas rivers roads and highways the land use map identifies different land classes through colour coding while roads are separate land use class in the map this study divided road damage based on the location of affected roads for example if the affected road is located within residential area that road damage was classified road damage in residential area 3 3 analysing flash flood locations inundated areas and frequencies this study used arcgis software to map the flash flood areas and to identify and count the affected buildings types of houses car parking areas drains and other physical properties using the kuala lumpur land use map the physical properties were differentiated according to land use classes such as residential commercial industrial institutional and other areas flash flood information obtained from the city hall dbkl was used to plot the location of flash floods hot spots points that often experience recurring pluvial flash floods between 2010 and 2017 the spatial extent of the area inundated by flash floods was not available thus an older dataset for the same area was used to estimate the general extent of small scale flash floods the information was obtained from the national flood condition and damage assessment report on flood events from 2000 to 2010 in kuala lumpur which recorded both fluvial and pluvial events did 2012 the task of recording was taken over by the city hall after an underground storm water tunnel smart project started operations to handle major fluvial floods in kuala lumpur while the timeline of flood events did not overlap a high number of the locations where the flood events were recorded in both datasets are identical an indication that the problem of small scale flash floods was not resolved the national dataset recorded approximately 79 flood locations in kuala lumpur many of which were linked to 18 major events the location of 53 flood events was matched in both the datasets and the extent of the corresponding affected area was delineated using information in the national report fig 2 the findings revealed that the average flooded area per location was 10 92 ha which represents the situation before the smart project was in operation when major floods were prevalent in a majority of the locations flood waters do not spread beyond 5 ha and the most frequent extent is 2 ha represented by the mode value based on this estimation 2 ha circular buffer zones were created for each flood location of 2010 to 2016 using the arcgis software to identify and quantify affected assets 3 4 flash flood cost estimation methods this study evaluates the cost of the direct and indirect damages of flash floods utilising the widely used market price and restoration cost approach balbi et al 2015 middelmann fernandes 2010 rayhan and grote 2010 the market price approach determines the value of a property based on the selling price of the property or similar property freeman et al 2014 under this approach relevant prices i e cleaning price fuel price value of time were used after adjusting with inflation by using consumer price index cpi calculator provided by dosm which uses 2010 as base year restoration cost approach values a good and services based on cost incurred for bringing it back to its original state brans 2005 in this approach different damage unit values duvs for different land use classes and property types as well as repair costs have been used in previous literature thieken et al 2007 flash floods in kuala lumpur commonly require clean up activities after the event hence cleaning cost data for different property types were used the property damage and clean up costs are considered as factors of direct costs of damages the direct cost of flash floods was calculated by using duv and cost per unit for each affected element in the flood area this can also be utilised in stage damage function for integrating hydraulic and economic modelling jonkman et al 2008 zabret et al 2018 similar ideas can be implemented by using damage thresholds and unit costs olsen et al 2015 the duvs are collected from did which is the authorised body that deals with flooding issues did 2003 suparta and rahman 2016 using these duvs and different data points in table 2 the physical damage and the resulting costs in different land use classes was computed and summed for calculating the cost of flash flood damages similarly indirect cost of flash flood was estimated by evaluating the secondary effect of flash flood i e road affected by flash flood the secondary effect includes loss of productive time supply related loss and traffic congestion cost which were calculated by using relevant market values such as fuel price value of time and vehicle operating cost 3 4 1 assumptions related to the cost calculation based on the dbkl 2008 city plan there is a drain on each side of the road the drainage length was calculated by measuring both sides of affected roads for estimating the clean up cost for drainage for indirect cost calculation the value of time was used as a proxy for the productivity value relating to time urban flash floods mostly result in traffic congestion and slowdown of mobility resulting in loss of time that could be spent on productive pursuits when the exact duration of disruption is not available studies often consider the duration of the traffic congestion itself for assessing the impact the average traffic congestion due to flash floods was assumed to be two hours similar assumptions were used to study localised floods in haarlem netherlands ten veldhuis 2011 shanghai china yin et al 2016 and malaysia nizam et al 2019 vehicle occupancy for vans and lorries was assumed to be one per vehicle motorcycles cars and buses was assumed to be used by the workforce while vans and lorries were used for delivering and supplying goods and services out of the 66 affected roads vehicle per road data was only available for 25 roads the average value of the 25 roads was used for the remaining roads for which data was unavailable all roads within the buffer zone were considered as affected by flash floods once a road is classified as being affected by flash floods the traffic mobility of the entire stretch of the road leading to and from this zone was considered disrupted 3 4 2 direct physical damage in different land use area the direct physical damage in residential areas is comprised of damage to different types of houses an approach followed in previous studies chiba and prabhakar 2017 the approach to attribute damage unit value for assessing direct physical damage in the commercial area is calculated based on the size of buildings in this approach the structures are divided into three categories small medium and large the road damage was calculated based on total length of road inundated and damage rate per kilometre inundated road did 2012 clean up costs comprise cleaning different types of houses in different land use classes drainage systems and sweeping costs for roads and car parking areas flash flood related clean up costs are implied for different elements affected such as multilevel buildings single story houses landed houses and shops lots where sediment removal cost is included zabret et al 2018 in terms of clean up cost the clean up charges differ on whether the house is a single story landed house and whether the location is a residential or a commercial area the rates are derived from the quotation given to dbkl from cleaning service companies the equation for estimating direct cost of flash floods in a year is presented below equation 1 3 1 dffc s d c c 2 sd σ i 1 n s t i d u v i 3 cc σ s t i s c c i σ

the components of the indirect tangible cost of flash floods calculation are productive time loss lpt goods and services delivery related time loss srl and traffic congestion costs tcc the goods and services related time loss refers to additional time wasted in delivering and supplying goods and services due to traffic delays specifically in terms of vans and lorries the traffic congestion cost refers to the sum of the cost involved for operating vehicles for extra time due to flash flood induced traffic congestion the unit cost value used are shown in table 2 the equations for estimating

sources of uncertainty it should be noted that the estimations of this study have some uncertainties that should be considered while making decision based on these results firstly the assumption of setting 1 of major flood damage values for flash floods is an uncertainty of concern although this percentage is applied for building damages only it has to be considered as a lower bound estimation secondly due to unavailability of inundated area data of flash flood events using average conditions for all flash flood events may further underestimate the costs this will downsize the cost level of all elements including indirect damages as well due to the existence of relatively more congested built up areas and infrastructural facilities in urban areas the cost is expected to be much higher if more severe floods are included in the analysis despite these uncertainties the simplified and conservative method used in this study will still be able to provide useful insights to relevant stakeholders for planning and decision making this study has its limitation for not being able to include various other cost aspects owing to data scarcity for example the latest data on rainfall intensity and duration and several other meteorological and hydrological data were not found for the flash flood events the direct tangible costs could include data on household contents which may be damaged or lost due to flash floods the economic value of damage caused to affected vehicles and the cost incurred by shops and business outlets as well as business interruptions adding these costs factors may increase total direct tangible costs of flash floods significantly 4 results and discussion 4 1 flash flood locations and frequencies flash floods are common in kuala lumpur a majority of the flash floods are located in the central part of the city along the gombak and klang rivers and their major connecting branches fig 3 there are several areas with high density of river networks such as in the eastern and western parts of the city which have not experienced flash floods these high density networks are located in relatively higher ground and have been converted into open concrete drains to service surrounding built up areas as part of the development process the water in these drains flow downward into the connecting branches in the lower terrain which then empty into the gombak and klang rivers many of the connecting branches have also been converted into open drains for adjacent built up areas in some areas the natural channels have been filled and the drains are more narrow that the original waterway the combination of built up areas and conversion of natural channels into concrete drains have impeded the capacity of water infiltration after rainfall in much of kuala lumpur the rapid runoff of water after a heavy rainfall along fewer surface water paths in some areas then accumulates in the relatively lower terrain along the gombak and klang rivers as well as its confluence in the central part of the city resulting in flash floods this issue of reduced infiltration capacity has also been highlighted in previous studies where it is suggested that retaining water for infiltration and preserving water bodies works better than constructing large pipes for ensuring flood safety kefi et al 2018 a total of 204 flash flood events were recorded in kuala lumpur between 2010 and 2016 table 3 the highest number of events occurred in 2016 61 events and the lowest was in 2014 8 events except for 2014 the frequency of flash floods appears to have increased over this period all the events were taken into account in the evaluation of damages and losses 4 2 costs of flash floods 4 2 1 cost of direct flash flood damage the cost of direct damage due to flash floods is presented according to the land use categories in kuala lumpur table 4 the results show that the direct costs in the residential areas exceeded a million ringgit in 2012 2013 and 2016 with rm1450904 rm1273742 and rm2011734 respectively in 2013 2015 and 2016 the direct costs of flash floods in the commercial areas were higher compared to other years with monetary loss of rm 2518816 rm2101084 and rm3759675 respectively the direct cost of flash flood damage was also found in other land use areas in 2015 and 2016 exceeding a million ringgit of damage valued at rm2608061 and rm1096651 respectively table 4 the institutional and industrial areas had lower direct damage this lower damage is attributed to the lesser extent of industrial and institutional areas in kuala lumpur although there are many institutions e g educational buildings and hospitals in the city this land use category had lower damage due to the lesser number of flash floods in these areas the total direct cost increased annually except for 2014 due to the low number of flash floods events in that year table 3 the three highest damage costs due to flash floods were in 2013 2015 and 2016 amounting to rm4121883 rm5819043 and rm8066458 respectively table 4 the direct flash flood damage included road damage due to inundation building damage and clean up activities fig 4 the results showed that residential and commercial areas were leading in road damage fig 4a the commercial areas also had high costs due to road damage in 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 with approximately 69 49 47 61 of total road damage respectively the residential areas had the second highest road damage in most of the years especially in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 with approximately 37 47 31 and 34 of total road damage respectively the third highest rate of road damage were from other land use areas notable road damage years in this land use category were in 2010 20 2014 27 and 2015 46 fig 4a in terms of building damage the residential areas had the leading rate of building damage in 2010 82 2011 60 2013 51 and 2014 81 the commercial areas had the leading rate of building damage in 2015 66 and 2016 52 in 2012 and 2013 the commercial areas had almost equal rates of building damage with residential areas with 44 and 48 of damage respectively fig 4b in terms of cleaning costs the commercial areas had the highest rate of cleaning cost due to flash flood with highest rates in 2011 57 2012 60 2013 73 and 2014 50 the rest of the years also had more than 40 of cleaning costs in commercial areas fig 4c the cleaning cost was higher in the commercial areas due to the higher price rate of cleaning activities for this land use category the building damage fig 4d were expectedly lower as flash floods in kuala lumpur do not usually cause much physical damage due to their lower intensity and magnitude building structure and material related damages are mostly related to the inundation level and its duration as these elements are resistant to short duration floods grahn and nyberg 2014 they expectedly experience less damage from small scale flash floods overall the cost categories were found to be highest in commercial areas followed by residential areas and other land use areas fig 4d in addition costs associated with road damage was the leading category for flash floods in the city a possible reason is that road maintenance is highly expensive and they are also very vulnerable to inundation nizam et al 2019 when a road is repeatedly inundated the strength of the material that is used to make the structure decreases and even gets damaged which involves higher expenditure to restore ghani et al 2016 4 2 2 cost of indirect flash flood damage the results of indirect damage related costs showed that loss of productive time related costs exceeded a million ringgit for all studied years however the costs exceeded rm15 million in 2015 and 2016 amounting to rm19405416 and rm29135955 respectively table 5 the supply related loss and traffic congestion related costs had similar ranges in all years the highest supply related loss were in 2013 2015 and 2016 with values of rm1788534 rm3702375 and rm5488670 respectively similarly the highest traffic congestion related loss occurred in 2013 2015 and 2016 amounting to rm1951618 rm4059560 and rm6010995 respectively high indirect costs occur when small scale pluvial flash floods spatially and temporally reduce the connectivity and accessibility of people yin et al 2016 a large number of people are stuck on the road which cause loss of their productive time additional fuel and vehicle operating related loss pyatkova et al 2019 comparing three indirect cost categories the results show that loss of productive time related cost was the leading source of indirect cost which contributed 70 73 of the annual cost fig 5 in comparison supply related loss and traffic congestion related costs varied between 13 and 15 of contribution during the same period the productive time related costs was higher because the flash floods indirectly affected a large number of people on the other hand although supply related loss had contributed less the delay in services such as delivering goods and services may have further economic consequences therefore these indirect damage aspects demand more careful attention 4 2 3 total flood damage cost a comparison between total direct and total indirect costs indicate that the level of indirect costs is much higher than the direct loss fig 6 the reason is that flash floods directly affect fewer people and cover less area as they are of small scale in nature therefore direct damages are logically lower than indirect costs grahn and nyberg 2014 however flash floods affect a larger number of people by disrupting road networks on which a significantly larger number of people and their productive activities are dependent pyatkova et al 2019 yin et al 2016 as a result while direct flash flood costs hardly exceeded rm5 million fig 5a the indirect costs were always more than rm5 million and even exceeded rm20 million in 2016 fig 6b the results also indicate that the road network was a major part of flash flood damage in terms of both direct and indirect costs the flood inundation related road damage significantly inflated direct damage compared to clean up cost and building damage the reason for lower damage to buildings was due to the lower inundation level and shorter duration however as roads were frequently affected by flash floods and there were more road structures in the study area due to its urban characteristics the road damage was higher the reason for direct and indirect flash flood costs being very high in 2015 and 2016 was due to higher frequency of flash flood occurrences and affected roads in these two years the cost of flash floods was comparatively low in 2010 2011 and 2014 due to two reasons firstly in these years flash flood frequency was low and secondly the number of roads affected by flash flood was comparatively low as well a comparison of total clean up physical damage indirect and total costs fig 7 show that the clean up cost is very negligible compared to the other cost categories the physical damage which included road damage and building damage was also much lower compared to indirect costs in this case the evidence clearly reveals that the indirect cost of flash floods was not only higher but is also increasing flash flood induced traffic congestion affects the work force benjamin 2017 which would induce additional economic cost due to traffic congestion productive time loss and service related loss this has not been accounted for in this study as the major source of indirect tangible loss was traffic congestion and other mobility disruptions policy interventions and adaptation strategies that focus on how to prevent road networks from being inundated and affected indirectly is an important aspect to consider the total damage values of flash floods in kuala lumpur are all below 1 of the gdp of the city table 6 this might seem exceptionally low compared to the damage costs of major floods however as a conservative calculation and associated uncertainties have contributed to a lower bound estimation in this study this could be just the tip of the iceberg moreover flash flood losses may increase in the future if more cost and damage information was added to the calculation if they were available additional explanatory variables such as depth duration and flood extent for each event as well as urban drainage system and rainfall data could have be included for a more accurate evaluation considering the limitations of this study a higher actual cost is a possible reality the study also makes a case for judicious recording of data related to small scale flash flood events so that more accurate assessments could be conducted even with the limited data and using a conservative approach the flash flood damage was about 0 04 of kuala lumpur s gdp in 2016 table 6 with global warming and the projected rise in frequency and intensity of climate hazards and growing exposure and vulnerability of the city due to rapid development the risk of much higher impact and economic cost due to flash floods is expected to increase in the future the total loss and number of affected roads consistently correspond to the frequency of flash floods in the city and this has generally increased over a period of seven years except for 2014 table 7 the average loss per flash flood has increased consistently during the same period except for 2011 flash flood loss per capita does not show any particular trend over the seven years with the highest value of rm27 2 per person in 2016 when the frequency of flash flood was also the highest however the indirect damage cost related to flash floods was higher as the number of roads affected increased this is because when a road network is disrupted various economic aspects will be affected in a vast city such as kuala lumpur as people from outside the disrupted area also have to use road network the findings on affected roads in kuala lumpur is supported by a previous study conducted in haarlem netherlands where disrupted road networks resulted in a larger number of people affected by floods of similar severity ten veldhuis 2011 the haarlem study that estimated costs using data from citizens on urban drainage problems also revealed that pluvial floods caused significantly higher damage costs to residential buildings compared to commercial buildings and flooded roads in kuala lumpur building damage and road damage are higher in commercial areas than residential areas this indicates that damage costs associated with small scale floods is context and area specific a proper comparison can only be done if the damages and losses are contextualised to the gdp of the city or some other common denominator moving forward this study can now provide baseline information for kuala lumpur on small scale flash floods a methodological approach has been demonstrated where the cost of disaster damage can be evaluated with minimum information the findings indicate that the indirect damage may be higher than the direct damage and may continue increasing as the elements at risk to flash flood are increasing due to the combination of rapid development in the city and extreme weather due to global warming these results may be helpful for insurers in deciding if small scale flash floods are damaging enough for developing insurance policies to transfer the risk of the affected people policymakers should also understand that data should be recorded more systematically to delineate aspects that are most likely to receive high damage so that the information can be used to inform policy such evidence based information is the way forward for achieving climate resilience for sustainable development in cities 5 conclusion this study conceptualises disaster impacts due to small scale flash floods in kuala lumpur which are short duration events of about less than six hours with shallow depths of flood waters generally less than two meters with limited spatial extent and without associated fatalities such events are considered disasters in the local context specifically for the affected population in the city the annual damages and losses associated with 204 small scale flash flood events between 2010 and 2016 range between rm4 5 million and rm48 7 million the highest flash flood damages and losses rm48 7 million represented 0 04 of the gross domestic product gdp of kuala lumpur in 2016 while this number may seem insignificant it is useful baseline information for further studies when more data is available to conduct a robust evaluation although the assessment was very conservative and associated with several uncertainties due to limited information there were some useful insights obtained direct costs were associated with damage to roads as well as commercial and residential areas to a lesser extent while loss of productive time was the leading factor for indirect costs the findings indicate that indirect damage costs are higher than the direct damage the total direct damage of flash floods hardly exceeded rm5 million but the indirect costs could be up to four times higher disrupted road networks were the highest contributor to both direct and indirect costs as they disturb various economic aspects and people both within the city and outside of the affected areas the damage costs are expected to increase due to the combination of rapid development and extreme weather due to global warming an important aspect to be considered in kuala lumpur are policy

3100,the cumulative costs associated with frequent small scale flash floods have been calculated for kuala lumpur malaysia to get an insight on damages and losses there is limited information on the impact of frequently occurring small scale events compared to large scale or catastrophic disasters particularly with respect to its overall implications on the economy at the city level such information would support the formulation of effective disaster risk reduction strategies the study evaluated the direct and indirect damage cost of 204 flash floods in kuala lumpur between 2010 and 2016 using a heuristic approach to compensate for data scarcity and drawing on the market price and restoration cost method the assessment relied primarily on secondary data from various government departments and relevant authorities the results revealed that the total flash flood damage was as high as rm48 7 million which represented 0 04 of the gross domestic product gdp of kuala lumpur in 2016 direct costs were associated with damage to roads as well as commercial and residential areas to a lesser extent while loss of productive time was the leading factor for indirect costs indirect damage costs are up to four times higher than direct damages with disrupted road networks being the highest contributor to both costs moving forward risk reduction strategies should focus the transportation sector the findings of this study is useful baseline information for future projection of damages and losses due to small scale flash floods in kuala lumpur keywords damage estimation flash floods small scale disasters disaster risk reduction disaster loss malaysia 1 introduction the frequency and damage due to disasters arising from climate hazards have been increasing over the past decades attary et al 2020 hallegatte 2014 shabnam 2014 one reason for this is the increase in temperature of the earth s surface air and water the continuation of increasing temperature trends is likely to cause further increases in the frequency and intensity of various climate related extreme events runkle et al 2018 ipcc 2021 the risks to densely populated areas are expected to be magnified ipcc 2022 while major and catastrophic disasters with casualties are severe enough to attract attention small scale climate related events are often overlooked despite their higher frequency the cumulative impact of the small scale events merits further investigation especially in urban areas to better understand and implement more efficient risk reduction measures flash floods generally result from intense rainfall dam or levee failure or rapid snowmelt with less than six hours of duration samsuri et al 2018 they are characterized by sudden rise in the water level relatively high velocity large amounts of debris and short duration with high frequency buslima et al 2018 they are mostly unpredictable and may have a detrimental cumulative impact on the affected community flood events with pluvial characteristics have a short duration of about less than six hours with relatively shallow floodwater depths nizam et al 2019 in this study small scale flash floods are defined as short duration events of about less than six hours with shallow depths of flood waters generally less than two meters with limited spatial extent and without associated fatalities the occurrence of flash floods in urban areas are expected to increase with extreme rainfall events due to global warming making it imperative for such localised events be assessed retrospectively and prospectively malaysia is adversely affected by extreme weather events between 1998 and 2018 the country experienced approximately 51 major disasters affecting 3 million people with 281 deaths with total damages estimated at us 2 billion ringgit malaysia rm 8 billion zurairi 2018 floods are the most common disaster in the country yusoff et al 2018 the rapid economic development of kuala lumpur has also contributed to uncontrolled structural development and environmental degradation pereira et al 2010 vaghefi et al 2017 in conjunction with extreme rainfall events this has contributed to increased incidences of flash floods while no fatalities have been reported flash floods have affected the city centre by causing heavy traffic jams and hindering mobility which disrupts daily activities in the city bhuiyan et al 2018a 2018b in the context of those affected the flash floods are disaster events their livelihood is affected and there is massive clean up of impacted areas including repair or replacement of damaged property such as cars appliances and houses the coverage of the impacts of flash floods has been minimal in the literature the cumulative economic costs of frequent small scale events are unknown hence it is largely unclear how these impacts can be evaluated in the future climate related disaster events disrupt various productive activities therefore analysing the costs involved with that disruption and damage is important to build resilience and achieve the goals of a sustainable city the purpose of this study is to provide baseline information on costs associated with frequent small scale flash floods in kuala lumpur the damages and losses associated with 204 flash flood events between 2010 and 2016 in the city will be evaluated the proportionate costs in terms of the city s gross domestic product gdp which has never been reported previously will also be determined the ensuing section presents a review of the literature followed by the methodology that was used in the study this is followed by results and discussion and a final section on the conclusions of this study 2 literature review 2 1 disaster impact assessment framework disaster impacts can be represented by direct and indirect damages and distinguished further with respect to the tangibility and intangibility of the damage elements this approach includes economic and non economic impacts ema 2002 garcia aristizabal and marzocchi 2012 hallegatte 2014 hochrainer stigler 2012 mechler et al 2010 meyer et al 2013 safaie et al 2017 un general assembly 2016 direct and indirect damages are distinguished based on the occurrence time of damage direct contact of the hazard and the location whether in a disaster area or not of the damage the tangibility of the damages is decided based on marketability measurability and monetary value of the affected items hochrainer stigler 2012 jonkman et al 2008 mckenzie et al 2005 in this framework all physical stock monetisable and priceable elements are denoted as tangible they are further classified as direct if the elements were caused by direct contact within the hazard area during the hazard event ema 2002 garcia aristizabal and marzocchi 2012 hochrainer stigler 2012 mechler et al 2010 meyer et al 2013 as well as during the hazard event hallegatte 2014 similarly all affected elements that are not physical not traded in the market unmeasurable and not monetisable are categorised as direct intangible damage the indirect damage elements are those affected due to the consequence of the direct damages of the disaster not necessarily within the hazard area and during the time of the hazard this is supported by the theories that the total direct damage will have a consequential impact that is indirect damage mechler hochrainer 2010 this study conceptualises disaster impacts due to flash floods where such events are considered disasters in the local context specifically for the affected population of kuala lumpur the city s susceptibility refers to its sensitivity to the hazards its vulnerability includes the damageability of the physical elements such as several types of houses i e single story houses landed houses bungalow and multi story buildings with respect to their damage rate road and transportation network clean up costs and traffic congestion related costs including repair and replacement costs the cost and damage rates can differ across land use classes and types of houses and assets for example the cleaning cost of single story houses landed houses in residential areas will differ from the cost for the same type of house in commercial areas as the rates for basic amenities and services are higher for areas classified as commercial 2 2 data scarcity in flash flood damage estimation flash flood impacts differ from place to place in europe between 1950 and 2006 about 40 of the total casualties from all types of disasters arising from natural hazards were due to flash floods barredo 2007 comparatively in malaysia flash floods only caused 3 of the total fatalities from all types of disasters em dat 2020 furthermore fatalities are not associated with small scale flash floods in malaysia bhuiyan et al 2018a however despite very insignificant casualties the risk of social and economic damage may still be significant even though early warning systems have been improved marchi et al 2010 montz and gruntfest 2002 ten veldhuis 2011 in kuala lumpur the adversity associated with flash floods is reflected through physical damage clean up costs mobility disruption and traffic congestion samsuri et al 2018 some of these impacts have further adverse consequences such as delays in getting to work spending more time idly on the road additional fuel cost disruption of daily activities and the opportunity cost of productive work this type of impact which happens due to the direct or immediate destruction or disruption caused by the disaster events is called an indirect impact hallegatte 2014 hochrainer stigler 2012 koks et al 2015 kousky 2014 kreibich et al 2014 meyer et al 2013 safaie et al 2017 un general assembly 2016 many of the indirect impacts are short term losses which may not be measurable by stock losses kajitani and tatano 2018 most flash flood impact studies cover historical events ex post that are severe widespread and involving fatalities or large insurance claims table 1 with respect to damage related information and extent of affected elements the assessments have notable property damage elements and other impact volume i e affecting larger areas higher death toll and larger number of affected people grahn and nyberg 2014 spekkers et al 2011 vozinaki et al 2015 flash floods that cause deaths and injuries are given serious attention and studied with greater urgency li et al 2019 špitalar et al 2014 terti et al 2017 however flash floods have become an important research area due to their wide range of impacts and damage capabilities as well as anticipated increase in frequency and intensity due to global warming looking at the methodological approaches most studies require extensive data and a combination of hydrological information garrote et al 2016 kefi et al 2018 le bihan et al 2016 the required data includes insurance data which has limited accessibility due to privacy policy of insurance companies grahn and nyberg 2014 spekkers et al 2011 digital topographic map flood water depth and flow velocity land use information and simulated flood inundation parameters vozinaki et al 2015 fatalities data flood points event data li et al 2019 špitalar et al 2014 terti et al 2017 population statistics topographic map drainage pattern data land use map damage map and primary survey bari et al 2021 mahmood et al 2016 such a high amount of data may not be available for all cases in reality many developing countries have an extremely limited amount of the relevant information for conventional evaluation therefore approaches that require both primary field survey data and secondary data data collected by third party as well as the incorporation of hydraulic information and depth damage curves have extremely limited applicability when data is scarce as such several impact assessment studies use insurance claims grahn and nyberg 2014 spekkers et al 2011 synthetic flow velocity flood depth crop damage curves vozinaki et al 2015 and hydraulic models for simulating flood damage assessment kefi et al 2018 le bihan et al 2016 vozinaki et al 2015 xia et al 2011 zeng et al 2019 such detailed information is generally available for major flood events or catastrophic flash flood events where the stakeholders record and have access to more useful information although the stage damage functions are well designed the damage results are affected by uncertainties and questionable transferability of the models arnell 1989 cammerer et al 2013 de moel and aerts 2011 büchele kreibich et al 2006 the models and methodologies used in above mentioned studies require integration of hydraulic aspects and physical sciences which may not be possible for small scale events due to insufficient information availability such information is certainly unavailable in the context of malaysian flash floods there is a gap in the literature on damage assessment of flash flood events for which information is limited in addition the usability of these models also becomes limited due to unavailability of specific depth damage or stage damage functions romali et al 2018 therefore this study uses the best available secondary data for calculating the direct and indirect damage related cost of flash floods it contributes to the literature by assessing small scale events which have been largely overlooked and addresses the methodological limitations due to data scarcity by implementing a heuristic approach for assessing disaster damage with limited data availability 3 methodology 3 1 location and description of the study site the study was conducted in the federal territory of kuala lumpur the capital city of malaysia the city is located in the centre of selangor state and covers an area of 243 km2 with an estimated population of 1 79 million as of 2015 department of statistics malaysia official portal 2015 the city hall of kuala lumpur dbkl administers 11 parliamentary constituencies fig 1 there are two major rivers in kuala lumpur the sungai klang and the sungai gombak the rapid pace of development has contributed to the problem clogged drainage in the area around this confluence thus the rivers overflow due to high precipitation and often cause flash floods in low lying areas hong hong 2016 extreme weather conditions such as greater intensity of rainfall is expected to increase in the future this has been supported by drainage and irrigation department did reports that estimated that the one hour rainfall intensity in 2000 2007 period increased by 17 compared to the past ismail et al 2018 3 2 data collection this study used secondary data for calculating the cost of flash flood damages the secondary data include land use classes flash flood maps and damage unit values duvs for different assets and property types such as roads landed single story houses bungalows kampung houses village houses flats apartments terraced houses and commercial buildings however there are no damage and loss value available for industrial buildings factories shops hospitals and schools the damage values of commercial building were used for estimating the cost of these items this was considered acceptable as the buildings are similar and the difference in the damage caused by shallow levels of flood waters over a short duration is expected to be minimal furthermore the majority of areas in kuala lumpur are classified as commercial areas with minimal industrial zones information was also collected on clean up costs for roads rivers drains and parking areas according to the land use classes cleaning costs were estimated based on quoted prices from the cleaning companies that were accepted by dbkl see table 2 for the respective values for indirect tangible costs the number of cars passing through the affected roads vehicle occupancy rate economic time value for kuala lumpur fuel price and vehicle operating cost were used various data points descriptions sources and unit of measurements were used to calculate flash flood damages table 2 the country has specific damage factors for different types of damage to properties and assets for calculating the cost of major flood events did 2012 however these factors cannot be used for small scale flash flood events without information on duration and depth of inundation which is rarely available the flood damage estimation guideline for the country did 2003 indicates that 1 of damage unit values of major floods can be used for flash floods there is no explanation on how the percentage was derived but this is the general assumption by the national government agency in charge of floods this value was adopted to calculate the building damage ratio for different types of houses the building damage ratio is the estimated flash flood damage for each type of structure i e houses commercial block etc the estimated damage value for a house is only a portion of the entire value of the structure the assumption is that flash floods do not destroy an entire house but rather damages it to different degrees depending on the type of house as kampung houses village houses are generally old and made of wood they are more vulnerable and it is expected that the damage will be comparatively higher compared to other houses the land use map of the federal territory of kuala lumpur has the following classes institutional residential trade industry green area and others the institutional land use class includes all institutional areas in the city such as schools colleges universities hospitals and other kinds of institutions the residential land use class includes all housing areas the trade areas include the busiest parts of the city which are characterised by shopping malls mini malls shops and places where business activities are held the industrial land use class includes firms and factories the green areas include parks and land with trees plants and grass the other land use class includes mixed used areas rivers roads and highways the land use map identifies different land classes through colour coding while roads are separate land use class in the map this study divided road damage based on the location of affected roads for example if the affected road is located within residential area that road damage was classified road damage in residential area 3 3 analysing flash flood locations inundated areas and frequencies this study used arcgis software to map the flash flood areas and to identify and count the affected buildings types of houses car parking areas drains and other physical properties using the kuala lumpur land use map the physical properties were differentiated according to land use classes such as residential commercial industrial institutional and other areas flash flood information obtained from the city hall dbkl was used to plot the location of flash floods hot spots points that often experience recurring pluvial flash floods between 2010 and 2017 the spatial extent of the area inundated by flash floods was not available thus an older dataset for the same area was used to estimate the general extent of small scale flash floods the information was obtained from the national flood condition and damage assessment report on flood events from 2000 to 2010 in kuala lumpur which recorded both fluvial and pluvial events did 2012 the task of recording was taken over by the city hall after an underground storm water tunnel smart project started operations to handle major fluvial floods in kuala lumpur while the timeline of flood events did not overlap a high number of the locations where the flood events were recorded in both datasets are identical an indication that the problem of small scale flash floods was not resolved the national dataset recorded approximately 79 flood locations in kuala lumpur many of which were linked to 18 major events the location of 53 flood events was matched in both the datasets and the extent of the corresponding affected area was delineated using information in the national report fig 2 the findings revealed that the average flooded area per location was 10 92 ha which represents the situation before the smart project was in operation when major floods were prevalent in a majority of the locations flood waters do not spread beyond 5 ha and the most frequent extent is 2 ha represented by the mode value based on this estimation 2 ha circular buffer zones were created for each flood location of 2010 to 2016 using the arcgis software to identify and quantify affected assets 3 4 flash flood cost estimation methods this study evaluates the cost of the direct and indirect damages of flash floods utilising the widely used market price and restoration cost approach balbi et al 2015 middelmann fernandes 2010 rayhan and grote 2010 the market price approach determines the value of a property based on the selling price of the property or similar property freeman et al 2014 under this approach relevant prices i e cleaning price fuel price value of time were used after adjusting with inflation by using consumer price index cpi calculator provided by dosm which uses 2010 as base year restoration cost approach values a good and services based on cost incurred for bringing it back to its original state brans 2005 in this approach different damage unit values duvs for different land use classes and property types as well as repair costs have been used in previous literature thieken et al 2007 flash floods in kuala lumpur commonly require clean up activities after the event hence cleaning cost data for different property types were used the property damage and clean up costs are considered as factors of direct costs of damages the direct cost of flash floods was calculated by using duv and cost per unit for each affected element in the flood area this can also be utilised in stage damage function for integrating hydraulic and economic modelling jonkman et al 2008 zabret et al 2018 similar ideas can be implemented by using damage thresholds and unit costs olsen et al 2015 the duvs are collected from did which is the authorised body that deals with flooding issues did 2003 suparta and rahman 2016 using these duvs and different data points in table 2 the physical damage and the resulting costs in different land use classes was computed and summed for calculating the cost of flash flood damages similarly indirect cost of flash flood was estimated by evaluating the secondary effect of flash flood i e road affected by flash flood the secondary effect includes loss of productive time supply related loss and traffic congestion cost which were calculated by using relevant market values such as fuel price value of time and vehicle operating cost 3 4 1 assumptions related to the cost calculation based on the dbkl 2008 city plan there is a drain on each side of the road the drainage length was calculated by measuring both sides of affected roads for estimating the clean up cost for drainage for indirect cost calculation the value of time was used as a proxy for the productivity value relating to time urban flash floods mostly result in traffic congestion and slowdown of mobility resulting in loss of time that could be spent on productive pursuits when the exact duration of disruption is not available studies often consider the duration of the traffic congestion itself for assessing the impact the average traffic congestion due to flash floods was assumed to be two hours similar assumptions were used to study localised floods in haarlem netherlands ten veldhuis 2011 shanghai china yin et al 2016 and malaysia nizam et al 2019 vehicle occupancy for vans and lorries was assumed to be one per vehicle motorcycles cars and buses was assumed to be used by the workforce while vans and lorries were used for delivering and supplying goods and services out of the 66 affected roads vehicle per road data was only available for 25 roads the average value of the 25 roads was used for the remaining roads for which data was unavailable all roads within the buffer zone were considered as affected by flash floods once a road is classified as being affected by flash floods the traffic mobility of the entire stretch of the road leading to and from this zone was considered disrupted 3 4 2 direct physical damage in different land use area the direct physical damage in residential areas is comprised of damage to different types of houses an approach followed in previous studies chiba and prabhakar 2017 the approach to attribute damage unit value for assessing direct physical damage in the commercial area is calculated based on the size of buildings in this approach the structures are divided into three categories small medium and large the road damage was calculated based on total length of road inundated and damage rate per kilometre inundated road did 2012 clean up costs comprise cleaning different types of houses in different land use classes drainage systems and sweeping costs for roads and car parking areas flash flood related clean up costs are implied for different elements affected such as multilevel buildings single story houses landed houses and shops lots where sediment removal cost is included zabret et al 2018 in terms of clean up cost the clean up charges differ on whether the house is a single story landed house and whether the location is a residential or a commercial area the rates are derived from the quotation given to dbkl from cleaning service companies the equation for estimating direct cost of flash floods in a year is presented below equation 1 3 1 dffc s d c c 2 sd σ i 1 n s t i d u v i 3 cc σ s t i s c c i σ

the components of the indirect tangible cost of flash floods calculation are productive time loss lpt goods and services delivery related time loss srl and traffic congestion costs tcc the goods and services related time loss refers to additional time wasted in delivering and supplying goods and services due to traffic delays specifically in terms of vans and lorries the traffic congestion cost refers to the sum of the cost involved for operating vehicles for extra time due to flash flood induced traffic congestion the unit cost value used are shown in table 2 the equations for estimating

sources of uncertainty it should be noted that the estimations of this study have some uncertainties that should be considered while making decision based on these results firstly the assumption of setting 1 of major flood damage values for flash floods is an uncertainty of concern although this percentage is applied for building damages only it has to be considered as a lower bound estimation secondly due to unavailability of inundated area data of flash flood events using average conditions for all flash flood events may further underestimate the costs this will downsize the cost level of all elements including indirect damages as well due to the existence of relatively more congested built up areas and infrastructural facilities in urban areas the cost is expected to be much higher if more severe floods are included in the analysis despite these uncertainties the simplified and conservative method used in this study will still be able to provide useful insights to relevant stakeholders for planning and decision making this study has its limitation for not being able to include various other cost aspects owing to data scarcity for example the latest data on rainfall intensity and duration and several other meteorological and hydrological data were not found for the flash flood events the direct tangible costs could include data on household contents which may be damaged or lost due to flash floods the economic value of damage caused to affected vehicles and the cost incurred by shops and business outlets as well as business interruptions adding these costs factors may increase total direct tangible costs of flash floods significantly 4 results and discussion 4 1 flash flood locations and frequencies flash floods are common in kuala lumpur a majority of the flash floods are located in the central part of the city along the gombak and klang rivers and their major connecting branches fig 3 there are several areas with high density of river networks such as in the eastern and western parts of the city which have not experienced flash floods these high density networks are located in relatively higher ground and have been converted into open concrete drains to service surrounding built up areas as part of the development process the water in these drains flow downward into the connecting branches in the lower terrain which then empty into the gombak and klang rivers many of the connecting branches have also been converted into open drains for adjacent built up areas in some areas the natural channels have been filled and the drains are more narrow that the original waterway the combination of built up areas and conversion of natural channels into concrete drains have impeded the capacity of water infiltration after rainfall in much of kuala lumpur the rapid runoff of water after a heavy rainfall along fewer surface water paths in some areas then accumulates in the relatively lower terrain along the gombak and klang rivers as well as its confluence in the central part of the city resulting in flash floods this issue of reduced infiltration capacity has also been highlighted in previous studies where it is suggested that retaining water for infiltration and preserving water bodies works better than constructing large pipes for ensuring flood safety kefi et al 2018 a total of 204 flash flood events were recorded in kuala lumpur between 2010 and 2016 table 3 the highest number of events occurred in 2016 61 events and the lowest was in 2014 8 events except for 2014 the frequency of flash floods appears to have increased over this period all the events were taken into account in the evaluation of damages and losses 4 2 costs of flash floods 4 2 1 cost of direct flash flood damage the cost of direct damage due to flash floods is presented according to the land use categories in kuala lumpur table 4 the results show that the direct costs in the residential areas exceeded a million ringgit in 2012 2013 and 2016 with rm1450904 rm1273742 and rm2011734 respectively in 2013 2015 and 2016 the direct costs of flash floods in the commercial areas were higher compared to other years with monetary loss of rm 2518816 rm2101084 and rm3759675 respectively the direct cost of flash flood damage was also found in other land use areas in 2015 and 2016 exceeding a million ringgit of damage valued at rm2608061 and rm1096651 respectively table 4 the institutional and industrial areas had lower direct damage this lower damage is attributed to the lesser extent of industrial and institutional areas in kuala lumpur although there are many institutions e g educational buildings and hospitals in the city this land use category had lower damage due to the lesser number of flash floods in these areas the total direct cost increased annually except for 2014 due to the low number of flash floods events in that year table 3 the three highest damage costs due to flash floods were in 2013 2015 and 2016 amounting to rm4121883 rm5819043 and rm8066458 respectively table 4 the direct flash flood damage included road damage due to inundation building damage and clean up activities fig 4 the results showed that residential and commercial areas were leading in road damage fig 4a the commercial areas also had high costs due to road damage in 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 with approximately 69 49 47 61 of total road damage respectively the residential areas had the second highest road damage in most of the years especially in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 with approximately 37 47 31 and 34 of total road damage respectively the third highest rate of road damage were from other land use areas notable road damage years in this land use category were in 2010 20 2014 27 and 2015 46 fig 4a in terms of building damage the residential areas had the leading rate of building damage in 2010 82 2011 60 2013 51 and 2014 81 the commercial areas had the leading rate of building damage in 2015 66 and 2016 52 in 2012 and 2013 the commercial areas had almost equal rates of building damage with residential areas with 44 and 48 of damage respectively fig 4b in terms of cleaning costs the commercial areas had the highest rate of cleaning cost due to flash flood with highest rates in 2011 57 2012 60 2013 73 and 2014 50 the rest of the years also had more than 40 of cleaning costs in commercial areas fig 4c the cleaning cost was higher in the commercial areas due to the higher price rate of cleaning activities for this land use category the building damage fig 4d were expectedly lower as flash floods in kuala lumpur do not usually cause much physical damage due to their lower intensity and magnitude building structure and material related damages are mostly related to the inundation level and its duration as these elements are resistant to short duration floods grahn and nyberg 2014 they expectedly experience less damage from small scale flash floods overall the cost categories were found to be highest in commercial areas followed by residential areas and other land use areas fig 4d in addition costs associated with road damage was the leading category for flash floods in the city a possible reason is that road maintenance is highly expensive and they are also very vulnerable to inundation nizam et al 2019 when a road is repeatedly inundated the strength of the material that is used to make the structure decreases and even gets damaged which involves higher expenditure to restore ghani et al 2016 4 2 2 cost of indirect flash flood damage the results of indirect damage related costs showed that loss of productive time related costs exceeded a million ringgit for all studied years however the costs exceeded rm15 million in 2015 and 2016 amounting to rm19405416 and rm29135955 respectively table 5 the supply related loss and traffic congestion related costs had similar ranges in all years the highest supply related loss were in 2013 2015 and 2016 with values of rm1788534 rm3702375 and rm5488670 respectively similarly the highest traffic congestion related loss occurred in 2013 2015 and 2016 amounting to rm1951618 rm4059560 and rm6010995 respectively high indirect costs occur when small scale pluvial flash floods spatially and temporally reduce the connectivity and accessibility of people yin et al 2016 a large number of people are stuck on the road which cause loss of their productive time additional fuel and vehicle operating related loss pyatkova et al 2019 comparing three indirect cost categories the results show that loss of productive time related cost was the leading source of indirect cost which contributed 70 73 of the annual cost fig 5 in comparison supply related loss and traffic congestion related costs varied between 13 and 15 of contribution during the same period the productive time related costs was higher because the flash floods indirectly affected a large number of people on the other hand although supply related loss had contributed less the delay in services such as delivering goods and services may have further economic consequences therefore these indirect damage aspects demand more careful attention 4 2 3 total flood damage cost a comparison between total direct and total indirect costs indicate that the level of indirect costs is much higher than the direct loss fig 6 the reason is that flash floods directly affect fewer people and cover less area as they are of small scale in nature therefore direct damages are logically lower than indirect costs grahn and nyberg 2014 however flash floods affect a larger number of people by disrupting road networks on which a significantly larger number of people and their productive activities are dependent pyatkova et al 2019 yin et al 2016 as a result while direct flash flood costs hardly exceeded rm5 million fig 5a the indirect costs were always more than rm5 million and even exceeded rm20 million in 2016 fig 6b the results also indicate that the road network was a major part of flash flood damage in terms of both direct and indirect costs the flood inundation related road damage significantly inflated direct damage compared to clean up cost and building damage the reason for lower damage to buildings was due to the lower inundation level and shorter duration however as roads were frequently affected by flash floods and there were more road structures in the study area due to its urban characteristics the road damage was higher the reason for direct and indirect flash flood costs being very high in 2015 and 2016 was due to higher frequency of flash flood occurrences and affected roads in these two years the cost of flash floods was comparatively low in 2010 2011 and 2014 due to two reasons firstly in these years flash flood frequency was low and secondly the number of roads affected by flash flood was comparatively low as well a comparison of total clean up physical damage indirect and total costs fig 7 show that the clean up cost is very negligible compared to the other cost categories the physical damage which included road damage and building damage was also much lower compared to indirect costs in this case the evidence clearly reveals that the indirect cost of flash floods was not only higher but is also increasing flash flood induced traffic congestion affects the work force benjamin 2017 which would induce additional economic cost due to traffic congestion productive time loss and service related loss this has not been accounted for in this study as the major source of indirect tangible loss was traffic congestion and other mobility disruptions policy interventions and adaptation strategies that focus on how to prevent road networks from being inundated and affected indirectly is an important aspect to consider the total damage values of flash floods in kuala lumpur are all below 1 of the gdp of the city table 6 this might seem exceptionally low compared to the damage costs of major floods however as a conservative calculation and associated uncertainties have contributed to a lower bound estimation in this study this could be just the tip of the iceberg moreover flash flood losses may increase in the future if more cost and damage information was added to the calculation if they were available additional explanatory variables such as depth duration and flood extent for each event as well as urban drainage system and rainfall data could have be included for a more accurate evaluation considering the limitations of this study a higher actual cost is a possible reality the study also makes a case for judicious recording of data related to small scale flash flood events so that more accurate assessments could be conducted even with the limited data and using a conservative approach the flash flood damage was about 0 04 of kuala lumpur s gdp in 2016 table 6 with global warming and the projected rise in frequency and intensity of climate hazards and growing exposure and vulnerability of the city due to rapid development the risk of much higher impact and economic cost due to flash floods is expected to increase in the future the total loss and number of affected roads consistently correspond to the frequency of flash floods in the city and this has generally increased over a period of seven years except for 2014 table 7 the average loss per flash flood has increased consistently during the same period except for 2011 flash flood loss per capita does not show any particular trend over the seven years with the highest value of rm27 2 per person in 2016 when the frequency of flash flood was also the highest however the indirect damage cost related to flash floods was higher as the number of roads affected increased this is because when a road network is disrupted various economic aspects will be affected in a vast city such as kuala lumpur as people from outside the disrupted area also have to use road network the findings on affected roads in kuala lumpur is supported by a previous study conducted in haarlem netherlands where disrupted road networks resulted in a larger number of people affected by floods of similar severity ten veldhuis 2011 the haarlem study that estimated costs using data from citizens on urban drainage problems also revealed that pluvial floods caused significantly higher damage costs to residential buildings compared to commercial buildings and flooded roads in kuala lumpur building damage and road damage are higher in commercial areas than residential areas this indicates that damage costs associated with small scale floods is context and area specific a proper comparison can only be done if the damages and losses are contextualised to the gdp of the city or some other common denominator moving forward this study can now provide baseline information for kuala lumpur on small scale flash floods a methodological approach has been demonstrated where the cost of disaster damage can be evaluated with minimum information the findings indicate that the indirect damage may be higher than the direct damage and may continue increasing as the elements at risk to flash flood are increasing due to the combination of rapid development in the city and extreme weather due to global warming these results may be helpful for insurers in deciding if small scale flash floods are damaging enough for developing insurance policies to transfer the risk of the affected people policymakers should also understand that data should be recorded more systematically to delineate aspects that are most likely to receive high damage so that the information can be used to inform policy such evidence based information is the way forward for achieving climate resilience for sustainable development in cities 5 conclusion this study conceptualises disaster impacts due to small scale flash floods in kuala lumpur which are short duration events of about less than six hours with shallow depths of flood waters generally less than two meters with limited spatial extent and without associated fatalities such events are considered disasters in the local context specifically for the affected population in the city the annual damages and losses associated with 204 small scale flash flood events between 2010 and 2016 range between rm4 5 million and rm48 7 million the highest flash flood damages and losses rm48 7 million represented 0 04 of the gross domestic product gdp of kuala lumpur in 2016 while this number may seem insignificant it is useful baseline information for further studies when more data is available to conduct a robust evaluation although the assessment was very conservative and associated with several uncertainties due to limited information there were some useful insights obtained direct costs were associated with damage to roads as well as commercial and residential areas to a lesser extent while loss of productive time was the leading factor for indirect costs the findings indicate that indirect damage costs are higher than the direct damage the total direct damage of flash floods hardly exceeded rm5 million but the indirect costs could be up to four times higher disrupted road networks were the highest contributor to both direct and indirect costs as they disturb various economic aspects and people both within the city and outside of the affected areas the damage costs are expected to increase due to the combination of rapid development and extreme weather due to global warming an important aspect to be considered in kuala lumpur are policy

3101,acid mine drainage amd has caused serious pollution in the surface water environments of karst areas but the effect of amd on the dissolved inorganic carbon dic dynamics in the receiving karst rivers remains poorly understood the amd and karst river water were sampled from the yangliujie river watershed in southwest china and mixed different proportions of amd and karst river water in a laboratory experiment to simulate seasonal hydrological conditions in the river in an attempt to explore the impact of amd on the loss rate and evolution of dic in karst river water the results showed that amd can cause a rapid ph drop in karst river water resulting in approximately 41 0 11 8 dic loss in the early stage of mixing as co2 g release to the atmosphere with the biological or chemical oxidation of fe2 and followed by fe3 biogenic formation of schwertmannite or hydrolysis the ph decreased and the dic concentration further decreased in the mixed samples the degree of decrease was related to the oxidation rate of fe2 with decreasing dic concentration δ13cdic enrichment gradually increased when the mixing ratio of amd was large the total h in amd and h generated by the oxidation of fe2 exceeded the hco3 content in karst river water the isotopic enrichment coefficient caused by the initial mixing and the end of the reaction was small and the dic transformation was mainly dominated by the loss of co2 g when a small proportion of amd was mixed in the hco3 concentration in the mixed water sample was in excess of the h produced by fe2 and the total h in amd the isotopic enrichment coefficient caused by the initial mixing and the end of the reaction was larger and the dic conversion was mainly affected by hco3 dehydration these preliminary findings support evidence showing dic conversion and loss in amd affected karst rivers increase the transfer of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere which diminishes net carbon sink fluxes in karst river basins so reasonable amd treatment methods should be applied to minimize these negative impacts keywords carbon release karst river carbon isotopic composition acid mine drainage coal mine data availability l have shared the link to my data at the attach file step 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd from the mining of coal and metal sulfide deposits continues to be a concern because it can cause serious environmental pollution owing to its high acidity toxic metal content and sulfate content acharya and kharel 2020 feng et al 2014 it is estimated that approximately 20 000 to 50 000 mines around the world discharge this kind of acidic water which has caused approximately 6400 km of rivers 8000 to 16 000 km of streams and 720 km2 of lakes and reservoirs to be seriously polluted johnson and hallberg 2005 rezaie and anderson 2020 creating a challenge for the global mining industry chen et al 2021 even if a mine is closed amd continues to flow out from the mine when amd enters downstream rivers it causes the ph value of the receiving water to decrease and the water quality to seriously drop ni et al 2008 dissolved inorganic carbon dic is the main form of dissolved carbon in river water bauer and bianchi 2011 and previous studies have shown that the dic in river water can be converted to co2 g under the influence of amd abongwa et al 2016 ali and atekwana 2011 fonyuy and atekwana 2008a vesper et al 2016 and increasing the co2 emissions of the receiving water which seriously affects the carbon cycle process of the river therefore the excitation effect of amd on the carbon sources cannot be ignored the dissolution process of carbonate rocks can consume co2 in the atmosphere soil and store it in the karst water as the form of hco3 ca1 xmgx co3 co2 h2o 1 x ca2 xmg2 2hco3 this carbon sink effect formed by karstification processes has attracted much attention cao et al 2018 liu et al 2011 this process also suggests that dic is an important indicator in the study of carbon sinks and the carbon cycle of karstification and there are relatively high dic concentrations in karst river water compared with other nonkarst rivers prior studies have shown that amd discharged from abandoned coal mines degrades surface water quality in karst areas chen et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 and that amd can also flow into karst aquifers through the conduits and promote the dissolution of carbonate rocks which releases more co2 to the atmosphere ren et al 2021 however the influence of amd on the dic of karst surface rivers has not attracted enough attention it is important to quantify properly the dic loss rate and the regulatory factors acting in this process this lack of knowledge affect our understanding about how to control the effect of the amd on the dic in karst surface rivers the southwest china karst region is one of the largest karst areas of the major concentrated karst regions in the world and guizhou province is not only located in the centre of the karst area in southwest china bai and zhou 2020 zhao et al 2018 but also an important coal base in southwest china the coal reserve ranks fifth in china and most of the coal mines are located in the karst mountainous area the sulfur content of most coal mines in guizhou is generally high close to or higher than 3 mainly pyrite feng et al 2014 and the exploitation method applied to the coal resources is mainly underground mining after coal mining multiple mined out areas are formed and groundwater gradually accumulates and easily forms amd then the accumulated acid water that naturally flows from these abandoned mines it is estimated that over a thousand coal mines have been closed in guizhou resulting in a wide range of abandoned coal caves and gangue dumps with amd flowing out owing to the high cost and technical difficulty of amd treatment only some of amd discharge from abandoned mines can be treated effectively this often result in the pollution of downstream river for the discharged amd in the karst mountain area zhang et al 2010 therefore amd emissions from abandoned coal mines have become one of the major current water environmental problems in guizhou which makes guizhou a highly representative area where karst geology and amd coexist however little information is available about the river dic transformation process in this geological setting because the discharge of amd and karst rivers has seasonal dynamic characteristics the acid base neutralization reaction is relatively fast and the hydrolysis of metal ions in amd can further provide h which makes it difficult to detect the fate of dic in the field under the fast mixing process in the river whereas the laboratory experiments can provide one of the ways to preliminary explore the evolution of dic and its isotope in amd polluted karst river water therefore in this study representative amd and corresponding affected karst river water were collected from guizhou and mixed at different volume ratios and the mixed water was continuous interval sampled 1 to document the changes in dic concentrations and isotope compositions δ13cdic in karst river water receiving amd 2 to reveal the dic loss due to the chemical evolution of amd and 3 to discuss the reaction mechanism and fractionation of δ13cdic accompanying the evolution of amd the goal of this research is to make a contribution to understand the carbon cycle and geochemical behaviour of dic in karst rivers under the influence of amd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 26 24 20 3 26 23 45 9 n 107 29 3 69 107 29 34 6 e is located in the upper reaches of the yangliujie river in duyun city fig 1 a guizhou province southwest china it has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 16 1 c and an average annual rainfall of 1431 1 mm the permian carbonate strata are mainly distributed in the basin and there is also a small amount of clastic rock strata in the devonian and carboniferous due to the abundant coal mine resources in the catchment underground coal mining activities began from the 1950s to the 1980s which has resulted in more than 300 abandoned coal mines of different sizes distributed in the basin and a large amount of coal mine acid drainage entering the yanliujie river the samples collected in this study are located in the boluochong coal mine which was closed in 2014 fig 1b the amd discharge of this mine is approximately 600 1500 m3 d mo 2010 the water quality in the yangliujie river seriously deteriorates after the confluence of the amd field investigation found that a large number of iron flocs were formed at the intersection of the amd and karst river water fig 1c 2 2 experimental design and analytical methods amd and karst river water krw samples were collected from the boluochong coal mine and yangliujie river in november 2021 to reflect the variation in the mixing ratio of amd and karst river water due to the fluctuation in drainage amd karst river water mixing experiments were carried out in 20 l clear plastic containers at room temperature we designed an experiment consisting of seven reactors namely amd 100 amd 95 amd 75 amd 50 amd 25 amd 5 and krw 100 with amd to karst river water volume ratios of 100 0 95 5 75 25 50 50 25 75 5 95 and 0 100 respectively duplicate samples were produced for each ratio and all of the reactors were covered with a plastic lid to prevent water evaporation but the reactors were open during the sampling time upon the filling of the reactors with the proper ratios of amd and karst river water the reactor was stirred using glass bars for approximately 1 min to ensure thorough mixing the ph water temperature c dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec redox potential eh fe2 and alkalinity alk were measured after mixing and water samples were collected for chemical and isotopic measurements then the reactors were subsequently sampled every 48 h intervals for physical chemical and isotopic analyses after thorough mechanical mixing and the entire duration of the experiment was 240 h samples for major element analysis were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and stored in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and samples for dic concentration and isotope composition analysis were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and stored in 15 ml brown plastic bottles the water temperature ph ec do and eh were measured by a handheld multiparameter probe multi 3630 wtw germany sx 630 sanxin china and the alk concentrations were measured by dilute hydrochloric acid titration using bromophenol green methyl red as an indicator the so4 2 content was determined by barium chromate spectrophotometry fe2 and mn were measured by colorimetry using the phenanthroline and formaldehyde oxime method immediately after sampling ca2 and mg2 were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry aas tas 990 persee china and al was analysed by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms xseriesii thermo fisher usa the dic concentration and carbon isotope composition were determined with an elemental analysis isotope ratios mass spectrometer irms delta v advantage thermo fisher usa coupled with a gasbench ii the carbon isotope ratios are reported in the delta notation δ s a m p l e r sample r sample 1 1000 where δsample is the stable isotope ratio in the water samples and rsample and rstandard are the ratios of 13c 12c in the water sample and in the standard respectively the δ13cdic is reported in delta notation relative to the vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb carbon standard the analytical precisions for dic concentrations and δ13cdic were 5 and 0 06 respectively 2 3 data processing and analysis the partial pressure of dissolved co2 log pco2 and dic were calculated with the hydrogeochemical computer software phreeqc v 2 using the phreeqc database parkhurst and appelo 1999 the solution conditions in the input file included the ph value temperature and concentrations of major ions and dic table s1 of the supplementary material and the output file contained the values of the co2 partial pressure and dic differences between different treatments were analysed using oneway anova with duncan s multiple comparison tests in spss 20 0 software and were considered to be significant at the p 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 the physicochemical properties variations of different treatments the results of water chemistry and isotope composition from the unmixed and mixed water samples are shown in table s1 of the supplementary material and fig 2 shows that the changes of ph ec do eh fe2 mn and al in the samples at different stages the initial krw 100 has relatively high value of ph and do with mean of 8 41 and 9 67 mg l respectively and has lower value of eh and ec mean of 200 mv and 470 μs cm respectively these parameters in krw 100 did not significantly change as the sampling time increased in addition the krw 100 had a trace concentration of al and both mn and fe2 were below the detection limit indicating that the heavy metal concentration in uncontaminated karst river water was extremely low however the mean values of ph ec do and eh of the initial amd 100 were 3 31 3645 μs cm 3 71 mg l and 387 mv respectively after 240 h the mean values of ph ec do and eh were 3 07 3680 μs cm 0 25 mg l and 414 mv in the amd 100 respectively indicates that the ph and do decreased and the eh increased with static duration in amd 100 and the mixed water samples exhibited the similar characteristics with amd 100 in addition the ph do and eh changed rapidly in the amd 100 amd 95 and amd 75 especially the do concentration which was generally less than 1 mg l after 96 h all samples of amd 5 had a relatively low eh value overall with the proportion of amd and the reaction time increased the ph and do of the mixed water decreased and the ec and eh increased the solutions ec value were significantly different between 240 h and 0 h overall the ec increased slightly as the static duration increased in the samples that amd proportion was greater than or equal to 50 while in these samples with less than 50 amd the ec value decreased slightly after 240 h the fe2 and mn concentrations in amd 100 and mixed samples shows significantly different at different sampling period and the fe2 concentrations tended to rise first from 0 h to 96 h and then decreased in these samples the mn concentrations decreased as the static duration increased the al concentrations in these samples were not significantly different because most samples had low ph alk values could be detected only in the krw 100 and amd 5 samples table s1 of the supplementary material the mean alk was 219 8 mg l in krw 100 and did not show changes with the static duration increased while when a small amount of amd was added that of the amd 5 samples reduced to 120 mg l and after 240 h had reduced to 81 6 mg l indicating that a small amount of amd inflow could significantly reduce karst river water alk 3 2 the dic concentration and δ13cdic variations of different treatments the changes of dic and δ13cdic of different water samples are shown in fig 3 the mean dic concentrations in the initial krw 100 mean of 3 90 mmol c l higher than initial amd 100 mean of 1 19 mmol c l and the mean of δ13cdic in initial krw 100 is 9 23 while 12 0 in initial amd 100 the dic were significantly different in amd 100 between 0 h and 240 h in contrast the variation found in krw 100 can be considered negligible after mixing amd and krw in different volume proportions as the proportion of amd decreased the dic and its carbon isotopic composition of the mixed samples gradually increased fig 3a as a whole the dic concentrations were reduced to varying degrees in mixed samples as the sampling time increased meanwhile the δ13cdic shows small increased with the decline of dic concentration fig 3b and especially in the amd 5 4 discussion 4 1 water chemistry evolution of amd mixed with karst river water the initial amd has a low ph and higher heavy metal concentration while krw shows the opposite characteristics thus when the two types of water are mixed in different proportions the fe2 mn and al concentration in the initial mixed samples shows significant change due to the dilution effect affects on the other hand the changes in the physicochemical parameters with static duration increased that can be explained by metal ion hydrolysis the valence state of the metal ions in solution is correlated with ph and eh and fe2 mn2 and al3 are the forms present in the amd and mixed samples based on the ph eh diagrams of brookins 1988 for the range of ph and eh measured during this study generally fe2 is oxidized to fe3 and afterwards fe3 is hydrolysed to fe oh 3 s according to reactions 1 and 2 however previous studies have shown that in the ph 4 0 system fe2 is difficult to be chemically oxidized by o2 it is mainly oxidized by biological oxidation for example by acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans a ferrooxidans smith et al 1988 wang and zhou 2012 due to the extremely acidic and sulfate rich conditions under the promotion of a ferrooxidans sulfate preferentially combines with fe3 to form iron hydroxysulfate minerals instead of fe oh 3 or ferrihydrite bigham et al 1996 hedrich et al 2011 in general when the ph is in the range of 2 5 to 4 0 and the sulfate concentration is 1000 to 3000 mg l blgham et al 1990 schwertmannite is inclined to form under the influence of biomineralization by a ferrooxidans reactions 3 and 4 and further increases in ph can form iron hydroxy compounds such as goethite ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite according to table s1 of the supplementary material the ph value and sulfate concentration of amd 100 amd 95 amd 75 and amd 50 are within the optimal conditions for schwertmannite formation which suggests that the oxidation of fe2 in these samples is mainly biological oxidation however the amd 25 constitute a boundary below which the biological oxidation rate is reduced the mean ph value of amd 5 is higher than 6 with a lower sulfate concentration 200 mg l which indicates that fe2 is oxidized to fe3 through chemical oxidation and that fe3 is subsequently hydrolysed to fe oh 3 s according to reactions 1 and 2 in addition although the hydrolysis of al3 and mn2 can generate protons the higher ph required for this reaction and fig 2 a shows that the ph of the reaction solution gradually decreases with sampling time increased which inhibits the hydrolysis of al and mn indicating that reactions 5 and 6 are less likely to occur in the amd 100 and mixed samples the removal of mn may be related to fe oxyhydroxides or schwertmannite adsorption and coprecipitation since unfiltered initial amd and krw were used for mixing the first increase in fe2 and al concentrations may be associated with the secondary dissolution of suspended particles fe al hydroxide colloids in the amd and mixed samples with decreasing ph 1 f e 2 0 25 o 2 h f e 3 0 5 h 2 o 2 f e 3 3 h 2 o f e o h 3 s 3 h 3 4 f e 2 o 2 4 h acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans 4 f e 3 2 h 2 o 4 8 f e 3 x s o 4 2 16 12 x h 2 o f

in the solution gradually decreases with time and the higher the concentration of fe2 is the faster the consumption of do in the mixed samples fig 2b 2e which suggest that the reduced do concentration can affect the further oxidation of fe2 in these samples as the reaction proceeding the h concentration in the samples gradually increases and the ph gradually decreases furthermore the eh measurements describe the redox state which can be increased with the transformation of fe2 to fe3 in general conductivity is a measure of the concentration of ions in solution but the conductivity of the solution is not only related to the ion concentration but also related to the ion species in which h and oh have a significant influence on the ec of the solution artemov et al 2015 thus in the samples with a higher proportion of amd the h formed by parts of fe2 hydrolysis may slightly increase the solution conductivity while the proportion of amd decreases the do in the water is sufficient the rate of fe2 oxidation is high and the solution ec value is slightly reduced due to fe deposition 4 2 dic loss during the evolution of water chemistry 4 2 1 the influence of amd on dic when ph of water is within the range of 6 9 bicarbonate hco3 is the dominant dic species the initial mean ph value of krw was 8 41 hence the dic in krast river water is mainly composed of hco3 additionally the main anions and cations in krw are hco3 ca2 and mg2 table s1 of the supplementary material which suggests that the chemical composition of river water are mainly impacted by the carbonate weathering in the study area therefore when amd is mixed with krw through different proportion the h in the amd can be first neutralized by the hco3 in krw which give rise to decrease the dic by releasing co2 g loss to the atmosphere reactions 7 represent this kinetic and equilibrium processes 7 hc o 3 h a h 2 o c o 2 aq b c o 2 g as viewed from table s1 of the supplementary material at the ph range measured for the amd 25 amd 50 amd 75 and amd 95 the dic species are mainly consist of co2 aq at 0 h and the mean initial ph is lower than 4 5 in these samples this indicates that h in the amd consumes most of the hco3 from krw causing carbonate buffing system in these samples to break down at the initial stage while the dic in amd 5 is mainly hco3 at 0 h suggesting the hco3 concentration is in excess of the h from small amounts of amd and krw has a certain buffering ability for a small amount of amd mixed in in addition as stated previously in section 4 1 the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 and subsequent hydrolysis of fe3 causes a further ph drop if the dic decrease due to protons produced from the chemical evolution of fe2 then the relationship between fe2 and dic can be used to assess this process as shown in fig 4 a there are positive relationships between fe2 and dic in the amd 100 and mixed samples which indicates that decreases in dic with time can be explained by the chemical evolution of fe2 meanwhile according to reactions 7 if dehydration of hco3 to co2 aq and subsequent conversion of co2 aq to co2 g occurs then the hco3 and co2 aq concentrations could continue to decrease with hco3 conversion and co2 release in fig 4b the amd 100 amd 95 amd 75 amd 50 and amd 25 shows a positive relationship between hco3 and co2 aq but the dic in these samples are mainly composed of co2 aq and they have a relatively high pco2 table s1 of the supplementary material these results suggest that dic concentrations decreased as the static duration prolonged were mainly controlled by co2 aq to co2 g however amd 5 shows a negative relationship between hco3 and co2 aq plus the dic primarily consists of hco3 at different stages table s1 of the supplementary material this may result from parts of the hco3 are gradually neutralized by h to form co2 aq it is deduced that the dic changes in amd 5 was primarily influenced by dehydration of hco3 4 2 2 estimation of the dic loss rate the theoretical dic concentration due to the dilution effects of each mixed sample when the neutralization reaction process is not considered and dilution effects caused only by the mixing process of amd and krw is shown in the second column in table 1 however compared with the calculated theoretical value the measured dic concentration in the mixed samples is significantly lower and the average loss of dic is 41 0 11 8 range from 26 1 6 5 to 52 6 0 1 in the initial mixing 0 h reflecting that instantaneous dic losses in the amd impact on the krw and the amount of dic lost as co2 g is related to the amount of initial amd and bicarbonate however prior study have shown that initial dic loss of 11 0 2 9 occurred in the amd mixed with tap water fonyuy and atekwana 2008b this may be due to the difference in ph value of amd because of the mean ph value of amd is 3 31 in our study and 5 74 fonyuy and atekwana 2008b respectively which also imply that the lower the ph of the amd the higher the amount of dic loss during initial mixing process after 240 h the average dic loss of the mixed samples reaching 60 7 10 2 range from 43 0 1 1 to 69 3 1 5 besides the dic loss in the amd reaching 31 5 4 4 this results coincide with previous observation that the effects of fe2 oxidation followed by fe3 hydrolysis will provoke caused decreased in dic atekwana and fonyuy 2009 fonyuy and atekwana 2008a while krw 100 shows the lowest dic loss rate 1 0 0 8 since all samples in this study were placed in the laboratory and covered in this experiment and reduced the oxygen exchange process between water and the atmosphere therefore the oxidation of fe2 could be carried out solely by using the existing do in the amd and mixed samples as observed in table 1 all samples but amd 5 have the highest do loss rate 80 and low fe2 oxidation rates sample amd 5 also present the lowest fe2 concentration which imply that the highest fe2 oxidation rate may associated with sufficient do supplement then affected the oxidation efficiency of fe2 to fe3 give rise to reduce production rate of protons by biomineralization or fe3 hydrolysis in addition the loss of dic as co2 g is related not only to ph but also to temperature and atmospheric pco2 as well as the degree of agitation and aeration of the sample fonyuy and atekwana 2008a this study had a short experimental time with little change in water temperature and atmospheric co2 which had less effect on co2 g in the reaction samples however due to the weathering of carbonate rocks rivers in karst areas are rich in dic which would lead to a higher co2 emission fluxes than the rivers in nonkarst areas liu and han 2020 pu et al 2019 moreover most coal mines are located in karst mountainous areas where the river slopes are steep the water depth is shallow and the underlying surface of the riverbed is irregular these conditions facilitate to produce turbulence in the river with a high do due to agitation this could provides sufficient do for the oxidation of fe2 from amd which could further bring about increase the dic loss rate in amd contaminated karst river water under filed conditions since the static experiment shows that the dic loss of the karst river water under the influence of the amd is high we infer that the co2 release flux from amd contaminated karst river water could be further enhanced and expected to diminish the net carbon sink capacity in the karst watershed thus the dic loss caused by amd directly flowing into rivers from abandoned karst coal mines cannot be ignored 4 3 δ13cdic fractionation in amd polluted karst river water the relationship between the ratio of dic and δ13cdic can be used as a qualitative guide to evaluate changes in hco3 and co2 aq on δ13cdic fonyuy and atekwana 2008b as viewed from fig 5 along with the proportion of amd increasing the initial mixed samples tend to be more consistent with the amd isotopic composition it possible that the presence of co2 aq in amd as part of the mixed samples since the dic pool in the mixed samples consists of three parts 1 co2 aq from amd 2 hco3 in krw converted into co2 aq under the neutralization of h and 3 residual hco3 if the hco3 concentration is in excess of h thus the higher the amd volume ratio is the greater the effect on the initial dic isotopic composition of the mixed sample in addition if the neutralization reaction between hco3 and h is not considered the mixed samples should be near the dashed line in fig 5 however our measured data are are located to the lower right of the line it is suggest that the δ13cdic values of the mixed samples are higher than the theoretical values indicate that 13c isotopic fractionation accompanied by dic loss occurs at the initial mixing stage the δ13cdic value in amd 95 amd 75 amd 50 and amd 25 are increased by less than 0 8 compared with the theoretical values and are increase by 0 30 0 56 from 0 h to 240 h since these samples experience rapid and complete conversion of hco3 and these processes will minimizing the enrichment between hco3 and co2 aq fonyuy and atekwana 2008b by contrast initial amd 5 increased by 1 44 compared with the theoretical values and the mean difference of δ13cdic value between 240 h and 0 h in amd 5 reached 1 46 so mixing of small amounts of amd with krw resulted in significant dic isotopic fractionation additionally fig 5 shows a negative relationship between δ13cdic and dic in the amd and mixed samples which indicates that the value of δ13cdic shows positive enrichment alongside the increasing dic loss and in accordance with reactions 7 the dic loss and its c isotopic compositions in amd and mixed samples are mainly affected by ① conversion of hco3 to co2 aq and ② transformation of co2 aq to co2 g both processes can lead to varying degrees of carbon isotope fractionation and the range of equilibrium fractionation factor is linearly correlated with the water temperature based on the equations of mook et al 1974 and zhang et al 1995 the ε13cco2 aq co2 g ranged from 1 36 to 1 37 at the measured temperatures during experiment period while ε13chco3 co2 g ranged from 8 92 to 9 27 thus the enrichment of 13c in the dic in the amd and mixed samples is related to the fractionation accompanying each step and the extent to which each step dominates dic evolution since the dic loss is continuously decreasing and has a relatively constant isotopic fractionation during hco3 dehydration in amd and mixed samples this process can be governed by first order kinetics thus the isotope fractionation in these samples can be modelled as a rayleigh function ali and atekwana 2009 fonyuy and atekwana 2008a δ13ct ε ct c0 δ13c0 where δ13ct is the measured dic carbon isotope ratio δ13c0 is the initial carbon isotope ratio of the sample ε is the isotopic enrichment factor given as αproduct αreactant 1 103 ct is the dic concentration measured at any time t and c0 is the dic concentration at the beginning of the experiment if the solution is in equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g then the dic concentration ct c0 does not change in solution will remain constant abongwa and atekwana 2013 as shown in fig 6 the krw 100 shows that a nearly invariant change in dic with slightly increase in δ13cdic so the krw 100 would in a certain condition of dic equilibration with atmospheric co2 however for those samples that the proportion of amd were higher than 25 the good positive trends were observed in δ13cdic correspond to decreasing concentrations of dic ct c0 it is further demonstrated that water chemical evolution can giver rise to the changes of c isotopic composition and they have a relatively lower slopes the rate of isotopic enrichment increases gradually with decreasing amd ranges from 0 61 to 1 47 for amd amd 95 amd 75 amd 50 and amd 25 which indicated that dic isotopic enrichment factor of these sample vary less throughout the static duration among them the amd and amd 95 has the lowest coefficient of determination it may be related with the small 13c enrichment rate of dic under the influence of lager amounts of amd because the dic from these samples is mainly composed of co2 aq at different stages table s1 of the supplementary material which suggest that all the hco3 from krw was converted to co2 aq in the mixed samples and the faster diffusion coefficient of 12co2 in to atmosphere which can result in the enrichment of 13c in the remaining dic this has been documented in field rivers cartwright 2010 liu and han 2020 but the fractionation accompanying the transfer of co2 aq to co2 g is relatively small in contrast amd 5 has a higher slope with a coefficient of determination of 0 93 fig 6 the enrichment factor in amd 5 is 7 44 which is close to ε13chco3 co2 g since the dic changes in amd 5 was primarily influenced by dehydration of hco3 hco3 dehydration proceeds with the progressively decreasing ph and 12c is preferentially incorporated into co2 aq in this process thus leaving hco3 enriched in 13c but with the pool of fe2 is exhausted in the sample isotopic enrichment is also may also be controlled by hco3 equilibrating with atmospheric co2 4 4 summary of the effect mechanism of dic in amd impacted karst river water this static experiment provide an insights for understand the effects of evolution of dic in amd impacted karst river water basis on what have been discussed above the evolution of dic after two types of water mixing are shown in fig 7 the dic in the karst river water is mainly hco3 after mixing with amd hco3 preferentially neutralizes the existing h in the amd numeral ① this process can cause a substantial hco3 loss 41 0 11 8 and then with the gradual oxidation of fe2 in the mixed water h is continuously generated numeral ② which further reduces the concentration of dic if the ph of mixed water is less than 4 and has a higher sulfate concentration 1000 to 3000 mg l the fe2 is mainly oxidized by biological oxidation otherwise it is oxidized by chemical oxidation the oxidation rate of fe2 is related to its concentration and the do content in the mixed water when the do content is sufficient an increase in fe2 concentration is conducive to the production of more h and dehydration of more hco3 during the entire mixing process if the total h in the amd and the rate of h produced by the chemical evolution of fe2 exceeds the rate of neutralization by hco3 the ph decreases continuously and the δ13cdic enrichment rate is dominated by the loss of co2 g and causes δ13cdic enrichment 1 numeral ③ at the same time due to the presence of a certain amount of dic mainly co2 aq in the amd the initial dic isotopic value of the mixed sample gradually tends to that of amd as the volume of amd increases however when the total h in amd is lower than the rate of neutralization by hco3 and the hco3 concentration is in excess of the h produced by fe2 the δ13cdic enrichment rate is dominated by hco3 dehydration and the δ13cdic enrichment increases by 1 0 numeral ④ owing to the river is a flowing state in field setting which is different from the static experiment the results of this experiment shows that the dic loss is higher after amd and krw are mixed therefore further field research work should be focus on the evolution of dic in the pollution zone formed by amd polluted rivers 5 conclusions in this study the effects of amd on the dic and its isotopes in karst river water were investigated experimentally and the following main conclusions were drawn 1 amd can cause a rapid decrease in karst river water ph increase the value of ec and eh and the rate of change in these indicators is related to the proportion of amd mixing with the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 in the mixed water sample and subsequent biogenic formation of schwertmannite or hydrolysis of fe3 which makes ph value do fe2 and mn were gradually decreased and eh progressively increased 2 the h in amd can rapidly neutralize the hco3 in karst river water causing bicarbonate dehydration the dic loss rates caused by different proportions of amd mixed with krw vary widely on average which causes dic losses of 41 0 11 8 in the early stage of mixing as co2 g release to the atmosphere and it will be continuously increases along with water chemistry evolution 3 if the total h in amd and the rate of h produced by fe2 oxidation exceeds the rate of neutralization by hco3 the δ13cdic enrichment rate is dominated by the loss of co2 g and causes a small 13c enrichment 1 while when the hco3 concentration is in excess of the h produced by fe2 and the total h in amd the δ13cdic enrichment rate is dominated by hco3 dehydration and causes the δ13cdic enrichment to increase by 1 0 even though our experiment could mimic the situation of shallow water with decreasing do condition the continuous co2 release indicate a substantial impact of amd on the ability of karst rivers to act as a c sink it is necessary to further study the carbon flux and net carbon sink in the amd impacted karst river basin with a long term field investigation most importantly the effective prevention and control techniques passive or active should be conducted to reduce the negative impact of amd waters on karst carbon sink credit authorship contribution statement xingxing cao conceptualization methodology

3101,acid mine drainage amd has caused serious pollution in the surface water environments of karst areas but the effect of amd on the dissolved inorganic carbon dic dynamics in the receiving karst rivers remains poorly understood the amd and karst river water were sampled from the yangliujie river watershed in southwest china and mixed different proportions of amd and karst river water in a laboratory experiment to simulate seasonal hydrological conditions in the river in an attempt to explore the impact of amd on the loss rate and evolution of dic in karst river water the results showed that amd can cause a rapid ph drop in karst river water resulting in approximately 41 0 11 8 dic loss in the early stage of mixing as co2 g release to the atmosphere with the biological or chemical oxidation of fe2 and followed by fe3 biogenic formation of schwertmannite or hydrolysis the ph decreased and the dic concentration further decreased in the mixed samples the degree of decrease was related to the oxidation rate of fe2 with decreasing dic concentration δ13cdic enrichment gradually increased when the mixing ratio of amd was large the total h in amd and h generated by the oxidation of fe2 exceeded the hco3 content in karst river water the isotopic enrichment coefficient caused by the initial mixing and the end of the reaction was small and the dic transformation was mainly dominated by the loss of co2 g when a small proportion of amd was mixed in the hco3 concentration in the mixed water sample was in excess of the h produced by fe2 and the total h in amd the isotopic enrichment coefficient caused by the initial mixing and the end of the reaction was larger and the dic conversion was mainly affected by hco3 dehydration these preliminary findings support evidence showing dic conversion and loss in amd affected karst rivers increase the transfer of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere which diminishes net carbon sink fluxes in karst river basins so reasonable amd treatment methods should be applied to minimize these negative impacts keywords carbon release karst river carbon isotopic composition acid mine drainage coal mine data availability l have shared the link to my data at the attach file step 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd from the mining of coal and metal sulfide deposits continues to be a concern because it can cause serious environmental pollution owing to its high acidity toxic metal content and sulfate content acharya and kharel 2020 feng et al 2014 it is estimated that approximately 20 000 to 50 000 mines around the world discharge this kind of acidic water which has caused approximately 6400 km of rivers 8000 to 16 000 km of streams and 720 km2 of lakes and reservoirs to be seriously polluted johnson and hallberg 2005 rezaie and anderson 2020 creating a challenge for the global mining industry chen et al 2021 even if a mine is closed amd continues to flow out from the mine when amd enters downstream rivers it causes the ph value of the receiving water to decrease and the water quality to seriously drop ni et al 2008 dissolved inorganic carbon dic is the main form of dissolved carbon in river water bauer and bianchi 2011 and previous studies have shown that the dic in river water can be converted to co2 g under the influence of amd abongwa et al 2016 ali and atekwana 2011 fonyuy and atekwana 2008a vesper et al 2016 and increasing the co2 emissions of the receiving water which seriously affects the carbon cycle process of the river therefore the excitation effect of amd on the carbon sources cannot be ignored the dissolution process of carbonate rocks can consume co2 in the atmosphere soil and store it in the karst water as the form of hco3 ca1 xmgx co3 co2 h2o 1 x ca2 xmg2 2hco3 this carbon sink effect formed by karstification processes has attracted much attention cao et al 2018 liu et al 2011 this process also suggests that dic is an important indicator in the study of carbon sinks and the carbon cycle of karstification and there are relatively high dic concentrations in karst river water compared with other nonkarst rivers prior studies have shown that amd discharged from abandoned coal mines degrades surface water quality in karst areas chen et al 2015 jiang et al 2020 and that amd can also flow into karst aquifers through the conduits and promote the dissolution of carbonate rocks which releases more co2 to the atmosphere ren et al 2021 however the influence of amd on the dic of karst surface rivers has not attracted enough attention it is important to quantify properly the dic loss rate and the regulatory factors acting in this process this lack of knowledge affect our understanding about how to control the effect of the amd on the dic in karst surface rivers the southwest china karst region is one of the largest karst areas of the major concentrated karst regions in the world and guizhou province is not only located in the centre of the karst area in southwest china bai and zhou 2020 zhao et al 2018 but also an important coal base in southwest china the coal reserve ranks fifth in china and most of the coal mines are located in the karst mountainous area the sulfur content of most coal mines in guizhou is generally high close to or higher than 3 mainly pyrite feng et al 2014 and the exploitation method applied to the coal resources is mainly underground mining after coal mining multiple mined out areas are formed and groundwater gradually accumulates and easily forms amd then the accumulated acid water that naturally flows from these abandoned mines it is estimated that over a thousand coal mines have been closed in guizhou resulting in a wide range of abandoned coal caves and gangue dumps with amd flowing out owing to the high cost and technical difficulty of amd treatment only some of amd discharge from abandoned mines can be treated effectively this often result in the pollution of downstream river for the discharged amd in the karst mountain area zhang et al 2010 therefore amd emissions from abandoned coal mines have become one of the major current water environmental problems in guizhou which makes guizhou a highly representative area where karst geology and amd coexist however little information is available about the river dic transformation process in this geological setting because the discharge of amd and karst rivers has seasonal dynamic characteristics the acid base neutralization reaction is relatively fast and the hydrolysis of metal ions in amd can further provide h which makes it difficult to detect the fate of dic in the field under the fast mixing process in the river whereas the laboratory experiments can provide one of the ways to preliminary explore the evolution of dic and its isotope in amd polluted karst river water therefore in this study representative amd and corresponding affected karst river water were collected from guizhou and mixed at different volume ratios and the mixed water was continuous interval sampled 1 to document the changes in dic concentrations and isotope compositions δ13cdic in karst river water receiving amd 2 to reveal the dic loss due to the chemical evolution of amd and 3 to discuss the reaction mechanism and fractionation of δ13cdic accompanying the evolution of amd the goal of this research is to make a contribution to understand the carbon cycle and geochemical behaviour of dic in karst rivers under the influence of amd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 26 24 20 3 26 23 45 9 n 107 29 3 69 107 29 34 6 e is located in the upper reaches of the yangliujie river in duyun city fig 1 a guizhou province southwest china it has a humid subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 16 1 c and an average annual rainfall of 1431 1 mm the permian carbonate strata are mainly distributed in the basin and there is also a small amount of clastic rock strata in the devonian and carboniferous due to the abundant coal mine resources in the catchment underground coal mining activities began from the 1950s to the 1980s which has resulted in more than 300 abandoned coal mines of different sizes distributed in the basin and a large amount of coal mine acid drainage entering the yanliujie river the samples collected in this study are located in the boluochong coal mine which was closed in 2014 fig 1b the amd discharge of this mine is approximately 600 1500 m3 d mo 2010 the water quality in the yangliujie river seriously deteriorates after the confluence of the amd field investigation found that a large number of iron flocs were formed at the intersection of the amd and karst river water fig 1c 2 2 experimental design and analytical methods amd and karst river water krw samples were collected from the boluochong coal mine and yangliujie river in november 2021 to reflect the variation in the mixing ratio of amd and karst river water due to the fluctuation in drainage amd karst river water mixing experiments were carried out in 20 l clear plastic containers at room temperature we designed an experiment consisting of seven reactors namely amd 100 amd 95 amd 75 amd 50 amd 25 amd 5 and krw 100 with amd to karst river water volume ratios of 100 0 95 5 75 25 50 50 25 75 5 95 and 0 100 respectively duplicate samples were produced for each ratio and all of the reactors were covered with a plastic lid to prevent water evaporation but the reactors were open during the sampling time upon the filling of the reactors with the proper ratios of amd and karst river water the reactor was stirred using glass bars for approximately 1 min to ensure thorough mixing the ph water temperature c dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec redox potential eh fe2 and alkalinity alk were measured after mixing and water samples were collected for chemical and isotopic measurements then the reactors were subsequently sampled every 48 h intervals for physical chemical and isotopic analyses after thorough mechanical mixing and the entire duration of the experiment was 240 h samples for major element analysis were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and stored in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and samples for dic concentration and isotope composition analysis were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and stored in 15 ml brown plastic bottles the water temperature ph ec do and eh were measured by a handheld multiparameter probe multi 3630 wtw germany sx 630 sanxin china and the alk concentrations were measured by dilute hydrochloric acid titration using bromophenol green methyl red as an indicator the so4 2 content was determined by barium chromate spectrophotometry fe2 and mn were measured by colorimetry using the phenanthroline and formaldehyde oxime method immediately after sampling ca2 and mg2 were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry aas tas 990 persee china and al was analysed by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms xseriesii thermo fisher usa the dic concentration and carbon isotope composition were determined with an elemental analysis isotope ratios mass spectrometer irms delta v advantage thermo fisher usa coupled with a gasbench ii the carbon isotope ratios are reported in the delta notation δ s a m p l e r sample r sample 1 1000 where δsample is the stable isotope ratio in the water samples and rsample and rstandard are the ratios of 13c 12c in the water sample and in the standard respectively the δ13cdic is reported in delta notation relative to the vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb carbon standard the analytical precisions for dic concentrations and δ13cdic were 5 and 0 06 respectively 2 3 data processing and analysis the partial pressure of dissolved co2 log pco2 and dic were calculated with the hydrogeochemical computer software phreeqc v 2 using the phreeqc database parkhurst and appelo 1999 the solution conditions in the input file included the ph value temperature and concentrations of major ions and dic table s1 of the supplementary material and the output file contained the values of the co2 partial pressure and dic differences between different treatments were analysed using oneway anova with duncan s multiple comparison tests in spss 20 0 software and were considered to be significant at the p 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 the physicochemical properties variations of different treatments the results of water chemistry and isotope composition from the unmixed and mixed water samples are shown in table s1 of the supplementary material and fig 2 shows that the changes of ph ec do eh fe2 mn and al in the samples at different stages the initial krw 100 has relatively high value of ph and do with mean of 8 41 and 9 67 mg l respectively and has lower value of eh and ec mean of 200 mv and 470 μs cm respectively these parameters in krw 100 did not significantly change as the sampling time increased in addition the krw 100 had a trace concentration of al and both mn and fe2 were below the detection limit indicating that the heavy metal concentration in uncontaminated karst river water was extremely low however the mean values of ph ec do and eh of the initial amd 100 were 3 31 3645 μs cm 3 71 mg l and 387 mv respectively after 240 h the mean values of ph ec do and eh were 3 07 3680 μs cm 0 25 mg l and 414 mv in the amd 100 respectively indicates that the ph and do decreased and the eh increased with static duration in amd 100 and the mixed water samples exhibited the similar characteristics with amd 100 in addition the ph do and eh changed rapidly in the amd 100 amd 95 and amd 75 especially the do concentration which was generally less than 1 mg l after 96 h all samples of amd 5 had a relatively low eh value overall with the proportion of amd and the reaction time increased the ph and do of the mixed water decreased and the ec and eh increased the solutions ec value were significantly different between 240 h and 0 h overall the ec increased slightly as the static duration increased in the samples that amd proportion was greater than or equal to 50 while in these samples with less than 50 amd the ec value decreased slightly after 240 h the fe2 and mn concentrations in amd 100 and mixed samples shows significantly different at different sampling period and the fe2 concentrations tended to rise first from 0 h to 96 h and then decreased in these samples the mn concentrations decreased as the static duration increased the al concentrations in these samples were not significantly different because most samples had low ph alk values could be detected only in the krw 100 and amd 5 samples table s1 of the supplementary material the mean alk was 219 8 mg l in krw 100 and did not show changes with the static duration increased while when a small amount of amd was added that of the amd 5 samples reduced to 120 mg l and after 240 h had reduced to 81 6 mg l indicating that a small amount of amd inflow could significantly reduce karst river water alk 3 2 the dic concentration and δ13cdic variations of different treatments the changes of dic and δ13cdic of different water samples are shown in fig 3 the mean dic concentrations in the initial krw 100 mean of 3 90 mmol c l higher than initial amd 100 mean of 1 19 mmol c l and the mean of δ13cdic in initial krw 100 is 9 23 while 12 0 in initial amd 100 the dic were significantly different in amd 100 between 0 h and 240 h in contrast the variation found in krw 100 can be considered negligible after mixing amd and krw in different volume proportions as the proportion of amd decreased the dic and its carbon isotopic composition of the mixed samples gradually increased fig 3a as a whole the dic concentrations were reduced to varying degrees in mixed samples as the sampling time increased meanwhile the δ13cdic shows small increased with the decline of dic concentration fig 3b and especially in the amd 5 4 discussion 4 1 water chemistry evolution of amd mixed with karst river water the initial amd has a low ph and higher heavy metal concentration while krw shows the opposite characteristics thus when the two types of water are mixed in different proportions the fe2 mn and al concentration in the initial mixed samples shows significant change due to the dilution effect affects on the other hand the changes in the physicochemical parameters with static duration increased that can be explained by metal ion hydrolysis the valence state of the metal ions in solution is correlated with ph and eh and fe2 mn2 and al3 are the forms present in the amd and mixed samples based on the ph eh diagrams of brookins 1988 for the range of ph and eh measured during this study generally fe2 is oxidized to fe3 and afterwards fe3 is hydrolysed to fe oh 3 s according to reactions 1 and 2 however previous studies have shown that in the ph 4 0 system fe2 is difficult to be chemically oxidized by o2 it is mainly oxidized by biological oxidation for example by acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans a ferrooxidans smith et al 1988 wang and zhou 2012 due to the extremely acidic and sulfate rich conditions under the promotion of a ferrooxidans sulfate preferentially combines with fe3 to form iron hydroxysulfate minerals instead of fe oh 3 or ferrihydrite bigham et al 1996 hedrich et al 2011 in general when the ph is in the range of 2 5 to 4 0 and the sulfate concentration is 1000 to 3000 mg l blgham et al 1990 schwertmannite is inclined to form under the influence of biomineralization by a ferrooxidans reactions 3 and 4 and further increases in ph can form iron hydroxy compounds such as goethite ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite according to table s1 of the supplementary material the ph value and sulfate concentration of amd 100 amd 95 amd 75 and amd 50 are within the optimal conditions for schwertmannite formation which suggests that the oxidation of fe2 in these samples is mainly biological oxidation however the amd 25 constitute a boundary below which the biological oxidation rate is reduced the mean ph value of amd 5 is higher than 6 with a lower sulfate concentration 200 mg l which indicates that fe2 is oxidized to fe3 through chemical oxidation and that fe3 is subsequently hydrolysed to fe oh 3 s according to reactions 1 and 2 in addition although the hydrolysis of al3 and mn2 can generate protons the higher ph required for this reaction and fig 2 a shows that the ph of the reaction solution gradually decreases with sampling time increased which inhibits the hydrolysis of al and mn indicating that reactions 5 and 6 are less likely to occur in the amd 100 and mixed samples the removal of mn may be related to fe oxyhydroxides or schwertmannite adsorption and coprecipitation since unfiltered initial amd and krw were used for mixing the first increase in fe2 and al concentrations may be associated with the secondary dissolution of suspended particles fe al hydroxide colloids in the amd and mixed samples with decreasing ph 1 f e 2 0 25 o 2 h f e 3 0 5 h 2 o 2 f e 3 3 h 2 o f e o h 3 s 3 h 3 4 f e 2 o 2 4 h acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans 4 f e 3 2 h 2 o 4 8 f e 3 x s o 4 2 16 12 x h 2 o f

in the solution gradually decreases with time and the higher the concentration of fe2 is the faster the consumption of do in the mixed samples fig 2b 2e which suggest that the reduced do concentration can affect the further oxidation of fe2 in these samples as the reaction proceeding the h concentration in the samples gradually increases and the ph gradually decreases furthermore the eh measurements describe the redox state which can be increased with the transformation of fe2 to fe3 in general conductivity is a measure of the concentration of ions in solution but the conductivity of the solution is not only related to the ion concentration but also related to the ion species in which h and oh have a significant influence on the ec of the solution artemov et al 2015 thus in the samples with a higher proportion of amd the h formed by parts of fe2 hydrolysis may slightly increase the solution conductivity while the proportion of amd decreases the do in the water is sufficient the rate of fe2 oxidation is high and the solution ec value is slightly reduced due to fe deposition 4 2 dic loss during the evolution of water chemistry 4 2 1 the influence of amd on dic when ph of water is within the range of 6 9 bicarbonate hco3 is the dominant dic species the initial mean ph value of krw was 8 41 hence the dic in krast river water is mainly composed of hco3 additionally the main anions and cations in krw are hco3 ca2 and mg2 table s1 of the supplementary material which suggests that the chemical composition of river water are mainly impacted by the carbonate weathering in the study area therefore when amd is mixed with krw through different proportion the h in the amd can be first neutralized by the hco3 in krw which give rise to decrease the dic by releasing co2 g loss to the atmosphere reactions 7 represent this kinetic and equilibrium processes 7 hc o 3 h a h 2 o c o 2 aq b c o 2 g as viewed from table s1 of the supplementary material at the ph range measured for the amd 25 amd 50 amd 75 and amd 95 the dic species are mainly consist of co2 aq at 0 h and the mean initial ph is lower than 4 5 in these samples this indicates that h in the amd consumes most of the hco3 from krw causing carbonate buffing system in these samples to break down at the initial stage while the dic in amd 5 is mainly hco3 at 0 h suggesting the hco3 concentration is in excess of the h from small amounts of amd and krw has a certain buffering ability for a small amount of amd mixed in in addition as stated previously in section 4 1 the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 and subsequent hydrolysis of fe3 causes a further ph drop if the dic decrease due to protons produced from the chemical evolution of fe2 then the relationship between fe2 and dic can be used to assess this process as shown in fig 4 a there are positive relationships between fe2 and dic in the amd 100 and mixed samples which indicates that decreases in dic with time can be explained by the chemical evolution of fe2 meanwhile according to reactions 7 if dehydration of hco3 to co2 aq and subsequent conversion of co2 aq to co2 g occurs then the hco3 and co2 aq concentrations could continue to decrease with hco3 conversion and co2 release in fig 4b the amd 100 amd 95 amd 75 amd 50 and amd 25 shows a positive relationship between hco3 and co2 aq but the dic in these samples are mainly composed of co2 aq and they have a relatively high pco2 table s1 of the supplementary material these results suggest that dic concentrations decreased as the static duration prolonged were mainly controlled by co2 aq to co2 g however amd 5 shows a negative relationship between hco3 and co2 aq plus the dic primarily consists of hco3 at different stages table s1 of the supplementary material this may result from parts of the hco3 are gradually neutralized by h to form co2 aq it is deduced that the dic changes in amd 5 was primarily influenced by dehydration of hco3 4 2 2 estimation of the dic loss rate the theoretical dic concentration due to the dilution effects of each mixed sample when the neutralization reaction process is not considered and dilution effects caused only by the mixing process of amd and krw is shown in the second column in table 1 however compared with the calculated theoretical value the measured dic concentration in the mixed samples is significantly lower and the average loss of dic is 41 0 11 8 range from 26 1 6 5 to 52 6 0 1 in the initial mixing 0 h reflecting that instantaneous dic losses in the amd impact on the krw and the amount of dic lost as co2 g is related to the amount of initial amd and bicarbonate however prior study have shown that initial dic loss of 11 0 2 9 occurred in the amd mixed with tap water fonyuy and atekwana 2008b this may be due to the difference in ph value of amd because of the mean ph value of amd is 3 31 in our study and 5 74 fonyuy and atekwana 2008b respectively which also imply that the lower the ph of the amd the higher the amount of dic loss during initial mixing process after 240 h the average dic loss of the mixed samples reaching 60 7 10 2 range from 43 0 1 1 to 69 3 1 5 besides the dic loss in the amd reaching 31 5 4 4 this results coincide with previous observation that the effects of fe2 oxidation followed by fe3 hydrolysis will provoke caused decreased in dic atekwana and fonyuy 2009 fonyuy and atekwana 2008a while krw 100 shows the lowest dic loss rate 1 0 0 8 since all samples in this study were placed in the laboratory and covered in this experiment and reduced the oxygen exchange process between water and the atmosphere therefore the oxidation of fe2 could be carried out solely by using the existing do in the amd and mixed samples as observed in table 1 all samples but amd 5 have the highest do loss rate 80 and low fe2 oxidation rates sample amd 5 also present the lowest fe2 concentration which imply that the highest fe2 oxidation rate may associated with sufficient do supplement then affected the oxidation efficiency of fe2 to fe3 give rise to reduce production rate of protons by biomineralization or fe3 hydrolysis in addition the loss of dic as co2 g is related not only to ph but also to temperature and atmospheric pco2 as well as the degree of agitation and aeration of the sample fonyuy and atekwana 2008a this study had a short experimental time with little change in water temperature and atmospheric co2 which had less effect on co2 g in the reaction samples however due to the weathering of carbonate rocks rivers in karst areas are rich in dic which would lead to a higher co2 emission fluxes than the rivers in nonkarst areas liu and han 2020 pu et al 2019 moreover most coal mines are located in karst mountainous areas where the river slopes are steep the water depth is shallow and the underlying surface of the riverbed is irregular these conditions facilitate to produce turbulence in the river with a high do due to agitation this could provides sufficient do for the oxidation of fe2 from amd which could further bring about increase the dic loss rate in amd contaminated karst river water under filed conditions since the static experiment shows that the dic loss of the karst river water under the influence of the amd is high we infer that the co2 release flux from amd contaminated karst river water could be further enhanced and expected to diminish the net carbon sink capacity in the karst watershed thus the dic loss caused by amd directly flowing into rivers from abandoned karst coal mines cannot be ignored 4 3 δ13cdic fractionation in amd polluted karst river water the relationship between the ratio of dic and δ13cdic can be used as a qualitative guide to evaluate changes in hco3 and co2 aq on δ13cdic fonyuy and atekwana 2008b as viewed from fig 5 along with the proportion of amd increasing the initial mixed samples tend to be more consistent with the amd isotopic composition it possible that the presence of co2 aq in amd as part of the mixed samples since the dic pool in the mixed samples consists of three parts 1 co2 aq from amd 2 hco3 in krw converted into co2 aq under the neutralization of h and 3 residual hco3 if the hco3 concentration is in excess of h thus the higher the amd volume ratio is the greater the effect on the initial dic isotopic composition of the mixed sample in addition if the neutralization reaction between hco3 and h is not considered the mixed samples should be near the dashed line in fig 5 however our measured data are are located to the lower right of the line it is suggest that the δ13cdic values of the mixed samples are higher than the theoretical values indicate that 13c isotopic fractionation accompanied by dic loss occurs at the initial mixing stage the δ13cdic value in amd 95 amd 75 amd 50 and amd 25 are increased by less than 0 8 compared with the theoretical values and are increase by 0 30 0 56 from 0 h to 240 h since these samples experience rapid and complete conversion of hco3 and these processes will minimizing the enrichment between hco3 and co2 aq fonyuy and atekwana 2008b by contrast initial amd 5 increased by 1 44 compared with the theoretical values and the mean difference of δ13cdic value between 240 h and 0 h in amd 5 reached 1 46 so mixing of small amounts of amd with krw resulted in significant dic isotopic fractionation additionally fig 5 shows a negative relationship between δ13cdic and dic in the amd and mixed samples which indicates that the value of δ13cdic shows positive enrichment alongside the increasing dic loss and in accordance with reactions 7 the dic loss and its c isotopic compositions in amd and mixed samples are mainly affected by ① conversion of hco3 to co2 aq and ② transformation of co2 aq to co2 g both processes can lead to varying degrees of carbon isotope fractionation and the range of equilibrium fractionation factor is linearly correlated with the water temperature based on the equations of mook et al 1974 and zhang et al 1995 the ε13cco2 aq co2 g ranged from 1 36 to 1 37 at the measured temperatures during experiment period while ε13chco3 co2 g ranged from 8 92 to 9 27 thus the enrichment of 13c in the dic in the amd and mixed samples is related to the fractionation accompanying each step and the extent to which each step dominates dic evolution since the dic loss is continuously decreasing and has a relatively constant isotopic fractionation during hco3 dehydration in amd and mixed samples this process can be governed by first order kinetics thus the isotope fractionation in these samples can be modelled as a rayleigh function ali and atekwana 2009 fonyuy and atekwana 2008a δ13ct ε ct c0 δ13c0 where δ13ct is the measured dic carbon isotope ratio δ13c0 is the initial carbon isotope ratio of the sample ε is the isotopic enrichment factor given as αproduct αreactant 1 103 ct is the dic concentration measured at any time t and c0 is the dic concentration at the beginning of the experiment if the solution is in equilibrium with atmospheric co2 g then the dic concentration ct c0 does not change in solution will remain constant abongwa and atekwana 2013 as shown in fig 6 the krw 100 shows that a nearly invariant change in dic with slightly increase in δ13cdic so the krw 100 would in a certain condition of dic equilibration with atmospheric co2 however for those samples that the proportion of amd were higher than 25 the good positive trends were observed in δ13cdic correspond to decreasing concentrations of dic ct c0 it is further demonstrated that water chemical evolution can giver rise to the changes of c isotopic composition and they have a relatively lower slopes the rate of isotopic enrichment increases gradually with decreasing amd ranges from 0 61 to 1 47 for amd amd 95 amd 75 amd 50 and amd 25 which indicated that dic isotopic enrichment factor of these sample vary less throughout the static duration among them the amd and amd 95 has the lowest coefficient of determination it may be related with the small 13c enrichment rate of dic under the influence of lager amounts of amd because the dic from these samples is mainly composed of co2 aq at different stages table s1 of the supplementary material which suggest that all the hco3 from krw was converted to co2 aq in the mixed samples and the faster diffusion coefficient of 12co2 in to atmosphere which can result in the enrichment of 13c in the remaining dic this has been documented in field rivers cartwright 2010 liu and han 2020 but the fractionation accompanying the transfer of co2 aq to co2 g is relatively small in contrast amd 5 has a higher slope with a coefficient of determination of 0 93 fig 6 the enrichment factor in amd 5 is 7 44 which is close to ε13chco3 co2 g since the dic changes in amd 5 was primarily influenced by dehydration of hco3 hco3 dehydration proceeds with the progressively decreasing ph and 12c is preferentially incorporated into co2 aq in this process thus leaving hco3 enriched in 13c but with the pool of fe2 is exhausted in the sample isotopic enrichment is also may also be controlled by hco3 equilibrating with atmospheric co2 4 4 summary of the effect mechanism of dic in amd impacted karst river water this static experiment provide an insights for understand the effects of evolution of dic in amd impacted karst river water basis on what have been discussed above the evolution of dic after two types of water mixing are shown in fig 7 the dic in the karst river water is mainly hco3 after mixing with amd hco3 preferentially neutralizes the existing h in the amd numeral ① this process can cause a substantial hco3 loss 41 0 11 8 and then with the gradual oxidation of fe2 in the mixed water h is continuously generated numeral ② which further reduces the concentration of dic if the ph of mixed water is less than 4 and has a higher sulfate concentration 1000 to 3000 mg l the fe2 is mainly oxidized by biological oxidation otherwise it is oxidized by chemical oxidation the oxidation rate of fe2 is related to its concentration and the do content in the mixed water when the do content is sufficient an increase in fe2 concentration is conducive to the production of more h and dehydration of more hco3 during the entire mixing process if the total h in the amd and the rate of h produced by the chemical evolution of fe2 exceeds the rate of neutralization by hco3 the ph decreases continuously and the δ13cdic enrichment rate is dominated by the loss of co2 g and causes δ13cdic enrichment 1 numeral ③ at the same time due to the presence of a certain amount of dic mainly co2 aq in the amd the initial dic isotopic value of the mixed sample gradually tends to that of amd as the volume of amd increases however when the total h in amd is lower than the rate of neutralization by hco3 and the hco3 concentration is in excess of the h produced by fe2 the δ13cdic enrichment rate is dominated by hco3 dehydration and the δ13cdic enrichment increases by 1 0 numeral ④ owing to the river is a flowing state in field setting which is different from the static experiment the results of this experiment shows that the dic loss is higher after amd and krw are mixed therefore further field research work should be focus on the evolution of dic in the pollution zone formed by amd polluted rivers 5 conclusions in this study the effects of amd on the dic and its isotopes in karst river water were investigated experimentally and the following main conclusions were drawn 1 amd can cause a rapid decrease in karst river water ph increase the value of ec and eh and the rate of change in these indicators is related to the proportion of amd mixing with the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 in the mixed water sample and subsequent biogenic formation of schwertmannite or hydrolysis of fe3 which makes ph value do fe2 and mn were gradually decreased and eh progressively increased 2 the h in amd can rapidly neutralize the hco3 in karst river water causing bicarbonate dehydration the dic loss rates caused by different proportions of amd mixed with krw vary widely on average which causes dic losses of 41 0 11 8 in the early stage of mixing as co2 g release to the atmosphere and it will be continuously increases along with water chemistry evolution 3 if the total h in amd and the rate of h produced by fe2 oxidation exceeds the rate of neutralization by hco3 the δ13cdic enrichment rate is dominated by the loss of co2 g and causes a small 13c enrichment 1 while when the hco3 concentration is in excess of the h produced by fe2 and the total h in amd the δ13cdic enrichment rate is dominated by hco3 dehydration and causes the δ13cdic enrichment to increase by 1 0 even though our experiment could mimic the situation of shallow water with decreasing do condition the continuous co2 release indicate a substantial impact of amd on the ability of karst rivers to act as a c sink it is necessary to further study the carbon flux and net carbon sink in the amd impacted karst river basin with a long term field investigation most importantly the effective prevention and control techniques passive or active should be conducted to reduce the negative impact of amd waters on karst carbon sink credit authorship contribution statement xingxing cao conceptualization methodology

advection dispersion modelling admodel p 2 to advance the understanding of in stream phosphorus transformation processes and 3 to explore their relation to controlling factors water temperature seasonality and water flow for a case study of the river swale uk modelling results in agreement with results based on experimental data show that resuspension is the largest contributor to the

inorganic to organic forms is important in channel sinks appear more important than sources for soluble reactive phosphorus srp during 80 of the time while there is no clear evidence that organic

increased attention they receive currently at global level is motivated by their key role in the agriculture e g fertilizers and in the ecosystem dynamics e g as limiting nutrients for algae production increased loads of phosphorus to waterbodies is usually the primary driver for the eutrophication of freshwater bodies charlton et al 2018 colborne et al 2019 zinabu et al 2018 the european environment agency s databases on the status and quality of europe s water resources waterbase shows evidence that the average concentration of phosphates in european rivers is larger during the period 2000 2017 compared to the period 1992 2017 even if a decrease of 1 6 per year is indicated over the last two three decades eea 2019 mainly attributed to the improved waste water treatment technologies among river water bodies assessed by the environment agency in england 55 were at less than good ecological status with respect to p concentrations in 2016 environment agency 2018 while an earlier report indicates the figure to be just 45 environment agency 2012 concern surrounds persistence of elevated levels due to release of legacy p held in riverbed sediments that offset benefits of reduced pollutant load from the land and other sources such as improved waste water treatment moreover recent research shows that p concentrations are and will remain high enough to fail p standards until 2050 charlton et al 2018 jarvie et al 2018 hutchins et al 2016 ockenden et al 2016 or are greater than ecologically limiting thresholds riley et al 2018 and emphasise the increasing risk of eutrophication dangers associated principally to p compounds are long established and widely investigated for rivers in england and worldwide harrison et al 2019a and 2019b charlton et al 2018

degradation with respect to p should be underpinned by deep understanding of the behaviour and fate of p species and on the prediction of its future trends recent work underlines the important role of water quality models which include p concentrations riley et al 2018 tuo et al 2015 charlton et al 2018 to support high quality decision making and water management the mathematical modelling of water quality facilitates both understanding of phenomena and its prediction even in cases where the availability of experimental data is limited ani et al 2009 such modelling can be carried out at different levels of magnitude and detail starting from the small scale hundreds of meters of river stretch to the global scale see the models discussed by harrison et al 2019b depending on the area of interest its particularities and the needs with respect to the resolution in terms of space and time the spectrum of approaches extends between a catchment scale modelling describing a catchment or multiple catchments not necessarily high resolution in terms of space and time mainly based on usual long term monitoring data keraga et al 2019 srinivas and singh 2018 and b modelling of river stretches based on high resolution data multiple monitoring points along the stretch where measurements of channel characteristics hydrodynamic data and water quality data are needed such as admodel for nitrogen ani et al 2011 in terms of advancing system understanding river p transport studies of both types have proven valuable in many respects a facilitate understanding of catchment scale

colborne et al 2019 liberoff et al 2019 records et al 2016 ramos et al 2015 during recent years river stretch studies type b including high resolution measurements of p species and advective dispersive non conservative transport have become less common this is most probably due to the difficulties and great costs associated to gathering the needed high resolution data which despite recent advances halliday et al 2015 rode et al 2016 is still not commonplace and also a change in focus towards studies covering larger spatial scales valuable recent studies include those of dou et al 2018 and nguyen et al 2018 while earlier studies are a lot more abundant as shown by mateus et al 2018 gao and li 2014 wang et al 2013 tsakiris and alexakis 2012 or ani et al 2010 for effective basin scale management it is important to maintain small scale modelling development to inform appropriate and sufficiently accurate process representation in larger scale models tang et al 2019 the extent to which in channel transformations are important in determining catchment scale fluxes is unclear conservative or black box modelling approaches with simple dependencies on residence time zhang et al 2017 or sedimentation jackson blake et al 2017 may provide sufficient representation but this merits further attention in this context admodel a model based upon detailed representation of pollutant advection and dispersion has been successfully developed for simulation of nitrogen compounds ani et al 2011 and performs comparably to a contrasting but extensively tested model questor boorman 2003a 2003b that assumes complete mixing in asset of reaches the advection dispersion approach was calibrated and evaluated by considering the transport parameters e g dispersion coefficients convective velocity and associated nutrient nitrogen transformations nitrate and ammonium given the need to better understand phosphorus dynamics in rivers it is important to build on the approach by developing from first principles a compatible approach for phosphorus the potential that would then arise for an integrated approach covering multiple nutrient determinands is of much value the river swale in north east england has been the focus or a part of a wide range of studies on phosphorus i speciation in the main channel based on weekly river monitoring data jarvie et al 1998 including the

understanding in the swale a detailed modelling approach as adopted in admodel p is lacking findings from process based studies will be revisited later to provide invaluable context for a modelling study on the p transformations therefore the objectives of the present paper are 1 to offer a new validated detailed modelling tool admodel p for the prediction of p compounds transport along a

transformation processes 3 to explore their relation to controlling factors namely water temperature seasonality and water flow and 4 offer a p compounds transformations model using field data easy to collect transferable to other case studies in terms of river pollutant transport the present research contributes to i the detailed representation of phenomena which empowers good prediction efficiency of concentrations and in the same time does not make it a too complex model ii the use of easily attainable field data water flow water temperature and seasonality to generate empirical

investigated area of river swale further referred to also as the river stretch or the study area is 54 km long delimited at the upstream end by catterick national grid reference ngr se225994508 and at the downstream end by crakehill ngr se426734 it includes three major tributaries river wiske bedale beck and cod beck and 15 minor tributaries this river swale catchment is a part of the greater river ouse catchment presented in fig 1 the monitoring data used by house and warwick 1998a and 1998b and bowes and house 2001 along with additional field data will be used the focus is on data from the late 1990 s which provides a valuable perspective on model development as it covers a period where in general in river legacy stores had not yet started to be depleted this is likely still the case in sensitive environments where large point sources as targeted by eu urban wastewater treatment directive legislation are absent the field data include measurements at the monitoring stations for the channel width water depth water flow rate and p species concentrations and estimations based on gis for the river bed slope corresponding to the main stream of the river swale and the three major tributaries the ten intensive monitoring campaigns carried out at temporal resolution up to 3 h are briefly described in table 1 different environmental conditions are reflected as data has been collected during a wide range of events from low discharge e g event c3 in october 1995 to very high discharge during storms e g event c6 in march 1998 the water flow graphs for campaigns c1 to c10 are available in fig d 1 and fig d 2 during these events the concentration of p components in the river swale is heavily influenced by sinks and sources which can be represented under two labels 1 in river processes denominated also transformations which cause consumption or generation of a certain chemical species and 2 discharges of effluents from outside the river denominated also pollution sources which introduce significant amounts of phosphorous presented under different forms neal et al 2010 withers and jarvie 2008 for river swale there are point and non point diffuse phosphorous sources bowes et al 2008 point sources mainly sewage treatment works stws provide a continuous load of phosphorus to the river and strongly influence srp mainly during low flow their influence is less significant during high flows due to dilution non point sources agricultural and farming activities predominate mainly during high flows confirmed also by house and warwick 1998a being associated with runoff and soil erosion and are the dominant sources of soluble unreactive phosphorus sup increasing tdp and consequently tp and particulate phosphorus pp increasing tp pollution sources are included in admodel p as inputs but their detailed investigation is out of the scope of the present paper in contrast in river p transformations are comprehensively discussed the concentrations field data measurements of phosphorus species concentrations at the river swale monitoring stations has been made public on hydroshare hutchins and timis 2020 this data is part of a larger freely available accredited dataset by leach et al 2013 including nutrient concentrations also for the river swale the water flow data is available online in the uk national river flow archive link available in the

consumed or produced in the river trough processes expressed by the rate of transformation t mg s l the concentration dynamics is also affected by the convective transport velocity v m s and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d m2 s for the development of admodel p an analytical solution of the 1d ade suitable to describe the pollutant dynamics during the continuous point discharge pujol and sanchez cabeza 2000 has been implemented in matlab together with a model for the transformations the appropriate description of transformation processed during the in stream transport is the main challenge related to the ade based approach 3 2 the steps to calibrate and verify the model the dynamic representation of transformation rates in admodel p has been guided by identifying semi empirical models to estimate the rates for each transformation process a stepwise process was implemented fig 2 1 the start point was a conservative advection dispersion model with no transformations 2 representing the phosphorous transformations which involves two sub steps identifying i which transformations to include and ii suitable mathematical relationships initial form to be refined later during preliminary calibration to represent their controlling factors a robust pollutant transport model needs identification of optimal complexity as explored by jackson blake et al 2017 who sought opportunity to simplify the complex inca p model for admodel p the identified transformations model see section 4 involves 5 processes each expressed mathematically with empirical rate coefficients for calibration 3 optimisation of the empirical rate coefficients the eight m and r described in table 3 the matlab built in optimization function fmincon has been employed as basis for the optimization framework developed for admodel p the framework key components are 1 the objective function which calculates the difference between the two types of concentration vectors estimated vs measurements for both srp and op based on the widely used nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 the non linear constraints function with respect to the srp and op concentrations in order not to allow negative values of the estimated concentrations 3 lower and upper limits for the decision variables m and r coefficients and 4 the starting point for each decision variable it is crucial how the options of the optimization function optimoptions are defined because different kind of settings related to issues such as the optimization algorithm the tolerances or the search stopping criteria could lead to very different solutions the eight decision variables are modified automatically by the optimization algorithm at each computation cycle to achieve a minimum value of the objective function corresponding to the maximum of the nse coefficient while meeting the non linear constraints the tolerances and the limits for the decision variables the initial values of the rate coefficients employed by admodel p as start point for the optimization have been estimated based on questor rates for mineralization and sedimentation transformations included in questor as employed by hutchins et al 2010 while for the other transformations the initial rate coefficients are zero observed data for p compounds are taken from 8 of the 10 calibration data sets excluding two campaigns to be used later for model evaluation 4 the optimum forms of the models for transformations have been further introduced in admodel p in order to finalize its calibration following implementation in admodel p applications demonstrate model performance against experimental data for the eight model development campaigns 5 admodel p was later verified using independent data from the remaining two monitoring campaigns multiple runs of preliminary model calibration followed by evaluation steps 3 to 5 have been carried out employing each time two different independent campaigns for the model evaluation the selection of the two evaluation campaigns has been done fulfilling two main rules 1 evaluation events should take place in different times of the year in order to ensure variability over seasonality and 2 evaluation events should take place at different flow regime otherwise the combinations are random the purpose of these preliminary runs was to identify the trends of transformation processes in relation to controlling factors in order to validate the most suitable form of the equations for the process rates initially identified in step 2 above and in final form as described in section 4 2 and the appropriate settings for the optimization framework step 3 above the results in terms of goodness of fit associated to the preliminary runs are presented in table b 1 in appendix b further the finalised identification of equations and optimization settings has been implemented in admodel which then underwent a final round of calibration and evaluation employing a chosen data splitting option 2 in table b 1 in appendix b admodel p has been made public on hydroshare timis 2021 4 the identification of the phosphorus transformations model to employ 4 1 phosphorus components and transformations phosphorus is present in multiple constituents of the river ecosystem algae zooplankton and aquatic animals water river channel e g sediments river banks soil and under multiple forms ji 2017 chau 2005 loucks and van beek 2017 terminology has not always been consistent with different appellations or assumptions used and wider terms often introduced e g organic p and particulate p used as interchangeable hence these are comprehensively related in tabular table a 1 in appendix a and graphical fig 3 as employed in the literature charlton et al 2018 dou et al 2018 ji 2017 tye et al 2016 tuo et al 2015 neal et al 2010 bowes et al 2005 and 2003 house 2003 wade et al 2002 house and warwick 1998a bowie et al 1985 visual representation of processes associated to models and not only typically uses one of three different approaches depending on the purpose of the case study 1 a generalist approach employing an all inclusive p term contained in phases e g p in water and p in sediments as in wijesiri et al 2019 2 simple representations of the phosphorus cycle usually involving one type of organic p under different designations e g op pp and one type of inorganic p under different designations e g srp ip hutchins et al 2010 a questor application including the swale and also srinivas and singh 2018 jackson blake et al 2017 cooper et al 2015 lindenschmidt et al 2007 and 3 more complex representations involving more components and multiple interdependencies dou et al 2018 alam and dutta 2016 kim et al 2006 loucks and van beek 2017 bowie 1985 robson 2014 states that catchment river models are almost universally on the simpler side with respect to their treatment of in stream processes sometimes only considering tp and either representing sedimentation alone or not representing in stream processes thereby assuming that nutrient sources from outside the river are determinant on the in river nutrient load of the post 2003 river models reviewed by robson 2014 74 include less than 3 biogeochemical or ecological processes and robson 2014 also states that ecological models for rivers often do not consider phosphorus at all there are however a wealth of models taking into account more than one phosphorus species and multiple in stream processes the processes either act as sinks or sources for each category of compounds table 2 a sub set of the processes in table 2 are chosen later for specific modelling of p compounds transport by admodel p in river swale 4 2 phosphorus transformations included in admodel p as stated earlier p transformation are important in the swale house and warwick 1998b identified large losses of srp associated with uptake by the river bed suspended sediments macrophytes and algae mass balance calculations for tdp srp and tp house 2003 determined the relative importance of riverine processes in controlling p concentrations and discriminated those in terms of whether they were chemically or physically driven bowes et al 2003 2005 conclude that the interaction with the river bed and sediments e g mineralisation is likely significant within the river swale and that sedimentation and resuspension should be considered by models five categories of in stream p transformations were identified as being important mineralization uptake adsorption desorption sedimentation and resuspension these are deemed responsible for the loss and or accumulation of srp and op during the transport the rates of the chemical processes are considered as having first order kinetics while the physical processes are zero order kinetics they are mainly influenced by the water temperature t water flow q and seasonality each rate depends on a particular transformation rate constant k as shown in table 3 where the form of the admodel p transformations model equations is presented the processes included in the srp uptake by macrophytes phytoplankton and benthic algae and also those under the formation of tdp through the decomposition of plants and detritus are likely to vary substantially on a seasonal basis across the seasons the aggregated impacts of growth and then decay of primary producers reflect an integration of climate driven factors on a longer timescale than specific diurnal environmental fluctuations therefore in addition to applying water temperature controls on these transformation rates we invoke seasonal variability into the rate parameters defining sources and sinks we consider two key variables the julian day number jdn and the factor of seasonality or seasonality factor s quantified in the context of the monitoring campaigns fig 4 the jdn allows the representation of multiple events in the time succession they happen and facilitates the implementation of continuous functions to describe the cyclical influence of seasonality along the monitoring campaigns a non dimensional scalar determined by a function based on the sine of the jdn defines s see fig 3 which takes values between 0 beginning of winter and 1 beginning of summer with an example provided for 1997 this cyclical variation of s represents the continuous periodicity in the intensity of processes fluctuating cyclically during the year for example in the models for resuspension and uptake the intra annual variability is expected to be strongly determined by s process rates being expected to increase during spring angert et al 2011 the conjunctive use of jdn and s results in a continuous function describing seasonality in transformation rates models s is included separately for each transformation rate constant as it may have differing significance 5 results and discussions 5 1 transformations model values are shown for the m and r coefficients identified during optimization for the calculation of each transformation rate as in equations in table 3 and the resulting values of rate coefficients table 4 resuspension is the largest contributor to the variability of op while adsorption desorption are the largest contributors to the variability of srp in table 4 positive values mean net sink rate coefficients vary during the events as illustrated in fig c 1 in appendix c and their variation is influenced by the change of controlling factors as illustrated in appendix c fig c 2 for the water flow fig c 3 for the water temperature and fig c 4 for the seasonality figures show relations to be expected from the basics of the transformations model in table 3 and reveal agreement with previous findings resuspension followed by mineralization influence the most organic species while for inorganic species adsorption desorption processes predominate as found by house 2003 highest adsorption rates occur at lowest temperatures campaign 4 average of 2 7 c whilst lowest rates i e highest desorption occur during campaign 7 average of 17 c findings in agreement with the knowledge that higher water temperatures facilitate anoxic conditions which enhance the release of p from sediments han et al 2022 mbabazi et al 2019 house 2003 there is a positive relationship between water temperature and mineralization rate as also found by yuan et al 2019 its variability within campaigns is caused by diurnal variation of water temperature caissie et al 2013 resuspension which is the largest contributor to the variability of op shows greatest relative variability at low flows as observed by yuan et al 2019 and house 2003 highest rates of resuspension are associated with higher flow and moderate s seasonality i e early spring uptake has the lowest values table 4 varying substantially with seasonality showing highest rates in summer when flows are also low srp losses due to uptake are much lower than those due to other sinks as also found by house 2003 and jarvie et al 2005 in nutrient rich rivers 5 2 admodel p calibration and evaluation results the admodel p inputs consist of the dynamic profiles of water flow and srp and op concentrations 1 at the upstream end acting as boundary condition 2 at the tributaries and 3 at the actual pollution sources along the stretch the outputs consist of the dynamic profiles of concentrations of srp and op at the downstream end labelled m4 outputs for all 8 development and calibration campaigns and the 2 evaluation campaigns 2 and 9 kept independent during all earlier stages are presented fig 5 a d fig e 1 and fig e 2 it has been decided to simulate all campaigns together as a continuous event fig 5a d using concatenated data from individual campaigns c1 to c5 in fig e 1 and c6 to c10 in fig e 2 in order to test the capability of admodel to cater for very rapid changes in time at campaign boundaries as controlling factors and other variables change between campaigns it is demonstrated that evaluation campaigns encompass a representative range of conditions with respect to 1 water flow storm during campaign 2 and normal flow during campaign 9 2 water temperature mean of 6 c and 17 c for campaigns 2 and 9 respectively and 3 seasonality late winter during campaign 2 and mid summer during campaign 9 results show that simulations follow the general trend of measurements for both srp and op despite underestimation of peaks in case of events 3 5 and 7 for the calibration of srp events 6 and 8 for the calibration of op and event 2 for the evaluation of op on the other hand the lowest concentrations of op are slightly overestimated while the lowest concentrations of srp are overestimated on few occasions the admodel p performance has been evaluated using the multiple criteria as shown in table 5 where values for the non conservative runs employing the transformations model are included the criteria equations are available in table b 2 additionally the conservative runs have been assessed with the nse and values are 1 65 for the calibration of srp 4 77 for the evaluation of srp respectively 0 13 and 0 35 for op in all occasions as expected due to the high importance of transformations the non conservative version of the model behaves better compared to the conservative version moriasi et al 2007 discuss models for the streamflow and transport of sediments nitrogen and phosphorus at larger time steps mostly daily and monthly in relation to nse range from to 1 rsr range from 0 to large positive values and pbias and find that the minimally acceptable model performance is indicated by nse 0 00 while satisfactory simulations are indicated by nse 0 50 together with rsr 0 70 and pbias 70 for nitrogen and phosphorus the results for detailed hourly simulations of admodel p achieve nse values close to the tresholds of 0 50 nse and respectively 0 70 rsr for the calibration of srp and the evaluation of op while for the evaluation of srp and calibration of op the values are in the acceptable limits for the model performance the low values of pbias in table 5 indicate good simulations according to gupta et al 1999 moriasi et al 2007 with small overestimation bias for srp during calibration and evaluation the negative values of pbias and for op during calibration while there is underestimation bias for op during evaluation the positive value of pbias the kge values between 0 47 and 0 71 indicate good results of admodel if taking into account the limit of kge 0 3 or nse 0 5 mentioned by knoben et al 2019 in relation to hydrologycal models positive values of kge indicate good model performance while negative kge values indicate bad model performance knoben 2019 gupta et al 2009 the br2 values krause et al 2005 are between 0 31 and 0 61 when the intercept is zero and gradients between 0 94 and 1 15 further on the performance of admodel is discussed in section 5 4 in a wider context providing a comparison with other models 5 3 wider correlations of srp and op dynamics to controlling factors using admodel p in order to understand the underlying phenomena behind these results correlate it to the modelled transformation rate constants and their controlling factors and understand in which situations the river is acting as a source or sink fig 6 is offered there are 3 different series of concentration data provided in the same graph 1 the total value of sources influencing the concentration at m4 i e inputs for m4 which comprise pollution sources tributaries and the concentration at the upstream end of the stretch labelled m1 2 the measurements of concentration at m4 and 3 the simulated concentration at m4 with respect to water flow fig 6a b it is observed that relationships between inputs and outputs are similar below 6 m3 s i e log q of 1 79 m3 s and above 105 m3 s i e log q of 4 65 m3 s where consumption along the stretch occurs for both srp and op at low flows for op this is attributed to sedimentation although there is a tendency to overestimate op concentrations the sinks of srp seem to be prominent along the stretch on the entire flow range except between 22 m3 s and 55 m3 s i e log q of 3 09 to 4 01 m3 s where there are alternating periods of net sources and sinks fig 6a for mid range flows between 6 m3 s and 105 m3 s the flow range where the model simulates srp and op observations most closely for op there are alternating periods of net sources and sinks at flows above 105 m3 s both srp and op concentrations are generally overestimated the implication could be 1 errors in representation of dilution processes at high flows 2 additional sinks along the stretch at high flows which are unaccounted for 3 sinks included in admodel p are sufficient but are underestimated at high flows refinements increasing the rates of existing sinks may be incorporated if supported by field evidence of other affected in river conditions e g biotic indicators but the additional complexity may lead to a less reliable and over parameterised model overall despite the improved performance with respect to water temperature sinks of srp are prevalent throughout apart from some occasions above 16 c fig 6c which may be due to desorption fig c 3b op sinks and sources alternate along the stretch on the entire temperature range except between 5 c and 10 c where additional sinks are evident in this interval admodel p gives better op predictions compared to temperatures above 12 c when overestimation occurs in multiple occasions with respect to seasonality there is evidence of srp sinks at almost all times except the s range 0 45 to 0 50 corresponding to mid spring where there is evidence of srp sources fig 6e admodel p gives fair predictions except at s values around 0 45 0 50 and 0 84 corresponding to mid end spring where srp is often overestimated despite the large simulated uptake values there is no clear evidence that additional op sinks or sources are dominant at certain times fig 6f with the exception of the s range 0 45 to 0 60 where in stream sinks of op are evident overestimations of op occur between spring and mid summer s above approximatively 0 49 while underestimations occur at the beginning of winter s around 0 02 it is suspected that accuracy at different seasons may be improved by an improved biotic processes representation taking into account additional controlling parameters such as solar radiation or algae since there is an overestimation of both srp and op in spring when biological processes are most significant 5 4 putting findings in the context of other river phosphorus models admodel p represents a phenomena based simulation of phosphorus dynamics in rivers it differs from other widely available models in that it uses information on river flow water temperature and seasonality to generate empirical relations to summarise the variation in process rates constants m and r values are estimated and applied to these functions to generate rate constants k values the rate constants coupled with zero or first order dependency on the source p pool define variation in fluxes of phosphorus in contrast deterministic models such as inca p jackson blake et al 2016 swat neitsch et al 2011 ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 and efdc wu and xu 2011 directly use theoretical relationships along a spectrum of complexity in hydrobiochemical dynamics for example isotherm kinetics particulate settling biotic uptake related to primary productivity and require a number of additional measurements or assumptions to define these fluxes the modelling in the present study demonstrates that if q t and s are known then considerable model skill nse 0 24 0 62 can be achieved in simulating sub daily dynamics of op and srp in the river swale system evidence from wellen et al 2015 suggests that despite a relatively small number of parameters for optimisation 8 empirical coefficients this compares favourably to other studies at sub daily resolution sub daily studies are scarce approximately 2 of studies of the studies reviewed by wellen et al 2015 few appear to address identification of in channel processes reflecting a trend towards whole basin large scale system assessment as identified in section 1 above it is instructive to compare admodel p process representation and performance with the simply p model jackson blake et al 2017 which represents a simplification of inca p having an order of magnitude fewer calibration parameters and achieved without a substantial sacrificing model performance river particulate phosphorus in simply p is entirely controlled by particulate behaviour sedimentation and resuspension additionally for dissolved p although substantial retention has been identified from controlled channel experiments house et al 1995 the simply p model omits biotic uptake and net adsorption treating it as a conservative substance within the channel jackson blake et al 2017 evaluated the model comparison in a small scottish rural catchment otherwise similar to the swale short residence time gives limited opportunity for riverine processes to become a significant part of catchment mass balance in identifying the importance of net sedimentation and the lack of influence of biotic uptake the present study corroborates jackson blake et al 2017 although contrastingly identifies importance of desorption and conversion of inorganic to organic forms to be important performance statistics for the two models are broadly similar 6 conclusions admodel p is a powerful simulation tool capable to make detailed dynamic predictions with reasonable accuracy for the case of river swale the complexity of phenomena involving p compounds during their transport along the river has been treated with special care during our demarche of finding the optimum representation of transformations included in admodel p five transformations have been considered mineralization sedimentation resuspension uptake and adsorption desorption and thereby estimated using empirical coefficients catering for a wide range of conditions with respect to water flow water temperatures and seasonality the values identified for the coefficients and consequently for the process rates reveal that interaction with sediments and transformation of inorganic p to organic p species are the dominant processes while the uptake has the lowest influence on inorganic p variability simulation results are in agreement with results based on experimental data showing interactions between water and sediments to be highly significant overall sinks of phosphorus appear to be more important than sources during most of the events studied results suggest adsorption desorption processes are likely to predominate the rates of interaction with the sediments are highly influenced by the water flow via the sedimentation and resuspension rates by the water temperature via adsorption desorption rate and by seasonality via resuspension rate the conversion of inorganic to organic forms of p as well as the mineralization of op to srp are influenced by water temperature the biological uptake of srp is influenced by the water flow and seasonality model skill has been discussed in the context of the transformation rate coefficients and their main controlling factors visual correlations have been offered as support for discussions such information can be of additional use as support for other projects related to the identification and formulation of transformation models for different case studies work to further improve performance of admodel p may include the estimation of uptake using chlorophyll measurements or adding new pollutant species for which field data is available e g silica models such as admodel p are needed to support water quality management in all rivers these include those less polluted river networks such as the ouse of which the swale is a part which has been evaluated as oligotrophic mesotrophic by hutchins et al 2010 but with risk of degenerating to a mesotrophic eutrophic system by 2080 the wider implications from this point of view are the options to adapt admodel p to other monitored river stretches over different time scales which may have levels of accrual or depletion of legacy phosphorus contrasting to those in the swale in the 1990s studies using admodel to identify change in process rate parameters through a set of sequential applications at intervals before and after undergoing mandatory upgrades in wastewater treatment would improve mechanistic understanding of how river systems respond to interventions and the extent to which legacy effects weaken the expected benefits the model structure is based on general principles of flow routing pollutant transport and phosphorus transformations and whilst site specific calibration is necessary it is transferable to any other situation the approach described here whereby process rates are estimated based on readily available hydro climatic and seasonal information can also be used as a means to

3102,the objectives of the present research are 1 to predict phosphorus compounds transport along river stretches at high spatio temporal resolution by developing an original approach based on advection dispersion modelling admodel p 2 to advance the understanding of in stream phosphorus transformation processes and 3 to explore their relation to controlling factors water temperature seasonality and water flow for a case study of the river swale uk modelling results in agreement with results based on experimental data show that resuspension is the largest contributor to the variability of organic phosphorus while adsorption desorption are the largest contributors to the variability of soluble reactive phosphorus additionally simulations reveal that conversion of inorganic to organic forms is important in channel sinks appear more important than sources for soluble reactive phosphorus srp during 80 of the time while there is no clear evidence that organic phosphorus op sinks or sources are dominant except the beginning of spring around 20 of the total time the findings are valuable because they advance knowledge regarding 1 which in stream processes

transport model mineralization sedimentation resuspension uptake adsorption desorption 1 introduction phosphorus p compounds are among the most important freshwater nutrients of critical concern the increased attention they receive currently at global level is motivated by their key role in the agriculture e g fertilizers and in the ecosystem dynamics e g as limiting nutrients for algae production increased loads of phosphorus to waterbodies is usually the primary driver for the eutrophication of freshwater bodies charlton et al 2018 colborne et al 2019 zinabu et al 2018 the european environment agency s databases on the status and quality of europe s water resources waterbase shows evidence that the average concentration of phosphates in european rivers is larger during the period 2000 2017 compared to the period 1992 2017 even if a decrease of 1 6 per year is indicated over the last two three decades eea 2019 mainly attributed to the improved waste water treatment technologies among river water bodies assessed by the environment agency in england 55 were at less than good ecological status with respect to p concentrations in 2016 environment agency 2018 while an earlier report indicates the figure to be just 45 environment agency 2012 concern surrounds persistence of elevated levels due to release of legacy p held in riverbed sediments that offset benefits of reduced pollutant load from the land and other sources such as improved waste water treatment moreover recent research shows that p concentrations are and will remain high enough to fail p standards until 2050 charlton et al 2018 jarvie et al 2018 hutchins et al 2016 ockenden et al 2016 or are greater than ecologically limiting thresholds riley et al 2018 and emphasise the increasing risk of eutrophication dangers associated principally to p compounds are long established and widely investigated for rivers in england and worldwide harrison et al 2019a and 2019b charlton et al 2018

degradation with respect to p should be underpinned by deep understanding of the behaviour and fate of p species and on the prediction of its future trends recent work underlines the important role of water quality models which include p concentrations riley et al 2018 tuo et al 2015 charlton et al 2018 to support high quality decision making and water management the mathematical modelling of water quality facilitates both understanding of phenomena and its prediction even in cases where the availability of experimental data is limited ani et al 2009 such modelling can be carried out at different levels of magnitude and detail starting from the small scale hundreds of meters of river stretch to the global scale see the models discussed by harrison et al 2019b depending on the area of interest its particularities and the needs with respect to the resolution in terms of space and time the spectrum of approaches extends between a catchment scale modelling describing a catchment or multiple catchments not necessarily high resolution in terms of space and time mainly based on usual long term monitoring data keraga et al 2019 srinivas and singh 2018 and b modelling of river stretches based on high resolution data multiple monitoring points along the stretch where measurements of channel characteristics hydrodynamic data and water quality data are needed such as admodel for nitrogen ani et al 2011 in terms of advancing system understanding river p transport studies of both types have proven valuable in many respects a facilitate understanding of catchment scale

certain types of sources charlton et al 2018 ockenden et al 2016 cooper et al 2015 wade et al 2002 and f identification and or understanding of p pollution sources alone or along with other nutrients colborne et al 2019 liberoff et al 2019 records et al 2016 ramos et al 2015 during recent years river stretch studies type b including high resolution measurements of p species and advective dispersive non conservative transport have become less common this is most probably due to the difficulties and great costs associated to gathering the needed high resolution data which despite recent advances halliday et al 2015 rode et al 2016 is still not commonplace and also a change in focus towards studies covering larger spatial scales valuable recent studies include those of dou et al 2018 and nguyen et al 2018 while earlier studies are a lot more abundant as shown by mateus et al 2018 gao and li 2014 wang et al 2013 tsakiris and alexakis 2012 or ani et al 2010 for effective basin scale management it is important to maintain small scale modelling development to inform appropriate and sufficiently accurate process representation in larger scale models tang et al 2019 the extent to which in channel transformations are important in determining catchment scale fluxes is unclear conservative or black box modelling approaches with simple dependencies on residence time zhang et al 2017 or sedimentation jackson blake et al 2017 may provide sufficient representation but this merits further attention in this context admodel a model based upon detailed representation of pollutant advection and dispersion has been successfully developed for simulation of nitrogen compounds ani et al 2011 and performs comparably to a contrasting but extensively tested model questor boorman 2003a 2003b that assumes complete mixing in asset of reaches the advection dispersion approach was calibrated and evaluated by considering the transport parameters e g dispersion coefficients convective velocity and associated nutrient nitrogen transformations nitrate and ammonium given the need to better understand phosphorus dynamics in rivers it is important to build on the approach by developing from first principles a compatible approach for phosphorus the potential that would then arise for an integrated approach covering multiple nutrient determinands is of much value the river swale in north east england has been the focus or a part of a wide range of studies on phosphorus i speciation in the main channel based on weekly river monitoring data jarvie et al 1998 including the

understanding in the swale a detailed modelling approach as adopted in admodel p is lacking findings from process based studies will be revisited later to provide invaluable context for a modelling study on the p transformations therefore the objectives of the present paper are 1 to offer a new validated detailed modelling tool admodel p for the prediction of p compounds transport along a stretch of river swale at sub daily resolution based on principles of advection and dispersion previously applied for nitrogen simulation 2 to advance the understanding and significance of in stream p transformation processes 3 to explore their relation to controlling factors namely water temperature seasonality and water flow and 4 offer a p compounds transformations model using field data easy to collect transferable to other case studies in terms of river pollutant transport the present research contributes to i the detailed representation of phenomena which empowers good prediction efficiency of concentrations and in the same time does not make it a too complex model ii the use of easily attainable field data water flow water temperature and seasonality to generate empirical relations to express the dynamics of process rates this is in contrast to existing mechanistic models which require detailed characterisations and extensive assumptions of channel properties

investigated area of river swale further referred to also as the river stretch or the study area is 54 km long delimited at the upstream end by catterick national grid reference ngr se225994508 and at the downstream end by crakehill ngr se426734 it includes three major tributaries river wiske bedale beck and cod beck and 15 minor tributaries this river swale catchment is a part of the greater river ouse catchment presented in fig 1 the monitoring data used by house and warwick 1998a and 1998b and bowes and house 2001 along with additional field data will be used the focus is on data from the late 1990 s which provides a valuable perspective on model development as it covers a period where in general in river legacy stores had not yet started to be depleted this is likely still the case in sensitive environments where large point sources as targeted by eu urban wastewater treatment directive legislation are absent the field data include measurements at the monitoring stations for the channel width water depth water flow rate and p species concentrations and estimations based on gis for the river bed slope corresponding to the main stream of the river swale and the three major tributaries the ten intensive monitoring campaigns carried out at temporal resolution up to 3 h are briefly described in table 1 different environmental conditions are reflected as data has been collected during a wide range of events from low discharge e g event c3 in october 1995 to very high discharge during storms e g event c6 in march 1998 the water flow graphs for campaigns c1 to c10 are available in fig d 1 and fig d 2 during these events the concentration of p components in the river swale is heavily influenced by sinks and sources which can be represented under two labels 1 in river processes denominated also transformations which cause consumption or generation of a certain chemical species and 2 discharges of effluents from outside the river denominated also pollution sources which introduce significant amounts of phosphorous presented under different forms neal et al 2010 withers and jarvie 2008 for river swale there are point and non point diffuse phosphorous sources bowes et al 2008 point sources mainly sewage treatment works stws provide a continuous load of phosphorus to the river and strongly influence srp mainly during low flow their influence is less significant during high flows due to dilution non point sources agricultural and farming activities predominate mainly during high flows confirmed also by house and warwick 1998a being associated with runoff and soil erosion and are the dominant sources of soluble unreactive phosphorus sup increasing tdp and consequently tp and particulate phosphorus pp increasing tp pollution sources are included in admodel p as inputs but their detailed investigation is out of the scope of the present paper in contrast in river p transformations are comprehensively discussed the concentrations field data measurements of phosphorus species concentrations at the river swale monitoring stations has been made public on hydroshare hutchins and timis 2020 this data is part of a larger freely available accredited dataset by leach et al 2013 including nutrient concentrations also for the river swale the water flow data is available online in the uk national river flow archive link available in the references list at the specific locations for the two sites the upstream end of the investigated river stretch station number 27090 and at the downstream end of the river stretch station number 27071 3 methodology 3 1 model background admodel p is based on the one dimensional 1d advection dispersion equation ade for mass transport along distributed parameters systems such as the rivers c t x d c x c v x s t the equation describes the evolution in time t s of the concentration c mg l of a chemical species along the river reach x m while the pollutant is discharged from sources s mg s l and it is consumed or produced in the river trough processes expressed by the rate of transformation t mg s l the concentration dynamics is also affected by the convective transport velocity v m s and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient d m2 s for the development of admodel p an analytical solution of the 1d ade suitable to describe the pollutant dynamics during the continuous point discharge pujol and sanchez cabeza 2000 has been implemented in matlab together with a model for the transformations the appropriate description of transformation processed during the in stream transport is the main challenge related to the ade based approach 3 2 the steps to calibrate and verify the model the dynamic representation of transformation rates in admodel p has been guided by identifying semi empirical models to estimate the rates for each transformation process a stepwise process was implemented fig 2 1 the start point was a conservative advection dispersion model with no transformations 2 representing the phosphorous transformations which involves two sub steps identifying i which transformations to include and ii suitable mathematical relationships initial form to be refined later during preliminary calibration to represent their controlling factors a robust pollutant transport model needs identification of optimal complexity as explored by jackson blake et al 2017 who sought opportunity to simplify the complex inca p model for admodel p the identified transformations model see section 4 involves 5 processes each expressed mathematically with empirical rate coefficients for calibration 3 optimisation of the empirical rate coefficients the eight m and r described in table 3 the matlab built in optimization function fmincon has been employed as basis for the optimization framework developed for admodel p the framework key components are 1 the objective function which calculates the difference between the two types of concentration vectors estimated vs measurements for both srp and op based on the widely used nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 the non linear constraints function with respect to the srp and op concentrations in order not to allow negative values of the estimated concentrations 3 lower and upper limits for the decision variables m and r coefficients and 4 the starting point for each decision variable it is crucial how the options of the optimization function optimoptions are defined because different kind of settings related to issues such as the optimization algorithm the tolerances or the search stopping criteria could lead to very different solutions the eight decision variables are modified automatically by the optimization algorithm at each computation cycle to achieve a minimum value of the objective function corresponding to the maximum of the nse coefficient while meeting the non linear constraints the tolerances and the limits for the decision variables the initial values of the rate coefficients employed by admodel p as start point for the optimization have been estimated based on questor rates for mineralization and sedimentation transformations included in questor as employed by hutchins et al 2010 while for the other transformations the initial rate coefficients are zero observed data for p compounds are taken from 8 of the 10 calibration data sets excluding two campaigns to be used later for model evaluation 4 the optimum forms of the models for transformations have been further introduced in admodel p in order to finalize its calibration following implementation in admodel p applications demonstrate model performance against experimental data for the eight model development campaigns 5 admodel p was later verified using independent data from the remaining two monitoring campaigns multiple runs of preliminary model calibration followed by evaluation steps 3 to 5 have been carried out employing each time two different independent campaigns for the model evaluation the selection of the two evaluation campaigns has been done fulfilling two main rules 1 evaluation events should take place in different times of the year in order to ensure variability over seasonality and 2 evaluation events should take place at different flow regime otherwise the combinations are random the purpose of these preliminary runs was to identify the trends of transformation processes in relation to controlling factors in order to validate the most suitable form of the equations for the process rates initially identified in step 2 above and in final form as described in section 4 2 and the appropriate settings for the optimization framework step 3 above the results in terms of goodness of fit associated to the preliminary runs are presented in table b 1 in appendix b further the finalised identification of equations and optimization settings has been implemented in admodel which then underwent a final round of calibration and evaluation employing a chosen data splitting option 2 in table b 1 in appendix b admodel p has been made public on hydroshare timis 2021 4 the identification of the phosphorus transformations model to employ 4 1 phosphorus components and transformations phosphorus is present in multiple constituents of the river ecosystem algae zooplankton and aquatic animals water river channel e g sediments river banks soil and under multiple forms ji 2017 chau 2005 loucks and van beek 2017 terminology has not always been consistent with different appellations or assumptions used and wider terms often introduced e g organic p and particulate p used as interchangeable hence these are comprehensively related in tabular table a 1 in appendix a and graphical fig 3 as employed in the literature charlton et al 2018 dou et al 2018 ji 2017 tye et al 2016 tuo et al 2015 neal et al 2010 bowes et al 2005 and 2003 house 2003 wade et al 2002 house and warwick 1998a bowie et al 1985 visual representation of processes associated to models and not only typically uses one of three different approaches depending on the purpose of the case study 1 a generalist approach employing an all inclusive p term contained in phases e g p in water and p in sediments as in wijesiri et al 2019 2 simple representations of the phosphorus cycle usually involving one type of organic p under different designations e g op pp and one type of inorganic p under different designations e g srp ip hutchins et al 2010 a questor application including the swale and also srinivas and singh 2018 jackson blake et al 2017 cooper et al 2015 lindenschmidt et al 2007 and 3 more complex representations involving more components and multiple interdependencies dou et al 2018 alam and dutta 2016 kim et al 2006 loucks and van beek 2017 bowie 1985 robson 2014 states that catchment river models are almost universally on the simpler side with respect to their treatment of in stream processes sometimes only considering tp and either representing sedimentation alone or not representing in stream processes thereby assuming that nutrient sources from outside the river are determinant on the in river nutrient load of the post 2003 river models reviewed by robson 2014 74 include less than 3 biogeochemical or ecological processes and robson 2014 also states that ecological models for rivers often do not consider phosphorus at all there are however a wealth of models taking into account more than one phosphorus species and multiple in stream processes the processes either act as sinks or sources for each category of compounds table 2 a sub set of the processes in table 2 are chosen later for specific modelling of p compounds transport by admodel p in river swale 4 2 phosphorus transformations included in admodel p as stated earlier p transformation are important in the swale house and warwick 1998b identified large losses of srp associated with uptake by the river bed suspended sediments macrophytes and algae mass balance calculations for tdp srp and tp house 2003 determined the relative importance of riverine processes in controlling p concentrations and discriminated those in terms of whether they were chemically or physically driven bowes et al 2003 2005 conclude that the interaction with the river bed and sediments e g mineralisation is likely significant within the river swale and that sedimentation and resuspension should be considered by models five categories of in stream p transformations were identified as being important mineralization uptake adsorption desorption sedimentation and resuspension these are deemed responsible for the loss and or accumulation of srp and op during the transport the rates of the chemical processes are considered as having first order kinetics while the physical processes are zero order kinetics they are mainly influenced by the water temperature t water flow q and seasonality each rate depends on a particular transformation rate constant k as shown in table 3 where the form of the admodel p transformations model equations is presented the processes included in the srp uptake by macrophytes phytoplankton and benthic algae and also those under the formation of tdp through the decomposition of plants and detritus are likely to vary substantially on a seasonal basis across the seasons the aggregated impacts of growth and then decay of primary producers reflect an integration of climate driven factors on a longer timescale than specific diurnal environmental fluctuations therefore in addition to applying water temperature controls on these transformation rates we invoke seasonal variability into the rate parameters defining sources and sinks we consider two key variables the julian day number jdn and the factor of seasonality or seasonality factor s quantified in the context of the monitoring campaigns fig 4 the jdn allows the representation of multiple events in the time succession they happen and facilitates the implementation of continuous functions to describe the cyclical influence of seasonality along the monitoring campaigns a non dimensional scalar determined by a function based on the sine of the jdn defines s see fig 3 which takes values between 0 beginning of winter and 1 beginning of summer with an example provided for 1997 this cyclical variation of s represents the continuous periodicity in the intensity of processes fluctuating cyclically during the year for example in the models for resuspension and uptake the intra annual variability is expected to be strongly determined by s process rates being expected to increase during spring angert et al 2011 the conjunctive use of jdn and s results in a continuous function describing seasonality in transformation rates models s is included separately for each transformation rate constant as it may have differing significance 5 results and discussions 5 1 transformations model values are shown for the m and r coefficients identified during optimization for the calculation of each transformation rate as in equations in table 3 and the resulting values of rate coefficients table 4 resuspension is the largest contributor to the variability of op while adsorption desorption are the largest contributors to the variability of srp in table 4 positive values mean net sink rate coefficients vary during the events as illustrated in fig c 1 in appendix c and their variation is influenced by the change of controlling factors as illustrated in appendix c fig c 2 for the water flow fig c 3 for the water temperature and fig c 4 for the seasonality figures show relations to be expected from the basics of the transformations model in table 3 and reveal agreement with previous findings resuspension followed by mineralization influence the most organic species while for inorganic species adsorption desorption processes predominate as found by house 2003 highest adsorption rates occur at lowest temperatures campaign 4 average of 2 7 c whilst lowest rates i e highest desorption occur during campaign 7 average of 17 c findings in agreement with the knowledge that higher water temperatures facilitate anoxic conditions which enhance the release of p from sediments han et al 2022 mbabazi et al 2019 house 2003 there is a positive relationship between water temperature and mineralization rate as also found by yuan et al 2019 its variability within campaigns is caused by diurnal variation of water temperature caissie et al 2013 resuspension which is the largest contributor to the variability of op shows greatest relative variability at low flows as observed by yuan et al 2019 and house 2003 highest rates of resuspension are associated with higher flow and moderate s seasonality i e early spring uptake has the lowest values table 4 varying substantially with seasonality showing highest rates in summer when flows are also low srp losses due to uptake are much lower than those due to other sinks as also found by house 2003 and jarvie et al 2005 in nutrient rich rivers 5 2 admodel p calibration and evaluation results the admodel p inputs consist of the dynamic profiles of water flow and srp and op concentrations 1 at the upstream end acting as boundary condition 2 at the tributaries and 3 at the actual pollution sources along the stretch the outputs consist of the dynamic profiles of concentrations of srp and op at the downstream end labelled m4 outputs for all 8 development and calibration campaigns and the 2 evaluation campaigns 2 and 9 kept independent during all earlier stages are presented fig 5 a d fig e 1 and fig e 2 it has been decided to simulate all campaigns together as a continuous event fig 5a d using concatenated data from individual campaigns c1 to c5 in fig e 1 and c6 to c10 in fig e 2 in order to test the capability of admodel to cater for very rapid changes in time at campaign boundaries as controlling factors and other variables change between campaigns it is demonstrated that evaluation campaigns encompass a representative range of conditions with respect to 1 water flow storm during campaign 2 and normal flow during campaign 9 2 water temperature mean of 6 c and 17 c for campaigns 2 and 9 respectively and 3 seasonality late winter during campaign 2 and mid summer during campaign 9 results show that simulations follow the general trend of measurements for both srp and op despite underestimation of peaks in case of events 3 5 and 7 for the calibration of srp events 6 and 8 for the calibration of op and event 2 for the evaluation of op on the other hand the lowest concentrations of op are slightly overestimated while the lowest concentrations of srp are overestimated on few occasions the admodel p performance has been evaluated using the multiple criteria as shown in table 5 where values for the non conservative runs employing the transformations model are included the criteria equations are available in table b 2 additionally the conservative runs have been assessed with the nse and values are 1 65 for the calibration of srp 4 77 for the evaluation of srp respectively 0 13 and 0 35 for op in all occasions as expected due to the high importance of transformations the non conservative version of the model behaves better compared to the conservative version moriasi et al 2007 discuss models for the streamflow and transport of sediments nitrogen and phosphorus at larger time steps mostly daily and monthly in relation to nse range from to 1 rsr range from 0 to large positive values and pbias and find that the minimally acceptable model performance is indicated by nse 0 00 while satisfactory simulations are indicated by nse 0 50 together with rsr 0 70 and pbias 70 for nitrogen and phosphorus the results for detailed hourly simulations of admodel p achieve nse values close to the tresholds of 0 50 nse and respectively 0 70 rsr for the calibration of srp and the evaluation of op while for the evaluation of srp and calibration of op the values are in the acceptable limits for the model performance the low values of pbias in table 5 indicate good simulations according to gupta et al 1999 moriasi et al 2007 with small overestimation bias for srp during calibration and evaluation the negative values of pbias and for op during calibration while there is underestimation bias for op during evaluation the positive value of pbias the kge values between 0 47 and 0 71 indicate good results of admodel if taking into account the limit of kge 0 3 or nse 0 5 mentioned by knoben et al 2019 in relation to hydrologycal models positive values of kge indicate good model performance while negative kge values indicate bad model performance knoben 2019 gupta et al 2009 the br2 values krause et al 2005 are between 0 31 and 0 61 when the intercept is zero and gradients between 0 94 and 1 15 further on the performance of admodel is discussed in section 5 4 in a wider context providing a comparison with other models 5 3 wider correlations of srp and op dynamics to controlling factors using admodel p in order to understand the underlying phenomena behind these results correlate it to the modelled transformation rate constants and their controlling factors and understand in which situations the river is acting as a source or sink fig 6 is offered there are 3 different series of concentration data provided in the same graph 1 the total value of sources influencing the concentration at m4 i e inputs for m4 which comprise pollution sources tributaries and the concentration at the upstream end of the stretch labelled m1 2 the measurements of concentration at m4 and 3 the simulated concentration at m4 with respect to water flow fig 6a b it is observed that relationships between inputs and outputs are similar below 6 m3 s i e log q of 1 79 m3 s and above 105 m3 s i e log q of 4 65 m3 s where consumption along the stretch occurs for both srp and op at low flows for op this is attributed to sedimentation although there is a tendency to overestimate op concentrations the sinks of srp seem to be prominent along the stretch on the entire flow range except between 22 m3 s and 55 m3 s i e log q of 3 09 to 4 01 m3 s where there are alternating periods of net sources and sinks fig 6a for mid range flows between 6 m3 s and 105 m3 s the flow range where the model simulates srp and op observations most closely for op there are alternating periods of net sources and sinks at flows above 105 m3 s both srp and op concentrations are generally overestimated the implication could be 1 errors in representation of dilution processes at high flows 2 additional sinks along the stretch at high flows which are unaccounted for 3 sinks included in admodel p are sufficient but are underestimated at high flows refinements increasing the rates of existing sinks may be incorporated if supported by field evidence of other affected in river conditions e g biotic indicators but the additional complexity may lead to a less reliable and over parameterised model overall despite the improved performance with respect to water temperature sinks of srp are prevalent throughout apart from some occasions above 16 c fig 6c which may be due to desorption fig c 3b op sinks and sources alternate along the stretch on the entire temperature range except between 5 c and 10 c where additional sinks are evident in this interval admodel p gives better op predictions compared to temperatures above 12 c when overestimation occurs in multiple occasions with respect to seasonality there is evidence of srp sinks at almost all times except the s range 0 45 to 0 50 corresponding to mid spring where there is evidence of srp sources fig 6e admodel p gives fair predictions except at s values around 0 45 0 50 and 0 84 corresponding to mid end spring where srp is often overestimated despite the large simulated uptake values there is no clear evidence that additional op sinks or sources are dominant at certain times fig 6f with the exception of the s range 0 45 to 0 60 where in stream sinks of op are evident overestimations of op occur between spring and mid summer s above approximatively 0 49 while underestimations occur at the beginning of winter s around 0 02 it is suspected that accuracy at different seasons may be improved by an improved biotic processes representation taking into account additional controlling parameters such as solar radiation or algae since there is an overestimation of both srp and op in spring when biological processes are most significant 5 4 putting findings in the context of other river phosphorus models admodel p represents a phenomena based simulation of phosphorus dynamics in rivers it differs from other widely available models in that it uses information on river flow water temperature and seasonality to generate empirical relations to summarise the variation in process rates constants m and r values are estimated and applied to these functions to generate rate constants k values the rate constants coupled with zero or first order dependency on the source p pool define variation in fluxes of phosphorus in contrast deterministic models such as inca p jackson blake et al 2016 swat neitsch et al 2011 ce qual w2 cole and wells 2006 and efdc wu and xu 2011 directly use theoretical relationships along a spectrum of complexity in hydrobiochemical dynamics for example isotherm kinetics particulate settling biotic uptake related to primary productivity and require a number of additional measurements or assumptions to define these fluxes the modelling in the present study demonstrates that if q t and s are known then considerable model skill nse 0 24 0 62 can be achieved in simulating sub daily dynamics of op and srp in the river swale system evidence from wellen et al 2015 suggests that despite a relatively small number of parameters for optimisation 8 empirical coefficients this compares favourably to other studies at sub daily resolution sub daily studies are scarce approximately 2 of studies of the studies reviewed by wellen et al 2015 few appear to address identification of in channel processes reflecting a trend towards whole basin large scale system assessment as identified in section 1 above it is instructive to compare admodel p process representation and performance with the simply p model jackson blake et al 2017 which represents a simplification of inca p having an order of magnitude fewer calibration parameters and achieved without a substantial sacrificing model performance river particulate phosphorus in simply p is entirely controlled by particulate behaviour sedimentation and resuspension additionally for dissolved p although substantial retention has been identified from controlled channel experiments house et al 1995 the simply p model omits biotic uptake and net adsorption treating it as a conservative substance within the channel jackson blake et al 2017 evaluated the model comparison in a small scottish rural catchment otherwise similar to the swale short residence time gives limited opportunity for riverine processes to become a significant part of catchment mass balance in identifying the importance of net sedimentation and the lack of influence of biotic uptake the present study corroborates jackson blake et al 2017 although contrastingly identifies importance of desorption and conversion of inorganic to organic forms to be important performance statistics for the two models are broadly similar 6 conclusions admodel p is a powerful simulation tool capable to make detailed dynamic predictions with reasonable accuracy for the case of river swale the complexity of phenomena involving p compounds during their transport along the river has been treated with special care during our demarche of finding the optimum representation of transformations included in admodel p five transformations have been considered mineralization sedimentation resuspension uptake and adsorption desorption and thereby estimated using empirical coefficients catering for a wide range of conditions with respect to water flow water temperatures and seasonality the values identified for the coefficients and consequently for the process rates reveal that interaction with sediments and transformation of inorganic p to organic p species are the dominant processes while the uptake has the lowest influence on inorganic p variability simulation results are in agreement with results based on experimental data showing interactions between water and sediments to be highly significant overall sinks of phosphorus appear to be more important than sources during most of the events studied results suggest adsorption desorption processes are likely to predominate the rates of interaction with the sediments are highly influenced by the water flow via the sedimentation and resuspension rates by the water temperature via adsorption desorption rate and by seasonality via resuspension rate the conversion of inorganic to organic forms of p as well as the mineralization of op to srp are influenced by water temperature the biological uptake of srp is influenced by the water flow and seasonality model skill has been discussed in the context of the transformation rate coefficients and their main controlling factors visual correlations have been offered as support for discussions such information can be of additional use as support for other projects related to the identification and formulation of transformation models for different case studies work to further improve performance of admodel p may include the estimation of uptake using chlorophyll measurements or adding new pollutant species for which field data is available e g silica models such as admodel p are needed to support water quality management in all rivers these include those less polluted river networks such as the ouse of which the swale is a part which has been evaluated as oligotrophic mesotrophic by hutchins et al 2010 but with risk of degenerating to a mesotrophic eutrophic system by 2080 the wider implications from this point of view are the options to adapt admodel p to other monitored river stretches over different time scales which may have levels of accrual or depletion of legacy phosphorus contrasting to those in the swale in the 1990s studies using admodel to identify change in process rate parameters through a set of sequential applications at intervals before and after undergoing mandatory upgrades in wastewater treatment would improve mechanistic understanding of how river systems respond to interventions and the extent to which legacy effects weaken the expected benefits the model structure is based on general principles of flow routing pollutant transport and phosphorus transformations and whilst site specific calibration is necessary it is transferable to any other situation the approach described here whereby process rates are estimated based on readily available hydro climatic and seasonal information can also be used as a means to

3103,flood inundation forecast maps provide an essential tool to disaster management teams for planning and preparation ahead of a flood event in order to mitigate the impacts of flooding on the community evaluating the accuracy of forecast flood maps is essential for model development and improving future flood predictions conventional quantitative binary verification measures typically provide a domain averaged score at grid level of forecast skill this score is dependent on the magnitude of the flood and the spatial scale of the flood map binary scores have limited physical meaning and do not indicate location specific variations in forecast skill that enable targeted model improvements to be made a new scale selective approach is presented here to evaluate forecast flood inundation maps against remotely observed flood extents a neighbourhood approach based on the fraction skill score is applied to assess the spatial scale at which the forecast becomes skilful at capturing the observed flood this skilful scale varies with location and when combined with a contingency map creates a novel categorical scale map a valuable visual tool for model evaluation and development the impact of model improvements on forecast flood map accuracy skill scores are often masked by large areas of correctly predicted flooded unflooded cells to address this the accuracy of the flood edge location is evaluated the flood edge location accuracy proves to be more sensitive to variations in forecast skill and spatial scale compared to the accuracy of the entire flood extent additionally the resulting skilful scale of the flood edge provides a physically meaningful verification measure of the forecast flood edge discrepancy the methods are illustrated by application to a case study flood event with an estimated return period of 120 to 550 years of the river wye and river lugg uk in february 2020 representation errors are introduced where remote sensing observations capture flood extent at different spatial resolutions in comparison with the model the sensitivity of the verified skilful scale to the resolution of the observations is investigated re scaling and interpolating observations leads to a small reduction in skill score compared with the observation flood map derived at the model resolution the domain averaged skilful scale remains the same with slight location specific variations in skilful scale evident on the categorical scale map overall our novel emphasis on scale rather than domain average score means that comparisons can be made across different flooding scenarios and forecast systems and between forecasts at different spatial scales keywords flood maps spatial verification scale selective sar code and data availability the functions used to evaluate the forecast flood maps using a scale selective approach along with the sar derived and forecast flood maps are available on the following zenodo page https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6011882 hooker 2022 1 introduction timely predictions of flood extent and depth from flood forecasting systems provide essential information to flood risk managers that enable anticipatory action prior to the occurrence of a potential flooding event evaluating the accuracy of flood extent forecasts against observations forms an essential part of model development schumann 2019 forecast flood inundation footprints are typically validated against remote sensing images using binary performance measures stephens et al 2014 calculated at grid level in order to produce a forecast flood map hydrodynamic or hydraulic flood models in two dimensions simulate the flow of water using a local digital terrain model dtm the spatial resolution of dtms has increased over recent years and is important for accurate flood mapping for example in the uk the environment agency national lidar programme offers open source 1 m surface elevation data for the whole of england environment agency 2021 additional surface detail to 0 3 m spatial resolution from unmanned aerial vehicle uav lidar data acquired in urban areas is now possible trepekli et al 2021 this means forecast flood maps could be presented at this very high resolution it is questionable how meaningful it is to present highly detailed flood maps as a deterministic forecast savage et al 2016 particularly at longer lead times where the skill of the flood forecasting system becomes increasingly dependent on the accuracy of the meteorological forecast ecmwf 2022 speight et al 2021 note for surface water flooding that more detail is included in local scale flood maps than can be justified by the predictability of the forecast a high resolution fine scale forecast flood map will show greater detail of the flood extent and the flood edge location compared to a low resolution coarse scale flood map at a high resolution the discrepancy between the forecast and observed flood maps may be closer in terms of distance however a small mismatch will lead to a double penalty impact on forecast verification the model is penalised twice for the over prediction false alarm and the under prediction miss stein and stoop 2019 when high resolution forecasts are verified against observations at grid level the predictability can appear to worsen and the high resolution forecast would need to perform better than the low resolution forecast to achieve the same verification score it is not meaningful to compare verification scores across different spatial scales spatial verification methods for flood inundation mapping have only received limited attention over the past decade schumann 2019 verification approaches that account for uncertainties in observations and small discrepancies in gridded data using a fuzzy set approach hagen 2003 have previously been applied to flood mapping pappenberger et al 2007 dasgupta et al 2018 however the fuzzy set method does not incorporate variations in spatial scale cloke and pappenberger 2008 in atmospheric sciences verification approaches that account for changes in spatial scale are well established these approaches include the fraction skill score fss which applies a neighbourhood approach to assess a useful skilful scale roberts and lean 2008 of a precipitation forecast dey et al 2014 2016 developed the fss approach to produce location specific agreement scales between the forecast and observed fields to understand the spatial predictability of an ensemble forecast other spatial scale approaches include the wavelet method of scale decomposition where the forecast and observed fields are decomposed into maps at different scales by wavelet transformation and subsequently verified briggs and levine 1997 casati and wilson 2007 cloke and pappenberger 2008 note that this method is extremely sensitive to offsetting of maps in general the performance of forecast flood maps are evaluated for the entire flood extent regardless of flood magnitude adding bias to binary performance measures stephens et al 2014 stephens et al 2014 question whether it is important to validate all flooded cells when only cells that are close to the flood margin are difficult to predict pappenberger et al 2007 evaluated model performance only on cells that were subject to change between differing model runs to address the issue of large areas of correctly predicted flooded unflooded cells masking variations in forecast skill scores satellite based synthetic aperture radar sar sensors are well known for their flood detection capability unobstructed flood waters appear dark on sar images due to the low backscatter return from the relatively smooth water surface sar sensors also have an advantage over optical instruments as they can scan at night and are not impacted by cloud and weather usually associated with a flooding situation due to improvements in spatial resolution and more frequent revisit times sar data has been used successfully to calibrate and validate hydrodynamic and hydraulic forecast models schumann et al 2009 grimaldi et al 2016 further model improvements have been shown through the assimilation of sar data e g garcía pintado et al

et al 2018 2021a b the copernicus emergency management service cems copernicus programme 2021 offers freely available open access sentinel 1 sar data currently due to the malfunction of sentinel 1b in december 2021 one satellite is in orbit at 10 m ground resolution and a six day revisit time for the mid latitudes nevertheless sentinel 1 data offers good coverage of a potential flood event for a major flood event cems can be triggered to offer additional rapid flood mapping from 2022 the new global flood monitoring gfm product gfm 2021 hostache et al 2021 of the copernicus emergency management service cems copernicus programme 2021 produces sentinel 1 sar derived flood inundation maps using three flood detection algorithms providing uncertainty and population affected estimates within 8 hours of the image acquisition representation errors arise where observation spatial scales are different from the model spatial scale janjić et al 2018 the spatial resolution of sar imagery suitable for flood detection varies across satellite constellation both historically and presently and continues to improve very high resolution less than 3 m imaging capabilities are increasingly available including terrasar x alos 2 palsar 2 and the cosmo skymed radarsat 2 and iceye constellations mason et al 2021a it is common practice to re scale sar derived flood maps to match the model grid size for validation or assimilation with model data the objective of this paper is to present a scale selective approach to evaluate flood inundation forecast maps and to develop a physically meaningful measure of flood edge location accuracy that can be automated and easily applied in practice the method has been developed with operational forecast verification in mind but it is applicable to all flood inundation maps a new approach is described and applied here to evaluate the spatial scale at which the forecast becomes useful skilful at capturing the remotely observed flood extent and specifically the flood edge location the spatial skill of a forecast flood map varies with location we aim to improve the conventional contingency map by incorporating the skilful scale to create a new categorical scale map also we address how representation errors arising from observation spatial scale variations and interpolation have an impact on model evaluation in the rest of this paper we explore the features of a novel scale selective evaluation approach illustrated through application to a case study in section 2 we describe the case study a recent flooding event in the uk following storm dennis february 2020 along with catchment descriptions for three chosen domains the flood inundation forecasting system developed by jba consulting flood foresight revilla romero et al 2017 is used to produce forecast flood maps for the event and is detailed in section 3 1 section 3 2 explains two methods that are used to derive remotely observed flood maps from sar imagery our new approach to the spatial evaluation of flood maps is detailed in section 4 along with descriptions of other binary performance measures the novel categorical scale map is applied to the case studies in section 5 and the evaluation results are discussed we conclude in section 6 and discuss the wider applications of a spatial scale approach to flood map skill evaluation 2 flood event this extreme flooding event is chosen here as a case study to demonstrate the features of a spatial scale approach to forecast flood map evaluation during february 2020 three named storms ciara dennis and jorge arrived in quick succession delivered by a powerful and ideally positioned jet stream that enabled rapid cyclogenesis davies et al 2021 each storm rapidly intensified and deepened bringing damaging winds and exceptionally heavy rainfall across the uk met office 2020 this led to the river wye reaching its highest ever recorded water level at the old bridge in hereford riverlevels uk 2020 the annual exceedance probability aep for the recorded peak flow of the lugg and wye rivers was 0 2 0 8 return period 120 550 years and 0 6 2 0 160 550 years respectively sefton et al 2021 2 1 february 2020 february 2020 was the uk s wettest february on record and the fifth wettest month ever recorded the uk average rainfall total exceeded the 1981 2010 average by 237 kendon 2020 locally in northwest england and north wales the rainfall exceedance was three to four times the typical monthly average rainfall during this period around 4000 to 5000 properties were flooded in the uk with significant river water levels recorded in wales west and northwest england sefton et al 2021 with six days between ciara and dennis groundwater and river levels were high and soils saturated the environment agency issued a record number of over 600 flood alerts and warnings for england jba 2021 2 2 catchment location and description three domains each differing in hydrological characteristics have been selected for forecast flood map evaluation during the storm dennis flooding event two domains a and b have been chosen from the wye catchment fig 1 a 28 4 km length centred upon ross on wye a and the wye at hereford b a 5 8 km section a third domain c includes 4 km of the river lugg 2 2 1 the river wye domains a and b the river wye flows for approximately 215 km from plynlimon at 750 metres above ordnance datum maod in the cambrian mountains mid wales it initially travels southeastwards into england where it meanders southwards to ultimately join the severn estuary the upper catchment land cover is predominantly grassland with some forest cover with highly impermeable bedrock and superficial deposits of sand and gravel in the hereford area national river flow archive 2021 the upstream catchment area of hereford is 1896 km2 at hereford the only city situated on the wye the river is embanked on the north side by a deep flood wall with further embankments on the opposite side hereford is characterised by the old bridge a 15th century stone bridge that creates a damming effect during high river flows as the wye flows south of hereford the topography flattens and the floodplain widens with large river meanders and a distinctive u shaped valley 2 2 2 river lugg at lugwardine domain c the river lugg has an upstream catchment area of 886 km2 and a maximum altitude of 660 maod and flows across the grasslands and agricultural fields of the herefordshire plain it has similar bedrock to the wye catchment and a higher proportion of more permeable superficial fluvial deposits of sand and gravel this is particularly evident in the lugwardine region where the topography is relatively flat with little to impede the flow of floodwaters across the plain the lugg flows into the river wye 2 km south of domain c 2 2 3 event hydrology the observed catchment rainfall which also includes a downstream section of the river wye shows that 50 mm fell on the 15th 10 mm on the 16th and 1 mm on the 17th february 2020 uk water resources portal 2022 there were further heavy showers forecast for the 16 17th and whilst these have not been captured by the rain gauges on the 17th they cannot be ruled out as contributing to surface water flooding in hereford the nearest hourly rainfall rate observation is a citizen science observation from the met office wow database met office 2022 for a site at sutton st nicholas near the river lugg and this shows the highest rainfall rate of 5 8 mm hr at 0300 on the 16th and a total accumulation of 12 5 mm on the 16th and 0 3 mm on the 17th daily maximum river levels recorded at ross on wye the old bridge hereford and lugwardine for january to march 2020 are plotted in fig 2 riverlevels uk 2020 the impact of the three storms on the river wye is indicated by a very sharp rise in water levels from the 8th to the 10th february following storm ciara further heavy showers maintained high water levels before storm dennis brought an exceptional rise in water levels peaking on the morning of the 17th february with record levels recorded at hereford 6 11 m at 9 30 am uct and ross on wye 4 77 m at 5 45 am utc unfortunately there are two days of missing data at ross on wye following the flood event by analysing the trend between the hereford and ross on wye river levels the peak level at ross on wye was likely higher and later than recorded the response of the wye at hereford is faster than at ross on wye most likely due to the upstream location of hereford and a more constrained embankment with the city center located either side of the river in comparison to the fast rapid response of the wye the river lugg displays a distinctively dampened response whilst the lugg initially responded quickly to the heavy rainfall once bankfull was reached and overtopping occurred the water levels remained consistently high with floodwaters extending across the relatively flat flood plain 3 data in this section we describe the model and observation data that we will use to illustrate our novel scale selective verification approach 3 1 flood foresight flood foresight fig 3 developed and run routinely by jba consulting is a fluvial flood inundation mapping system that can be implemented in any catchment around the globe flood foresight utilises a simulation library approach to generate maps of real time and forecast flood inundation and water depth the simulation library approach saves valuable computing time and allows the application of flood foresight in near continuous real time at national and international scales a library of flood maps is pre computed using jflow a 2d hydrodynamic model bradbrook 2006 note that in this study the flood maps are undefended i e temporary flood defences are not included jflow uses a raster based approach with a detailed underlying dtm and a simplified form of the full 2d hydrodynamic equations that capture the main controls of the flood routing for shallow topographically driven flow five flood maps at 5 m resolution are created for 20 75 100 200 and 1000 year return period flood events corresponding to annual exceedance probabilities aeps of 5 1 3 1 0 5 and 0 1 respectively these are interpolated to derive five intermediate maps between each adjacent pair of the jflow maps equally spaced in return period creating a total library of thirty flood maps flood foresight takes inputs of rainfall from numerical weather prediction nwp models river gauge data both historical and real time and forecast streamflow and uses these to select the most appropriate flood map for the location and forecast time period the uk and ireland configurations of the flood forecasting module use deterministic streamflow forecast data from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi european hydrological predictions for the environment e hype the meteorological input data for the e hype model is the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf atmospheric model high resolution hres numerical weather prediction nwp model on a 0 1 0 1 grid with forecasts issued daily out to 10 days lead time forecast flood maps for the uk are produced on a 25 m grid length out to 10 days ahead see mason et al 2021b section 2 1 for additional details 3 2 sar derived flood maps two methods are applied to derive a flood map from sar backscatter values captured close to the flood peak the second method was included as it provides derivation of flood maps at different spatial resolutions a sentinel 1 s1b image was acquired in interferometric wide swath mode swath width 250 km just prior to the flood peak at 0622 on the 17th february a pre flood image september 2019 from the same satellite sensor and track was used to derive the flood map in both methods in the first method the esa grid processing on demand gpod hasard service http gpod eo esa int has been utilised the automated flood mapping algorithm chini et al 2017 uses a statistical hierarchical split based approach to distinguish the two classes flood and background using a pre flood and flood image level 1 grd product sar images vv are preproccesed which involves precise orbit correction radiometric calibration thermal noise removal speckle reduction terrain correction and reprojection to the wgs84 coordinate system the hasard mapping algorithm removes permanent water bodies including the river water flooded areas beneath vegetation bridges and near to buildings are not detected using this method the hasard flood map at 20 m spatial scale is used to evaluate the performance of flood foresight for each of the three domains out to 10 days lead time in the second method the same sentinel 1 sar image in this case using both vv and vh was processed using google earth engine gee to derive flood maps at a range of spatial resolutions 5 m to 25 m gee holds a catalogue of level 1 preprocessed sentinel 1 sar images google earth engine catalog 2021 a smoothing filter is applied to reduce speckle and a pre and post flood image are used to train a classification and regression tree cart classifier breiman et al 1984 google earth engine cart 2021 the classifier is applied to the whole image to produce a flood map at a specified scale gee uses an image pyramid approach to scale or pixel resolution analysis this means variations in the scale selected are determined from the scale of the input image google earth engine scale 2021 the variation of the flood extent detected at a range of spatial resolutions and the impact of re scaling and interpolation errors on performance measures are investigated flood foresight forecast flood maps include the river channel and exclude surface features such as vegetation and buildings to smooth the hasard and gee flood maps and allow a fairer comparison we apply a morphological closing operation without impacting the location of the flood extent to flood fill vegetation and buildings 4 flood map evaluation methods the following subsections detail a new spatial scale selective approach to forecast flood map evaluation the fraction skill score fss developed by roberts and lean 2008 for validation of convective precipitation forecasts in atmospheric science uses a neighbourhood approach to determine the scale at which the forecast becomes skilful dey et al 2016 developed this approach to determine an agreement scale between an ensemble forecast and observations at each grid cell to add location specific information here we extend the technique to apply it to the new application of flood inundation mapping and further develop a novel categorical scale map that combines an agreement scale map with a conventional contingency map 4 1 spatial scale selective approach initially the observed flood extent derived from sar data is re scaled to match the forecast flood map grid size using spline interpolation and both are converted into binary fields a threshold approach is determined for the situation for a flood map verification of spatial skill the simplest example applied here is to assign each grid cell as flooded 1 or unflooded 0 for the whole domain alternative future threshold approaches for flood inundation maps could include applying thresholds to water depth percentiles the location of the flood edge cells can be extracted from the observed and modelled binary flood maps given a domain of interest we number all of the grid cells according to their spatial coordinates i j i 1 n x and j 1 n y where n x is the number of columns in the domain and n y is the number of rows for each grid cell a square of length n forms an n n neighbourhood surrounding the grid cell the fraction of 1 s in the square neighbourhood is calculated for each grid cell this creates two fields of fractions over the domain for both the forecast m n i j and observed o n i j data the fraction fields are compared against one another to calculate the mean squared error mse for the neighbourhood 1 m s e n 1 n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y o n i j m n i j 2 based on the fractions calculated for the model and observed fields a worst possible mse is calculated 2 m s e n r e f 1 n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y o n i j 2 m n i j 2 the fss is given by 3 f s s n 1 m s e n m s e n r e f fig 4 illustrates an example of the fss application at grid level n 1 and at the next neighbourhood size n 3 in this simple example there is no agreement between the model and observation at grid level but at n 3 the skill score improves to 0 92 in general the fss is calculated for each length of neighbourhood n for a given neighbourhood size an fss of 1 is said to have perfect skill and 0 means no skill the fss will increase as n increases up to an asymptote see fig 3 from roberts and lean 2008 if there is no model bias across the whole domain of interest observed and forecast flooded areas are the same then the asymptotic fraction skill score afss at n 2 n 1 where n is the number of grid cells along the longest side of the domain will equal 1 plotting fss against spatial scale can indicate a range of scales where the model is deemed to be the most useful this usefulness is a trade off between being too smooth larger n or too fine where the forecast skill is lost and the computation time lengthy the gradient of the fss curve versus neighbourhood size is another indicator of forecast skill with respect to spatial scale a steeper gradient indicates more rapidly improving skill over smaller grid sizes compared with a flatter curve indicating a much wider neighbourhood is required to reach the same skill score a target fss score f s s t is defined as 4 f s s t 0 5 f o 2 where f 0 is the fraction of flood observed across the whole domain of interest and can be thought of as being equidistant between the skill of a random forecast and perfect skill f s s t will vary depending on the magnitude of the observed flood relative to the domain area this allows the comparison of the f s s t scale across different domain sizes and floods of different magnitudes when the fss is plotted against spatial scale neighbourhood size we can identify a spatial scale when the fss first equals or exceeds f s s t fig 6 shows an example of this plot the spatial scale neighbourhood size reached at f s s t can tell us the displacement distance d t between the observed and forecast flood or more meaningfully the flood edge locations as the flood edge represents a very small fraction of the domain the scale at f s s t will tend to 2 d t meaning the displacement distance is half of this scale see figure 4 in roberts and lean 2008 it has been shown by skok and roberts 2016 that care must be taken when calculating the fss near to the domain boundary since increasingly larger neighbourhood sizes would extend further beyond the boundary edge skok and roberts 2016 concluded that as long as the domain was sufficiently large relative to the spatial errors then the boundary effect could be considered to be insignificant for flood mapping verification purposes the domain area should be selected to include the area of interest e g the floodplain with the neighbourhoods considered extending beyond the domain at the boundary this assumes that the observations available allow this if this is not that case then another boundary method could be applied such as cropping at the domain edge 4 2 location dependent agreement scales the fss gives an overall domain averaged measure of forecast performance and an average minimum scale at which the forecast is deemed skilful dey et al 2016 describe a method for calculating an agreement scale at each grid cell located at coordinate position i j a brief summary of the method is presented here two fields are considered f 1 i j and f 2 i j in this application these are the forecast and observed fields in alternative applications the method could be applied to measure similarity between members of an ensemble the fields in this instance are not required to be thresholded and can be applied to flood depths the aim is to find a minimum neighbourhood size or scale for every grid point such that there is an agreement between f 1 i j and f 2 i j this is known as the agreement scale s i j the relationship between the agreement scale and the neighbourhood size described in section 4 1 is given by s i j n 1 2 firstly all grid points are compared by calculating the relative mse d i j s at the grid scale s 0 n 1 5 d i j s f 1 i j s f 2 i j s 2 f 1 i j s 2 f 2 i j s 2 if f 1 i j 0 and f 2 i j 0 both dry then d i j s 0 correct at grid level note that d i j s varies from zero to 1 the fields are considered to be in agreement at the scale being tested if 6 d i j s d c r i t i j s i j where d c r i t i j s α 1 α s s l i m and s l i m is a predetermined fixed maximum scale the parameter value α is chosen to indicate the acceptable bias at grid level such that 0 α 1 here we set α 0 no background bias if d i j s d c r i t i j s then the next neighbourhood size up is considered s 1 a 3 by 3 square the process continues with increasingly larger neighbourhoods until the agreement scale or s l i m is reached for every cell in the domain of interest the agreement scale at each grid cell is then mapped onto the domain of interest 4 3 categorical scale map currently the agreement scale map proposed by dey et al 2016 provides a location specific scale of agreement between the forecast and observed flood map however it does not show whether the model is over or under predicting the flood extent in our work we develop the agreement scale map further by combining with a contingency map for the forecast to create a new categorical scale map this highlights the agreement scale for areas of over or under prediction in a contingency map each cell in the forecast and observed flood map are compared and classified using a contingency table table 1 the categories are re classified numerically in the array for automated updating of the agreement scale map over predicted cells b are set to 1 under predicted cells c are set to 1 correctly predicted flooded cells a are assigned nan and correctly predicted unflooded cells are set to 0 the array element wise product of the agreement scale map and the numerical contingency map produces the new categorical scale map 4 4 binary performance measures it has been suggested by cloke and pappenberger 2008 that a range of performance measures should be applied so that a forecast can be assessed as rigorously as possible a selection of commonly applied binary performance measures each focusing on a different aspect of performance have been included here for comparison with the fraction skill score results following the application of a contingency table table 1 to the forecast flood map a number of binary performance measures can be calculated table 2 table 2 describes the range of performance value the ideal score and a description of which aspects of the forecast flood map performance each binary measure assesses 5 results we illustrate and discuss our new method applied to the flood event in sections 5 1 and 5 2 the scale selective approach is applied to an extreme flooding event in the uk to determine a useful skilful spatial scale for both the entire flood extent and the flood edge location for three domains out to 10 days lead time an example forecast flood map for 0 day lead time compared with the sar derived flood map is presented as a contingency map in fig 5 the zoomed in perspective shows the double penalty impact described in section 1 the discrepancy at the flood edge depends on the spatial scale of the forecast flood maps along with the model performance next in section 5 3 location specific agreement scales are presented on categorical scale maps the final section 5 4 addresses the question of the impact of representation error caused by variations in sar derived flood map spatial resolution on the evaluation results 5 1 spatial scale variability of forecast flood extent and flood edge location an evaluation of the spatial skill of the flood foresight forecast flood maps against the sar derived flood map for the flood peak on the 17th february 2020 has been calculated for each domain fig 1 for both the entire flood extent and the flood edge location the fraction skill score fss is applied to increasing neighbourhood sizes n to determine the spatial scale at which the forecast becomes skilful at capturing the observed flood fig 6 shows fss against n for one example the river lugg domain c for the entire flood a and the flood edge b each line represents a different model run date from the 10 02 2020 7 day lead time to the 17 02 2020 0 day lead time with the exception of the 7 day lead time all forecasts for the whole flood fig 6a exceed the f s s t at grid level n 1 with gradually improving skill as n increases in contrast to this the fss applied to the flood edge fig 6b shows all forecasts below f s s t at grid level and n 3 with the skill increasing more rapidly compared with the whole flood to reach f s s t at n 5 for all run dates within a 5 day lead time except for 16 02 2020 which is just below f s s t this indicates that the flood edge is forecast to be around 62 5 m from the observed flood edge on average for a 5 day lead time the difference between the gradients of the plots indicate the flood edge is more sensitive to changes in spatial scale compared with evaluation of the whole flooded area the whole flood verification here indicates a strong model performance however verifying the whole flood alone could mask the flood edge location performance which in this case has a coarser scale at f s s t similar trends in fss with neighbourhood size and comparisons between the entire flood and the flood edge verification scales are found for all domains the rate of fss increase or fss gradient with n tells us how quickly the forecast skill improves with increasing scale a more spatially accurate forecast of the flood edge will demonstrate a steeper gradient reaching f s s t at a smaller neighbourhood size 5 2 comparison of spatial scales at differing lead times and domain location the performance measures for each domain for daily lead times out to 10 days are presented in fig 7 the fss at n 1 3 and 5 are shown along with critical success index csi hit rate hr pierce skill score pss and the bias see table 2 for definitions the bias score is an indicator of over or under prediction of the flood extent and is plotted on a separate axis to account for the larger range for lead times within 5 days of the flood peak f s s 0 8 for the entire flooded area at grid level for the river wye domain a indicates a strong model performance fig 7a there is a dip in the fss on the 16 02 2020 where the forecast over predicts the flood extent this is also reflected in the csi score in contrast to this the hr and pss increase despite the over prediction as more observed flood cells are correctly predicted wet we note that the pss hr far does account for over prediction however the far is the fraction of the dry area incorrectly predicted wet which is very small relative to the hr 0 03 versus 0 90 validation of the river wye flood edge fig 7b is more sensitive to changes in neighbourhood size compared with the whole flood validation here the flood edge is very well forecast in terms of spatial location and exceeds f s s t at n 3 on average 37 5 m displacement for a 5 day lead time except for 1 day lead time where f s s t is exceeded at n 5 as shown previously in section 5 1 the forecast of the river lugg flood edge is skilful at n 5 fig 7f on average 62 5 m displacement for a 5 day lead time differences in the hydrological characteristics might explain differences in model performance the wye valley flood plain is well defined with distinctive valley sides and this event proved to be valley filling in contrast to the lugg flood plain which is relatively flat and extensive this could explain the increased skill shown for the prediction of the wye flood edge the average observed flood top width for the lugg domain c is 740 m and for the wye domain a 430 m this gives a flood edge displacement as a fraction of the flood top width of 7 4 for the lugg and 7 8 for the wye the results for all three domains show that for this case study the forecasting system has limited skill beyond a five day lead time the forecast accuracy of the meteorological driving data diminishes with increasing lead time ecmwf 2022 extratropical cyclones etcs are the dominant meteorological driver of major winter flooding in the uk this is particularly true when an atmospheric river is associated with an etc and when etcs arrive in clusters as was the case here bringing multiple spells of heavy precipitation lavers et al 2011 griffith et al 2020 the typical formation time of etcs is 3 5 days occasionally up to 10 days ulbrich et al 2009 which limits the predictability of the meteorological system particularly when the jet stream is very strong as was the case here the atmospheric and precipitation predictability will vary depending on the situation for example a slow moving etc close to the uk would potentially have a longer lead time of useful prediction conversely flooding in the summer associated with convection would likely have a shorter skilful lead time the scale selective approach presented here can be used to determine a meaningful scale to present flood inundation maps this scale will vary with forecast lead time and will depend on the predictability of the meteorological situation there is more variation in skilful scale with lead time evident for the wye at hereford domain b in fig 7c and d compared with domain a and c to achieve the same fss for the whole flood as domain a and c up to a 5 day lead time the neighbourhood size would need to exceed n 5 the model is over predicting the flood extent in particular on the 16 02 2020 1 day lead time this overprediction at 1 day lead time is evident for all domains as can be seen in the bias scores but the impact of this is most noticeable at hereford hereford has more complex topography compared to the other domains particularly along the river bank with bridges buildings permanent and temporary flood defences deployed during the event affecting the flow of the flood wave through the city the maps used in the simulation library of flood foresight are produced using a bare earth dtm despite this the model performs well exceeding f s s t at n 5 at the 5 day and 2 day lead times for the flood edge forecast overall the fss indicates a similar trend in performance across all results as the commonly applied csi the value of f s s t is determined by the magnitude of the observed flood which means the skilful scale determined at f s s t can be meaningfully compared across the domains the skilful scale of the forecast flood edge location gives an average discrepancy distance a physically meaningful evaluation measure provides additional information compared to a conventional verification score 5 3 categorical scale maps location dependent categorical scale maps section 4 3 have been calculated for all run dates for both the entire flooded area and the flood edge fig 8 shows categorical scale maps for the whole flood for three different lead times for each domain longer lead times are on the left the run dates vary with domain to present the most informative maps such that variation in forecast skill can be seen across the different lead times the colours on the map indicate grid cell specific agreement scales section 4 2 between the forecast flood map and the sar derived flood map grey white regions indicate correctly predicted flooded unflooded cells red shows the forecast flood extent is under predicted miss and blue indicates over prediction false alarm increasingly darker shades of red blue show that larger scales were needed for the agreement criteria to be met the darkest blue at s 10 indicates a total mismatch between forecast and observed flooding the addition of the agreement scale information in comparison to a conventional contingency map for an example see fig 5 quickly highlights regions of total mismatch through the darkest shading with areas that are slightly misaligned in lighter shades the agreement scale indicated gives a physical measure of distance at specific locations between the forecast and the observed flood map where s s l i m the location specific skilful scale varies with location and lead time as indicated on the categorical scale maps for a 7 day lead time forecast for the river wye fig 8a the model is indicating some flooding could occur although under estimating the total extent as shown by the darkest red areas which show the limits of the agreement scale have been reached by 5 days lead time the forecast is in very close agreement with the observed flood at grid level in grey with larger agreement scales indicated by red blue shading along some of the flood edge locations fig 8b and a balance between under and over prediction over prediction is more evident by 1 day lead time for the river wye fig 8c and flooding is also over predicted along smaller tributaries there are several detached areas of flooding observed remotely that are most likely due to ponding of surface water flooding which were not predicted by the fluvial flood forecasting system the hereford forecast is most skilful on the 12th february fig 8d with over prediction particularly towards the southwest at 3 day and 1 day lead times fig 8e and f a small stream running southwards to the wye the eign brook could be contributing to the over prediction seen here it is also worth mentioning that sar will struggle to detect flood waters where buildings are closer together when the distance between them is less than the ground resolution of the sar shadow and layover effects due to the side looking nature of the sar also mean flood detection is more difficult in urban areas mason et al 2021a this will likely only impact a small area of the hereford domain but this observation uncertainty should be considered when interpreting these results there is an area of under prediction of the flood extent in the centre of the hereford domain visible at all lead times this could be due to surface water flooding which most likely occurred due to the very high intensity rainfall observed this combined with the urban area and steeply sloping gradient to the north of this area most likely contributed to rapid surface water runoff towards the river since flood foresight is a fluvial flood forecast system we would not expect surface water flooding such as this to be predicted flood foresight selects multiple flood maps and stitches them together when the return period threshold is exceeded for a given area the hereford section of the wye does not trigger a flood map selection until a 5 day lead time this area also influences part of the river lugg flood map and can be seen as a mismatch on the lower left hand side of fig 8g and h once this is included the forecast flood map is in very good agreement from a 5 day lead time there are areas that could be further improved indicated by the lighter shading fig 8i an acceptable level of agreement scale could be determined for a given situation for example n 5 and efforts made to understand improve larger agreement scales at specific locations these improvements might include changes to infrastructure included in the dtm used in the hydraulic modelling for example 5 4 sar derived flood map scale variation in practice particularly where a flood event is prolonged or the flooding extent covers a wide area there may be multiple sources of sar data available for model evaluation usually at higher spatial resolutions compared to the model grid size e g iceye in spot mode at 1 m and strip mode at 3 m ground resolution it is important to consider the impact of using observations at different spatial scales on the scale selective approach results by conducting a simulation experiment we address the question of how re scaling and interpolating three higher spatial resolution sar derived flood maps relative to the forecast flood maps affects the scale selective skill scores and location specific forecast skill in order to simulate a range of observation spatial scales sar derived flood maps are produced using method two described in section 3 2 at spatial resolutions from 5 m to 25 m these are re scaled by 0 order spline interpolation ndimage zoom 2021 briand and monasse 2018 to match the model resolution 25 m and compared to the forecast flood map for the river lugg 5 day lead time a comparison of the gee flood map against the hasard flood map both at 20 m spatial scale produce almost identical verification scores for all performance measures for the river lugg δ f s s 0 01 the categorical scale maps for the comparison between the forecast flood map and the re scaled simulated sar derived flood maps are shown in fig 9 the resulting domain averaged skill scores for the same forecast flood map against the four sar derived flood maps are displayed in fig 10 the scores are calculated for the whole flood and the flood edge alone in general the categorical scale maps show similar regions of over and under prediction but there are small location specific variations in skilful scale the sar derived flood map at 25 m the same spatial scale as the forecast flood maps shows the best agreement away from the flood edge this is also evident in the overall fss score for the 25 m comparison which marginally outperforms the evaluation after re scaling finer observation flood maps fig 10 the skilful scale determined for each observation comparison of the whole flooding extent is n 1 or at grid level and for the flood edge is at n 5 overall based on the results from this simulation experiment the scale selective approach is not overly sensitive to the observation spatial scale and the skilful scale determined remains the same for each of the observed sar derived flood maps for both the entire flood extent and the flood edge small errors are introduced by re scaling and interpolating finer resolution observations to the model spatial scale which slightly reduce the skill score and change location specific details on the categorical scale maps observation scale selection and re scaling along with interpolation errors must be considered when evaluating model performance particularly where model or observation scales vary in space and time or where comparisons are made across different models 6 discussion and conclusions overall the aim of this paper was to introduce and apply a new scale selective approach to forecast flood map evaluation with an emphasis on providing a physically meaningful verification of the flood edge location the skilful spatial scale for comparison of forecast flood inundation maps against sar derived observed flood extent has been evaluated by the application of the fraction skill score this provides a domain averaged skilful scale the verification measure has been applied to a forecast of an extreme flood event in the uk on the river wye and the river lugg following storm dennis in february 2020 flood foresight inundation predictions with lead times out to 10 days are evaluated against a sentinel 1 sar derived flood map captured close to the flood peak for three domains each differing in hydrological characteristics conventional binary performance measures were calculated alongside the fss for comparison flood edge verification shows greater sensitivity to changes in forecast skill and spatial scale relative to verification of the entire flood extent the skilful scale determined is physically meaningful and can be used to estimate the average flood edge discrepancy from the observed flood edge the observed flood map spatial resolution relative to the model scale is important and re scaling and interpolation errors will impact the model verification scores ideally the observed flood map should be derived at the same spatial scale as the forecast model to minimise these errors in operational practice the scale at which the forecast flood maps are presented to forecasters and decision makers should reflect the uncertainty within the forecast very high resolution flood maps can be presented where a detailed dtm is available if this is presented as a deterministic forecast to flood risk management teams it could lead to an over confidence in the forecast or where the actual observed flood magnitude is different the forecast may be devalued in the future savage et al 2016 speight et al 2021 application of a spatial scale approach to forecast evaluation can determine the scale at which it is best to present the forecast flood map conversely if the model is found to be skilful at grid level there is scope to increase the flood map resolution adding more detail to the flood edge location improvements made to hydrodynamic models such as through data assimilation to improve inputs initial conditions or model parameters may not improve the forecast flood edge location at grid level however improvements may be evident through evaluation using fss across a range of scales categorical scale maps are a useful evaluation and forecasting tool adding location specific detail model improvements can be spatially targeted and as improvements are made the categorical scale map will highlight location specific changes for example the categorical scale maps for hereford indicate the local infrastructure in particular bridges impact the movement of the flood wave which suggests a digital surface model dsm would be beneficial in urban areas the verification approach is presented here in the context of an operational flood forecasting system the skilful scale determined for each flooding scenario lead time and at specific locations within a domain depends on the skill of the entire hydrometeorological chain of forecasting models from the meteorological inputs to the hydrodynamic model run offline in the case study presented here used to determine the inundation extent for a given river discharge the scale selective approach is equally applicable for the validation of flood maps from hydrodynamic models that are not part of an operational system here we focus on the use of sar derived flood maps for validation however the approach would apply to any remotely observed flooding such as from optical satellite data or uav aerial imagery that can be converted into a gridded dataset the fss must be applied to binary data and for this reason it is very easily applicable to flooding extent with grid cells categorised as flooded unflooded in operational forecasting flood depth is also an important metric to verify and by applying a threshold depths below above a certain level or percentile the depth data can be converted for application of fss the method for calculating categorical scale maps does not require binary data and so the depth values can be used directly in the calculations ideally in operational forecast systems quantitative validation should run in tandem with the forecast system where observations are available over time a catalogue of skilful scales flood edge discrepancy distances and categorical scale maps could be built up this catalogue would enable analysis of scale across different flood event type season meteorological scenario forecast lead time and at specific locations within a catchment or sub catchment such a verification library would enable forecasters to increase intuition and expert judgement on the relevant scales for a given forecast based on this analysis and an increased understanding of the predictability of flood inundation forecast flood maps could be presented at a variable scale for example a coarser scale at longer lead times becoming more detailed closer to the flooding event coarse scales can appear jagged or with large steps along the edge and so ideally these would be converted to smooth contours but with some indication for example lighter shading that the flood edge lies somewhere within the width of the grid cell rather than exactly at the contour edge at shorter lead times as forecast confidence is assumed to increase the flood edge location would show more detail and a narrower band of uncertainty grid cell width this flood edge uncertainty information will prove invaluable for impact based forecasting practice the spatial scale approach will also prove a useful tool in multi model performance comparisons where forecast flood maps are presented at different spatial resolutions or to evaluate the performance of an increase in model resolution evaluating a skilful scale for each model can be compared directly whereas the skill score values should not be compared across models with different spatial scales emerton et al 2016 these methods will also benefit surface water flooding verification where the flood map is likely to be localised and discrete and accounting for variations in spatial skill more critical an improved approach to evaluating forecast flood maps will result in improved accuracy in the predictions of flooding ultimately this will benefit disaster management teams and those living in flood prone areas to enable future mitigation of flooding impacts credit authorship contribution statement helen hooker conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

3103,flood inundation forecast maps provide an essential tool to disaster management teams for planning and preparation ahead of a flood event in order to mitigate the impacts of flooding on the community evaluating the accuracy of forecast flood maps is essential for model development and improving future flood predictions conventional quantitative binary verification measures typically provide a domain averaged score at grid level of forecast skill this score is dependent on the magnitude of the flood and the spatial scale of the flood map binary scores have limited physical meaning and do not indicate location specific variations in forecast skill that enable targeted model improvements to be made a new scale selective approach is presented here to evaluate forecast flood inundation maps against remotely observed flood extents a neighbourhood approach based on the fraction skill score is applied to assess the spatial scale at which the forecast becomes skilful at capturing the observed flood this skilful scale varies with location and when combined with a contingency map creates a novel categorical scale map a valuable visual tool for model evaluation and development the impact of model improvements on forecast flood map accuracy skill scores are often masked by large areas of correctly predicted flooded unflooded cells to address this the accuracy of the flood edge location is evaluated the flood edge location accuracy proves to be more sensitive to variations in forecast skill and spatial scale compared to the accuracy of the entire flood extent additionally the resulting skilful scale of the flood edge provides a physically meaningful verification measure of the forecast flood edge discrepancy the methods are illustrated by application to a case study flood event with an estimated return period of 120 to 550 years of the river wye and river lugg uk in february 2020 representation errors are introduced where remote sensing observations capture flood extent at different spatial resolutions in comparison with the model the sensitivity of the verified skilful scale to the resolution of the observations is investigated re scaling and interpolating observations leads to a small reduction in skill score compared with the observation flood map derived at the model resolution the domain averaged skilful scale remains the same with slight location specific variations in skilful scale evident on the categorical scale map overall our novel emphasis on scale rather than domain average score means that comparisons can be made across different flooding scenarios and forecast systems and between forecasts at different spatial scales keywords flood maps spatial verification scale selective sar code and data availability the functions used to evaluate the forecast flood maps using a scale selective approach along with the sar derived and forecast flood maps are available on the following zenodo page https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6011882 hooker 2022 1 introduction timely predictions of flood extent and depth from flood forecasting systems provide essential information to flood risk managers that enable anticipatory action prior to the occurrence of a potential flooding event evaluating the accuracy of flood extent forecasts against observations forms an essential part of model development schumann 2019 forecast flood inundation footprints are typically validated against remote sensing images using binary performance measures stephens et al 2014 calculated at grid level in order to produce a forecast flood map hydrodynamic or hydraulic flood models in two dimensions simulate the flow of water using a local digital terrain model dtm the spatial resolution of dtms has increased over recent years and is important for accurate flood mapping for example in the uk the environment agency national lidar programme offers open source 1 m surface elevation data for the whole of england environment agency 2021 additional surface detail to 0 3 m spatial resolution from unmanned aerial vehicle uav lidar data acquired in urban areas is now possible trepekli et al 2021 this means forecast flood maps could be presented at this very high resolution it is questionable how meaningful it is to present highly detailed flood maps as a deterministic forecast savage et al 2016 particularly at longer lead times where the skill of the flood forecasting system becomes increasingly dependent on the accuracy of the meteorological forecast ecmwf 2022 speight et al 2021 note for surface water flooding that more detail is included in local scale flood maps than can be justified by the predictability of the forecast a high resolution fine scale forecast flood map will show greater detail of the flood extent and the flood edge location compared to a low resolution coarse scale flood map at a high resolution the discrepancy between the forecast and observed flood maps may be closer in terms of distance however a small mismatch will lead to a double penalty impact on forecast verification the model is penalised twice for the over prediction false alarm and the under prediction miss stein and stoop 2019 when high resolution forecasts are verified against observations at grid level the predictability can appear to worsen and the high resolution forecast would need to perform better than the low resolution forecast to achieve the same verification score it is not meaningful to compare verification scores across different spatial scales spatial verification methods for flood inundation mapping have only received limited attention over the past decade schumann 2019 verification approaches that account for uncertainties in observations and small discrepancies in gridded data using a fuzzy set approach hagen 2003 have previously been applied to flood mapping pappenberger et al 2007 dasgupta et al 2018 however the fuzzy set method does not incorporate variations in spatial scale cloke and pappenberger 2008 in atmospheric sciences verification approaches that account for changes in spatial scale are well established these approaches include the fraction skill score fss which applies a neighbourhood approach to assess a useful skilful scale roberts and lean 2008 of a precipitation forecast dey et al 2014 2016 developed the fss approach to produce location specific agreement scales between the forecast and observed fields to understand the spatial predictability of an ensemble forecast other spatial scale approaches include the wavelet method of scale decomposition where the forecast and observed fields are decomposed into maps at different scales by wavelet transformation and subsequently verified briggs and levine 1997 casati and wilson 2007 cloke and pappenberger 2008 note that this method is extremely sensitive to offsetting of maps in general the performance of forecast flood maps are evaluated for the entire flood extent regardless of flood magnitude adding bias to binary performance measures stephens et al 2014 stephens et al 2014 question whether it is important to validate all flooded cells when only cells that are close to the flood margin are difficult to predict pappenberger et al 2007 evaluated model performance only on cells that were subject to change between differing model runs to address the issue of large areas of correctly predicted flooded unflooded cells masking variations in forecast skill scores satellite based synthetic aperture radar sar sensors are well known for their flood detection capability unobstructed flood waters appear dark on sar images due to the low backscatter return from the relatively smooth water surface sar sensors also have an advantage over optical instruments as they can scan at night and are not impacted by cloud and weather usually associated with a flooding situation due to improvements in spatial resolution and more frequent revisit times sar data has been used successfully to calibrate and validate hydrodynamic and hydraulic forecast models schumann et al 2009 grimaldi et al 2016 further model improvements have been shown through the assimilation of sar data e g garcía pintado et al 2015 hostache et al 2018 cooper et al 2019 di mauro et al 2020 dasgupta et al 2018 2021a b recent techniques have improved the flood detection in urban areas using medium and high resolution sar mason et al 2018 2021a b the copernicus emergency management service cems copernicus programme 2021 offers freely available open access sentinel 1 sar data currently due to the malfunction of sentinel 1b in december 2021 one satellite is in orbit at 10 m ground resolution and a six day revisit time for the mid latitudes nevertheless sentinel 1 data offers good coverage of a potential flood event for a major flood event cems can be triggered to offer additional rapid flood mapping from 2022 the new global flood monitoring gfm product gfm 2021 hostache et al 2021 of the copernicus emergency management service cems copernicus programme 2021 produces sentinel 1 sar derived flood inundation maps using three flood detection algorithms providing uncertainty and population affected estimates within 8 hours of the image acquisition representation errors arise where observation spatial scales are different from the model spatial scale janjić et al 2018 the spatial resolution of sar imagery suitable for flood detection varies across satellite constellation both historically and presently and continues to improve very high resolution less than 3 m imaging capabilities are increasingly available including terrasar x alos 2 palsar 2 and the cosmo skymed radarsat 2 and iceye constellations mason et al 2021a it is common practice to re scale sar derived flood maps to match the model grid size for validation or assimilation with model data the objective of this paper is to present a scale selective approach to evaluate flood inundation forecast maps and to develop a physically meaningful measure of flood edge location accuracy that can be automated and easily applied in practice the method has been developed with operational forecast verification in mind but it is applicable to all flood inundation maps a new approach is described and applied here to evaluate the spatial scale at which the forecast becomes useful skilful at capturing the remotely observed flood extent and specifically the flood edge location the spatial skill of a forecast flood map varies with location we aim to improve the conventional contingency map by incorporating the skilful scale to create a new categorical scale map also we address how representation errors arising from observation spatial scale variations and interpolation have an impact on model evaluation in the rest of this paper we explore the features of a novel scale selective evaluation approach illustrated through application to a case study in section 2 we describe the case study a recent flooding event in the uk following storm dennis february 2020 along with catchment descriptions for three chosen domains the flood inundation forecasting system developed by jba consulting flood foresight revilla romero et al 2017 is used to produce forecast flood maps for the event and is detailed in section 3 1 section 3 2 explains two methods that are used to derive remotely observed flood maps from sar imagery our new approach to the spatial evaluation of flood maps is detailed in section 4 along with descriptions of other binary performance measures the novel categorical scale map is applied to the case studies in section 5 and the evaluation results are discussed we conclude in section 6 and discuss the wider applications of a spatial scale approach to flood map skill evaluation 2 flood event this extreme flooding event is chosen here as a case study to demonstrate the features of a spatial scale approach to forecast flood map evaluation during february 2020 three named storms ciara dennis and jorge arrived in quick succession delivered by a powerful and ideally positioned jet stream that enabled rapid cyclogenesis davies et al 2021 each storm rapidly intensified and deepened bringing damaging winds and exceptionally heavy rainfall across the uk met office 2020 this led to the river wye reaching its highest ever recorded water level at the old bridge in hereford riverlevels uk 2020 the annual exceedance probability aep for the recorded peak flow of the lugg and wye rivers was 0 2 0 8 return period 120 550 years and 0 6 2 0 160 550 years respectively sefton et al 2021 2 1 february 2020 february 2020 was the uk s wettest february on record and the fifth wettest month ever recorded the uk average rainfall total exceeded the 1981 2010 average by 237 kendon 2020 locally in northwest england and north wales the rainfall exceedance was three to four times the typical monthly average rainfall during this period around 4000 to 5000 properties were flooded in the uk with significant river water levels recorded in wales west and northwest england sefton et al 2021 with six days between ciara and dennis groundwater and river levels were high and soils saturated the environment agency issued a record number of over 600 flood alerts and warnings for england jba 2021 2 2 catchment location and description three domains each differing in hydrological characteristics have been selected for forecast flood map evaluation during the storm dennis flooding event two domains a and b have been chosen from the wye catchment fig 1 a 28 4 km length centred upon ross on wye a and the wye at hereford b a 5 8 km section a third domain c includes 4 km of the river lugg 2 2 1 the river wye domains a and b the river wye flows for approximately 215 km from plynlimon at 750 metres above ordnance datum maod in the cambrian mountains mid wales it initially travels southeastwards into england where it meanders southwards to ultimately join the severn estuary the upper catchment land cover is predominantly grassland with some forest cover with highly impermeable bedrock and superficial deposits of sand and gravel in the hereford area national river flow archive 2021 the upstream catchment area of hereford is 1896 km2 at hereford the only city situated on the wye the river is embanked on the north side by a deep flood wall with further embankments on the opposite side hereford is characterised by the old bridge a 15th century stone bridge that creates a damming effect during high river flows as the wye flows south of hereford the topography flattens and the floodplain widens with large river meanders and a distinctive u shaped valley 2 2 2 river lugg at lugwardine domain c the river lugg has an upstream catchment area of 886 km2 and a maximum altitude of 660 maod and flows across the grasslands and agricultural fields of the herefordshire plain it has similar bedrock to the wye catchment and a higher proportion of more permeable superficial fluvial deposits of sand and gravel this is particularly evident in the lugwardine region where the topography is relatively flat with little to impede the flow of floodwaters across the plain the lugg flows into the river wye 2 km south of domain c 2 2 3 event hydrology the observed catchment rainfall which also includes a downstream section of the river wye shows that 50 mm fell on the 15th 10 mm on the 16th and 1 mm on the 17th february 2020 uk water resources portal 2022 there were further heavy showers forecast for the 16 17th and whilst these have not been captured by the rain gauges on the 17th they cannot be ruled out as contributing to surface water flooding in hereford the nearest hourly rainfall rate observation is a citizen science observation from the met office wow database met office 2022 for a site at sutton st nicholas near the river lugg and this shows the highest rainfall rate of 5 8 mm hr at 0300 on the 16th and a total accumulation of 12 5 mm on the 16th and 0 3 mm on the 17th daily maximum river levels recorded at ross on wye the old bridge hereford and lugwardine for january to march 2020 are plotted in fig 2 riverlevels uk 2020 the impact of the three storms on the river wye is indicated by a very sharp rise in water levels from the 8th to the 10th february following storm ciara further heavy showers maintained high water levels before storm dennis brought an exceptional rise in water levels peaking on the morning of the 17th february with record levels recorded at hereford 6 11 m at 9 30 am uct and ross on wye 4 77 m at 5 45 am utc unfortunately there are two days of missing data at ross on wye following the flood event by analysing the trend between the hereford and ross on wye river levels the peak level at ross on wye was likely higher and later than recorded the response of the wye at hereford is faster than at ross on wye most likely due to the upstream location of hereford and a more constrained embankment with the city center located either side of the river in comparison to the fast rapid response of the wye the river lugg displays a distinctively dampened response whilst the lugg initially responded quickly to the heavy rainfall once bankfull was reached and overtopping occurred the water levels remained consistently high with floodwaters extending across the relatively flat flood plain 3 data in this section we describe the model and observation data that we will use to illustrate our novel scale selective verification approach 3 1 flood foresight flood foresight fig 3 developed and run routinely by jba consulting is a fluvial flood inundation mapping system that can be implemented in any catchment around the globe flood foresight utilises a simulation library approach to generate maps of real time and forecast flood inundation and water depth the simulation library approach saves valuable computing time and allows the application of flood foresight in near continuous real time at national and international scales a library of flood maps is pre computed using jflow a 2d hydrodynamic model bradbrook 2006 note that in this study the flood maps are undefended i e temporary flood defences are not included jflow uses a raster based approach with a detailed underlying dtm and a simplified form of the full 2d hydrodynamic equations that capture the main controls of the flood routing for shallow topographically driven flow five flood maps at 5 m resolution are created for 20 75 100 200 and 1000 year return period flood events corresponding to annual exceedance probabilities aeps of 5 1 3 1 0 5 and 0 1 respectively these are interpolated to derive five intermediate maps between each adjacent pair of the jflow maps equally spaced in return period creating a total library of thirty flood maps flood foresight takes inputs of rainfall from numerical weather prediction nwp models river gauge data both historical and real time and forecast streamflow and uses these to select the most appropriate flood map for the location and forecast time period the uk and ireland configurations of the flood forecasting module use deterministic streamflow forecast data from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi european hydrological predictions for the environment e hype the meteorological input data for the e hype model is the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf atmospheric model high resolution hres numerical weather prediction nwp model on a 0 1 0 1 grid with forecasts issued daily out to 10 days lead time forecast flood maps for the uk are produced on a 25 m grid length out to 10 days ahead see mason et al 2021b section 2 1 for additional details 3 2 sar derived flood maps two methods are applied to derive a flood map from sar backscatter values captured close to the flood peak the second method was included as it provides derivation of flood maps at different spatial resolutions a sentinel 1 s1b image was acquired in interferometric wide swath mode swath width 250 km just prior to the flood peak at 0622 on the 17th february a pre flood image september 2019 from the same satellite sensor and track was used to derive the flood map in both methods in the first method the esa grid processing on demand gpod hasard service http gpod eo esa int has been utilised the automated flood mapping algorithm chini et al 2017 uses a statistical hierarchical split based approach to distinguish the two classes flood and background using a pre flood and flood image level 1 grd product sar images vv are preproccesed which involves precise orbit correction radiometric calibration thermal noise removal speckle reduction terrain correction and reprojection to the wgs84 coordinate system the hasard mapping algorithm removes permanent water bodies including the river water flooded areas beneath vegetation bridges and near to buildings are not detected using this method the hasard flood map at 20 m spatial scale is used to evaluate the performance of flood foresight for each of the three domains out to 10 days lead time in the second method the same sentinel 1 sar image in this case using both vv and vh was processed using google earth engine gee to derive flood maps at a range of spatial resolutions 5 m to 25 m gee holds a catalogue of level 1 preprocessed sentinel 1 sar images google earth engine catalog 2021 a smoothing filter is applied to reduce speckle and a pre and post flood image are used to train a classification and regression tree cart classifier breiman et al 1984 google earth engine cart 2021 the classifier is applied to the whole image to produce a flood map at a specified scale gee uses an image pyramid approach to scale or pixel resolution analysis this means variations in the scale selected are determined from the scale of the input image google earth engine scale 2021 the variation of the flood extent detected at a range of spatial resolutions and the impact of re scaling and interpolation errors on performance measures are investigated flood foresight forecast flood maps include the river channel and exclude surface features such as vegetation and buildings to smooth the hasard and gee flood maps and allow a fairer comparison we apply a morphological closing operation without impacting the location of the flood extent to flood fill vegetation and buildings 4 flood map evaluation methods the following subsections detail a new spatial scale selective approach to forecast flood map evaluation the fraction skill score fss developed by roberts and lean 2008 for validation of convective precipitation forecasts in atmospheric science uses a neighbourhood approach to determine the scale at which the forecast becomes skilful dey et al 2016 developed this approach to determine an agreement scale between an ensemble forecast and observations at each grid cell to add location specific information here we extend the technique to apply it to the new application of flood inundation mapping and further develop a novel categorical scale map that combines an agreement scale map with a conventional contingency map 4 1 spatial scale selective approach initially the observed flood extent derived from sar data is re scaled to match the forecast flood map grid size using spline interpolation and both are converted into binary fields a threshold approach is determined for the situation for a flood map verification of spatial skill the simplest example applied here is to assign each grid cell as flooded 1 or unflooded 0 for the whole domain alternative future threshold approaches for flood inundation maps could include applying thresholds to water depth percentiles the location of the flood edge cells can be extracted from the observed and modelled binary flood maps given a domain of interest we number all of the grid cells according to their spatial coordinates i j i 1 n x and j 1 n y where n x is the number of columns in the domain and n y is the number of rows for each grid cell a square of length n forms an n n neighbourhood surrounding the grid cell the fraction of 1 s in the square neighbourhood is calculated for each grid cell this creates two fields of fractions over the domain for both the forecast m n i j and observed o n i j data the fraction fields are compared against one another to calculate the mean squared error mse for the neighbourhood 1 m s e n 1 n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y o n i j m n i j 2 based on the fractions calculated for the model and observed fields a worst possible mse is calculated 2 m s e n r e f 1 n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y o n i j 2 m n i j 2 the fss is given by 3 f s s n 1 m s e n m s e n r e f fig 4 illustrates an example of the fss application at grid level n 1 and at the next neighbourhood size n 3 in this simple example there is no agreement between the model and observation at grid level but at n 3 the skill score improves to 0 92 in general the fss is calculated for each length of neighbourhood n for a given neighbourhood size an fss of 1 is said to have perfect skill and 0 means no skill the fss will increase as n increases up to an asymptote see fig 3 from roberts and lean 2008 if there is no model bias across the whole domain of interest observed and forecast flooded areas are the same then the asymptotic fraction skill score afss at n 2 n 1 where n is the number of grid cells along the longest side of the domain will equal 1 plotting fss against spatial scale can indicate a range of scales where the model is deemed to be the most useful this usefulness is a trade off between being too smooth larger n or too fine where the forecast skill is lost and the computation time lengthy the gradient of the fss curve versus neighbourhood size is another indicator of forecast skill with respect to spatial scale a steeper gradient indicates more rapidly improving skill over smaller grid sizes compared with a flatter curve indicating a much wider neighbourhood is required to reach the same skill score a target fss score f s s t is defined as 4 f s s t 0 5 f o 2 where f 0 is the fraction of flood observed across the whole domain of interest and can be thought of as being equidistant between the skill of a random forecast and perfect skill f s s t will vary depending on the magnitude of the observed flood relative to the domain area this allows the comparison of the f s s t scale across different domain sizes and floods of different magnitudes when the fss is plotted against spatial scale neighbourhood size we can identify a spatial scale when the fss first equals or exceeds f s s t fig 6 shows an example of this plot the spatial scale neighbourhood size reached at f s s t can tell us the displacement distance d t between the observed and forecast flood or more meaningfully the flood edge locations as the flood edge represents a very small fraction of the domain the scale at f s s t will tend to 2 d t meaning the displacement distance is half of this scale see figure 4 in roberts and lean 2008 it has been shown by skok and roberts 2016 that care must be taken when calculating the fss near to the domain boundary since increasingly larger neighbourhood sizes would extend further beyond the boundary edge skok and roberts 2016 concluded that as long as the domain was sufficiently large relative to the spatial errors then the boundary effect could be considered to be insignificant for flood mapping verification purposes the domain area should be selected to include the area of interest e g the floodplain with the neighbourhoods considered extending beyond the domain at the boundary this assumes that the observations available allow this if this is not that case then another boundary method could be applied such as cropping at the domain edge 4 2 location dependent agreement scales the fss gives an overall domain averaged measure of forecast performance and an average minimum scale at which the forecast is deemed skilful dey et al 2016 describe a method for calculating an agreement scale at each grid cell located at coordinate position i j a brief summary of the method is presented here two fields are considered f 1 i j and f 2 i j in this application these are the forecast and observed fields in alternative applications the method could be applied to measure similarity between members of an ensemble the fields in this instance are not required to be thresholded and can be applied to flood depths the aim is to find a minimum neighbourhood size or scale for every grid point such that there is an agreement between f 1 i j and f 2 i j this is known as the agreement scale s i j the relationship between the agreement scale and the neighbourhood size described in section 4 1 is given by s i j n 1 2 firstly all grid points are compared by calculating the relative mse d i j s at the grid scale s 0 n 1 5 d i j s f 1 i j s f 2 i j s 2 f 1 i j s 2 f 2 i j s 2 if f 1 i j 0 and f 2 i j 0 both dry then d i j s 0 correct at grid level note that d i j s varies from zero to 1 the fields are considered to be in agreement at the scale being tested if 6 d i j s d c r i t i j s i j where d c r i t i j s α 1 α s s l i m and s l i m is a predetermined fixed maximum scale the parameter value α is chosen to indicate the acceptable bias at grid level such that 0 α 1 here we set α 0 no background bias if d i j s d c r i t i j s then the next neighbourhood size up is considered s 1 a 3 by 3 square the process continues with increasingly larger neighbourhoods until the agreement scale or s l i m is reached for every cell in the domain of interest the agreement scale at each grid cell is then mapped onto the domain of interest 4 3 categorical scale map currently the agreement scale map proposed by dey et al 2016 provides a location specific scale of agreement between the forecast and observed flood map however it does not show whether the model is over or under predicting the flood extent in our work we develop the agreement scale map further by combining with a contingency map for the forecast to create a new categorical scale map this highlights the agreement scale for areas of over or under prediction in a contingency map each cell in the forecast and observed flood map are compared and classified using a contingency table table 1 the categories are re classified numerically in the array for automated updating of the agreement scale map over predicted cells b are set to 1 under predicted cells c are set to 1 correctly predicted flooded cells a are assigned nan and correctly predicted unflooded cells are set to 0 the array element wise product of the agreement scale map and the numerical contingency map produces the new categorical scale map 4 4 binary performance measures it has been suggested by cloke and pappenberger 2008 that a range of performance measures should be applied so that a forecast can be assessed as rigorously as possible a selection of commonly applied binary performance measures each focusing on a different aspect of performance have been included here for comparison with the fraction skill score results following the application of a contingency table table 1 to the forecast flood map a number of binary performance measures can be calculated table 2 table 2 describes the range of performance value the ideal score and a description of which aspects of the forecast flood map performance each binary measure assesses 5 results we illustrate and discuss our new method applied to the flood event in sections 5 1 and 5 2 the scale selective approach is applied to an extreme flooding event in the uk to determine a useful skilful spatial scale for both the entire flood extent and the flood edge location for three domains out to 10 days lead time an example forecast flood map for 0 day lead time compared with the sar derived flood map is presented as a contingency map in fig 5 the zoomed in perspective shows the double penalty impact described in section 1 the discrepancy at the flood edge depends on the spatial scale of the forecast flood maps along with the model performance next in section 5 3 location specific agreement scales are presented on categorical scale maps the final section 5 4 addresses the question of the impact of representation error caused by variations in sar derived flood map spatial resolution on the evaluation results 5 1 spatial scale variability of forecast flood extent and flood edge location an evaluation of the spatial skill of the flood foresight forecast flood maps against the sar derived flood map for the flood peak on the 17th february 2020 has been calculated for each domain fig 1 for both the entire flood extent and the flood edge location the fraction skill score fss is applied to increasing neighbourhood sizes n to determine the spatial scale at which the forecast becomes skilful at capturing the observed flood fig 6 shows fss against n for one example the river lugg domain c for the entire flood a and the flood edge b each line represents a different model run date from the 10 02 2020 7 day lead time to the 17 02 2020 0 day lead time with the exception of the 7 day lead time all forecasts for the whole flood fig 6a exceed the f s s t at grid level n 1 with gradually improving skill as n increases in contrast to this the fss applied to the flood edge fig 6b shows all forecasts below f s s t at grid level and n 3 with the skill increasing more rapidly compared with the whole flood to reach f s s t at n 5 for all run dates within a 5 day lead time except for 16 02 2020 which is just below f s s t this indicates that the flood edge is forecast to be around 62 5 m from the observed flood edge on average for a 5 day lead time the difference between the gradients of the plots indicate the flood edge is more sensitive to changes in spatial scale compared with evaluation of the whole flooded area the whole flood verification here indicates a strong model performance however verifying the whole flood alone could mask the flood edge location performance which in this case has a coarser scale at f s s t similar trends in fss with neighbourhood size and comparisons between the entire flood and the flood edge verification scales are found for all domains the rate of fss increase or fss gradient with n tells us how quickly the forecast skill improves with increasing scale a more spatially accurate forecast of the flood edge will demonstrate a steeper gradient reaching f s s t at a smaller neighbourhood size 5 2 comparison of spatial scales at differing lead times and domain location the performance measures for each domain for daily lead times out to 10 days are presented in fig 7 the fss at n 1 3 and 5 are shown along with critical success index csi hit rate hr pierce skill score pss and the bias see table 2 for definitions the bias score is an indicator of over or under prediction of the flood extent and is plotted on a separate axis to account for the larger range for lead times within 5 days of the flood peak f s s 0 8 for the entire flooded area at grid level for the river wye domain a indicates a strong model performance fig 7a there is a dip in the fss on the 16 02 2020 where the forecast over predicts the flood extent this is also reflected in the csi score in contrast to this the hr and pss increase despite the over prediction as more observed flood cells are correctly predicted wet we note that the pss hr far does account for over prediction however the far is the fraction of the dry area incorrectly predicted wet which is very small relative to the hr 0 03 versus 0 90 validation of the river wye flood edge fig 7b is more sensitive to changes in neighbourhood size compared with the whole flood validation here the flood edge is very well forecast in terms of spatial location and exceeds f s s t at n 3 on average 37 5 m displacement for a 5 day lead time except for 1 day lead time where f s s t is exceeded at n 5 as shown previously in section 5 1 the forecast of the river lugg flood edge is skilful at n 5 fig 7f on average 62 5 m displacement for a 5 day lead time differences in the hydrological characteristics might explain differences in model performance the wye valley flood plain is well defined with distinctive valley sides and this event proved to be valley filling in contrast to the lugg flood plain which is relatively flat and extensive this could explain the increased skill shown for the prediction of the wye flood edge the average observed flood top width for the lugg domain c is 740 m and for the wye domain a 430 m this gives a flood edge displacement as a fraction of the flood top width of 7 4 for the lugg and 7 8 for the wye the results for all three domains show that for this case study the forecasting system has limited skill beyond a five day lead time the forecast accuracy of the meteorological driving data diminishes with increasing lead time ecmwf 2022 extratropical cyclones etcs are the dominant meteorological driver of major winter flooding in the uk this is particularly true when an atmospheric river is associated with an etc and when etcs arrive in clusters as was the case here bringing multiple spells of heavy precipitation lavers et al 2011 griffith et al 2020 the typical formation time of etcs is 3 5 days occasionally up to 10 days ulbrich et al 2009 which limits the predictability of the meteorological system particularly when the jet stream is very strong as was the case here the atmospheric and precipitation predictability will vary depending on the situation for example a slow moving etc close to the uk would potentially have a longer lead time of useful prediction conversely flooding in the summer associated with convection would likely have a shorter skilful lead time the scale selective approach presented here can be used to determine a meaningful scale to present flood inundation maps this scale will vary with forecast lead time and will depend on the predictability of the meteorological situation there is more variation in skilful scale with lead time evident for the wye at hereford domain b in fig 7c and d compared with domain a and c to achieve the same fss for the whole flood as domain a and c up to a 5 day lead time the neighbourhood size would need to exceed n 5 the model is over predicting the flood extent in particular on the 16 02 2020 1 day lead time this overprediction at 1 day lead time is evident for all domains as can be seen in the bias scores but the impact of this is most noticeable at hereford hereford has more complex topography compared to the other domains particularly along the river bank with bridges buildings permanent and temporary flood defences deployed during the event affecting the flow of the flood wave through the city the maps used in the simulation library of flood foresight are produced using a bare earth dtm despite this the model performs well exceeding f s s t at n 5 at the 5 day and 2 day lead times for the flood edge forecast overall the fss indicates a similar trend in performance across all results as the commonly applied csi the value of f s s t is determined by the magnitude of the observed flood which means the skilful scale determined at f s s t can be meaningfully compared across the domains the skilful scale of the forecast flood edge location gives an average discrepancy distance a physically meaningful evaluation measure provides additional information compared to a conventional verification score 5 3 categorical scale maps location dependent categorical scale maps section 4 3 have been calculated for all run dates for both the entire flooded area and the flood edge fig 8 shows categorical scale maps for the whole flood for three different lead times for each domain longer lead times are on the left the run dates vary with domain to present the most informative maps such that variation in forecast skill can be seen across the different lead times the colours on the map indicate grid cell specific agreement scales section 4 2 between the forecast flood map and the sar derived flood map grey white regions indicate correctly predicted flooded unflooded cells red shows the forecast flood extent is under predicted miss and blue indicates over prediction false alarm increasingly darker shades of red blue show that larger scales were needed for the agreement criteria to be met the darkest blue at s 10 indicates a total mismatch between forecast and observed flooding the addition of the agreement scale information in comparison to a conventional contingency map for an example see fig 5 quickly highlights regions of total mismatch through the darkest shading with areas that are slightly misaligned in lighter shades the agreement scale indicated gives a physical measure of distance at specific locations between the forecast and the observed flood map where s s l i m the location specific skilful scale varies with location and lead time as indicated on the categorical scale maps for a 7 day lead time forecast for the river wye fig 8a the model is indicating some flooding could occur although under estimating the total extent as shown by the darkest red areas which show the limits of the agreement scale have been reached by 5 days lead time the forecast is in very close agreement with the observed flood at grid level in grey with larger agreement scales indicated by red blue shading along some of the flood edge locations fig 8b and a balance between under and over prediction over prediction is more evident by 1 day lead time for the river wye fig 8c and flooding is also over predicted along smaller tributaries there are several detached areas of flooding observed remotely that are most likely due to ponding of surface water flooding which were not predicted by the fluvial flood forecasting system the hereford forecast is most skilful on the 12th february fig 8d with over prediction particularly towards the southwest at 3 day and 1 day lead times fig 8e and f a small stream running southwards to the wye the eign brook could be contributing to the over prediction seen here it is also worth mentioning that sar will struggle to detect flood waters where buildings are closer together when the distance between them is less than the ground resolution of the sar shadow and layover effects due to the side looking nature of the sar also mean flood detection is more difficult in urban areas mason et al 2021a this will likely only impact a small area of the hereford domain but this observation uncertainty should be considered when interpreting these results there is an area of under prediction of the flood extent in the centre of the hereford domain visible at all lead times this could be due to surface water flooding which most likely occurred due to the very high intensity rainfall observed this combined with the urban area and steeply sloping gradient to the north of this area most likely contributed to rapid surface water runoff towards the river since flood foresight is a fluvial flood forecast system we would not expect surface water flooding such as this to be predicted flood foresight selects multiple flood maps and stitches them together when the return period threshold is exceeded for a given area the hereford section of the wye does not trigger a flood map selection until a 5 day lead time this area also influences part of the river lugg flood map and can be seen as a mismatch on the lower left hand side of fig 8g and h once this is included the forecast flood map is in very good agreement from a 5 day lead time there are areas that could be further improved indicated by the lighter shading fig 8i an acceptable level of agreement scale could be determined for a given situation for example n 5 and efforts made to understand improve larger agreement scales at specific locations these improvements might include changes to infrastructure included in the dtm used in the hydraulic modelling for example 5 4 sar derived flood map scale variation in practice particularly where a flood event is prolonged or the flooding extent covers a wide area there may be multiple sources of sar data available for model evaluation usually at higher spatial resolutions compared to the model grid size e g iceye in spot mode at 1 m and strip mode at 3 m ground resolution it is important to consider the impact of using observations at different spatial scales on the scale selective approach results by conducting a simulation experiment we address the question of how re scaling and interpolating three higher spatial resolution sar derived flood maps relative to the forecast flood maps affects the scale selective skill scores and location specific forecast skill in order to simulate a range of observation spatial scales sar derived flood maps are produced using method two described in section 3 2 at spatial resolutions from 5 m to 25 m these are re scaled by 0 order spline interpolation ndimage zoom 2021 briand and monasse 2018 to match the model resolution 25 m and compared to the forecast flood map for the river lugg 5 day lead time a comparison of the gee flood map against the hasard flood map both at 20 m spatial scale produce almost identical verification scores for all performance measures for the river lugg δ f s s 0 01 the categorical scale maps for the comparison between the forecast flood map and the re scaled simulated sar derived flood maps are shown in fig 9 the resulting domain averaged skill scores for the same forecast flood map against the four sar derived flood maps are displayed in fig 10 the scores are calculated for the whole flood and the flood edge alone in general the categorical scale maps show similar regions of over and under prediction but there are small location specific variations in skilful scale the sar derived flood map at 25 m the same spatial scale as the forecast flood maps shows the best agreement away from the flood edge this is also evident in the overall fss score for the 25 m comparison which marginally outperforms the evaluation after re scaling finer observation flood maps fig 10 the skilful scale determined for each observation comparison of the whole flooding extent is n 1 or at grid level and for the flood edge is at n 5 overall based on the results from this simulation experiment the scale selective approach is not overly sensitive to the observation spatial scale and the skilful scale determined remains the same for each of the observed sar derived flood maps for both the entire flood extent and the flood edge small errors are introduced by re scaling and interpolating finer resolution observations to the model spatial scale which slightly reduce the skill score and change location specific details on the categorical scale maps observation scale selection and re scaling along with interpolation errors must be considered when evaluating model performance particularly where model or observation scales vary in space and time or where comparisons are made across different models 6 discussion and conclusions overall the aim of this paper was to introduce and apply a new scale selective approach to forecast flood map evaluation with an emphasis on providing a physically meaningful verification of the flood edge location the skilful spatial scale for comparison of forecast flood inundation maps against sar derived observed flood extent has been evaluated by the application of the fraction skill score this provides a domain averaged skilful scale the verification measure has been applied to a forecast of an extreme flood event in the uk on the river wye and the river lugg following storm dennis in february 2020 flood foresight inundation predictions with lead times out to 10 days are evaluated against a sentinel 1 sar derived flood map captured close to the flood peak for three domains each differing in hydrological characteristics conventional binary performance measures were calculated alongside the fss for comparison flood edge verification shows greater sensitivity to changes in forecast skill and spatial scale relative to verification of the entire flood extent the skilful scale determined is physically meaningful and can be used to estimate the average flood edge discrepancy from the observed flood edge the observed flood map spatial resolution relative to the model scale is important and re scaling and interpolation errors will impact the model verification scores ideally the observed flood map should be derived at the same spatial scale as the forecast model to minimise these errors in operational practice the scale at which the forecast flood maps are presented to forecasters and decision makers should reflect the uncertainty within the forecast very high resolution flood maps can be presented where a detailed dtm is available if this is presented as a deterministic forecast to flood risk management teams it could lead to an over confidence in the forecast or where the actual observed flood magnitude is different the forecast may be devalued in the future savage et al 2016 speight et al 2021 application of a spatial scale approach to forecast evaluation can determine the scale at which it is best to present the forecast flood map conversely if the model is found to be skilful at grid level there is scope to increase the flood map resolution adding more detail to the flood edge location improvements made to hydrodynamic models such as through data assimilation to improve inputs initial conditions or model parameters may not improve the forecast flood edge location at grid level however improvements may be evident through evaluation using fss across a range of scales categorical scale maps are a useful evaluation and forecasting tool adding location specific detail model improvements can be spatially targeted and as improvements are made the categorical scale map will highlight location specific changes for example the categorical scale maps for hereford indicate the local infrastructure in particular bridges impact the movement of the flood wave which suggests a digital surface model dsm would be beneficial in urban areas the verification approach is presented here in the context of an operational flood forecasting system the skilful scale determined for each flooding scenario lead time and at specific locations within a domain depends on the skill of the entire hydrometeorological chain of forecasting models from the meteorological inputs to the hydrodynamic model run offline in the case study presented here used to determine the inundation extent for a given river discharge the scale selective approach is equally applicable for the validation of flood maps from hydrodynamic models that are not part of an operational system here we focus on the use of sar derived flood maps for validation however the approach would apply to any remotely observed flooding such as from optical satellite data or uav aerial imagery that can be converted into a gridded dataset the fss must be applied to binary data and for this reason it is very easily applicable to flooding extent with grid cells categorised as flooded unflooded in operational forecasting flood depth is also an important metric to verify and by applying a threshold depths below above a certain level or percentile the depth data can be converted for application of fss the method for calculating categorical scale maps does not require binary data and so the depth values can be used directly in the calculations ideally in operational forecast systems quantitative validation should run in tandem with the forecast system where observations are available over time a catalogue of skilful scales flood edge discrepancy distances and categorical scale maps could be built up this catalogue would enable analysis of scale across different flood event type season meteorological scenario forecast lead time and at specific locations within a catchment or sub catchment such a verification library would enable forecasters to increase intuition and expert judgement on the relevant scales for a given forecast based on this analysis and an increased understanding of the predictability of flood inundation forecast flood maps could be presented at a variable scale for example a coarser scale at longer lead times becoming more detailed closer to the flooding event coarse scales can appear jagged or with large steps along the edge and so ideally these would be converted to smooth contours but with some indication for example lighter shading that the flood edge lies somewhere within the width of the grid cell rather than exactly at the contour edge at shorter lead times as forecast confidence is assumed to increase the flood edge location would show more detail and a narrower band of uncertainty grid cell width this flood edge uncertainty information will prove invaluable for impact based forecasting practice the spatial scale approach will also prove a useful tool in multi model performance comparisons where forecast flood maps are presented at different spatial resolutions or to evaluate the performance of an increase in model resolution evaluating a skilful scale for each model can be compared directly whereas the skill score values should not be compared across models with different spatial scales emerton et al 2016 these methods will also benefit surface water flooding verification where the flood map is likely to be localised and discrete and accounting for variations in spatial skill more critical an improved approach to evaluating forecast flood maps will result in improved accuracy in the predictions of flooding ultimately this will benefit disaster management teams and those living in flood prone areas to enable future mitigation of flooding impacts credit authorship contribution statement helen hooker conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis

3104,this study showed that the complex rainfall characteristics of south korea where rainfall is concentrated during a specific period are poorly represented with a simple single parameter distribution thus a two parameter lognormal distribution that best represents the rainfall characteristics of south korea was proposed by comparing four different distributions using this distribution this study developed a suitable analytical probabilistic model apm to simulate runoff event volumes in south korea and suggested an apm parameter adjustment method based on rainfall characteristics thirty year rainfall data recorded at ten stations were grouped based on the interevent time definition ietd of each station with the grouped rainfall events the probability density function pdf of the lognormal distribution was confirmed to best fit the rainfall event characteristic histograms in south korea including those of the rainfall event volume duration and interevent time the apm was developed by deriving the pdf of the runoff event volume with a lognormal distribution and a frequency analysis was performed based on the runoff event volume obtained by the apm and the storm water management model swmm to verify the suitability of the derived model the runoff event volumes output by the apm were compared with the runoff event volumes simulated by the swmm the exceedance probabilities and return periods output by the developed apm with a lognormal distribution were very close to the swmm results however the return periods output by the apm were overestimated and adjustment parameters were needed to match the outputs to the swmm results this study found a strong correlation between the adjustment parameters and the coefficients of variation in the average monthly rainfall this result suggested that model parameter adjustments are necessary before applying an apm to rainfall datasets with large coefficients of variation in average monthly rainfall data keywords analytical probabilistic model adjustment parameter average monthly rainfall coefficient of variation lognormal distribution storm water management model 1 introduction as urbanization progresses runoff volumes have increased and stormwater management facilities have been installed to control urban stormwater these facilities are typically designed using three approaches the design storm event approach the continuous simulation approach and the analytical probabilistic approach the design storm event approach simulates runoff hydrographs based on the hyetographs of design storms this method is widely used to design stormwater management facilities however this approach has been criticized due to its basic assumption that the return period of the resulting runoff hydrograph is equal to the return period of the design storm hyetograph wenzel 1982 adams and howard 1986 the continuous simulation approach uses long term continuous rainfall data as input without pretreatment this approach is the most reliable but it is difficult and time consuming to organize the simulations the analytical probabilistic approach has been proposed as a substitution for the continuous simulation approach the probability density function pdf of the runoff volume has been derived and used in the hydrological design of urban stormwater management facilities for statistical analyses of rainfall event characteristics namely the rainfall event volume duration and interevent time continuous rainfall data are grouped into rainfall events by an appropriate interevent time definition ietd an analytical probabilistic model apm is derived based on rainfall runoff transformations and the pdfs of rainfall event characteristics guo and adams 1999 calculated the peak outflow rates of stormwater management facilities with an analytical probabilistic approach and confirmed that the results obtained with this approach agreed well with the results of the storm water management model swmm guo 2001 compared all three design approaches by calculating the peak flood discharge rates although the three approaches produced similar results the analytical probabilistic approach was recommended due to the variability that arose in the design storm approach depending on the selected model and designed storm as was also mentioned by guo and zhuge 2008 and hassini and guo 2017 and the computational simplicity of the analytical probabilistic approach analytical probabilistic approaches have been continuously studied and applied in water resource research eagleson 1972 guo and adams 1998a 1998b guo 2001 guo et al 2012 hassini and guo 2020 and are still being developed today guo and zhuge 2008 guo and dai 2009 guo et al 2009 guo et al 2012 in particular studies on the application of apms to low impact development lid have been conducted recently guo and baetz 2007 wang et al 2019 zhang and guo 2013a 2013b 2014 when determining the design criteria of stormwater management facilities through an analytical probabilistic approach it is important to fit probability distributions that are suitable for rainfall event characteristics hassini and guo 2016 most studies have fit one parameter exponential distributions to rainfall event characteristics and provided exponential distribution parameter values for the united states driscoll et al 1989 wanielista and yousef 1993 and canada adams and papa 2000 however studies conducted in other countries with rainfall characteristics that differ from those of north america andrés doménech et al 2010 bacchi et al 2008 balistrocchi et al 2009 hassan et al 2015 zegpi and fernández 2010 have shown that distributions other than one parameter exponential distributions such as the generalized pareto weibull wakeby and two parameter gamma distributions better represent their rainfall event characteristics attempts have been made in south korea to determine the optimal distribution of rainfall event characteristics to develop an apm choi et al 2008 developed an apm using a three parameter exponential distribution and applied it to a watershed in south korea to evaluate its feasibility by comparing the results with a one parameter exponential distribution kim and han 2010 also applied a three parameter exponential distribution to an apm to develop a stormwater capture curve park et al 2013 applied a two parameter exponential distribution and a one parameter exponential distribution to an apm to estimate the water quality capture volume wqcv a design parameter of urban stormwater treatment facilities these studies suggested new distribution types or compared two distribution types to represent the characteristics of rainfall events in south korea it is necessary to investigate the applicability of various distributions to obtain the optimal probability distribution type in south korea but few studies have compared different distributions this study compares a total of four probability distributions including three two parameter distributions and the conventional one parameter exponential distribution the three parameter distribution is not included in the distribution comparison because the parameter estimation process is difficult determining rainfall runoff transformations is also important in the development of apms in several studies adams and bontje 1984 adams and papa 2000 park and um 2018 rainfall runoff transformations have been simply represented by applying only one lumped runoff coefficient regardless of the perviousness or imperviousness of the study areas guo and adams 1998a pointed out that this expression is too simplistic to describe physically complex hydrological conditions to improve the oversimplification of rainfall runoff transformations due to the application of a lumped runoff coefficient many studies guo and adams 1998a 1999 chen and adams 2005a 2005b have considered the spatial characteristics of the analyzed catchment and developed rainfall runoff processes by dividing the catchment into pervious and impervious areas chen and adams 2007 compared the runoff volume of the swmm with the runoff volumes of apms based on three types of rainfall runoff transformations one transformation type ignored the distinction between pervious and impervious areas while the other two types made spatial divisions one of the two transformation types in which spatial division was considered also included the infiltration process the average annual runoff volume results of the apm obtained based on the two transformation types in which spatial characteristics were considered were comparable to the swmm results regardless of whether or not the infiltration process was included based on these results the authors suggested that the relatively simple rainfall runoff transformation considering only the spatial division of the study area is effective in estimating runoff volumes therefore this study employs this rainfall runoff transformation type for deriving runoff pdfs south korea has distinct wet and dry seasons based on the monsoon climate with concentrated rainfall in july and august the objective of this study is to determine the most appropriate probability distributions for rainfall event characteristics in south korea and to develop and verify an apm using the determined probability distributions the pdfs of the runoff volume are derived by applying one and two parameter distributions to two types of rainfall runoff transformations with and without the separation of pervious and impervious areas for runoff coefficient the performance of the apm is compared with the results from a calibrated swmm and based on this comparison the adjustment of the apm according to swmm results is proposed this study contains three major parts the development of the apm a frequency analysis and comparison with the swmm and the adjustment of the model according to the swmm results the overall flowchart of the study is illustrated in fig 1 2 methods 2 1 study stations in this study a statistical analysis of the 30 year hourly rainfall data recorded from 1991 to 2020 at ten stations in south korea is conducted the locations of the stations in busan chuncheon daegu daejeon jeonju jinju seoul sokcho taebaek and wonju are shown in fig 2 2 2 interevent time definition the continuous historical rainfall series are separated into rainfall events based on the ietd for the statistical analysis the ietd provides a minimum spacing between independent rainfall events as a criterion for grouping rainfall events this study applies a common method the autocorrelation analysis method to estimate the ietd the autocorrelation analysis method is based on the statistical independence of rainfall events separated by the ietd the ietd is determined as the lag time at which the correlation between rainfall events is close to zero and the lag time is the time interval between each observation the results of the autocorrelation analysis and the ietds determined for each study station are shown in fig 3 and table 1 2 3 rainfall runoff transformation in deriving the pdf of the runoff volume the rainfall runoff transformation is preceded by converting the rainfall volume v mm to the runoff volume v r mm the simplest original rainfall runoff transformation is expressed with only a lumped runoff coefficient and does not consider spatial characteristics the transformation used in the storage treatment overflow and runoff model storm u s army corps of engineers 1977 is as follows 1 v r 0 v s d v s d v s d where is a dimensionless runoff coefficient and s d is the depression storage mm the original rainfall runoff transformation equation 1 is developed by dividing the lumped areas into pervious and impervious areas for both runoff coefficients and depression storage for the fraction of impervious area in the urban catchment h s d is divided into the pervious area depression storage as s dp and the impervious area depression storage as s di and it is generally assumed that s di s dp the runoff coefficient is only considered in the pervious area and is denoted by dp assuming that the impervious area runoff coefficient is unity after the initial depression losses are satisfied 2 v ri 0 v s di v s di v s di 3 v rp 0 v s dp dp v s dp v s dp 4 v r h v ri 1 h v rp the runoff volume from impervious and pervious areas is expressed by equations 2 and 3 respectively which are combined according to the area weighted runoff of equation 4 this transformation which considers spatial characteristics is referred to herein as the developed rainfall runoff transformation and is expressed as follows 5 v r 0 v s di h v s di s di v s dp h dp 1 h v h s di dp s dp 1 h v s dp continuous swmm simulation takes nonlinear infiltration models such as horton green ampt and curve number into account nevertheless this study uses equation 5 assuming a linear relationship between rainfall and runoff based on the results of predicting similar runoff or spill responses regardless of whether explicit infiltration process is included chen and adams 2005a chen and adams 2007 2 4 derivation of the probability distribution for the runoff event volume to derive the runoff event probability distribution the rainfall runoff transformation and the pdfs of the rainfall event characteristics are considered the rainfall event volume pdfs used to develop the apm include the commonly used one parameter exponential distribution and the lognormal distribution that best fits the rainfall event characteristics of south korea the pdfs are represented with their parameters in table 2 the process and results of determining the pdf that best represents the rainfall event characteristics of south korea are presented in section 3 1 the pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf of the runoff event volume are derived by combining the original and developed rainfall runoff transformation and the two rainfall event volume pdfs 2 4 1 one parameter exponential distribution adams and papa 2000 derived the pdf and cdf of the runoff event volume by applying a one parameter exponential distribution and the original rainfall runoff transformation which are expressed as follows 6 f v r v r p r o b v r v r 1 e ζ v r ϕ s d 7 f v r v r d d v r f v r v r ζ ϕ e ζ v r ϕ s d where the pdf and cdf of the runoff event volume are denoted as f v r v r and f v r v r respectively and ζ is the parameter of the one parameter exponential pdf the pdf and cdf of the runoff event volume in which the developed rainfall runoff transformation is applied are expressed as follows chen and adams 2007 8 f v r v r 1 e ζ s di v r 0 1 e ζ v r h s di 0 v r h s dp s di 1 e ζ v r ϕ h s dh v r h s dp s di

calibration of input parameters for swmm to verify the apm derived in this study a frequency analysis of the apm and a continuous simulation model is conducted and the results are compared the us epa swmm rossman 2015 is a stormwater runoff quantity and quality simulation model primarily for urban areas this study calculated the runoff volume for continuous simulation in the swmm the experimental catchment selected for swmm calibration is gunja drainage basin this catchment which is located in seoul south korea has an area of 96 5 ha and an impervious area ratio h of 0 5 the observed rainfall and runoff volume data for calibration are constructed from nine specific rainfall events between 2005 and 2010 kim 2006 the slope manning s n catchment width depression storage infiltration capacity and infiltration decay coefficient are parameters that require calibration they are manually calibrated until the difference between the observed and simulated runoff volumes is minimized the roughness coefficient and depression storage are set to different values for the pervious and impervious areas and because the swmm infiltration process is simulated by the horton infiltration equation the relevant parameters are also set the physical characteristics and calibrated swmm input parameters are listed in table 4 the calibrated input parameters are equally applied to all stations to identify trends in the runoff event volume distribution by rainfall characteristics under constant spatial characteristics rather than accurately estimating the runoff event volumes the runoff volumes are estimated every ten minutes by applying the calibrated parameters to the swmm for comparison with the observed values the r 2 values between the simulated and observed runoff volumes in table 5 range from 0 78 to 0 93 for all events the swmm runoff event volumes for nine specific events are plotted against the corresponding observed values in fig 4 a linear regression line between the simulated and observed runoff event volumes shows an r 2 of 0 87 the swmm runoff event volumes closely match the observed runoff event volumes 2 5 2 apm parameters the calibrated swmm parameters pervious and impervious area depression storage s dp and s di are applied equally to the apm in the developed rainfall runoff transformation s dp and s di are set to 1 08 and 4 5 mm respectively for the original rainfall runoff transformation the depression storage s d is used by substituting the area weighted depression storage s dh value chen and adams 2005b the lumped runoff coefficient for the original rainfall runoff transformation is estimated using the impervious area ratio h of the test catchment as suggested by wef and asce 1998 21 0 85 h 3 0 75 h 2 0 774 h 0 04 the value obtained by substituting h of the test catchment into equation 21 is 0 34 the pervious area runoff coefficient dp for the developed rainfall runoff transformation is less than and typically determined empirically rather than calculated from the observed runoff data chen and adams 2005a chen and adams 2007 this study set dp to 0 25 as in chen and adams 2005a 2 6 exceedance probability and return period of the runoff event volume both apms and the swmm use the same rainfall data from the ten stations for the frequency analysis the continuous runoff results obtained from the swmm are grouped into runoff events for the frequency analysis the ietd obtained for these runoff events is not the same as the ietd obtained for the rainfall events the runoff event derived ietd is smaller than the rainfall event derived ietd and can be considered as small as approximately the time of concentration guo and adams 1998a based on an estimated 2 hour time of concentration the runoff event derived ietd which is 2 h shorter than the rainfall event derived ietd is applied to separate the continuous runoff data into runoff events the frequency analysis is conducted by determining the exceedance probability and return period of the runoff event volumes simulated by the two apms and the swmm the exceedance probabilities of the runoff event volume derived for the apms are calculated using the cdfs f v r v r listed in table 3 and expressed as follows 22 g v r v r 1 f v r v r where g v r v r is the exceedance probability of the runoff event volume v r per rainfall event and f v r v r is the cdf of v r for the runoff event volume derived from the swmm the exceedance probability is calculated with the weibull plotting position formula which is expressed as follows 23 p m n 1 where p is the exceedance probability of a given runoff volume per rainfall event and n is the total number of runoff events corresponding to the total number of rainfall events in the continuous rainfall data input into the swmm m indicates that the event is the mth largest of n events the return period of a given runoff event volume is calculated as follows 24 t r 1 θ g v r v r where t r in years is the return period of the runoff event volume v r θ is the average annual number of rainfall events and g v r v r is the exceedance probability of v r per rainfall event which is substituted with the value obtained from equation 23 for the swmm and the value obtained from equation 22 for the apms 3 results 3 1 probability distribution of rainfall event characteristics to develop an apm for south korea the pdfs that are most suitable for the local rainfall event characteristics including the rainfall volume duration and interevent time are determined these three characteristics are plotted as relative frequency histograms one parameter exponential two parameter exponential lognormal and gamma pdfs are then fitted to each histogram in this process rainfall events less than 1 mm are removed from the statistical analysis to better fit the distribution of large rainfall events because small rainfall events are so dominant that they cause the histograms to skew excessively to the left this process is acceptable as the eliminated rainfall events have little effect on the overall runoff volumes guo and adams 1998a figs 5 7 show the relative frequency histograms of the rainfall event characteristics and four different pdfs these figures suggest that a lognormal distribution is optimal for representing the distributions of the rainfall event characteristics in south korea the suitability of the lognormal distribution is also verified in table 6 which lists the coefficient of determination values r 2 obtained for the fitted pdfs the coefficient of determination values derived for the lognormal pdf are the closest to 1 0 at most stations based on these results the runoff event volume pdf is derived by employing a lognormal distribution and a generally used one parameter exponential distribution and the derivation process is described in section 2 4 3 2 comparisons of apms and swmm simulation the close match between the swmm results and the observed runoff volumes is confirmed in section 2 5 1 rendering verification of the apm possible by comparison with the swmm a frequency analysis on 30 year rainfall data from ten stations is conducted by applying the calibrated input parameters and estimated runoff coefficients to the swmm and apms the exceedance probability and return period for the runoff event volume in equations 22 24 are used for the frequency analysis fig 8 illustrates the exceedance probabilities derived from the swmm and the two apms using the exponential and lognormal distributions the solid black lines represent the swmm results between the colored lines which represent the results of the two apms the dashed lines represent the original rainfall runoff transformation calculated using equation 1 while the solid lines denote the developed rainfall runoff transformation calculated using equation 5 the exceedance probability of the swmm agrees much better with a lognormal distribution than with an exponential distribution in particular the exceedance probabilities obtained by applying a lognormal distribution in the rainfall runoff transformation considering pervious and impervious areas the solid blue line correspond best with the swmm results over the entire range of the runoff event volumes the difference between the exceedance probabilities of the exponential distributions and the swmm increases rapidly from the point when the runoff event volume becomes larger than approximately 20 mm although the results obtained for the two distributions coincide well when the runoff event volume is smaller than approximately 20 mm fig 9 compares the return periods derived based on the runoff event volume with those output by the two apms and the swmm the results of the lognormal distribution obviously follow the swmm results better than the exponential distribution results however for return periods greater than approximately 0 1 years the return periods simulated by the apms are markedly overestimated for the same runoff event volume for this reason it is difficult to interpret that the return periods derived from the lognormal distributions follow the return periods simulated by the swmm sufficiently well these results are also confirmed in table 7 which shows the model evaluation statistics of the apms for the return period results compared to the swmm results the models are evaluated with the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data rsr moriasi et al 2007 the related formulas are shown in equations 25 28 25 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 26 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 27 pbias i 1 n o i s i 100 i 1 n

in the table the model evaluation results of the exponential and lognormal apms to which the developed rainfall runoff transformation is applied are indicated as exp and ln respectively the r 2 values for the lognormal apm are on average 0 2 greater than the exponential apm values and closer to 1 0 the model evaluation results are taken to be satisfactory as the nse is closer to 1 0 and pbias and rsr are closer to zero since the exponential apm values are significantly different from the optimal values compared to the lognormal apm values the exponential apm does not appropriately reflect the rainfall characteristics of south korea the overestimated results of the apms are also shown numerically with the corresponding pbias values all these values are negative indicating that the models are biased toward overestimation 3 3 adjustment of apm parameters in this study the overestimated return periods shown in fig 9 are adjusted downward to the swmm derived values the adjustment parameters are calculated based on model evaluation statistics criteria as shown in table 8 and are multiplied by the parameter μ of the lognormal pdf with the developed rainfall runoff transformation applied in general r 2 values greater than 0 5 are considered to be acceptable moriasi et al 2007 and as shown in table 7 most of the r 2 values for the lognormal apm are well above 0 5 and close to 1 0 before adjustment this indicates that the r 2 values do not have to be considered when calculating the adjustment parameters therefore the adjustment parameters are determined by iterating until the nse value is close to 1 0 pbias is no greater than the absolute value of 25 and rsr is 0 5 or less the adjusted parameters and the model evaluation statistics after application of these parameters are summarized in table 7 the adjusted lognormal apm is denoted by adjusted ln and as mentioned earlier the r 2 values are very close to 1 0 before and after adjustments most of the nse pbias and rsr values did not meet the criteria listed in table 8 before the adjustment but satisfy the criteria following the application of the adjustment parameters fig 10 also shows an improved result in which the return periods derived using the lognormal distribution are noticeably closer to those of the swmm compared to the results obtained before adjustment which are shown in fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of probability distributions based on rainfall characteristics many studies have shown that the one parameter exponential distribution is a suitable probability distribution for rainfall event characteristics eagleson 1972 1978 howard 1976 adams and bontje 1984 adams et al 1986 these results have been assumed in many subsequent studies because a single parameter distribution is simple and easy to calculate guo and adams 1998a b guo and adams 1999 chen and adams 2005a 2005b 2007 most of these studies have analyzed rainfall data from regions of north america that indicate that variations in seasonal rainfall are not much different such as toronto ontario canada and chicago illinois however the rainfall events in south korea unlike those in north america are severely concentrated from july to august several studies on regions with seasonal rainfall such as south korea have suggested distribution types other than an exponential distribution to represent their rainfall distribution characteristics andrés doménech et al 2010 derived the probability distribution for the detention tank design and applied it to valencia which is located on the eastern mediterranean coastline of spain rainfall events in valencia are concentrated in autumn and have a distinct seasonality in the derivation process they showed that the rainfall depth and duration in valencia are better fit with the generalized pareto and two parameter gamma distributions respectively than the exponential distribution they also confirmed that seasonality affects the calculation of the volumetric efficiencies and overflow reduction efficiencies of the detention tank zegpi and fernández 2010 proposed a model for estimating the cdf of the runoff volume and peak discharge rate and applied it to santiago chile most of the rainfall precipitation in santiago which has a mediterranean climate is concentrated between april and september castro et al 2019 the rainfall event volume distribution in santiago with seasonality was better represented by a two parameter gamma distribution than an exponential distribution table 9 presents the average monthly rainfall event distributions along with seasonality toronto in canada seoul in south korea valencia in spain and santiago in chile climate data org the results show that each region is fitted with different rainfall distributions in this study three types of two parameter distributions and one parameter exponential distributions were investigated for ten stations to determine the optimal probability distribution of rainfall characteristics in south korea as shown in figs 5 7 the lognormal distributions at most stations produced the best fit to the rainfall event characteristics this result leads to the apm frequency analysis results in figs 8 9 and table 7 the runoff volumes predicted by the apm with the lognormal distribution are much more consistent with the swmm values than the results of the apm with the exponential distribution the seasonality of rainfall events throughout a year helps account for the result that the probability distribution representing the rainfall characteristics of south korea are better fit by a distribution type other than the one parameter exponential distribution park et al 2013 also showed that the hydrological distribution is affected by the seasonality of rainfall events in south korea and that the two parameter exponential distribution is a better fit than the one parameter exponential distribution for the estimation of the stormwater water quality capture volume wqcv they suggested that caution is necessary when applying the analytical probabilistic approach to regions with significant standard deviations in the average monthly rainfall moreover rainfall seasonality results in a gap in the runoff volumes of apms as an event based simulation and the swmm as a continuous simulation the difference in runoff volumes between apms and the swmm caused by seasonality is discussed further in section 4 3 4 2 analysis of difference results between apm and swmm figs 8 9 show that the frequency analysis results of the apm with a lognormal pdf are much better than those of the one parameter exponential apm however the return periods of the lognormal apm were overestimated over the swmm results which is interpreted to be due to the limited ability of the apm to physically simulate the hydrological process as a continuous simulation model the swmm continuously tracks soil moisture and calculates runoff volumes heggen 2001 in contrast the apm an event based model calculates the runoff volume for each rainfall event individually and does not take into account soil moisture from antecedent rainfall events antecedent rainfall indicates that the rainfall falls before a given rainfall event and affects the runoff generation of a given rainfall event heggen 2001 antecedent rainfall has a significant impact on runoff volume estimates even if the runoff volume is estimated for the same rainfall event the runoff event volume is greater when the soil is full of moisture from antecedent rainfall events than in dry conditions when the rainfall runoff transformation is applied in the process of deriving the apm the depression storage is assumed to be fully available that is the soil moisture condition is always dry therefore the runoff volumes calculated under this assumption are underestimated for the same return periods as shown in fig 9 furthermore the greater the influence of the antecedent rainfall events on the runoff occurrence of the corresponding rainfall event the greater the difference between apm and swmm the apm was proposed to overcome the shortcomings of computationally burdensome and time consuming swmm and thus the apm produces results that are comparable to those output by the swmm while maintaining a comparable accuracy several studies have calculated return periods using apms and compared the results with those derived from simulation models guo and adams 1998a guo et al 2012 and zegpi and fernández 2010 overestimated the return periods for runoff event volumes and hassini and guo 2020 underestimated the return periods for peak discharge rates although these researchers did not make any adjustments to their return period estimates adjustments are applied in the current study to better fit the swmm results 4 3 correlation between the adjustment parameters and seasonal rainfall distributions as mentioned in section 4 2 the difference between apm and swmm widens as the influence of antecedent rainfall events increases the influenceability of the antecedent rainfall events on the runoff generation of the given rainfall event should consider the concept of the time period which is the time between the two consecutive rainfall events behera et al 2010 when successive rainfall events occur close together in other words when the time period is short the effect of the antecedent rainfall events is significant in particular the rainfall distribution pattern in south korea is relatively concentrated in a specific period and that time period is short in addition the concentration of rainfall distribution varies by region in south korea and the influence of antecedent rainfall events also differs behera et al 2010 showed that the antecedent rainfall characteristics were different for two regions with different climates in the united states the adjustment parameter values in table 7 were assigned differently for each station just as the degree of difference in the apm and swmm results in fig 9 varied from station to station which is assumed to be the result of regional antecedent rainfall characteristics this study distributes the 30 year average monthly rainfall considering the concentration of rainfall events to investigate the results in which each station was assigned a different adjustment parameter value fig 11 presents the rainfall distributions obtained for three stations busan daejeon and chuncheon the rainfall depth in chuncheon was noticeably concentrated from july to august the rainfall distributions of the other two stations are less concentrated than that of chuncheon and in particular the variance in the average monthly rainfall in busan is within a modest range in most months except july and august busan has higher rainfall depths than chuncheon and daejeon while chuncheon receives more average monthly rainfall in july and august than busan and daejeon comparing the corresponding adjustment parameters derived for the three stations chuncheon has the highest adjustment parameter at 1 26 and busan has the smallest adjustment parameter at 1 04 this investigation accounts for the fact that the adjustment parameter is higher when the rainfall distribution is more concentrated the more concentrated the rainfall events are the greater the influence of the antecedent rainfall events and the greater the difference between apm and swmm in the runoff prediction because the difference between the two models is modified by an adjustment parameter it is necessary to investigate the relationship between the concentration of rainfall events and adjustment parameters this relationship is corroborated by examining the coefficient of variation cv values derived for the 30 year average monthly rainfall data table 10 shows the cvs in ascending order along with the adjustment parameters the stations are grouped into groups a b and c by the corresponding cv and adjustment parameter ranges in group a the cv is less than 100 and the adjustment parameter is less than 1 10 while in group c the cv is greater than 110 and the adjustment parameter is greater than 1 20 in group b the cv ranges from 100 110 and the adjustment parameter ranges from 1 10 1 20 a map of the stations corresponding to groups a b and c is shown in fig 12 group a is adjacent to the south coast of south korea and group c is located in northwestern south korea group b includes the central region of south korea as well as the region adjoining the eastern coast of the country although sokcho and taebaek are close to group c they have different climate characteristics from group c because they are located to the east of the taebaek mountains sokcho and taebaek have similar monthly rainfall distributions to those recorded in the central part of south korea so they are placed into group b this grouping is similar to the results of heo et al 2007 and nam et al 2015 who grouped south korea according to rainfall characteristics through regional frequency analyses the adjustment parameters are calculated to improve the runoff estimation ability of the apm however it requires a lot of time to determine the adjustment parameter because different values are assessed by trial and error until the model evaluation criteria table 8 are satisfied grouping the adjustment parameters by region as shown in table 10 and fig 12 allows the process of calculating the adjustment parameter to be omitted therefore when estimating the runoff volume in a certain region it saves time and enables more accurate apm runoff estimation by using the adjustment parameter of the group corresponding to the region the derived adjustment parameters and cvs are plotted on the x and y axes along with a linear trend line in fig 13 the coefficient of determination of the trend line is 0 90 clearly indicating a positive correlation between the adjustment parameters and cvs for the average monthly rainfall however it is not known whether this correlation is generalizable since it has been confirmed for only ten stations of south korea to generalize the correlation proposal it is necessary to verify the correlation for more stations in south korea as well as regions of various countries with large cvs of average monthly rainfall furthermore expanding the target region is also required for more detailed and accurate grouping of adjustment parameters by region 5 conclusions this study investigated appropriate probability distributions for rainfall event characteristics in south korea and developed a corresponding apm to estimate the runoff event volume in contrast to other studies this study found that the rainfall event characteristics in south korea are best represented with lognormal distributions likewise the results of the lognormal apm are the closest to those of the swmm in terms of the exceedance probability and the return period however at most stations in south korea the lognormal apms overestimate the return periods of runoff events this study interprets that the overestimation is due to the concentrated rainfall distributions in the study stations and applies the adjustment parameters to the apm to match the return periods between the apm and the swmm the adjustment parameter increases as the average monthly rainfall distribution is concentrated that is a correlation is observed between the adjustment parameters and the cvs of the average monthly rainfall therefore the apm parameters need to be adjusted before applying it for the estimation of runoff volumes for regions with highly biased temporal rainfall distributions in addition this study divides different adjustment parameters for each station into three groups which enable to obviate the need for calculating the adjustment parameters the correlation between the adjustment parameters and cvs and grouping of the adjustment parameters presented in this study are confirmed only for ten stations in south korea these findings could be generalized through further validation to more regions and countries credit authorship contribution statement moonyoung lee investigation

3104,this study showed that the complex rainfall characteristics of south korea where rainfall is concentrated during a specific period are poorly represented with a simple single parameter distribution thus a two parameter lognormal distribution that best represents the rainfall characteristics of south korea was proposed by comparing four different distributions using this distribution this study developed a suitable analytical probabilistic model apm to simulate runoff event volumes in south korea and suggested an apm parameter adjustment method based on rainfall characteristics thirty year rainfall data recorded at ten stations were grouped based on the interevent time definition ietd of each station with the grouped rainfall events the probability density function pdf of the lognormal distribution was confirmed to best fit the rainfall event characteristic histograms in south korea including those of the rainfall event volume duration and interevent time the apm was developed by deriving the pdf of the runoff event volume with a lognormal distribution and a frequency analysis was performed based on the runoff event volume obtained by the apm and the storm water management model swmm to verify the suitability of the derived model the runoff event volumes output by the apm were compared with the runoff event volumes simulated by the swmm the exceedance probabilities and return periods output by the developed apm with a lognormal distribution were very close to the swmm results however the return periods output by the apm were overestimated and adjustment parameters were needed to match the outputs to the swmm results this study found a strong correlation between the adjustment parameters and the coefficients of variation in the average monthly rainfall this result suggested that model parameter adjustments are necessary before applying an apm to rainfall datasets with large coefficients of variation in average monthly rainfall data keywords analytical probabilistic model adjustment parameter average monthly rainfall coefficient of variation lognormal distribution storm water management model 1 introduction as urbanization progresses runoff volumes have increased and stormwater management facilities have been installed to control urban stormwater these facilities are typically designed using three approaches the design storm event approach the continuous simulation approach and the analytical probabilistic approach the design storm event approach simulates runoff hydrographs based on the hyetographs of design storms this method is widely used to design stormwater management facilities however this approach has been criticized due to its basic assumption that the return period of the resulting runoff hydrograph is equal to the return period of the design storm hyetograph wenzel 1982 adams and howard 1986 the continuous simulation approach uses long term continuous rainfall data as input without pretreatment this approach is the most reliable but it is difficult and time consuming to organize the simulations the analytical probabilistic approach has been proposed as a substitution for the continuous simulation approach the probability density function pdf of the runoff volume has been derived and used in the hydrological design of urban stormwater management facilities for statistical analyses of rainfall event characteristics namely the rainfall event volume duration and interevent time continuous rainfall data are grouped into rainfall events by an appropriate interevent time definition ietd an analytical probabilistic model apm is derived based on rainfall runoff transformations and the pdfs of rainfall event characteristics guo and adams 1999 calculated the peak outflow rates of stormwater management facilities with an analytical probabilistic approach and confirmed that the results obtained with this approach agreed well with the results of the storm water management model swmm guo 2001 compared all three design approaches by calculating the peak flood discharge rates although the three approaches produced similar results the analytical probabilistic approach was recommended due to the variability that arose in the design storm approach depending on the selected model and designed storm as was also mentioned by guo and zhuge 2008 and hassini and guo 2017 and the computational simplicity of the analytical probabilistic approach analytical probabilistic approaches have been continuously studied and applied in water resource research eagleson 1972 guo and adams 1998a 1998b guo 2001 guo et al 2012 hassini and guo 2020 and are still being developed today guo and zhuge 2008 guo and dai 2009 guo et al 2009 guo et al 2012 in particular studies on the application of apms to low impact development lid have been conducted recently guo and baetz 2007 wang et al 2019 zhang and guo 2013a 2013b 2014 when determining the design criteria of stormwater management facilities through an analytical probabilistic approach it is important to fit probability distributions that are suitable for rainfall event characteristics hassini and guo 2016 most studies have fit one parameter exponential distributions to rainfall event characteristics and provided exponential distribution parameter values for the united states driscoll et al 1989 wanielista and yousef 1993 and canada adams and papa 2000 however studies conducted in other countries with rainfall characteristics that differ from those of north america andrés doménech et al 2010 bacchi et al 2008 balistrocchi et al 2009 hassan et al 2015 zegpi and fernández 2010 have shown that distributions other than one parameter exponential distributions such as the generalized pareto weibull wakeby and two parameter gamma distributions better represent their rainfall event characteristics attempts have been made in south korea to determine the optimal distribution of rainfall event characteristics to develop an apm choi et al 2008 developed an apm using a three parameter exponential distribution and applied it to a watershed in south korea to evaluate its feasibility by comparing the results with a one parameter exponential distribution kim and han 2010 also applied a three parameter exponential distribution to an apm to develop a stormwater capture curve park et al 2013 applied a two parameter exponential distribution and a one parameter exponential distribution to an apm to estimate the water quality capture volume wqcv a design parameter of urban stormwater treatment facilities these studies suggested new distribution types or compared two distribution types to represent the characteristics of rainfall events in south korea it is necessary to investigate the applicability of various distributions to obtain the optimal probability distribution type in south korea but few studies have compared different distributions this study compares a total of four probability distributions including three two parameter distributions and the conventional one parameter exponential distribution the three parameter distribution is not included in the distribution comparison because the parameter estimation process is difficult determining rainfall runoff transformations is also important in the development of apms in several studies adams and bontje 1984 adams and papa 2000 park and um 2018 rainfall runoff transformations have been simply represented by applying only one lumped runoff coefficient regardless of the perviousness or imperviousness of the study areas guo and adams 1998a pointed out that this expression is too simplistic to describe physically complex hydrological conditions to improve the oversimplification of rainfall runoff transformations due to the application of a lumped runoff coefficient many studies guo and adams 1998a 1999 chen and adams 2005a 2005b have considered the spatial characteristics of the analyzed catchment and developed rainfall runoff processes by dividing the catchment into pervious and impervious areas chen and adams 2007 compared the runoff volume of the swmm with the runoff volumes of apms based on three types of rainfall runoff transformations one transformation type ignored the distinction between pervious and impervious areas while the other two types made spatial divisions one of the two transformation types in which spatial division was considered also included the infiltration process the average annual runoff volume results of the apm obtained based on the two transformation types in which spatial characteristics were considered were comparable to the swmm results regardless of whether or not the infiltration process was included based on these results the authors suggested that the relatively simple rainfall runoff transformation considering only the spatial division of the study area is effective in estimating runoff volumes therefore this study employs this rainfall runoff transformation type for deriving runoff pdfs south korea has distinct wet and dry seasons based on the monsoon climate with concentrated rainfall in july and august the objective of this study is to determine the most appropriate probability distributions for rainfall event characteristics in south korea and to develop and verify an apm using the determined probability distributions the pdfs of the runoff volume are derived by applying one and two parameter distributions to two types of rainfall runoff transformations with and without the separation of pervious and impervious areas for runoff coefficient the performance of the apm is compared with the results from a calibrated swmm and based on this comparison the adjustment of the apm according to swmm results is proposed this study contains three major parts the development of the apm a frequency analysis and comparison with the swmm and the adjustment of the model according to the swmm results the overall flowchart of the study is illustrated in fig 1 2 methods 2 1 study stations in this study a statistical analysis of the 30 year hourly rainfall data recorded from 1991 to 2020 at ten stations in south korea is conducted the locations of the stations in busan chuncheon daegu daejeon jeonju jinju seoul sokcho taebaek and wonju are shown in fig 2 2 2 interevent time definition the continuous historical rainfall series are separated into rainfall events based on the ietd for the statistical analysis the ietd provides a minimum spacing between independent rainfall events as a criterion for grouping rainfall events this study applies a common method the autocorrelation analysis method to estimate the ietd the autocorrelation analysis method is based on the statistical independence of rainfall events separated by the ietd the ietd is determined as the lag time at which the correlation between rainfall events is close to zero and the lag time is the time interval between each observation the results of the autocorrelation analysis and the ietds determined for each study station are shown in fig 3 and table 1 2 3 rainfall runoff transformation in deriving the pdf of the runoff volume the rainfall runoff transformation is preceded by converting the rainfall volume v mm to the runoff volume v r mm the simplest original rainfall runoff transformation is expressed with only a lumped runoff coefficient and does not consider spatial characteristics the transformation used in the storage treatment overflow and runoff model storm u s army corps of engineers 1977 is as follows 1 v r 0 v s d v s d v s d where is a dimensionless runoff coefficient and s d is the depression storage mm the original rainfall runoff transformation equation 1 is developed by dividing the lumped areas into pervious and impervious areas for both runoff coefficients and depression storage for the fraction of impervious area in the urban catchment h s d is divided into the pervious area depression storage as s dp and the impervious area depression storage as s di and it is generally assumed that s di s dp the runoff coefficient is only considered in the pervious area and is denoted by dp assuming that the impervious area runoff coefficient is unity after the initial depression losses are satisfied 2 v ri 0 v s di v s di v s di 3 v rp 0 v s dp dp v s dp v s dp 4 v r h v ri 1 h v rp the runoff volume from impervious and pervious areas is expressed by equations 2 and 3 respectively which are combined according to the area weighted runoff of equation 4 this transformation which considers spatial characteristics is referred to herein as the developed rainfall runoff transformation and is expressed as follows 5 v r 0 v s di h v s di s di v s dp h dp 1 h v h s di dp s dp 1 h v s dp continuous swmm simulation takes nonlinear infiltration models such as horton green ampt and curve number into account nevertheless this study uses equation 5 assuming a linear relationship between rainfall and runoff based on the results of predicting similar runoff or spill responses regardless of whether explicit infiltration process is included chen and adams 2005a chen and adams 2007 2 4 derivation of the probability distribution for the runoff event volume to derive the runoff event probability distribution the rainfall runoff transformation and the pdfs of the rainfall event characteristics are considered the rainfall event volume pdfs used to develop the apm include the commonly used one parameter exponential distribution and the lognormal distribution that best fits the rainfall event characteristics of south korea the pdfs are represented with their parameters in table 2 the process and results of determining the pdf that best represents the rainfall event characteristics of south korea are presented in section 3 1 the pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf of the runoff event volume are derived by combining the original and developed rainfall runoff transformation and the two rainfall event volume pdfs 2 4 1 one parameter exponential distribution adams and papa 2000 derived the pdf and cdf of the runoff event volume by applying a one parameter exponential distribution and the original rainfall runoff transformation which are expressed as follows 6 f v r v r p r o b v r v r 1 e ζ v r ϕ s d 7 f v r v r d d v r f v r v r ζ ϕ e ζ v r ϕ s d where the pdf and cdf of the runoff event volume are denoted as f v r v r and f v r v r respectively and ζ is the parameter of the one parameter exponential pdf the pdf and cdf of the runoff event volume in which the developed rainfall runoff transformation is applied are expressed as follows chen and adams 2007 8 f v r v r 1 e ζ s di v r 0 1 e ζ v r h s di 0 v r h s dp s di 1 e ζ v r ϕ h s dh v r h s dp s di

rainfall runoff transformation no runoff occurs when the rainfall volume is less than the depression storage the probability that runoff does not occur is denoted by an impulse probability which can

calibration of input parameters for swmm to verify the apm derived in this study a frequency analysis of the apm and a continuous simulation model is conducted and the results are compared the us epa swmm rossman 2015 is a stormwater runoff quantity and quality simulation model primarily for urban areas this study calculated the runoff volume for continuous simulation in the swmm the experimental catchment selected for swmm calibration is gunja drainage basin this catchment which is located in seoul south korea has an area of 96 5 ha and an impervious area ratio h of 0 5 the observed rainfall and runoff volume data for calibration are constructed from nine specific rainfall events between 2005 and 2010 kim 2006 the slope manning s n catchment width depression storage infiltration capacity and infiltration decay coefficient are parameters that require calibration they are manually calibrated until the difference between the observed and simulated runoff volumes is minimized the roughness coefficient and depression storage are set to different values for the pervious and impervious areas and because the swmm infiltration process is simulated by the horton infiltration equation the relevant parameters are also set the physical characteristics and calibrated swmm input parameters are listed in table 4 the calibrated input parameters are equally applied to all stations to identify trends in the runoff event volume distribution by rainfall characteristics under constant spatial characteristics rather than accurately estimating the runoff event volumes the runoff volumes are estimated every ten minutes by applying the calibrated parameters to the swmm for comparison with the observed values the r 2 values between the simulated and observed runoff volumes in table 5 range from 0 78 to 0 93 for all events the swmm runoff event volumes for nine specific events are plotted against the corresponding observed values in fig 4 a linear regression line between the simulated and observed runoff event volumes shows an r 2 of 0 87 the swmm runoff event volumes closely match the observed runoff event volumes 2 5 2 apm parameters the calibrated swmm parameters pervious and impervious area depression storage s dp and s di are applied equally to the apm in the developed rainfall runoff transformation s dp and s di are set to 1 08 and 4 5 mm respectively for the original rainfall runoff transformation the depression storage s d is used by substituting the area weighted depression storage s dh value chen and adams 2005b the lumped runoff coefficient for the original rainfall runoff transformation is estimated using the impervious area ratio h of the test catchment as suggested by wef and asce 1998 21 0 85 h 3 0 75 h 2 0 774 h 0 04 the value obtained by substituting h of the test catchment into equation 21 is 0 34 the pervious area runoff coefficient dp for the developed rainfall runoff transformation is less than and typically determined empirically rather than calculated from the observed runoff data chen and adams 2005a chen and adams 2007 this study set dp to 0 25 as in chen and adams 2005a 2 6 exceedance probability and return period of the runoff event volume both apms and the swmm use the same rainfall data from the ten stations for the frequency analysis the continuous runoff results obtained from the swmm are grouped into runoff events for the frequency analysis the ietd obtained for these runoff events is not the same as the ietd obtained for the rainfall events the runoff event derived ietd is smaller than the rainfall event derived ietd and can be considered as small as approximately the time of concentration guo and adams 1998a based on an estimated 2 hour time of concentration the runoff event derived ietd which is 2 h shorter than the rainfall event derived ietd is applied to separate the continuous runoff data into runoff events the frequency analysis is conducted by determining the exceedance probability and return period of the runoff event volumes simulated by the two apms and the swmm the exceedance probabilities of the runoff event volume derived for the apms are calculated using the cdfs f v r v r listed in table 3 and expressed as follows 22 g v r v r 1 f v r v r where g v r v r is the exceedance probability of the runoff event volume v r per rainfall event and f v r v r is the cdf of v r for the runoff event volume derived from the swmm the exceedance probability is calculated with the weibull plotting position formula which is expressed as follows 23 p m n 1 where p is the exceedance probability of a given runoff volume per rainfall event and n is the total number of runoff events corresponding to the total number of rainfall events in the continuous rainfall data input into the swmm m indicates that the event is the mth largest of n events the return period of a given runoff event volume is calculated as follows 24 t r 1 θ g v r v r where t r in years is the return period of the runoff event volume v r θ is the average annual number of rainfall events and g v r v r is the exceedance probability of v r per rainfall event which is substituted with the value obtained from equation 23 for the swmm and the value obtained from equation 22 for the apms 3 results 3 1 probability distribution of rainfall event characteristics to develop an apm for south korea the pdfs that are most suitable for the local rainfall event characteristics including the rainfall volume duration and interevent time are determined these three characteristics are plotted as relative frequency histograms one parameter exponential two parameter exponential lognormal and gamma pdfs are then fitted to each histogram in this process rainfall events less than 1 mm are removed from the statistical analysis to better fit the distribution of large rainfall events because small rainfall events are so dominant that they cause the histograms to skew excessively to the left this process is acceptable as the eliminated rainfall events have little effect on the overall runoff volumes guo and adams 1998a figs 5 7 show the relative frequency histograms of the rainfall event characteristics and four different pdfs these figures suggest that a lognormal distribution is optimal for representing the distributions of the rainfall event characteristics in south korea the suitability of the lognormal distribution is also verified in table 6 which lists the coefficient of determination values r 2 obtained for the fitted pdfs the coefficient of determination values derived for the lognormal pdf are the closest to 1 0 at most stations based on these results the runoff event volume pdf is derived by employing a lognormal distribution and a generally used one parameter exponential distribution and the derivation process is described in section 2 4 3 2 comparisons of apms and swmm simulation the close match between the swmm results and the observed runoff volumes is confirmed in section 2 5 1 rendering verification of the apm possible by comparison with the swmm a frequency analysis on 30 year rainfall data from ten stations is conducted by applying the calibrated input parameters and estimated runoff coefficients to the swmm and apms the exceedance probability and return period for the runoff event volume in equations 22 24 are used for the frequency analysis fig 8 illustrates the exceedance probabilities derived from the swmm and the two apms using the exponential and lognormal distributions the solid black lines represent the swmm results between the colored lines which represent the results of the two apms the dashed lines represent the original rainfall runoff transformation calculated using equation 1 while the solid lines denote the developed rainfall runoff transformation calculated using equation 5 the exceedance probability of the swmm agrees much better with a lognormal distribution than with an exponential distribution in particular the exceedance probabilities obtained by applying a lognormal distribution in the rainfall runoff transformation considering pervious and impervious areas the solid blue line correspond best with the swmm results over the entire range of the runoff event volumes the difference between the exceedance probabilities of the exponential distributions and the swmm increases rapidly from the point when the runoff event volume becomes larger than approximately 20 mm although the results obtained for the two distributions coincide well when the runoff event volume is smaller than approximately 20 mm fig 9 compares the return periods derived based on the runoff event volume with those output by the two apms and the swmm the results of the lognormal distribution obviously follow the swmm results better than the exponential distribution results however for return periods greater than approximately 0 1 years the return periods simulated by the apms are markedly overestimated for the same runoff event volume for this reason it is difficult to interpret that the return periods derived from the lognormal distributions follow the return periods simulated by the swmm sufficiently well these results are also confirmed in table 7 which shows the model evaluation statistics of the apms for the return period results compared to the swmm results the models are evaluated with the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of the measured data rsr moriasi et al 2007 the related formulas are shown in equations 25 28 25 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 26 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 27 pbias i 1 n o i s i 100 i 1 n

in the table the model evaluation results of the exponential and lognormal apms to which the developed rainfall runoff transformation is applied are indicated as exp and ln respectively the r 2 values for the lognormal apm are on average 0 2 greater than the exponential apm values and closer to 1 0 the model evaluation results are taken to be satisfactory as the nse is closer to 1 0 and pbias and rsr are closer to zero since the exponential apm values are significantly different from the optimal values compared to the lognormal apm values the exponential apm does not appropriately reflect the rainfall characteristics of south korea the overestimated results of the apms are also shown numerically with the corresponding pbias values all these values are negative indicating that the models are biased toward overestimation 3 3 adjustment of apm parameters in this study the overestimated return periods shown in fig 9 are adjusted downward to the swmm derived values the adjustment parameters are calculated based on model evaluation statistics criteria as shown in table 8 and are multiplied by the parameter μ of the lognormal pdf with the developed rainfall runoff transformation applied in general r 2 values greater than 0 5 are considered to be acceptable moriasi et al 2007 and as shown in table 7 most of the r 2 values for the lognormal apm are well above 0 5 and close to 1 0 before adjustment this indicates that the r 2 values do not have to be considered when calculating the adjustment parameters therefore the adjustment parameters are determined by iterating until the nse value is close to 1 0 pbias is no greater than the absolute value of 25 and rsr is 0 5 or less the adjusted parameters and the model evaluation statistics after application of these parameters are summarized in table 7 the adjusted lognormal apm is denoted by adjusted ln and as mentioned earlier the r 2 values are very close to 1 0 before and after adjustments most of the nse pbias and rsr values did not meet the criteria listed in table 8 before the adjustment but satisfy the criteria following the application of the adjustment parameters fig 10 also shows an improved result in which the return periods derived using the lognormal distribution are noticeably closer to those of the swmm compared to the results obtained before adjustment which are shown in fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of probability distributions based on rainfall characteristics many studies have shown that the one parameter exponential distribution is a suitable probability distribution for rainfall event characteristics eagleson 1972 1978 howard 1976 adams and bontje 1984 adams et al 1986 these results have been assumed in many subsequent studies because a single parameter distribution is simple and easy to calculate guo and adams 1998a b guo and adams 1999 chen and adams 2005a 2005b 2007 most of these studies have analyzed rainfall data from regions of north america that indicate that variations in seasonal rainfall are not much different such as toronto ontario canada and chicago illinois however the rainfall events in south korea unlike those in north america are severely concentrated from july to august several studies on regions with seasonal rainfall such as south korea have suggested distribution types other than an exponential distribution to represent their rainfall distribution characteristics andrés doménech et al 2010 derived the probability distribution for the detention tank design and applied it to valencia which is located on the eastern mediterranean coastline of spain rainfall events in valencia are concentrated in autumn and have a distinct seasonality in the derivation process they showed that the rainfall depth and duration in valencia are better fit with the generalized pareto and two parameter gamma distributions respectively than the exponential distribution they also confirmed that seasonality affects the calculation of the volumetric efficiencies and overflow reduction efficiencies of the detention tank zegpi and fernández 2010 proposed a model for estimating the cdf of the runoff volume and peak discharge rate and applied it to santiago chile most of the rainfall precipitation in santiago which has a mediterranean climate is concentrated between april and september castro et al 2019 the rainfall event volume distribution in santiago with seasonality was better represented by a two parameter gamma distribution than an exponential distribution table 9 presents the average monthly rainfall event distributions along with seasonality toronto in canada seoul in south korea valencia in spain and santiago in chile climate data org the results show that each region is fitted with different rainfall distributions in this study three types of two parameter distributions and one parameter exponential distributions were investigated for ten stations to determine the optimal probability distribution of rainfall characteristics in south korea as shown in figs 5 7 the lognormal distributions at most stations produced the best fit to the rainfall event characteristics this result leads to the apm frequency analysis results in figs 8 9 and table 7 the runoff volumes predicted by the apm with the lognormal distribution are much more consistent with the swmm values than the results of the apm with the exponential distribution the seasonality of rainfall events throughout a year helps account for the result that the probability distribution representing the rainfall characteristics of south korea are better fit by a distribution type other than the one parameter exponential distribution park et al 2013 also showed that the hydrological distribution is affected by the seasonality of rainfall events in south korea and that the two parameter exponential distribution is a better fit than the one parameter exponential distribution for the estimation of the stormwater water quality capture volume wqcv they suggested that caution is necessary when applying the analytical probabilistic approach to regions with significant standard deviations in the average monthly rainfall moreover rainfall seasonality results in a gap in the runoff volumes of apms as an event based simulation and the swmm as a continuous simulation the difference in runoff volumes between apms and the swmm caused by seasonality is discussed further in section 4 3 4 2 analysis of difference results between apm and swmm figs 8 9 show that the frequency analysis results of the apm with a lognormal pdf are much better than those of the one parameter exponential apm however the return periods of the lognormal apm were overestimated over the swmm results which is interpreted to be due to the limited ability of the apm to physically simulate the hydrological process as a continuous simulation model the swmm continuously tracks soil moisture and calculates runoff volumes heggen 2001 in contrast the apm an event based model calculates the runoff volume for each rainfall event individually and does not take into account soil moisture from antecedent rainfall events antecedent rainfall indicates that the rainfall falls before a given rainfall event and affects the runoff generation of a given rainfall event heggen 2001 antecedent rainfall has a significant impact on runoff volume estimates even if the runoff volume is estimated for the same rainfall event the runoff event volume is greater when the soil is full of moisture from antecedent rainfall events than in dry conditions when the rainfall runoff transformation is applied in the process of deriving the apm the depression storage is assumed to be fully available that is the soil moisture condition is always dry therefore the runoff volumes calculated under this assumption are underestimated for the same return periods as shown in fig 9 furthermore the greater the influence of the antecedent rainfall events on the runoff occurrence of the corresponding rainfall event the greater the difference between apm and swmm the apm was proposed to overcome the shortcomings of computationally burdensome and time consuming swmm and thus the apm produces results that are comparable to those output by the swmm while maintaining a comparable accuracy several studies have calculated return periods using apms and compared the results with those derived from simulation models guo and adams 1998a guo et al 2012 and zegpi and fernández 2010 overestimated the return periods for runoff event volumes and hassini and guo 2020 underestimated the return periods for peak discharge rates although these researchers did not make any adjustments to their return period estimates adjustments are applied in the current study to better fit the swmm results 4 3 correlation between the adjustment parameters and seasonal rainfall distributions as mentioned in section 4 2 the difference between apm and swmm widens as the influence of antecedent rainfall events increases the influenceability of the antecedent rainfall events on the runoff generation of the given rainfall event should consider the concept of the time period which is the time between the two consecutive rainfall events behera et al 2010 when successive rainfall events occur close together in other words when the time period is short the effect of the antecedent rainfall events is significant in particular the rainfall distribution pattern in south korea is relatively concentrated in a specific period and that time period is short in addition the concentration of rainfall distribution varies by region in south korea and the influence of antecedent rainfall events also differs behera et al 2010 showed that the antecedent rainfall characteristics were different for two regions with different climates in the united states the adjustment parameter values in table 7 were assigned differently for each station just as the degree of difference in the apm and swmm results in fig 9 varied from station to station which is assumed to be the result of regional antecedent rainfall characteristics this study distributes the 30 year average monthly rainfall considering the concentration of rainfall events to investigate the results in which each station was assigned a different adjustment parameter value fig 11 presents the rainfall distributions obtained for three stations busan daejeon and chuncheon the rainfall depth in chuncheon was noticeably concentrated from july to august the rainfall distributions of the other two stations are less concentrated than that of chuncheon and in particular the variance in the average monthly rainfall in busan is within a modest range in most months except july and august busan has higher rainfall depths than chuncheon and daejeon while chuncheon receives more average monthly rainfall in july and august than busan and daejeon comparing the corresponding adjustment parameters derived for the three stations chuncheon has the highest adjustment parameter at 1 26 and busan has the smallest adjustment parameter at 1 04 this investigation accounts for the fact that the adjustment parameter is higher when the rainfall distribution is more concentrated the more concentrated the rainfall events are the greater the influence of the antecedent rainfall events and the greater the difference between apm and swmm in the runoff prediction because the difference between the two models is modified by an adjustment parameter it is necessary to investigate the relationship between the concentration of rainfall events and adjustment parameters this relationship is corroborated by examining the coefficient of variation cv values derived for the 30 year average monthly rainfall data table 10 shows the cvs in ascending order along with the adjustment parameters the stations are grouped into groups a b and c by the corresponding cv and adjustment parameter ranges in group a the cv is less than 100 and the adjustment parameter is less than 1 10 while in group c the cv is greater than 110 and the adjustment parameter is greater than 1 20 in group b the cv ranges from 100 110 and the adjustment parameter ranges from 1 10 1 20 a map of the stations corresponding to groups a b and c is shown in fig 12 group a is adjacent to the south coast of south korea and group c is located in northwestern south korea group b includes the central region of south korea as well as the region adjoining the eastern coast of the country although sokcho and taebaek are close to group c they have different climate characteristics from group c because they are located to the east of the taebaek mountains sokcho and taebaek have similar monthly rainfall distributions to those recorded in the central part of south korea so they are placed into group b this grouping is similar to the results of heo et al 2007 and nam et al 2015 who grouped south korea according to rainfall characteristics through regional frequency analyses the adjustment parameters are calculated to improve the runoff estimation ability of the apm however it requires a lot of time to determine the adjustment parameter because different values are assessed by trial and error until the model evaluation criteria table 8 are satisfied grouping the adjustment parameters by region as shown in table 10 and fig 12 allows the process of calculating the adjustment parameter to be omitted therefore when estimating the runoff volume in a certain region it saves time and enables more accurate apm runoff estimation by using the adjustment parameter of the group corresponding to the region the derived adjustment parameters and cvs are plotted on the x and y axes along with a linear trend line in fig 13 the coefficient of determination of the trend line is 0 90 clearly indicating a positive correlation between the adjustment parameters and cvs for the average monthly rainfall however it is not known whether this correlation is generalizable since it has been confirmed for only ten stations of south korea to generalize the correlation proposal it is necessary to verify the correlation for more stations in south korea as well as regions of various countries with large cvs of average monthly rainfall furthermore expanding the target region is also required for more detailed and accurate grouping of adjustment parameters by region 5 conclusions this study investigated appropriate probability distributions for rainfall event characteristics in south korea and developed a corresponding apm to estimate the runoff event volume in contrast to other studies this study found that the rainfall event characteristics in south korea are best represented with lognormal distributions likewise the results of the lognormal apm are the closest to those of the swmm in terms of the exceedance probability and the return period however at most stations in south korea the lognormal apms overestimate the return periods of runoff events this study interprets that the overestimation is due to the concentrated rainfall distributions in the study stations and applies the adjustment parameters to the apm to match the return periods between the apm and the swmm the adjustment parameter increases as the average monthly rainfall distribution is concentrated that is a correlation is observed between the adjustment parameters and the cvs of the average monthly rainfall therefore the apm parameters need to be adjusted before applying it for the estimation of runoff volumes for regions with highly biased temporal rainfall distributions in addition this study divides different adjustment parameters for each station into three groups which enable to obviate the need for calculating the adjustment parameters the correlation between the adjustment parameters and cvs and grouping of the adjustment parameters presented in this study are confirmed only for ten stations in south korea these findings could be generalized through further validation to more regions and countries credit authorship contribution statement moonyoung lee investigation
