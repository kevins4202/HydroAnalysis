availability of data limits the application of detailed and in depth methods of determining groundwater recharge while the necessity to estimate and constrain groundwater recharge for guna tana is important the availability of data hinders detailed and in depth approaches as a result this study investigates the potential amount of groundwater recharge using rainfall and streamflow measurements within guna tana 2 methodology 2 1 study area the guna tana landscape is situated in the northwest part of ethiopia between 11 583 and 12 317 n latitude and 37 45 and 38 23 e longitudes fig 1 this landscape is comprised of the gumara and ribb adjacent watersheds the study watershed has an area of 3499 62 km2 and contributes to 30 5 of the basin inflow to lake tana the topography of the study area ranges from 1774 m a s l at lake tana to 4090 m a s l at mount guna the gumara and ribb rivers originate from small springs located near guna mountain at an elevation of 4090 m a s l and drain into the eastern part of lake tana the geology map of the study watersheds was attained from the geological survey of ethiopia with a resolution of 1 250 000 the geology is dominated by debre tabor basalts and trachytes quaternary lacustrine sediment middle basalt flows and upper basalts and trachytes covering 32 56 24 31 16 12 and 14 9 of the study area respectively fig 2 the quaternary lacustrine sediment found in the downstream parts of the study area near the lake offshore is characterized by alluvial deposits which are more favorable for groundwater recharge bhutta et al 2005 in the adjacent watersheds water is used mainly for domestic purposes sometimes it is used to supplement the deficit irrigation in downstream parts of the landscape in the ribb watershed the water is required for recreation and fishing activities at the ribb reservoir the need for supplementary irrigation in lower parts of the landscape and domestic use in upper parts of the landscape is very high most of the irrigated areas are below the gauging stations in both the watersheds the land use of the study area is mainly dominated by cultivated agriculture with 64 67 coverage followed by grassland with 14 17 and the remaining 21 16 covered by shrubland bare land and water andualem and demeke 2019 2 2 hydrometeorological data analysis the long term time series records of meteorological parameters like rainfall temperature wind speed relative humidity and sunshine duration were considered for evaluating the hydrologic components shaw 1998 to evaluate the hydrologic cycle components of the study area time series meteorological data was collected from the amahara meteorology agency the streamflow data for the gumara and ribb rivers was collected from the ethiopian ministry of water irrigation and electricity for the period from 1996 2015 ten meteorology stations data which are found in and around guna tana landscape debre tabor woreta yifag adis zemen ebinat dera hamusit wanzaye mekane eyesus amed ber and gassay stations were collated during this study table 1 the meteorological data was used for the determination of the areal depth of rainfall evapotranspiration and recharge from rainfall relative humidity relative humidity has an inverse relationship with evaporation shaw 1988 the minimum and maximum relative humidity of the debre tabor station are 38 7 and 90 3 respectively the sunshine hour duration of the debre tabor station was collected from amhara national meteorology agency and the values ranged between 4 47 and 8 80 table 2 2 2 1 spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall the precipitation that reaches a particular area rarely produces a uniform depth of rainfall over the entire area the rainfall obtained from a single rain gauge station is point rainfall that might not represent the areal average depth of rainfall therefore an average areal rainfall is necessary for most hydrological problems the areal rainfall determination methods of arithmetic mean and theissen polygon methods were employed in this study the spatial and temporal rainfall variability of the study area is exhibited in figs 3 and 4 respectively the rainfall in the area is unimodal with annual rainfall varying between 1023 mm and 1588 mm fig 3 the area gets the maximum rainfall during july and august fig 4 arithmetic mean method it is one of the simplest methods of obtaining average areal rainfall by dividing the sum of rainfall recorded at all rain gauge stations by the number of stations shaw 1998 1 p a v p 1 p 2 p n n where pav is the areal depth of precipitation p1 p2 pn are rainfall records at stations 1 2 etc and n is the total number of stations in and around the landscape basin theissen polygon method this method considers the areal representation of each station and it is more accurate than the simple arithmetic mean method 2 p a v p 1 a 1 p 2 a 2 p n a n i 1 n a where p1 p2 pn are the mean annual rainfall recorded at each rainfall station and a1 a2 an are the polygonal areas around each gauging station enclosed in the catchment and a is the total area of the study area 2 2 2 determination of evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was used to quantify the loss of water from the land surface to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration there are different methods e g turc thornthwaite and fao penman monteith of estimating evapotranspiration turc utilized a formula to estimate annual actual evapotranspiration aet for catchment regions in humid or arid climates shaw 1998 whereas the thornthwaite approach relies on mean temperature data in this study the most widely used and appropriate fao penman monteith method was employed to calculate the amount of potential evapotranspiration bautista et al 2009 lang et al 2017 penman developed an equation for the estimation of evapotranspiration by combining the mass transfer method with energy balance from temperature sunshine relative humidity and wind speed records penman also considered aerodynamic and surface resistance factors for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration the surface resistance rsi is the resistance of vapor flow through stomata openings total leaf area and soil surface while aerodynamic resistance rai is the resistance of vegetation upward involving friction from the air flowing over the vegetative surface

ground might not fully infiltrate or contribute to the groundwater since some portions will evaporate transpire and runoff from the watershed the rainwater which has infiltrated fills the soil moisture deficiency and or percolate down to recharge the aquifer the evaluation of rainfall recharge was done by using different empirical relationships between recharge and rainfall developed for different regions having similar climates rainfall and temperature data table 3 in 1970 krishna rao developed an empirical relationship to determine the groundwater recharge in a limited climatological homogeneous area as eq 7 7 r k p x krishna rao has developed the following relationships for different levels of annual rainfall r 0 20 p 400 for areas with annual normal rainfall p between 400 and 600 mm r 0 25 p 400 for areas with p between 600 and 1000 mm r 0 35 p 600 for areas with p above 2000 mm where r and p are expressed in millimeters for this study area having an annual rainfall of 1399 8 mm the recharge equation was interpolated and used to be r 0 30 p 500 maxey and eakin 1949 also developed the empirical relationship between mean annual precipitation of the subbasin and recharge from precipitation by considering evapotranspiration surface water runoff and recharge coefficient values between 0 25 groundwater estimation committee norms groundwater recharge from rainfall was also estimated using the groundwater estimation committee norms in 1987 the groundwater estimation committee developed ad hoc norms of rainfall infiltration for determining the recharge from rainfall as described below i alluvial areas recharge could be taken as 20 25 of rainfall for sandy areas and 10 20 for areas with high clay content more than 40 clay ii semi consolidated sandstones 10 15 of rainfall is considered as recharge iii hard rock areas granitic terrain for weathered and fractured rocks 10 15 of rainfall unweathered 5 10 of rainfall basaltic terrain 10 15 of rainfall weathered basalt 4 10 of rainfall the recharge coefficient is defined as the ratio of recharge to effective rainfall which indicates the effective rainfall that contributes to groundwater aquifers and is expressed in percentage allocca et al 2014 muteraja 1986 as 8 r c o e f f r p e where rcoeff is the recharge coefficient r is recharge and pe is effective rainfall 2 3 2 computation of recharge from streamflow the study area includes gauged and ungauged parts of the watershed around 63 95 of the landscape is gauged and 36 05 is ungauged table 4 the recharge which could be estimated from streamflow records was determined using different baseflow separation techniques hydrograph analysis was used to separate the streamflow records into baseflow and direct runoff which is essential for the estimation of recharge rates sloto et al 1991 gunduz 2006 a digital filter method using web based hydrograph analysis tool what the digital filter method is used in signal analysis and processing to separate high frequency signals from low frequency signals eckhardt 2005 filtering of the direct runoff from the baseflow is similar to signal analysis and processing by using eq 9 arnold et al 2000 9 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where qt is the filtered direct runoff at the t time step m3 s qt 1 is the filtered direct runoff at the t 1 time step m3 s α is the filter parameter qt is the total streamflow at the t time step m3 s and qt 1 is the total streamflow at the t 1 time step m3 s b part this program used time series records of streamflow to determine the daily record of groundwater discharge by separating the streamflow record knisel and sheridan 1983 and shirmohammadi et al 1984 described how the daily records of streamflow and linear interpolation are used to evaluate groundwater discharge in part a 2n 1 days interval block was created to examine each day in the interval to determine the hydrograph s lowest discharge the blocks were then rearranged the next day and the procedure was repeated if the requirements were met for the day a straight line was drawn connecting the neighboring local minima defining the baseflow hydrograph c recess this program determines the master recession curve of streamflow recession during times when all flow can be considered to be groundwater discharge and when the profile of the groundwater head distribution is nearly stable meyboom 1961 expressed the potential groundwater discharge based on the relationship between the logarithm of groundwater discharge and time 10 v d q d k 2 3026 where vd is total potential ground water discharge l3 and qd is ground water discharge at an initial time l3 t d rora this program used the recession curve displacement method to estimate the groundwater recharge for each peak instream flow in units of specific discharge inches per year rorabaugh 1964 daniel 1976 before a critical time this equation is used d q c d t 11 where dq is the difference between the ground water discharge and the groundwater discharge that would have occurred at the same time in the absence of the recharge event l3 t c is a constant the value of which is dependent on the magnitude of the recharge event l3 t0 5 and dt is the time since the recharge event t after the critical time the linear extrapolation could be q d q e 10 d t k 12 where qd is the groundwater discharge extrapolated to a time after critical time l3 t qe is the groundwater discharge extrapolated to a critical time after the peak from eq 12 and superposition l3 t and dt is the period from critical time to the day of interest t glover 1964 and rorabaugh 1964 also showed that the total potential groundwater discharge to the stream at a critical time after a peak instream flow is equal to about half of the total volume of water that recharged the groundwater system during the peak r 2 q 2 q 1 k 2 3026 13 where r is the total volume of recharge due to the event l3 q1 is the groundwater discharge at a critical time as extrapolated from the pre event streamflow recession l3 t and q2 is groundwater discharge at a critical time as extrapolated from the post event streamflow recession l3 t 3 results and discussion 3 1 areal depth of precipitation the rainfall stations used in this study are non uniformly distributed with different topographic variations the precipitation amounts among the gauging stations have significant variability table 5 the arithmetic average annual precipitation of the stations within the landscape was 1373 3 mm for the period 1996 2015 accordingly the average annual precipitation of the study area using the theisen polygon method was estimated to be 1399 8 mm table 5 the average annual precipitation estimated using arithmetic and theisen polygon methods gave relatively similar results even though the average annual rainfall for the guna tana landscape was computed at 1399 8 mm it varies between the ribb and gumara watersheds fig 3 hence the computed annual areal rainfall for the two watersheds gumara and ribb was 1479 44 mm and 1346 06 mm respectively thus a variation in rainfall leads to a recharge difference between two watersheds 3 2 evapotranspiration the reference evapotranspiration computed using the most typically used fao penman monteith method was found to be 1300 21 mm about 93 of the precipitation for the period 1996 2015 table 6 evapotranspiration findings showed that there can be a large potential quantity of rainfall that has been lost in the atmosphere due to evaporation and transpiration and does not contribute to groundwater recharge table 6 the recharge potential is therefore low due to the high potential evapotranspiration portela et al 2019 since fao penman monteith computes only the reference evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration might be less than this value asmerom 2008 also used the penman monteith method and found similar results for evapotranspiration from the lake tana basin with a value of 1344 mm yr 1 of water 3 3 groundwater recharge 3 3 1 recharge from rainfall the amount of recharge for the study area using the groundwater estimation committee method revealed that 197 23 mm of rainfall has the potential to contribute to the aquifer storage table 7 the groundwater committee method gave slightly smaller results of recharge as compared to the other empirical methods of recharge estimation from rainfall table 9 according to the groundwater estimation committee the recharge from rainfall depends upon the characteristics and types of rock in the landscape groundwater estimation committee 1997 the bulk of the catchment which is characterized by quaternary lacustrine sediments and debre tabor basalts has the largest potential for groundwater recharge due to it s area and percentage recharge potential table 7 and fig 2 the quaternary lacustrine sediment type of lithology has good postulated groundwater holding and recharge capacity the two watersheds recharge from rainfall was also computed using the groundwater estimation committee method separately it has been estimated that the ribb and gumara watersheds have a groundwater recharge potential of 204 76 mm and 184 83 mm respectively table 8 the result indicated that there is a slight variation due to the presence of more quaternary lacustrine sediments in the downstream parts of the ribb watershed than in gumara the different empirical equations used to estimate groundwater recharge resulted in almost similar and comparable values table 9 in the guna tana landscape the average annual recharge from rainfall was estimated to be about 253 70 mm which has the potential to contribute to the aquifer hence for the guna tana landscape the recharge coefficient from rainfall recharge was found to be 0 18 which revealed that about 18 of the rainfall has the potential to recharge the groundwater aquifers 3 3 2 recharge from streamflow the relationship between surface and groundwater was determined by separating the baseflow from surface runoff using part recess rora and what methods the mean streamflow and baseflow for the two rivers separated using the part program table 10 indicated that the baseflow was 561 59 mm yr 1 and 119 13 mm yr 1 respectively for the gumara and ribb rivers even though the ribb dam was upstream 500 m of the gauge the data used for recharge computation is considered prior to the construction of the dam asmerom 2008 compared the baseflow using eckhardt and found that the ribb watershed baseflow is significantly lower than gumara watershed with values of 52 5 mcm yr 1 and 142 59 mcm yr 1 respectively dessie et al 2014 found that the runoff contribution from the ribb river to lake tana is minimal the baseflow determined using the what recursive digital filter method also showed that there was an annual baseflow of 84 3 m3 s and 15 75 m3 s for the gumara and ribb watersheds respectively table 11 and fig 5 where kmin kmed and kmax are the minimum median and maximum recession indexes respectively among segments selected logqmn and logqmx are the minima and maximum values of the log of the streamflow and a b and c are the coefficients of the master recession index the recession index k was determined for each watershed before recharge could be estimated by the recession curve displacement method with the rora program k is the time in days required for groundwater discharge to decline by one log cycle after the recession curve becomes nearly linear on a semi log hydrograph k is determined by the construction of a master recession curve representing streamflow during periods when most or all flow is contributed by groundwater discharge rutledge 1998 table 12 the recharge determined from streamflow records using the rora method indicated that there was 142 14 mm yr 1 and 664 08 mm yr 1 for the upper ribb and gumara watersheds respectively table 13 the recharge estimated using rora gave a comparable result to part with 119 13 mm yr 1 and 561 59 mm yr 1 respectively for the upper ribb and gumara watersheds this indicates that there is a high amount of groundwater that could be used for different groundwater development practices the base flow for the ribb watershed showed a minimal result as compared to the gumara watershed this can be attributed to the differential measurements of the recorded flow the measurements of flow for the ribb watershed were only for 40 of the upper watershed with the remaining downstream parts of the watershed not being represented by the recorded flow the recharge potential estimated using rainfall and streamflow records contradicts since the ribb streamflow measurement was recorded prior to the postulated potential lithology the streamflow gauge is upstream and therefore does not include quaternary lacustrine sediment formation lithology besides there was a considerable precipitation and evapotranspiration difference between the two watersheds dessie et al 2014 stated this might be due to high evapotranspiration and or the discharge of groundwater that is not captured by the gauge measurements as it discharges downstream of the gauges 4 conclusions groundwater recharge can be computed using different methods and models depending on the availability of data the magnitude of groundwater recharge potential could be estimated using different techniques different empirical formulas were used to estimate the areal precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge quantities the areal precipitation of the study area was used for the estimation of the groundwater recharge using the water balance method and the groundwater estimation committee method the recharge estimated from streamflow was determined by separating the baseflow using different methods in the guna tana landscape ribb and gumara watersheds the annual rainfall was 1399 82 mm with the direct runoff and groundwater recharge estimated values of 1159 35 mm and 240 47 mm respectively even though there was a high amount of rain a large amount evaporated and transpired from the land surface and vegetation the recharge estimated from streamflow records indicated that there was a total of 806 22 mm yr 1 and 680 72 mm yr 1 using rora and part methods respectively the recharge coefficient derived from rainfall and streamflow data was found to be 0 18 and 0 20 respectively this implied that around 20 of the rainfall could be considered as a potential groundwater recharge amount the study results indicated that the groundwater recharge estimation either from rainfall or streamflow data is almost the same this showed that in data scarce areas streamflow and rainfall data could be used for groundwater recharge estimation in data scarce areas empirical equations might be good to estimate the recharge magnitude from rainfall and streamflow records for further groundwater development projects initiation and implementation therefore groundwater development projects could be developed to emphasize the development of the study area and the country as a whole this would increase the positive socio economic value of water and reduce water security problems people in this research region would profit from groundwater by exploring it through shallow and groundwater wells that may be utilized for residential and irrigation purposes the researchers also propose that before implementing groundwater projects the real groundwater recharge be estimated using water balance and other direct measurement methods declaration of competing

respectively the sunshine hour duration of the debre tabor station was collected from amhara national meteorology agency and the values ranged between 4 47 and 8 80 table 2 2 2 1 spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall the precipitation that reaches a particular area rarely produces a uniform depth of rainfall over the entire area the rainfall obtained from a single rain gauge station is point rainfall that might not represent the areal average depth of rainfall therefore an average areal rainfall is necessary for most hydrological problems the areal rainfall determination methods of arithmetic mean and theissen polygon methods were employed in this study the spatial and temporal rainfall variability of the study area is exhibited in figs 3 and 4 respectively the rainfall in the area is unimodal with annual rainfall varying between 1023 mm and 1588 mm fig 3 the area gets the maximum rainfall during july and august fig 4 arithmetic mean method it is one of the simplest methods of obtaining average areal rainfall by dividing the sum of rainfall recorded at all rain gauge stations by the number of stations shaw 1998 1 p a v p 1 p 2 p n n where pav is the areal depth of precipitation p1 p2 pn are rainfall records at stations 1 2 etc and n is the total number of stations in and around the landscape basin theissen polygon method this method considers the areal representation of each station and it is more accurate than the simple arithmetic mean method 2 p a v p 1 a 1 p 2 a 2 p n a n i 1 n a where p1 p2 pn are the mean annual rainfall recorded at each rainfall station and a1 a2 an are the polygonal areas around each gauging station enclosed in the catchment and a is the total area of the study area 2 2 2 determination of evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was used to quantify the loss of water from the land surface to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration there are different methods e g turc thornthwaite and fao penman monteith of estimating evapotranspiration turc utilized a formula to estimate annual actual evapotranspiration aet for catchment regions in humid or arid climates shaw 1998 whereas the thornthwaite approach relies on mean temperature data in this study the most widely used and appropriate fao penman monteith method was employed to calculate the amount of potential evapotranspiration bautista et al 2009 lang et al 2017 penman developed an equation for the estimation of evapotranspiration by combining the mass transfer method with energy balance from temperature sunshine relative humidity and wind speed records penman also considered aerodynamic and surface resistance factors for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration the surface resistance rsi is the resistance of vapor flow through stomata openings total leaf area and soil surface while aerodynamic resistance rai is the resistance of vegetation upward involving friction from the air flowing over the vegetative surface

ground might not fully infiltrate or contribute to the groundwater since some portions will evaporate transpire and runoff from the watershed the rainwater which has infiltrated fills the soil moisture deficiency and or percolate down to recharge the aquifer the evaluation of rainfall recharge was done by using different empirical relationships between recharge and rainfall developed for different regions having similar climates rainfall and temperature data table 3 in 1970 krishna rao developed an empirical relationship to determine the groundwater recharge in a limited climatological homogeneous area as eq 7 7 r k p x krishna rao has developed the following relationships for different levels of annual rainfall r 0 20 p 400 for areas with annual normal rainfall p between 400 and 600 mm r 0 25 p 400 for areas with p between 600 and 1000 mm r 0 35 p 600 for areas with p above 2000 mm where r and p are expressed in millimeters for this study area having an annual rainfall of 1399 8 mm the recharge equation was interpolated and used to be r 0 30 p 500 maxey and eakin 1949 also developed the empirical relationship between mean annual precipitation of the subbasin and recharge from precipitation by considering evapotranspiration surface water runoff and recharge coefficient values between 0 25 groundwater estimation committee norms groundwater recharge from rainfall was also estimated using the groundwater estimation committee norms in 1987 the groundwater estimation committee developed ad hoc norms of rainfall infiltration for determining the recharge from rainfall as described below i alluvial areas recharge could be taken as 20 25 of rainfall for sandy areas and 10 20 for areas with high clay content more than 40 clay ii semi consolidated sandstones 10 15 of rainfall is considered as recharge iii hard rock areas granitic terrain for weathered and fractured rocks 10 15 of rainfall unweathered 5 10 of rainfall basaltic terrain 10 15 of rainfall weathered basalt 4 10 of rainfall the recharge coefficient is defined as the ratio of recharge to effective rainfall which indicates the effective rainfall that contributes to groundwater aquifers and is expressed in percentage allocca et al 2014 muteraja 1986 as 8 r c o e f f r p e where rcoeff is the recharge coefficient r is recharge and pe is effective rainfall 2 3 2 computation of recharge from streamflow the study area includes gauged and ungauged parts of the watershed around 63 95 of the landscape is gauged and 36 05 is ungauged table 4 the recharge which could be estimated from streamflow records was determined using different baseflow separation techniques hydrograph analysis was used to separate the streamflow records into baseflow and direct runoff which is essential for the estimation of recharge rates sloto et al 1991 gunduz 2006 a digital filter method using web based hydrograph analysis tool what the digital filter method is used in signal analysis and processing to separate high frequency signals from low frequency signals eckhardt 2005 filtering of the direct runoff from the baseflow is similar to signal analysis and processing by using eq 9 arnold et al 2000 9 q t α q t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 where qt is the filtered direct runoff at the t time step m3 s qt 1 is the filtered direct runoff at the t 1 time step m3 s α is the filter parameter qt is the total streamflow at the t time step m3 s and qt 1 is the total streamflow at the t 1 time step m3 s b part this program used time series records of streamflow to determine the daily record of groundwater discharge by separating the streamflow record knisel and sheridan 1983 and shirmohammadi et al 1984 described how the daily records of streamflow and linear interpolation are used to evaluate groundwater discharge in part a 2n 1 days interval block was created to examine each day in the interval to determine the hydrograph s lowest discharge the blocks were then rearranged the next day and the procedure was repeated if the requirements were met for the day a straight line was drawn connecting the neighboring local minima defining the baseflow hydrograph c recess this program determines the master recession curve of streamflow recession during times when all flow can be considered to be groundwater discharge and when the profile of the groundwater head distribution is nearly stable meyboom 1961 expressed the potential groundwater discharge based on the relationship between the logarithm of groundwater discharge and time 10 v d q d k 2 3026 where vd is total potential ground water discharge l3 and qd is ground water discharge at an initial time l3 t d rora this program used the recession curve displacement method to estimate the groundwater recharge for each peak instream flow in units of specific discharge inches per year rorabaugh 1964 daniel 1976 before a critical time this equation is used d q c d t 11 where dq is the difference between the ground water discharge and the groundwater discharge that would have occurred at the same time in the absence of the recharge event l3 t c is a constant the value of which is dependent on the magnitude of the recharge event l3 t0 5 and dt is the time since the recharge event t after the critical time the linear extrapolation could be q d q e 10 d t k 12 where qd is the groundwater discharge extrapolated to a time after critical time l3 t qe is the groundwater discharge extrapolated to a critical time after the peak from eq 12 and superposition l3 t and dt is the period from critical time to the day of interest t glover 1964 and rorabaugh 1964 also showed that the total potential groundwater discharge to the stream at a critical time after a peak instream flow is equal to about half of the total volume of water that recharged the groundwater system during the peak r 2 q 2 q 1 k 2 3026 13 where r is the total volume of recharge due to the event l3 q1 is the groundwater discharge at a critical time as extrapolated from the pre event streamflow recession l3 t and q2 is groundwater discharge at a critical time as extrapolated from the post event streamflow recession l3 t 3 results and discussion 3 1 areal depth of precipitation the rainfall stations used in this study are non uniformly distributed with different topographic variations the precipitation amounts among the gauging stations have significant variability table 5 the arithmetic average annual precipitation of the stations within the landscape was 1373 3 mm for the period 1996 2015 accordingly the average annual precipitation of the study area using the theisen polygon method was estimated to be 1399 8 mm table 5 the average annual precipitation estimated using arithmetic and theisen polygon methods gave relatively similar results even though the average annual rainfall for the guna tana landscape was computed at 1399 8 mm it varies between the ribb and gumara watersheds fig 3 hence the computed annual areal rainfall for the two watersheds gumara and ribb was 1479 44 mm and 1346 06 mm respectively thus a variation in rainfall leads to a recharge difference between two watersheds 3 2 evapotranspiration the reference evapotranspiration computed using the most typically used fao penman monteith method was found to be 1300 21 mm about 93 of the precipitation for the period 1996 2015 table 6 evapotranspiration findings showed that there can be a large potential quantity of rainfall that has been lost in the atmosphere due to evaporation and transpiration and does not contribute to groundwater recharge table 6 the recharge potential is therefore low due to the high potential evapotranspiration portela et al 2019 since fao penman monteith computes only the reference evapotranspiration the actual evapotranspiration might be less than this value asmerom 2008 also used the penman monteith method and found similar results for evapotranspiration from the lake tana basin with a value of 1344 mm yr 1 of water 3 3 groundwater recharge 3 3 1 recharge from rainfall the amount of recharge for the study area using the groundwater estimation committee method revealed that 197 23 mm of rainfall has the potential to contribute to the aquifer storage table 7 the groundwater committee method gave slightly smaller results of recharge as compared to the other empirical methods of recharge estimation from rainfall table 9 according to the groundwater estimation committee the recharge from rainfall depends upon the characteristics and types of rock in the landscape groundwater estimation committee 1997 the bulk of the catchment which is characterized by quaternary lacustrine sediments and debre tabor basalts has the largest potential for groundwater recharge due to it s area and percentage recharge potential table 7 and fig 2 the quaternary lacustrine sediment type of lithology has good postulated groundwater holding and recharge capacity the two watersheds recharge from rainfall was also computed using the groundwater estimation committee method separately it has been estimated that the ribb and gumara watersheds have a groundwater recharge potential of 204 76 mm and 184 83 mm respectively table 8 the result indicated that there is a slight variation due to the presence of more quaternary lacustrine sediments in the downstream parts of the ribb watershed than in gumara the different empirical equations used to estimate groundwater recharge resulted in almost similar and comparable values table 9 in the guna tana landscape the average annual recharge from rainfall was estimated to be about 253 70 mm which has the potential to contribute to the aquifer hence for the guna tana landscape the recharge coefficient from rainfall recharge was found to be 0 18 which revealed that about 18 of the rainfall has the potential to recharge the groundwater aquifers 3 3 2 recharge from streamflow the relationship between surface and groundwater was determined by separating the baseflow from surface runoff using part recess rora and what methods the mean streamflow and baseflow for the two rivers separated using the part program table 10 indicated that the baseflow was 561 59 mm yr 1 and 119 13 mm yr 1 respectively for the gumara and ribb rivers even though the ribb dam was upstream 500 m of the gauge the data used for recharge computation is considered prior to the construction of the dam asmerom 2008 compared the baseflow using eckhardt and found that the ribb watershed baseflow is significantly lower than gumara watershed with values of 52 5 mcm yr 1 and 142 59 mcm yr 1 respectively dessie et al 2014 found that the runoff contribution from the ribb river to lake tana is minimal the baseflow determined using the what recursive digital filter method also showed that there was an annual baseflow of 84 3 m3 s and 15 75 m3 s for the gumara and ribb watersheds respectively table 11 and fig 5 where kmin kmed and kmax are the minimum median and maximum recession indexes respectively among segments selected logqmn and logqmx are the minima and maximum values of the log of the streamflow and a b and c are the coefficients of the master recession index the recession index k was determined for each watershed before recharge could be estimated by the recession curve displacement method with the rora program k is the time in days required for groundwater discharge to decline by one log cycle after the recession curve becomes nearly linear on a semi log hydrograph k is determined by the construction of a master recession curve representing streamflow during periods when most or all flow is contributed by groundwater discharge rutledge 1998 table 12 the recharge determined from streamflow records using the rora method indicated that there was 142 14 mm yr 1 and 664 08 mm yr 1 for the upper ribb and gumara watersheds respectively table 13 the recharge estimated using rora gave a comparable result to part with 119 13 mm yr 1 and 561 59 mm yr 1 respectively for the upper ribb and gumara watersheds this indicates that there is a high amount of groundwater that could be used for different groundwater development practices the base flow for the ribb watershed showed a minimal result as compared to the gumara watershed this can be attributed to the differential measurements of the recorded flow the measurements of flow for the ribb watershed were only for 40 of the upper watershed with the remaining downstream parts of the watershed not being represented by the recorded flow the recharge potential estimated using rainfall and streamflow records contradicts since the ribb streamflow measurement was recorded prior to the postulated potential lithology the streamflow gauge is upstream and therefore does not include quaternary lacustrine sediment formation lithology besides there was a considerable precipitation and evapotranspiration difference between the two watersheds dessie et al 2014 stated this might be due to high evapotranspiration and or the discharge of groundwater that is not captured by the gauge measurements as it discharges downstream of the gauges 4 conclusions groundwater recharge can be computed using different methods and models depending on the availability of data the magnitude of groundwater recharge potential could be estimated using different techniques different empirical formulas were used to estimate the areal precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge quantities the areal precipitation of the study area was used for the estimation of the groundwater recharge using the water balance method and the groundwater estimation committee method the recharge estimated from streamflow was determined by separating the baseflow using different methods in the guna tana landscape ribb and gumara watersheds the annual rainfall was 1399 82 mm with the direct runoff and groundwater recharge estimated values of 1159 35 mm and 240 47 mm respectively even though there was a high amount of rain a large amount evaporated and transpired from the land surface and vegetation the recharge estimated from streamflow records indicated that there was a total of 806 22 mm yr 1 and 680 72 mm yr 1 using rora and part methods respectively the recharge coefficient derived from rainfall and streamflow data was found to be 0 18 and 0 20 respectively this implied that around 20 of the rainfall could be considered as a potential groundwater recharge amount the study results indicated that the groundwater recharge estimation either from rainfall or streamflow data is almost the same this showed that in data scarce areas streamflow and rainfall data could be used for groundwater recharge estimation in data scarce areas empirical equations might be good to estimate the recharge magnitude from rainfall and streamflow records for further groundwater development projects initiation and implementation therefore groundwater development projects could be developed to emphasize the development of the study area and the country as a whole this would increase the positive socio economic value of water and reduce water security problems people in this research region would profit from groundwater by exploring it through shallow and groundwater wells that may be utilized for residential and irrigation purposes the researchers also propose that before implementing groundwater projects the real groundwater recharge be estimated using water balance and other direct measurement methods declaration of competing

8166,study region upper region of the citarum basin in indonesia study focus assessing water balance components in data scarce regions using different approaches could result in different outcomes in the upper reaches of the citarum river in west java indonesia for example many previous studies found the groundwater storage to be depleting while grace identifies a contrasting trend of increasing groundwater storage change therefore in this study we aim to improve the accuracy of water balance components estimates in the upper citarum basin firstly we estimate groundwater abstraction volumes based on population size and a review of literature estimates of the other water balance components namely the rainfall actual evaporation discharge and groundwater storage change are derived from various global datasets and available measurements we also use a distributed hydrological model wflow sbm to yield additional estimates of discharge and actual evaporation we compare each basin water balance estimate and quantify the uncertainty of some components using the extended triple collocation etc method new hydrological insights for the region etc application on four different rainfall estimates suggests a preference of using chirps product in the study area as it delivers r 2 of 0 56 and rmse of 6 52 mm day compared to estimates from rainfall station r 2 0 39 rmse 8 57 mm day saca d r 2 0 29 rmse 10 46 mm day and trmm r 2 0 56 rmse 8 61 mm day with chirps rainfall forcing wflow sbm model estimates of average daily actual evaporation and discharge are obtained the results for actual evaporation 2 67 mm day are plausible with a narrow difference of less than 0 50 mm day among other estimates the simulated discharge results in a daily average of 5 38 mm day estimated between observation data 3 65 mm day and glofas era5 product 6 12 mm day combining precipitation actual evaporation and discharge with a groundwater abstraction estimate of 0 57 mm day the wflow sbm based groundwater storage change is estimated at a daily storage depletion of 0 82 mm day using gleam actual evaporation estimates 3 13 mm day and observed daily discharge on the other hand results in surplus water of 0 45 mm day for groundwater storage change these results demonstrate the high uncertainty in capturing subsurface hydrological processes although the groundwater storage change estimates are found close to the estimates based upon grace gravimetric satellite data of 0 25 mm day with a variance of 1 57 mm day to aid in estimating current and future basin scale groundwater level changes to support operational water management and policy in the citarum basin considering the massive groundwater abstraction a focus on subsurface hydrological components quantification is of great importance for future research keywords water balance components estimate wflow sbm model extended triple collocation groundwater storage change estimate data scarce region upper citarum basin 1 introduction groundwater has been used for water supply purposes since prehistorical ages angelakis et al 2016 voudouris et al 2018 since then its exertion has developed from fulfilling life basic needs to meeting various demands from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors however groundwater resources are increasingly over exploited globally de graaf et al 2016 from central asia chatterjee et al 2018 hu et al 2019 the middle east al zyoud et al 2015 south europe closas et al 2017 africa khezzani and bouchemal 2018 mokadem et al 2018 to central america ochoa gonzález et al 2018 groundwater over abstraction leads to dwindling groundwater tables and often to deteriorating water quality and in many ways threats the security of water resources on a scale of the water cycle as a whole when the regulatory role of groundwater flow to other hydrological fluxes is considered chambel 2015 it also leads to many other problems such as land subsidence shen and xu 2011 figueroa miranda et al 2018 saltwater intrusion kim and yang 2018 mabrouk et al 2018 and surface water level decrease lin et al 2018 wu et al 2018 groundwater table fluctuation generally influences other water balance internal processes for example changes in groundwater recharge discharge pattern affect surface water system earman and dettinger 2011 groundwater flow pattern pétré et al 2019 runoff generation process abe et al 2020 and rate of evapotranspiration lurtz et al 2020 more consequences unavoidably occur once more factors are involved such as groundwater quality anthropogenic influence zhu et al 2019 lin et al 2020 climate change zhu et al 2020 and land cover and land use lulc development lamichhane and shakya 2019 shawul et al 2019 additionally interactions among hydrological cycle groundwater resources and human interference are also mutually influential as changes in water balance internal processes have a chain reaction effect in increasing groundwater abstraction from both unconfined and confined aquifers ali et al 2012 change in precipitation pattern has been found to have a strong relationship with groundwater abstraction volume too asoka et al 2017 it is clearly shown that groundwater is very closely connected with basin water cycle processes although it flows on a spatially and temporally different scale unfortunately in determining water balance components with good accuracy the required hydrological and hydrogeological information is often unavailable particularly in developing countries the usage of global open source datasets as well as remote sensing techniques rodell et al 2009 vorobevskii et al 2020 statistical downscaling method haberlandt et al 2014 pomee et al 2020 and similarity based regionalization techniques jafarzadegan et al 2020 are just a few examples of how the challenge of data scarcity can be met however water balance estimates determined using freely available often open source tools should be accompanied by an awareness of each method s uncertainties assumptions and embedded errors the upper citarum basin located in west java indonesia is an example of a region that is data scarce as well as highly groundwater dependent at least 50 million cubic meters of groundwater was estimated to be abstracted in 1990 and it grows to 300 million cubic meters in 2006 tirtomihardjo 2016 added to this fact other studies also indicate groundwater storage depletion in the basin gumilar et al 2015 such a massive volume and impact of groundwater abstraction unfortunately is not well managed and monitored groundwater abstraction data are hardly available accessible and reliable for public information based on rainfall stations measurement the average daily rainfall in the upper citarum basin between 2005 and 2015 is of 5 40 mm day 1971 77 mm year with a variance of 7 03 mm day 617 91 mm year meanwhile according to era5 reanalysis products hersbach et al 2020 the average daily actual evaporation is estimated at 2 82 mm day 1028 88 mm year with a variance of 0 55 mm day 36 03 mm year the remaining water from the precipitation and the actual evaporation estimates suggests a lower average potential daily inflow of 2 58 mm day compared to the observed average daily outflow of 3 65 mm day barring more water is still lost due to groundwater abstraction however this seems to be in contrast with the gravity recovery and climatic experiment grace estimate of total water storage that shows increasing terrestrial water storage in the last 15 years the absence of reliable hydrology and hydrogeology data makes it difficult to accurately capture the hydrological behavior of the upper citarum basin and verify the true status of the groundwater storage change it further stipulates the importance of more comprehensive and accurate estimates of the water balance components in the study area which is deeply discussed in this paper therefore the primary focus of this research is to provide improved estimates of the water balance components in a groundwater dependent and data scarce region of the upper citarum basin in particular the rainfall actual evaporation discharge groundwater abstraction and groundwater storage change each component is based not only on ground measurement but also various approaches and sources open source global datasets remote sensing based estimates and hydrological simulation using wflow sbm model schellekens et al 2020 uncertainty bounds of each water balance component are also quantified more importantly to appraise the accuracy of each estimate using the extended triple collocation etc method mccoll et al 2014 structure wise this paper is set up as follows the study area is described in section 2 section 3 explains the material methods and experimental setup the results are described in section 4 and are discussed in section 5 finally the conclusion is available in section 6 2 study area 2 1 the upper citarum basin the study area is the upper citarum basin located in the west java province indonesia fig 1 estimated from multi error removed improved terrain digital elevation model merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 its total area extends over 1823 km 2 administratively it covers large parts of two cities bandung and cimahi and three other smaller regencies of bandung west bandung and sumedang according to the west java central bureau of statistics the upper citarum basin is populated by no less than 9 6 million people in 2017 it is geographically located between 6 43 s 107 22 e and 7 15 s 107 57 e with its outlet at 6 56 s 107 30 e topographically the upper citarum basin is situated in varying elevated terrains surrounded by mountainous areas around the basin periphery with the highest elevation of 2500 m above sea level asl and basin outlet elevation at 640 m asl fig 1 also shows the topographical distribution of the upper citarum basin with a vast and relatively flat landscape distributed primarily in the middle part of the basin looking from land use and land cover lulc perspectives these territories are the primary location where cities and industries have been developing rapid urbanization is the major driving force behind such growth degrading the watershed impacting basin water quality agaton et al 2016 and increasing basin susceptibility to flooding occurrences siregar 2018 2 2 hydrology and climate situation there are 11 rainfall stations spatially distributed within and around the upper citarum basin see fig 1 based on these rainfall stations data between 2005 and 2015 which are provided by the national meteorology climatology and geophysical agency bmkg the average annual rainfall in the upper citarum basin interpolated using the thiessen polygon method is 1971 mm these measurements however involve huge uncertainties and errors as there exist notable periods when potentially missing data were not properly gauged this issue is comprehensively discussed in a later section the rainfall seasonal pattern is divided into dry and rainy seasons occurred annually from april to september and october to march respectively as the upper citarum basin is located in a tropical region rainfall is dominantly the only source of precipitation throughout the year the upper citarum basin is the upstream part of a bigger watershed system the citarum river basin whose outlet flows to the java sea three cascading dams are constructed along the main river saguling cirata and jatiluhur dam saguling reservoir being the most upstream among the three is located at the downstream section of a discharge measurement station named nanjung see fig 1 pinpointed as the upper citarum basin outlet the discharge in nanjung station is monitored using an automatic water level recorder awlr the streamflow data are made available by the indonesia research center for water resources pusair between 2005 and 2018 the minimum and maximum recorded daily discharge in nanjung station are 4 08 and 469 29 m 3 s respectively with an average of 73 86 m 3 s peak flows are frequently found with events of daily discharge surpassing 450 m 3 s approximately the 95th percentile occurred 6 times during the mentioned period the climate in the upper citarum basin is of a tropical monsoon climate with relatively constant temperatures throughout the year according to bmkg climatology data between 2005 and 2014 the mean annual temperature in the basin is 23 4 c with a very narrow range of average monthly temperatures between 22 5 and 24 8 c spatially the temperature is more varied with an average of 15 3 c around the mountainous area surrounding the basin periphery similar to other typical tropical climate regions the upper citarum basin has high potential evapotranspiration estimated at 1560 mm annually siswanto and francés 2019 2 3 groundwater abstraction hydrogeologically the upper citarum basin subsurface consists of layer cake type aquifers with cibeureum formation as its main aquifer interspersed by kosambi formation as a spatially distributed aquitard hutasoit 2009 fig 2 shows the typical north south hydrogeological cross section of the upper citarum basin groundwater over exploitation has been long known as a threatening problem in the basin gumilar et al 2015 tirtomihardjo 2016 with the domestic sector pumping from shallow aquifers and the industrial sector from deep aquifers the current groundwater abstraction rate has set off various consequences such as notable land subsidence of 8 cm year on average abidin et al 2012 and even up to 2 meters in several industrial zones gumilar et al 2015 there is no monitoring initiative unfortunately for the domestic groundwater abstraction according to the local regulation it is entirely legal to pump shallow groundwater to supply household needs in this study domestic groundwater abstraction volume is therefore estimated from population number data courtesy of the west java central bureau of statistics report in 2017 population growth estimate tarigan et al 2016 average daily water consumption per person and water supply coverage from municipal drinking water company pdam moersidik et al 2015 see table 1 between 2005 and 2018 the average domestic groundwater abstraction volume is estimated at 122 million m 3 per annum equivalent to 0 18 mm day regarding the industrial sector demand bandung city regulation includes theoretically strict rules in abstracting groundwater from deeper aquifers unfortunately law enforcement for water related regulations in indonesia is extremely weak braadbaart and braadbaart 1997 listiyani and said 2018 office of mineral and energy resources esdm of west java province concerning groundwater institutional management is the responsible organization to derive implement and evaluate policies related to the use of groundwater especially those abstracted by the industrial sector currently groundwater abstraction volumes from registered deep wells of the industrial sector are known to be partly monitored by esdm since 2017 and are accessible upon request for research purposes such figures were more of an unknown quantity to public pre 2017 in 2017 there are 377 deep wells operated by industries with total annual groundwater abstraction volumes of 6 8 million m 3 reported to esdm within the upper citarum basin such numbers are believed to be significantly higher in reality tirtomihardjo 2016 calculated the sum of the reported groundwater abstraction volumes by industrial sector and found it to be already at a rate of 47 6 million m 3 in 2008 further taufiq et al 2017 using a simplified groundwater model estimated the actual industries groundwater abstraction between 2010 and 2015 to be 14 times higher than the volumes reported to local government fig 3 a positive point from fig 3 is that in the last 15 years industrial groundwater abstraction has been decreasing agreed by the increasing groundwater storage change estimated from gravimetric satellite data of grace although as it has been mentioned above it is in contrast with the result of previous studies gumilar et al 2015 tirtomihardjo 2016 from field observation and direct interviews with site officers the annual industry driven groundwater pumping values in this study is estimated at 255 million m 3 equivalent to 0 38 mm day in summary the upper citarum basin is a highly groundwater dependent region as the majority of its water demand is fulfilled by abstracting water from the sub surface from the above description of domestic and industrial demand approximately 370 million m 3 of groundwater equivalent to 0 57 mm day is believed to be abstracted annually with such a massive abstraction volume it is hypothesized that groundwater abstraction has a significant influence on other components of the basin water cycle and possibly impacts its total water storage negatively 3 methodology 3 1 data sources and availability the upper citarum basin is a data scarce region with limited information and access to local observations and measurements therefore we explore various sources of literature site survey and global datasets a major portion of secondary data is provided by government organizations previously mentioned esdm bmkg and pusair several numbers of available global datasets are taken into account to provide additional information on unmeasured water budget variables and to validate the uncertainty of each estimate in summary table 2 lists the major data sources used in this study there are four sources of rainfall data considered in this study the first two rainfall datasets bmkg and saca d are sourced and derived from rainfall station based measurements bmkg rainfall station data are available from eleven stations shown in fig 1 saca d van den besselaar et al 2017 are interpolated gauge based precipitation products applied in the south east asia region by using an optimum interpolation method hofstra et al 2008 implemented in european climate assessment and dataset eca d project haylock et al 2008 the other two data sources are satellite based data trmm3b43 further referred to as trmm and chirps funk et al 2015 both are gauge based corrected estimates trmm data have been widely used in indonesia prasetia et al 2012 as syakur et al 2013 as well as chirps setiawan et al 2017 narulita and ningrum 2018 additionally both datasets were also found superior to drive hydrological model of swat to produce satisfying simulation results even when compared with rain gauge data luo et al 2019 there are three sources of daily actual evaporation data gleamv3 3a further referred to as gleam miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 era5 hersbach et al 2020 and wflow sbm model simulation results particularly for indonesia gleam estimates have been tested and deliver good performance in the western part of the java island wati et al 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 era5 data meanwhile is available in a finer spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 wflow sbm model calculates daily actual evaporation using the potential evaporation estimated based on downscaled era5 temperature radiation and surface pressure a method suggested by de bruin et al 2016 observed daily discharge data are provided by pusair additionally two more discharge estimates from wflow sbm model simulation and the global flood awareness system glofas era5 are used wflow sbm model and its parameterization are based upon the method of pedo transfer function imhoff et al 2020 described in section 3 3 glofas era5 is a global river discharge reanalysis product whose accuracy unfortunately decreases as the catchment size becomes smaller harrigan et al 2020 to the accuracy of average kge of 0 21 for catchment size between 500 and 2500 km 2 a range suitable to the upper citarum basin therefore glofas era5 estimates are used more as a comparison tool rather than an applicable estimate in this study groundwater abstraction is estimated from the population data and literature reviews of industrial pumping further the discrepancy between the basin inflow precipitation and outflow evaporation river discharge and groundwater abstraction determines groundwater storage change the groundwater storage change is also estimated from the grace dataset of gridded monthly global water storage nasa jpl 2019 since grace is measured in 1 1 resolution it is necessary to reconcile the spatial resolution difference between grace and catchment size landerer and swenson 2012 in fact the grace estimates have been used mostly in large basins such as the amazon pokhrel et al 2013 the colorado rahaman et al 2019 the upper nile shamsudduha et al 2017 and the heihe cao et al 2012 its application on local scale groundwater basins has been limited due to its inherit uncertainties sun 2013 however considering the uniformly distributed hydrological characteristics of rainfall pattern population density and urban development in the area surrounding the upper citarum basin we assume that the footprint of these remainder areas captured by grace is a good representation of the study area itself moreover using grace data as a verification tool still has its merit as humphrey et al 2016 demonstrated grace meaningful hydrological signal in high frequency monthly temporal variability which is what we use in this study grace has also been used as a terrestrial water storage reference in indonesia han et al 2017 3 2 extended triple collocation etc method uncertainty of each water balance component estimate is quantified using the extended triple collocation etc technique mccoll et al 2014 the improved uncertainty estimation method from the standard triple collocation tc stoffelen 1998 practically both tc and etc methods have been applied to many geophysical parameters such as soil moisture data gruber et al 2016 chen et al 2018 sea surface temperature data saha et al 2020 and ice concentration data scott 2020 it is important to realize that etc does not reduce uncertainty instead it quantifies uncertainties to assist in selecting the least uncertain product among numbers of estimates in principle etc method evaluates uncertainty by deriving the correlation coefficient of each measurement system with respect to an unknown target variable mccoll et al 2014 and is expressed through rmse and r 2 parameter wu et al 2019 it assumes the existence of a linear relationship between independent dataset x i and hypothetical true value t with eq 1 1 x i α i β i t ϵ i where α i and β i are calibration parameters and ϵ i is the corresponding random error further covariances between different measurements used to directly determine the designated objective function of rmse and r 2 are calculated using eq 2 2 q i j cov x i x j e x i x j e x i e x j where q i j represents covariance between two datasets x i and x j as etc method requires three unique datasets for each analysis i j 1 2 3 there are six different covariance values based on three dataset permutations q 11 q 12 q 13 q 22 q 23 and q 33 these covariances are used to calculate two objective functions 3 rmse 2 q 11 q 12 q 13 q 23 q 22 q 12 q 23 q 13 q 33 q 13 q 23 q 12 4 r 2 q 12 q 13 q 11 q 23 q 12 q 23 q 22 q 13 q 13 q 23 q 33 q 12 where each element in each matrix represents the subsequent objective function value of each dataset it is widely known that the closer rmse and r 2 values to 0 and 1 respectively the better the simulation performs 3 3 wflow sbm model and its parameterization wflow sbm model schellekens et al 2020 modification of the previous topog sbm model vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 is used to simulate the hydrological cycle in the upper citarum basin it is built on pcraster karssenberg et al 2010 and python language fig 4 displays an overview of the simulated processes and fluxes within the model framework one of the wflow sbm primary strengths is the model parameters that mostly represent physical characteristics making it easier to interpret and correlate their values with physical catchment properties vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 it has been used in broad applications on hydrological modeling delivering good performance too lópez et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2019 wannasin et al 2021b we use a similar setup as imhoff et al 2020 for model parameterization the high resolution model is parameterized based upon point scale pedo transfer functions ptfs followed by scaling to model resolution this method has been applied to other tropical catchments with good results wannasin et al 2021a soil related parameters are estimated based on soil types from soilgrids database hengl et al 2017 monthly leaf area index lai climatology is used for calculating daily interception using the model of gash 1979 and derived from modis for river network slope and river slope we use eilander et al 2020 method based on merit dem dataset yamazaki et al 2017 for deriving parameter values coupled to land use we use vito land use map buchhorn et al 2020 the parameter controlling recharge to deep groundwater maxleakage is set to zero to limit computing time we use one day timestamp with fixed sub timesteps for kinematic wave iterations 900 s for river cells and 3600 s for land cells the model is forced with chirps rainfall data spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and pet derived from era5 reanalysis de bruin et al 2016 for spatial downscaling of era5 2 m temperature to the model grid we use a fixed lapse rate of 0 65 100 m for the period of simulation we simulate the hydrological cycle between 2005 and 2018 where all the hydrological components data are available or have been created 3 4 groundwater storage change estimate as there is no snow formed precipitation and notable reservoir lake water bodies within the basin spatial domain the upper citarum basin storage involves only subsurface storage both in soil moisture storage vadose zones and or groundwater storage saturated zones referred to as groundwater storage change in the groundwater storage δ s is therefore determined by all the above mentioned water balance components of precipitation p as the inflow and actual evaporation ae river discharge q r and groundwater abstraction q a as the outflow calculated using eq 5 5 δ s i o p ae q r q a on the other hand recharge is a very important flux to consider in groundwater storage change assessment however from a whole catchment perspective recharge is an internal process within the water cycle not a water balance component that flows into like precipitation or out from like actual evaporation river discharge and groundwater abstraction a catchment directly itself and therefore not included in eq 5 in this study we report the average daily recharge estimates based on the wflow sbm model simulation it is important to note that these estimates vary in space and time 3 5 uncertainty bounds experimental setup using two rainfall station based and two satellite based measurements the uncertainty of each rainfall dataset is evaluated based on each values and measurement techniques the spatial resolution of the rainfall data is selected on the same resolution of 0 25 0 25 as the four rainfall data sources have different temporal coverages see table 2 the overlapping data availability period between 2000 and 2015 is selected the calculated objective functions rmse and r 2 are averaged within grids bounding the upper citarum basin etc method requires a minimum of one group consisting of three different datasets to be evaluated while there are four different rainfall data sources listed in table 2 therefore four etc datasets are constructed to utilize all available data while at the same time conforming to etc input requirement named etc 1 etc 2 etc 3 and etc 4 etc 1 consists of rainfall station data saca d and chirps etc 2 consists of rainfall station data saca d and trmm etc 3 consists of rainfall station data chirps and trmm lastly etc 4 consists of saca d chirps and trmm the rainfall estimate with the highest r 2 and the lowest rmse is used to drive the wflow sbm model furthermore with various estimates obtained from numerous approaches we derive uncertainty bounds of each water balance component by calculating some statistical distribution of the inter annual estimates during the simulated period between 2005 and 2018 namely the mean 1st and 3rd quartile for rainfall estimates we put our main focus on the best estimates according to the etc application following the rainfall data screening for actual evaporation and river discharge estimates we define two sets of estimates etc based and wflow sbm based estimates etc based estimates consist of the rainfall actual evaporation and discharge estimates with the highest r 2 and the lowest rmse based on etc application on each component added with the estimated groundwater abstraction which lead to the groundwater storage change estimate the wflow sbm based estimates on the other hand consist of an identical set of estimates except the actual evaporation and discharge estimates are obtained from the wflow sbm hydrological model simulation 4 results 4 1 data quality screening two observed data that are mainly checked and screened prior to further estimates are the observed rainfall and discharge we examine the number of non rainy days in all rainfall estimates to inspect their reliability regarding potentially missing measurements for discharge data we compare the rising and falling pattern of daily discharge observation with chirps rainfall and qualitatively derive judgment based on their agreement between 2005 and 2015 when all rainfall station data are available each rainfall station has on average 233 non rainy days each year the stations with the most non zero data available cisondari rainfall station has on average 208 non rainy days annually while other stations have 257 non rainy days at most this number does not correspond well with rainfall characteristics in a tropical region in this instance the upper citarum basin where there are only two seasons during a year rainy and dry with roughly similar temporal length in contrast saca d chirps and trmm rainfall estimates respectively have significantly fewer non rainy days of only 161 133 and 170 this fact shows the unreliability of the rainfall station data specifically in the upper citarum basin as these non rainy days might not actually have happened instead there were rainfall occurrences unrecorded during actual precipitation moreover the amount of non rainy days is not related to missing data in certain prolonged periods as well since the longest consecutive non rainy day in cisondari rainfall station is found at 22 days reflecting the absence of a dry season with such ambiguous observation considering and further utilizing other rainfall estimates is unavoidable hence the application of the etc technique to the rainfall estimates becomes even more important responding to the dubious rainfall data quality the discharge data screening is performed by comparing the observed discharge not to the observed rainfall but chirps rainfall estimates fig 5 shows the rising and falling pattern of the observed discharge due to the stimuli of chirps rainfall estimates from 2005 to 2015 we can see the seasonal pattern from both data a trend of higher rainfall and discharge that starts during september october and ends during june july the rainfall plot presents little variance between wet and dry years although it is still visible for example 2011 was a relatively dry year with less rainfall than the average while 2013 was much wetter the pattern is however dissimilar to the observed discharge the basin response is sometimes inconsistent with the rainfall pattern in 2012 for instance the continuous rainfall early during the year was not followed by a rising discharge instead it shows a series of consistent low flows thus in subsequent analysis the calculation of average discharge does not consider data from 2012 4 2 rainfall estimates fig 6 a shows a comparison between various estimates of annual rainfall in the upper citarum basin it suggests that satellite based measurements of chirps and trmm result in an estimate of precipitation that is higher 2872 and 2863 mm year respectively than that of station based measurements 1972 mm year for rainfall station and 2426 mm year for saca d this is agreed by the data screening which shows numerous potentially missing data in the rainfall station record secondly fig 6b reports the result of etc application to the daily rainfall estimates the left and right side y axis show the r 2 and rmse values respectively fig 6a in combination with r 2 metric in fig 6b show that rainfall estimates sourced from more similar measurement techniques tend to be in a better agreement compared to estimates from different approaches r 2 of both rainfall station and saca d data are higher than the satellite based measurements in etc 1 and etc 2 while similar patterns are found in r 2 of chirps and trmm in etc 3 and etc 4 furthermore while the satellite estimates have low r 2 in etc 1 and etc 2 0 18 for each estimate their values in etc 3 and etc 4 improve to 0 52 similar improvements are also found for the rainfall station based measurement but they occur at a much lower rate the r 2 of rainfall station and saca d data in etc 3 and etc 4 of 0 12 and 0 09 respectively have improved only to 0 37 and 0 27 on average based on the evaluation of r 2 and rainfall data screening in section 4 1 the satellite based rainfall estimates are more preferable to be used than the rainfall station based estimates to select the satellite data with the least uncertainty the calculated rmses are considered etc application shows distinct and obvious results in this regard comparing the two satellite based rainfall measurements all etc datasets agree that chirps estimates have less uncertainties compared to trmm from etc 1 and etc 2 rmse of chirps 8 84 mm day is lower to those of trmm 11 73 mm day which is in agreement with etc 3 and etc 4 results in conclusion according to the etc application to the four rainfall estimates using the r 2 similar measurement techniques produce estimates that are in a better agreement with those estimated using different measurement techniques furthermore based on the evaluation of rmse chirps rainfall estimates have the lowest rmse among the considered estimates therefore the rainfall input for the wflow sbm model simulation in this study is based on chirps forcing 4 3 actual evaporation estimates based upon the wflow sbm simulation that uses chirps rainfall estimates as the model input the wflow sbm based actual evaporation estimates are shown in fig 7 compared with gleam and era5 estimates we can see notable periods when the wflow sbm model produces lower estimates than the other two actual evaporation products mostly during dry season periods in the latter part of each year the water height equivalents of average daily actual evaporation however are not largely diverse as gleam era5 and wflow sbm estimates are of 3 13 2 82 and 2 67 mm day respectively the contrast in the temporal fluctuation of these estimates is quantified by the variance with the highest variability shown by gleam and wflow sbm simulation estimated at approximately 0 73 mm day however the wflow sbm simulation has lower estimates ranging between 0 11 and 4 54 mm day while gleam has the same variables on higher notes between 0 53 and 5 23 mm day the era5 actual evaporation estimates stand in between ranging from 0 70 to 4 90 mm day furthermore fig 8 a shows a boxplot comparison of daily actual evaporation estimates it supports the fig 7 interpretation of actual evaporation estimate distribution that shows higher values of gleam lower values of wflow sbm simulation with era5 values placed in between the results of etc application on actual evaporation estimates are shown in fig 8b indicating gleam estimates to have the highest r 2 of 0 82 and the lowest rmse of 0 31 mm day era5 and wflow sbm estimates have comparable results with r 2 values of 0 65 and 0 70 and rmse of 0 32 and 0 38 mm day respectively uncertainty quantification suggests a justifiable approximation of actual evaporation ranging between 2 67 and 3 13 mm day 4 4 river discharge estimates three river discharge estimates of observed data wflow sbm simulation and glofas era5 are plotted in fig 9 glofas era5 and observation data are directly available while wflow sbm based estimates are simulated through the setup described in section 3 3 visually the oscillation pattern of discharge in the upper citarum basin is quite distinct in fig 9 from all discharge estimates dry periods are found in the latter part of each year after june while wet periods start around late october until early may additionally there is no significant time lag noticed among the estimates however peak extreme values are not in agreement for example during early and late 2016 low flows during dry periods on the other hand are mostly in agreement among estimates fig 9 also shows that glofas era5 has the highest discharge estimate followed by wflow sbm simulation and observation data the water height equivalent average discharge of glofas era5 estimates is 6 12 mm day while wflow sbm and observation estimates are 5 38 and 3 65 mm day respectively although the rising and falling discharge pattern are mostly in agreement there are periods where certain estimate delivers significantly higher values than the others specifically glofas era5 and wflow sbm over reactions to precipitation are quantitatively shown by high statistical variances of 5 38 and 4 82 mm day respectively while the same metric on discharge observation is calculated at only 3 36 mm day glofas era5 overestimation on discharge observation compared to wflow sbm simulation is also agreed by three objective functions of kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse that we calculate using hydroeval python package hallouin 2019 it is important to consider that these metrics are calculated accordingly to the observed discharge in which the accountability and accuracy have been discussed in section 4 1 instead of relying on the numbers qualitative interpretations on discharge estimates are no less important than the kges nses and rmses nevertheless results show that the objective functions of glofas era5 estimates are worse than ones of the wflow sbm simulation while the kge for wflow sbm simulation to river discharge observation is calculated at 0 18 the one for glofas era5 is 0 03 the same goes with nse as one from wflow sbm 0 76 is higher than one from glofas era5 1 17 last but not least rmse of wflow sbm and glofas era5 are calculated at 94 15 and 104 53 m 3 s respectively considering the values from three discharge estimates the calculated metrics and glofas era5 tendency to decrease in accuracy in smaller catchments harrigan et al 2020 the water height equivalent average daily discharge component is estimated between 3 65 and 5 38 mm day 4 5 groundwater storage change estimates as discussed in section 3 4 the groundwater storage change estimates are calculated based on the discrepancy between the basin inflow precipitation and outflow actual evaporation river discharge and groundwater abstraction each water balance component however has multiple estimates that vary in magnitude therefore we categorize two groups of estimates etc based and wflow sbm based estimates section 3 5 in order to assist the calculation table 3 elaborates the statistical distribution of all mentioned water balance components estimates and table 4 additionally synthesizes them to total inflow and outflow along with groundwater storage change estimate in the upper citarum basin the average daily recharge calculated by the wflow sbm model meanwhile results in an estimate of 2 63 mm day it is important to take into account that great parts of the recharge flow horizontally in the soil moisture layer and subsequently become a part of river discharge as baseflow and only the rest of it permeates vertically into the saturated zones and fill the groundwater storage based on the etc based estimates there is an indication of a positive recharging trend to the upper citarum basin groundwater storage of 0 45 mm day despite the state of massive groundwater abstraction on the other hand the wflow sbm based estimates result in an opposite groundwater storage change status of negative 0 82 mm day indicating water deficits in the groundwater storage further aggravated by groundwater abstraction although the estimates range is in agreement with grace measures of on average 0 25 mm day with a variance of 1 57 mm day the contrast between the two estimates demonstrates notable uncertainty in groundwater storage change estimate despite considering numerous approaches from measurements to modeling techniques on the water balance components 4 6 the uncertainty bounds of the upper citarum basin water balance estimate to summarize all the above estimates we plot the inter annual time series of average daily estimates of rainfall actual evaporation discharge and groundwater storage change in fig 10 for the wflow sbm based estimate and in fig 11 for the etc based estimate we also plot the first and third quartile of the inter annual estimates to show the width of the inter annual variance of each estimate additionally we plot the average monthly values for each component to show the consistency between daily and monthly estimates from figs 10 and 11 we can see a narrow variance in evaporation and discharge estimates more importantly there are good correlations among these estimates with a correlation value of 0 76 between the wflow sbm simulation and gleam estimates of actual evaporation and 0 56 between the discharge observed and simulated by the wflow sbm model consistent patterns between daily and monthly averages are also visible in these two components from both estimates the wflow sbm based discharge shows a little disruption during september as there are some years when rainy seasons started earlier compared to the average resulting an inter annual outlier of discharge whose values skewing the average in contrast the groundwater storage change estimates show different features a broad range of estimates from 0 82 to 0 45 mm day can be interpreted either way as long term recharging or discharging process from or to the groundwater storage although such estimates are found in the range that is in agreement with grace measures the uncertainty bounds are too wide to enable us to derive a strong conclusion on the groundwater storage status in the upper citarum basin the relatively higher variances of the groundwater storage change estimates compared to the other water balance components shown in table 3 further support our interpretation moreover the pattern of the inter annual average monthly estimates of grace are relatively dissimilar with both the etc based and wflow sbm based estimates and dominantly found in different sides of positive and negative values all these facts underpin the absence of accurate estimates of groundwater storage change despite the ability to accurately estimate the other water balance components of rainfall actual evaporation and river discharge 5 discussion 5 1 alternative of forcing estimates and data sources in this study the results of etc application to four rainfall estimates fig 6 favor the use of satellite based forcing data as they occupy less uncertainty compared to rainfall station based data this is further supported by the concerning rainfall station data quality where suspiciously numerous missing data exist due to an under expected number of annual non rainy days it is also noted from etc application on rainfall estimates supporting previous studies by boluwade 2020 that similar measurement techniques have higher agreements between their products in comparison to data measured by different methods as the considered rainfall data in this study are sourced only from rainfall station based and satellite based measurements it is possible for future research to also observe the accuracy of rainfall data measured by other techniques for example by using radar sauvageot 1994 crowd sourcing personal weather stations de vos et al 2017 or commercial microwave link networks overeem et al 2011 similar opportunities apply to other water balance components estimates 5 2 results interpretation to the field situation the results summarized in table 3 show notable discrepancies among the estimated water balance components it is important to consider nevertheless that the upper citarum basin is a data scarce area from both aspects of quantity and quality although the etc technique is applied to quantify the estimates uncertainty the true values of the hydrological forcing remain unknown in this case etc applications do not reduce the uncertainty of the estimates instead it quantifies the confidence level of each estimate supporting the decision making in selecting the best estimate for each water balance component in comparison to previous studies in the citarum basin our estimates of each water balance component are reliably verified the average daily rainfall estimates between 5 40 and 7 80 mm day in the upper citarum basin is in agreement with the previous approximation by jaya et al 2020 with 6 30 mm day and salim et al 2019 with a range between 5 38 and 7 12 mm day in the same study salim et al 2019 estimated an average discharge equivalent to 4 49 mm day which is well within the estimated range of this study between 3 65 and 5 38 mm day average discharge during dry and wet periods simulated by julian et al 2019 at 3 40 mm day is also closely approximated within our uncertainty bounds however earlier studies did not consider potential changes in groundwater storage in this study the groundwater storage change is estimated using three approaches etc based estimate wflow sbm based estimate and remote sensing based gravimetric satellite estimates of grace dependent to the water balance components estimates of rainfall actual evaporation discharge and groundwater abstraction these estimates result in diverging trends from 0 82 to 0 45 mm day suggesting a high variance and uncertainties in the estimates of the water balance components which eventually lead to a pending groundwater storage change status considering the positive etc based estimate of groundwater storage change increases in such component would coincide with rising groundwater tables which unfortunately are not reinforced by the results of previous studies as they showed dwindling groundwater tables gumilar et al 2015 tirtomihardjo 2016 in his study gumilar et al 2015 found trends of groundwater table decline in 11 wells within the bandung groundwater basin however those wells are located in industrial zones and are used to abstract the groundwater thus the observed groundwater tables in those wells would certainly involve biases in their measurements same findings by tirtomihardjo 2016 also contain similar issues as the direct quotes from his study were groundwater levels in industrial areas are on the decline to capture the overview of the groundwater table fluctuation groundwater table data with less bias in regard to groundwater abstraction need to be collected and analyzed while groundwater table data are point based and often involve biases groundwater storage change estimate is an integrated metric of a whole basin comparing the results from previous studies of dwindling groundwater tables that are in conflict with two of our estimates etc based and grace points to a possibility of spatially varying states of groundwater storage change there could be zones with dwindling groundwater tables while the basin overall groundwater storage is indeed increasing and vice versa a more comprehensive study on the upper citarum basin subsurface processes could unravel the spatial distribution of groundwater storage changes and map as well as separate recharging and discharging area of groundwater storage furthermore by comparing the decreasing groundwater abstraction rate fig 3 with the uncertain groundwater storage change estimates changing trends on the groundwater storage status could be plausible therefore temporally fluctuating trends of groundwater storage state are necessary to be further explored time series simulations of subsurface internal processes need to be performed in the future taking into account groundwater flow and groundwater related data reliability as the gap of knowledge in the upper citarum basin 5 3 the opportunities for future research despite involving some errors and uncertainties surface water balance components are in principle directly observable for example the rainfall and discharge in the upper citarum basin in contrast groundwater abstraction instead of being directly measured is roughly estimated using population data and modeling results from other research the credibility of the available industrial groundwater abstraction report is also questionable since the reported values are significantly lower than previous estimates taufiq et al 2017 hence the groundwater storage change estimate as a resultant of all other estimates is highly uncertain moreover there are still issues to consider such as water balance spatial distribution temporal variance and groundwater flow system to improve the accuracy and narrow the range of subsurface water balance estimates the internal subsurface hydrological processes involving hydrogeological characteristics soil parameters etc should be explored simulated and validated with the available groundwater head measurements currently the continuation of this study is being conducted by collating groundwater related data of the upper citarum basin 6 conclusions in this paper we improve the accuracy of the water balance components estimates and their uncertainty bounds in a highly groundwater dependent and data scarce region of the upper citarum basin between 2005 and 2018 the analysis starts from hydrological data collection to hydrological simulation using the wflow sbm model which allows uncertainty quantification of water balance components as estimated from these data the rainfall data are sourced from rainfall station based rainfall station and saca d and satellite based trmm and chirps measurements the uncertainty analysis using the extended triple collocation method indicates a preference towards satellite data which is supported by initial rainfall data screening that shows many potentially missing data recorded by the rainfall stations in subsequent analysis chirps rainfall data with an average daily rainfall estimate of 7 80 mm day are used to drive the wflow sbm model hydrological simulation using the wflow sbm model results in two water balance components estimates actual evaporation and discharge the actual evaporation is compared to the other two estimates based upon remote sensing data gleam and era5 all the estimates result in very similar values with etc application on actual evaporation in favor of gleam the simulated discharge of 5 38 mm day is compared to both observation data and glofas era5 estimate with observed data of 3 65 mm day endorsed by the etc we developed two scenarios in estimating groundwater storage change etc based and wflow sbm model based estimate both scenarios involve chirps rainfall estimates and groundwater abstraction estimates based upon population data and industrial abstraction literature the etc based estimates consist of gleam actual evaporation and observed discharge resulting in an average daily groundwater storage change of 0 45 mm day the wflow sbm model based estimates on the other hand consist of evaporation and discharge estimates produced by wflow sbm simulation delivering a result of 0 82 mm day additionally grace satellite observation estimates a similar metric of 0 25 mm day with a variance of 1 57 mm day such a wide range of the groundwater storage change estimates reflects substantial uncertainties and knowledge gaps on subsurface hydrological behavior in the upper citarum basin further it leads towards a need for the next research step to simulate subsurface hydrological processes and to validate that with the available groundwater head measurements which is currently being developed authors contribution steven r rusli conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation

8166,study region upper region of the citarum basin in indonesia study focus assessing water balance components in data scarce regions using different approaches could result in different outcomes in the upper reaches of the citarum river in west java indonesia for example many previous studies found the groundwater storage to be depleting while grace identifies a contrasting trend of increasing groundwater storage change therefore in this study we aim to improve the accuracy of water balance components estimates in the upper citarum basin firstly we estimate groundwater abstraction volumes based on population size and a review of literature estimates of the other water balance components namely the rainfall actual evaporation discharge and groundwater storage change are derived from various global datasets and available measurements we also use a distributed hydrological model wflow sbm to yield additional estimates of discharge and actual evaporation we compare each basin water balance estimate and quantify the uncertainty of some components using the extended triple collocation etc method new hydrological insights for the region etc application on four different rainfall estimates suggests a preference of using chirps product in the study area as it delivers r 2 of 0 56 and rmse of 6 52 mm day compared to estimates from rainfall station r 2 0 39 rmse 8 57 mm day saca d r 2 0 29 rmse 10 46 mm day and trmm r 2 0 56 rmse 8 61 mm day with chirps rainfall forcing wflow sbm model estimates of average daily actual evaporation and discharge are obtained the results for actual evaporation 2 67 mm day are plausible with a narrow difference of less than 0 50 mm day among other estimates the simulated discharge results in a daily average of 5 38 mm day estimated between observation data 3 65 mm day and glofas era5 product 6 12 mm day combining precipitation actual evaporation and discharge with a groundwater abstraction estimate of 0 57 mm day the wflow sbm based groundwater storage change is estimated at a daily storage depletion of 0 82 mm day using gleam actual evaporation estimates 3 13 mm day and observed daily discharge on the other hand results in surplus water of 0 45 mm day for groundwater storage change these results demonstrate the high uncertainty in capturing subsurface hydrological processes although the groundwater storage change estimates are found close to the estimates based upon grace gravimetric satellite data of 0 25 mm day with a variance of 1 57 mm day to aid in estimating current and future basin scale groundwater level changes to support operational water management and policy in the citarum basin considering the massive groundwater abstraction a focus on subsurface hydrological components quantification is of great importance for future research keywords water balance components estimate wflow sbm model extended triple collocation groundwater storage change estimate data scarce region upper citarum basin 1 introduction groundwater has been used for water supply purposes since prehistorical ages angelakis et al 2016 voudouris et al 2018 since then its exertion has developed from fulfilling life basic needs to meeting various demands from domestic industrial and agricultural sectors however groundwater resources are increasingly over exploited globally de graaf et al 2016 from central asia chatterjee et al 2018 hu et al 2019 the middle east al zyoud et al 2015 south europe closas et al 2017 africa khezzani and bouchemal 2018 mokadem et al 2018 to central america ochoa gonzález et al 2018 groundwater over abstraction leads to dwindling groundwater tables and often to deteriorating water quality and in many ways threats the security of water resources on a scale of the water cycle as a whole when the regulatory role of groundwater flow to other hydrological fluxes is considered chambel 2015 it also leads to many other problems such as land subsidence shen and xu 2011 figueroa miranda et al 2018 saltwater intrusion kim and yang 2018 mabrouk et al 2018 and surface water level decrease lin et al 2018 wu et al 2018 groundwater table fluctuation generally influences other water balance internal processes for example changes in groundwater recharge discharge pattern affect surface water system earman and dettinger 2011 groundwater flow pattern pétré et al 2019 runoff generation process abe et al 2020 and rate of evapotranspiration lurtz et al 2020 more consequences unavoidably occur once more factors are involved such as groundwater quality anthropogenic influence zhu et al 2019 lin et al 2020 climate change zhu et al 2020 and land cover and land use lulc development lamichhane and shakya 2019 shawul et al 2019 additionally interactions among hydrological cycle groundwater resources and human interference are also mutually influential as changes in water balance internal processes have a chain reaction effect in increasing groundwater abstraction from both unconfined and confined aquifers ali et al 2012 change in precipitation pattern has been found to have a strong relationship with groundwater abstraction volume too asoka et al 2017 it is clearly shown that groundwater is very closely connected with basin water cycle processes although it flows on a spatially and temporally different scale unfortunately in determining water balance components with good accuracy the required hydrological and hydrogeological information is often unavailable particularly in developing countries the usage of global open source datasets as well as remote sensing techniques rodell et al 2009 vorobevskii et al 2020 statistical downscaling method haberlandt et al 2014 pomee et al 2020 and similarity based regionalization techniques jafarzadegan et al 2020 are just a few examples of how the challenge of data scarcity can be met however water balance estimates determined using freely available often open source tools should be accompanied by an awareness of each method s uncertainties assumptions and embedded errors the upper citarum basin located in west java indonesia is an example of a region that is data scarce as well as highly groundwater dependent at least 50 million cubic meters of groundwater was estimated to be abstracted in 1990 and it grows to 300 million cubic meters in 2006 tirtomihardjo 2016 added to this fact other studies also indicate groundwater storage depletion in the basin gumilar et al 2015 such a massive volume and impact of groundwater abstraction unfortunately is not well managed and monitored groundwater abstraction data are hardly available accessible and reliable for public information based on rainfall stations measurement the average daily rainfall in the upper citarum basin between 2005 and 2015 is of 5 40 mm day 1971 77 mm year with a variance of 7 03 mm day 617 91 mm year meanwhile according to era5 reanalysis products hersbach et al 2020 the average daily actual evaporation is estimated at 2 82 mm day 1028 88 mm year with a variance of 0 55 mm day 36 03 mm year the remaining water from the precipitation and the actual evaporation estimates suggests a lower average potential daily inflow of 2 58 mm day compared to the observed average daily outflow of 3 65 mm day barring more water is still lost due to groundwater abstraction however this seems to be in contrast with the gravity recovery and climatic experiment grace estimate of total water storage that shows increasing terrestrial water storage in the last 15 years the absence of reliable hydrology and hydrogeology data makes it difficult to accurately capture the hydrological behavior of the upper citarum basin and verify the true status of the groundwater storage change it further stipulates the importance of more comprehensive and accurate estimates of the water balance components in the study area which is deeply discussed in this paper therefore the primary focus of this research is to provide improved estimates of the water balance components in a groundwater dependent and data scarce region of the upper citarum basin in particular the rainfall actual evaporation discharge groundwater abstraction and groundwater storage change each component is based not only on ground measurement but also various approaches and sources open source global datasets remote sensing based estimates and hydrological simulation using wflow sbm model schellekens et al 2020 uncertainty bounds of each water balance component are also quantified more importantly to appraise the accuracy of each estimate using the extended triple collocation etc method mccoll et al 2014 structure wise this paper is set up as follows the study area is described in section 2 section 3 explains the material methods and experimental setup the results are described in section 4 and are discussed in section 5 finally the conclusion is available in section 6 2 study area 2 1 the upper citarum basin the study area is the upper citarum basin located in the west java province indonesia fig 1 estimated from multi error removed improved terrain digital elevation model merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 its total area extends over 1823 km 2 administratively it covers large parts of two cities bandung and cimahi and three other smaller regencies of bandung west bandung and sumedang according to the west java central bureau of statistics the upper citarum basin is populated by no less than 9 6 million people in 2017 it is geographically located between 6 43 s 107 22 e and 7 15 s 107 57 e with its outlet at 6 56 s 107 30 e topographically the upper citarum basin is situated in varying elevated terrains surrounded by mountainous areas around the basin periphery with the highest elevation of 2500 m above sea level asl and basin outlet elevation at 640 m asl fig 1 also shows the topographical distribution of the upper citarum basin with a vast and relatively flat landscape distributed primarily in the middle part of the basin looking from land use and land cover lulc perspectives these territories are the primary location where cities and industries have been developing rapid urbanization is the major driving force behind such growth degrading the watershed impacting basin water quality agaton et al 2016 and increasing basin susceptibility to flooding occurrences siregar 2018 2 2 hydrology and climate situation there are 11 rainfall stations spatially distributed within and around the upper citarum basin see fig 1 based on these rainfall stations data between 2005 and 2015 which are provided by the national meteorology climatology and geophysical agency bmkg the average annual rainfall in the upper citarum basin interpolated using the thiessen polygon method is 1971 mm these measurements however involve huge uncertainties and errors as there exist notable periods when potentially missing data were not properly gauged this issue is comprehensively discussed in a later section the rainfall seasonal pattern is divided into dry and rainy seasons occurred annually from april to september and october to march respectively as the upper citarum basin is located in a tropical region rainfall is dominantly the only source of precipitation throughout the year the upper citarum basin is the upstream part of a bigger watershed system the citarum river basin whose outlet flows to the java sea three cascading dams are constructed along the main river saguling cirata and jatiluhur dam saguling reservoir being the most upstream among the three is located at the downstream section of a discharge measurement station named nanjung see fig 1 pinpointed as the upper citarum basin outlet the discharge in nanjung station is monitored using an automatic water level recorder awlr the streamflow data are made available by the indonesia research center for water resources pusair between 2005 and 2018 the minimum and maximum recorded daily discharge in nanjung station are 4 08 and 469 29 m 3 s respectively with an average of 73 86 m 3 s peak flows are frequently found with events of daily discharge surpassing 450 m 3 s approximately the 95th percentile occurred 6 times during the mentioned period the climate in the upper citarum basin is of a tropical monsoon climate with relatively constant temperatures throughout the year according to bmkg climatology data between 2005 and 2014 the mean annual temperature in the basin is 23 4 c with a very narrow range of average monthly temperatures between 22 5 and 24 8 c spatially the temperature is more varied with an average of 15 3 c around the mountainous area surrounding the basin periphery similar to other typical tropical climate regions the upper citarum basin has high potential evapotranspiration estimated at 1560 mm annually siswanto and francés 2019 2 3 groundwater abstraction hydrogeologically the upper citarum basin subsurface consists of layer cake type aquifers with cibeureum formation as its main aquifer interspersed by kosambi formation as a spatially distributed aquitard hutasoit 2009 fig 2 shows the typical north south hydrogeological cross section of the upper citarum basin groundwater over exploitation has been long known as a threatening problem in the basin gumilar et al 2015 tirtomihardjo 2016 with the domestic sector pumping from shallow aquifers and the industrial sector from deep aquifers the current groundwater abstraction rate has set off various consequences such as notable land subsidence of 8 cm year on average abidin et al 2012 and even up to 2 meters in several industrial zones gumilar et al 2015 there is no monitoring initiative unfortunately for the domestic groundwater abstraction according to the local regulation it is entirely legal to pump shallow groundwater to supply household needs in this study domestic groundwater abstraction volume is therefore estimated from population number data courtesy of the west java central bureau of statistics report in 2017 population growth estimate tarigan et al 2016 average daily water consumption per person and water supply coverage from municipal drinking water company pdam moersidik et al 2015 see table 1 between 2005 and 2018 the average domestic groundwater abstraction volume is estimated at 122 million m 3 per annum equivalent to 0 18 mm day regarding the industrial sector demand bandung city regulation includes theoretically strict rules in abstracting groundwater from deeper aquifers unfortunately law enforcement for water related regulations in indonesia is extremely weak braadbaart and braadbaart 1997 listiyani and said 2018 office of mineral and energy resources esdm of west java province concerning groundwater institutional management is the responsible organization to derive implement and evaluate policies related to the use of groundwater especially those abstracted by the industrial sector currently groundwater abstraction volumes from registered deep wells of the industrial sector are known to be partly monitored by esdm since 2017 and are accessible upon request for research purposes such figures were more of an unknown quantity to public pre 2017 in 2017 there are 377 deep wells operated by industries with total annual groundwater abstraction volumes of 6 8 million m 3 reported to esdm within the upper citarum basin such numbers are believed to be significantly higher in reality tirtomihardjo 2016 calculated the sum of the reported groundwater abstraction volumes by industrial sector and found it to be already at a rate of 47 6 million m 3 in 2008 further taufiq et al 2017 using a simplified groundwater model estimated the actual industries groundwater abstraction between 2010 and 2015 to be 14 times higher than the volumes reported to local government fig 3 a positive point from fig 3 is that in the last 15 years industrial groundwater abstraction has been decreasing agreed by the increasing groundwater storage change estimated from gravimetric satellite data of grace although as it has been mentioned above it is in contrast with the result of previous studies gumilar et al 2015 tirtomihardjo 2016 from field observation and direct interviews with site officers the annual industry driven groundwater pumping values in this study is estimated at 255 million m 3 equivalent to 0 38 mm day in summary the upper citarum basin is a highly groundwater dependent region as the majority of its water demand is fulfilled by abstracting water from the sub surface from the above description of domestic and industrial demand approximately 370 million m 3 of groundwater equivalent to 0 57 mm day is believed to be abstracted annually with such a massive abstraction volume it is hypothesized that groundwater abstraction has a significant influence on other components of the basin water cycle and possibly impacts its total water storage negatively 3 methodology 3 1 data sources and availability the upper citarum basin is a data scarce region with limited information and access to local observations and measurements therefore we explore various sources of literature site survey and global datasets a major portion of secondary data is provided by government organizations previously mentioned esdm bmkg and pusair several numbers of available global datasets are taken into account to provide additional information on unmeasured water budget variables and to validate the uncertainty of each estimate in summary table 2 lists the major data sources used in this study there are four sources of rainfall data considered in this study the first two rainfall datasets bmkg and saca d are sourced and derived from rainfall station based measurements bmkg rainfall station data are available from eleven stations shown in fig 1 saca d van den besselaar et al 2017 are interpolated gauge based precipitation products applied in the south east asia region by using an optimum interpolation method hofstra et al 2008 implemented in european climate assessment and dataset eca d project haylock et al 2008 the other two data sources are satellite based data trmm3b43 further referred to as trmm and chirps funk et al 2015 both are gauge based corrected estimates trmm data have been widely used in indonesia prasetia et al 2012 as syakur et al 2013 as well as chirps setiawan et al 2017 narulita and ningrum 2018 additionally both datasets were also found superior to drive hydrological model of swat to produce satisfying simulation results even when compared with rain gauge data luo et al 2019 there are three sources of daily actual evaporation data gleamv3 3a further referred to as gleam miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 era5 hersbach et al 2020 and wflow sbm model simulation results particularly for indonesia gleam estimates have been tested and deliver good performance in the western part of the java island wati et al 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 era5 data meanwhile is available in a finer spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 wflow sbm model calculates daily actual evaporation using the potential evaporation estimated based on downscaled era5 temperature radiation and surface pressure a method suggested by de bruin et al 2016 observed daily discharge data are provided by pusair additionally two more discharge estimates from wflow sbm model simulation and the global flood awareness system glofas era5 are used wflow sbm model and its parameterization are based upon the method of pedo transfer function imhoff et al 2020 described in section 3 3 glofas era5 is a global river discharge reanalysis product whose accuracy unfortunately decreases as the catchment size becomes smaller harrigan et al 2020 to the accuracy of average kge of 0 21 for catchment size between 500 and 2500 km 2 a range suitable to the upper citarum basin therefore glofas era5 estimates are used more as a comparison tool rather than an applicable estimate in this study groundwater abstraction is estimated from the population data and literature reviews of industrial pumping further the discrepancy between the basin inflow precipitation and outflow evaporation river discharge and groundwater abstraction determines groundwater storage change the groundwater storage change is also estimated from the grace dataset of gridded monthly global water storage nasa jpl 2019 since grace is measured in 1 1 resolution it is necessary to reconcile the spatial resolution difference between grace and catchment size landerer and swenson 2012 in fact the grace estimates have been used mostly in large basins such as the amazon pokhrel et al 2013 the colorado rahaman et al 2019 the upper nile shamsudduha et al 2017 and the heihe cao et al 2012 its application on local scale groundwater basins has been limited due to its inherit uncertainties sun 2013 however considering the uniformly distributed hydrological characteristics of rainfall pattern population density and urban development in the area surrounding the upper citarum basin we assume that the footprint of these remainder areas captured by grace is a good representation of the study area itself moreover using grace data as a verification tool still has its merit as humphrey et al 2016 demonstrated grace meaningful hydrological signal in high frequency monthly temporal variability which is what we use in this study grace has also been used as a terrestrial water storage reference in indonesia han et al 2017 3 2 extended triple collocation etc method uncertainty of each water balance component estimate is quantified using the extended triple collocation etc technique mccoll et al 2014 the improved uncertainty estimation method from the standard triple collocation tc stoffelen 1998 practically both tc and etc methods have been applied to many geophysical parameters such as soil moisture data gruber et al 2016 chen et al 2018 sea surface temperature data saha et al 2020 and ice concentration data scott 2020 it is important to realize that etc does not reduce uncertainty instead it quantifies uncertainties to assist in selecting the least uncertain product among numbers of estimates in principle etc method evaluates uncertainty by deriving the correlation coefficient of each measurement system with respect to an unknown target variable mccoll et al 2014 and is expressed through rmse and r 2 parameter wu et al 2019 it assumes the existence of a linear relationship between independent dataset x i and hypothetical true value t with eq 1 1 x i α i β i t ϵ i where α i and β i are calibration parameters and ϵ i is the corresponding random error further covariances between different measurements used to directly determine the designated objective function of rmse and r 2 are calculated using eq 2 2 q i j cov x i x j e x i x j e x i e x j where q i j represents covariance between two datasets x i and x j as etc method requires three unique datasets for each analysis i j 1 2 3 there are six different covariance values based on three dataset permutations q 11 q 12 q 13 q 22 q 23 and q 33 these covariances are used to calculate two objective functions 3 rmse 2 q 11 q 12 q 13 q 23 q 22 q 12 q 23 q 13 q 33 q 13 q 23 q 12 4 r 2 q 12 q 13 q 11 q 23 q 12 q 23 q 22 q 13 q 13 q 23 q 33 q 12 where each element in each matrix represents the subsequent objective function value of each dataset it is widely known that the closer rmse and r 2 values to 0 and 1 respectively the better the simulation performs 3 3 wflow sbm model and its parameterization wflow sbm model schellekens et al 2020 modification of the previous topog sbm model vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 is used to simulate the hydrological cycle in the upper citarum basin it is built on pcraster karssenberg et al 2010 and python language fig 4 displays an overview of the simulated processes and fluxes within the model framework one of the wflow sbm primary strengths is the model parameters that mostly represent physical characteristics making it easier to interpret and correlate their values with physical catchment properties vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 it has been used in broad applications on hydrological modeling delivering good performance too lópez et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2019 wannasin et al 2021b we use a similar setup as imhoff et al 2020 for model parameterization the high resolution model is parameterized based upon point scale pedo transfer functions ptfs followed by scaling to model resolution this method has been applied to other tropical catchments with good results wannasin et al 2021a soil related parameters are estimated based on soil types from soilgrids database hengl et al 2017 monthly leaf area index lai climatology is used for calculating daily interception using the model of gash 1979 and derived from modis for river network slope and river slope we use eilander et al 2020 method based on merit dem dataset yamazaki et al 2017 for deriving parameter values coupled to land use we use vito land use map buchhorn et al 2020 the parameter controlling recharge to deep groundwater maxleakage is set to zero to limit computing time we use one day timestamp with fixed sub timesteps for kinematic wave iterations 900 s for river cells and 3600 s for land cells the model is forced with chirps rainfall data spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and pet derived from era5 reanalysis de bruin et al 2016 for spatial downscaling of era5 2 m temperature to the model grid we use a fixed lapse rate of 0 65 100 m for the period of simulation we simulate the hydrological cycle between 2005 and 2018 where all the hydrological components data are available or have been created 3 4 groundwater storage change estimate as there is no snow formed precipitation and notable reservoir lake water bodies within the basin spatial domain the upper citarum basin storage involves only subsurface storage both in soil moisture storage vadose zones and or groundwater storage saturated zones referred to as groundwater storage change in the groundwater storage δ s is therefore determined by all the above mentioned water balance components of precipitation p as the inflow and actual evaporation ae river discharge q r and groundwater abstraction q a as the outflow calculated using eq 5 5 δ s i o p ae q r q a on the other hand recharge is a very important flux to consider in groundwater storage change assessment however from a whole catchment perspective recharge is an internal process within the water cycle not a water balance component that flows into like precipitation or out from like actual evaporation river discharge and groundwater abstraction a catchment directly itself and therefore not included in eq 5 in this study we report the average daily recharge estimates based on the wflow sbm model simulation it is important to note that these estimates vary in space and time 3 5 uncertainty bounds experimental setup using two rainfall station based and two satellite based measurements the uncertainty of each rainfall dataset is evaluated based on each values and measurement techniques the spatial resolution of the rainfall data is selected on the same resolution of 0 25 0 25 as the four rainfall data sources have different temporal coverages see table 2 the overlapping data availability period between 2000 and 2015 is selected the calculated objective functions rmse and r 2 are averaged within grids bounding the upper citarum basin etc method requires a minimum of one group consisting of three different datasets to be evaluated while there are four different rainfall data sources listed in table 2 therefore four etc datasets are constructed to utilize all available data while at the same time conforming to etc input requirement named etc 1 etc 2 etc 3 and etc 4 etc 1 consists of rainfall station data saca d and chirps etc 2 consists of rainfall station data saca d and trmm etc 3 consists of rainfall station data chirps and trmm lastly etc 4 consists of saca d chirps and trmm the rainfall estimate with the highest r 2 and the lowest rmse is used to drive the wflow sbm model furthermore with various estimates obtained from numerous approaches we derive uncertainty bounds of each water balance component by calculating some statistical distribution of the inter annual estimates during the simulated period between 2005 and 2018 namely the mean 1st and 3rd quartile for rainfall estimates we put our main focus on the best estimates according to the etc application following the rainfall data screening for actual evaporation and river discharge estimates we define two sets of estimates etc based and wflow sbm based estimates etc based estimates consist of the rainfall actual evaporation and discharge estimates with the highest r 2 and the lowest rmse based on etc application on each component added with the estimated groundwater abstraction which lead to the groundwater storage change estimate the wflow sbm based estimates on the other hand consist of an identical set of estimates except the actual evaporation and discharge estimates are obtained from the wflow sbm hydrological model simulation 4 results 4 1 data quality screening two observed data that are mainly checked and screened prior to further estimates are the observed rainfall and discharge we examine the number of non rainy days in all rainfall estimates to inspect their reliability regarding potentially missing measurements for discharge data we compare the rising and falling pattern of daily discharge observation with chirps rainfall and qualitatively derive judgment based on their agreement between 2005 and 2015 when all rainfall station data are available each rainfall station has on average 233 non rainy days each year the stations with the most non zero data available cisondari rainfall station has on average 208 non rainy days annually while other stations have 257 non rainy days at most this number does not correspond well with rainfall characteristics in a tropical region in this instance the upper citarum basin where there are only two seasons during a year rainy and dry with roughly similar temporal length in contrast saca d chirps and trmm rainfall estimates respectively have significantly fewer non rainy days of only 161 133 and 170 this fact shows the unreliability of the rainfall station data specifically in the upper citarum basin as these non rainy days might not actually have happened instead there were rainfall occurrences unrecorded during actual precipitation moreover the amount of non rainy days is not related to missing data in certain prolonged periods as well since the longest consecutive non rainy day in cisondari rainfall station is found at 22 days reflecting the absence of a dry season with such ambiguous observation considering and further utilizing other rainfall estimates is unavoidable hence the application of the etc technique to the rainfall estimates becomes even more important responding to the dubious rainfall data quality the discharge data screening is performed by comparing the observed discharge not to the observed rainfall but chirps rainfall estimates fig 5 shows the rising and falling pattern of the observed discharge due to the stimuli of chirps rainfall estimates from 2005 to 2015 we can see the seasonal pattern from both data a trend of higher rainfall and discharge that starts during september october and ends during june july the rainfall plot presents little variance between wet and dry years although it is still visible for example 2011 was a relatively dry year with less rainfall than the average while 2013 was much wetter the pattern is however dissimilar to the observed discharge the basin response is sometimes inconsistent with the rainfall pattern in 2012 for instance the continuous rainfall early during the year was not followed by a rising discharge instead it shows a series of consistent low flows thus in subsequent analysis the calculation of average discharge does not consider data from 2012 4 2 rainfall estimates fig 6 a shows a comparison between various estimates of annual rainfall in the upper citarum basin it suggests that satellite based measurements of chirps and trmm result in an estimate of precipitation that is higher 2872 and 2863 mm year respectively than that of station based measurements 1972 mm year for rainfall station and 2426 mm year for saca d this is agreed by the data screening which shows numerous potentially missing data in the rainfall station record secondly fig 6b reports the result of etc application to the daily rainfall estimates the left and right side y axis show the r 2 and rmse values respectively fig 6a in combination with r 2 metric in fig 6b show that rainfall estimates sourced from more similar measurement techniques tend to be in a better agreement compared to estimates from different approaches r 2 of both rainfall station and saca d data are higher than the satellite based measurements in etc 1 and etc 2 while similar patterns are found in r 2 of chirps and trmm in etc 3 and etc 4 furthermore while the satellite estimates have low r 2 in etc 1 and etc 2 0 18 for each estimate their values in etc 3 and etc 4 improve to 0 52 similar improvements are also found for the rainfall station based measurement but they occur at a much lower rate the r 2 of rainfall station and saca d data in etc 3 and etc 4 of 0 12 and 0 09 respectively have improved only to 0 37 and 0 27 on average based on the evaluation of r 2 and rainfall data screening in section 4 1 the satellite based rainfall estimates are more preferable to be used than the rainfall station based estimates to select the satellite data with the least uncertainty the calculated rmses are considered etc application shows distinct and obvious results in this regard comparing the two satellite based rainfall measurements all etc datasets agree that chirps estimates have less uncertainties compared to trmm from etc 1 and etc 2 rmse of chirps 8 84 mm day is lower to those of trmm 11 73 mm day which is in agreement with etc 3 and etc 4 results in conclusion according to the etc application to the four rainfall estimates using the r 2 similar measurement techniques produce estimates that are in a better agreement with those estimated using different measurement techniques furthermore based on the evaluation of rmse chirps rainfall estimates have the lowest rmse among the considered estimates therefore the rainfall input for the wflow sbm model simulation in this study is based on chirps forcing 4 3 actual evaporation estimates based upon the wflow sbm simulation that uses chirps rainfall estimates as the model input the wflow sbm based actual evaporation estimates are shown in fig 7 compared with gleam and era5 estimates we can see notable periods when the wflow sbm model produces lower estimates than the other two actual evaporation products mostly during dry season periods in the latter part of each year the water height equivalents of average daily actual evaporation however are not largely diverse as gleam era5 and wflow sbm estimates are of 3 13 2 82 and 2 67 mm day respectively the contrast in the temporal fluctuation of these estimates is quantified by the variance with the highest variability shown by gleam and wflow sbm simulation estimated at approximately 0 73 mm day however the wflow sbm simulation has lower estimates ranging between 0 11 and 4 54 mm day while gleam has the same variables on higher notes between 0 53 and 5 23 mm day the era5 actual evaporation estimates stand in between ranging from 0 70 to 4 90 mm day furthermore fig 8 a shows a boxplot comparison of daily actual evaporation estimates it supports the fig 7 interpretation of actual evaporation estimate distribution that shows higher values of gleam lower values of wflow sbm simulation with era5 values placed in between the results of etc application on actual evaporation estimates are shown in fig 8b indicating gleam estimates to have the highest r 2 of 0 82 and the lowest rmse of 0 31 mm day era5 and wflow sbm estimates have comparable results with r 2 values of 0 65 and 0 70 and rmse of 0 32 and 0 38 mm day respectively uncertainty quantification suggests a justifiable approximation of actual evaporation ranging between 2 67 and 3 13 mm day 4 4 river discharge estimates three river discharge estimates of observed data wflow sbm simulation and glofas era5 are plotted in fig 9 glofas era5 and observation data are directly available while wflow sbm based estimates are simulated through the setup described in section 3 3 visually the oscillation pattern of discharge in the upper citarum basin is quite distinct in fig 9 from all discharge estimates dry periods are found in the latter part of each year after june while wet periods start around late october until early may additionally there is no significant time lag noticed among the estimates however peak extreme values are not in agreement for example during early and late 2016 low flows during dry periods on the other hand are mostly in agreement among estimates fig 9 also shows that glofas era5 has the highest discharge estimate followed by wflow sbm simulation and observation data the water height equivalent average discharge of glofas era5 estimates is 6 12 mm day while wflow sbm and observation estimates are 5 38 and 3 65 mm day respectively although the rising and falling discharge pattern are mostly in agreement there are periods where certain estimate delivers significantly higher values than the others specifically glofas era5 and wflow sbm over reactions to precipitation are quantitatively shown by high statistical variances of 5 38 and 4 82 mm day respectively while the same metric on discharge observation is calculated at only 3 36 mm day glofas era5 overestimation on discharge observation compared to wflow sbm simulation is also agreed by three objective functions of kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and root mean square error rmse that we calculate using hydroeval python package hallouin 2019 it is important to consider that these metrics are calculated accordingly to the observed discharge in which the accountability and accuracy have been discussed in section 4 1 instead of relying on the numbers qualitative interpretations on discharge estimates are no less important than the kges nses and rmses nevertheless results show that the objective functions of glofas era5 estimates are worse than ones of the wflow sbm simulation while the kge for wflow sbm simulation to river discharge observation is calculated at 0 18 the one for glofas era5 is 0 03 the same goes with nse as one from wflow sbm 0 76 is higher than one from glofas era5 1 17 last but not least rmse of wflow sbm and glofas era5 are calculated at 94 15 and 104 53 m 3 s respectively considering the values from three discharge estimates the calculated metrics and glofas era5 tendency to decrease in accuracy in smaller catchments harrigan et al 2020 the water height equivalent average daily discharge component is estimated between 3 65 and 5 38 mm day 4 5 groundwater storage change estimates as discussed in section 3 4 the groundwater storage change estimates are calculated based on the discrepancy between the basin inflow precipitation and outflow actual evaporation river discharge and groundwater abstraction each water balance component however has multiple estimates that vary in magnitude therefore we categorize two groups of estimates etc based and wflow sbm based estimates section 3 5 in order to assist the calculation table 3 elaborates the statistical distribution of all mentioned water balance components estimates and table 4 additionally synthesizes them to total inflow and outflow along with groundwater storage change estimate in the upper citarum basin the average daily recharge calculated by the wflow sbm model meanwhile results in an estimate of 2 63 mm day it is important to take into account that great parts of the recharge flow horizontally in the soil moisture layer and subsequently become a part of river discharge as baseflow and only the rest of it permeates vertically into the saturated zones and fill the groundwater storage based on the etc based estimates there is an indication of a positive recharging trend to the upper citarum basin groundwater storage of 0 45 mm day despite the state of massive groundwater abstraction on the other hand the wflow sbm based estimates result in an opposite groundwater storage change status of negative 0 82 mm day indicating water deficits in the groundwater storage further aggravated by groundwater abstraction although the estimates range is in agreement with grace measures of on average 0 25 mm day with a variance of 1 57 mm day the contrast between the two estimates demonstrates notable uncertainty in groundwater storage change estimate despite considering numerous approaches from measurements to modeling techniques on the water balance components 4 6 the uncertainty bounds of the upper citarum basin water balance estimate to summarize all the above estimates we plot the inter annual time series of average daily estimates of rainfall actual evaporation discharge and groundwater storage change in fig 10 for the wflow sbm based estimate and in fig 11 for the etc based estimate we also plot the first and third quartile of the inter annual estimates to show the width of the inter annual variance of each estimate additionally we plot the average monthly values for each component to show the consistency between daily and monthly estimates from figs 10 and 11 we can see a narrow variance in evaporation and discharge estimates more importantly there are good correlations among these estimates with a correlation value of 0 76 between the wflow sbm simulation and gleam estimates of actual evaporation and 0 56 between the discharge observed and simulated by the wflow sbm model consistent patterns between daily and monthly averages are also visible in these two components from both estimates the wflow sbm based discharge shows a little disruption during september as there are some years when rainy seasons started earlier compared to the average resulting an inter annual outlier of discharge whose values skewing the average in contrast the groundwater storage change estimates show different features a broad range of estimates from 0 82 to 0 45 mm day can be interpreted either way as long term recharging or discharging process from or to the groundwater storage although such estimates are found in the range that is in agreement with grace measures the uncertainty bounds are too wide to enable us to derive a strong conclusion on the groundwater storage status in the upper citarum basin the relatively higher variances of the groundwater storage change estimates compared to the other water balance components shown in table 3 further support our interpretation moreover the pattern of the inter annual average monthly estimates of grace are relatively dissimilar with both the etc based and wflow sbm based estimates and dominantly found in different sides of positive and negative values all these facts underpin the absence of accurate estimates of groundwater storage change despite the ability to accurately estimate the other water balance components of rainfall actual evaporation and river discharge 5 discussion 5 1 alternative of forcing estimates and data sources in this study the results of etc application to four rainfall estimates fig 6 favor the use of satellite based forcing data as they occupy less uncertainty compared to rainfall station based data this is further supported by the concerning rainfall station data quality where suspiciously numerous missing data exist due to an under expected number of annual non rainy days it is also noted from etc application on rainfall estimates supporting previous studies by boluwade 2020 that similar measurement techniques have higher agreements between their products in comparison to data measured by different methods as the considered rainfall data in this study are sourced only from rainfall station based and satellite based measurements it is possible for future research to also observe the accuracy of rainfall data measured by other techniques for example by using radar sauvageot 1994 crowd sourcing personal weather stations de vos et al 2017 or commercial microwave link networks overeem et al 2011 similar opportunities apply to other water balance components estimates 5 2 results interpretation to the field situation the results summarized in table 3 show notable discrepancies among the estimated water balance components it is important to consider nevertheless that the upper citarum basin is a data scarce area from both aspects of quantity and quality although the etc technique is applied to quantify the estimates uncertainty the true values of the hydrological forcing remain unknown in this case etc applications do not reduce the uncertainty of the estimates instead it quantifies the confidence level of each estimate supporting the decision making in selecting the best estimate for each water balance component in comparison to previous studies in the citarum basin our estimates of each water balance component are reliably verified the average daily rainfall estimates between 5 40 and 7 80 mm day in the upper citarum basin is in agreement with the previous approximation by jaya et al 2020 with 6 30 mm day and salim et al 2019 with a range between 5 38 and 7 12 mm day in the same study salim et al 2019 estimated an average discharge equivalent to 4 49 mm day which is well within the estimated range of this study between 3 65 and 5 38 mm day average discharge during dry and wet periods simulated by julian et al 2019 at 3 40 mm day is also closely approximated within our uncertainty bounds however earlier studies did not consider potential changes in groundwater storage in this study the groundwater storage change is estimated using three approaches etc based estimate wflow sbm based estimate and remote sensing based gravimetric satellite estimates of grace dependent to the water balance components estimates of rainfall actual evaporation discharge and groundwater abstraction these estimates result in diverging trends from 0 82 to 0 45 mm day suggesting a high variance and uncertainties in the estimates of the water balance components which eventually lead to a pending groundwater storage change status considering the positive etc based estimate of groundwater storage change increases in such component would coincide with rising groundwater tables which unfortunately are not reinforced by the results of previous studies as they showed dwindling groundwater tables gumilar et al 2015 tirtomihardjo 2016 in his study gumilar et al 2015 found trends of groundwater table decline in 11 wells within the bandung groundwater basin however those wells are located in industrial zones and are used to abstract the groundwater thus the observed groundwater tables in those wells would certainly involve biases in their measurements same findings by tirtomihardjo 2016 also contain similar issues as the direct quotes from his study were groundwater levels in industrial areas are on the decline to capture the overview of the groundwater table fluctuation groundwater table data with less bias in regard to groundwater abstraction need to be collected and analyzed while groundwater table data are point based and often involve biases groundwater storage change estimate is an integrated metric of a whole basin comparing the results from previous studies of dwindling groundwater tables that are in conflict with two of our estimates etc based and grace points to a possibility of spatially varying states of groundwater storage change there could be zones with dwindling groundwater tables while the basin overall groundwater storage is indeed increasing and vice versa a more comprehensive study on the upper citarum basin subsurface processes could unravel the spatial distribution of groundwater storage changes and map as well as separate recharging and discharging area of groundwater storage furthermore by comparing the decreasing groundwater abstraction rate fig 3 with the uncertain groundwater storage change estimates changing trends on the groundwater storage status could be plausible therefore temporally fluctuating trends of groundwater storage state are necessary to be further explored time series simulations of subsurface internal processes need to be performed in the future taking into account groundwater flow and groundwater related data reliability as the gap of knowledge in the upper citarum basin 5 3 the opportunities for future research despite involving some errors and uncertainties surface water balance components are in principle directly observable for example the rainfall and discharge in the upper citarum basin in contrast groundwater abstraction instead of being directly measured is roughly estimated using population data and modeling results from other research the credibility of the available industrial groundwater abstraction report is also questionable since the reported values are significantly lower than previous estimates taufiq et al 2017 hence the groundwater storage change estimate as a resultant of all other estimates is highly uncertain moreover there are still issues to consider such as water balance spatial distribution temporal variance and groundwater flow system to improve the accuracy and narrow the range of subsurface water balance estimates the internal subsurface hydrological processes involving hydrogeological characteristics soil parameters etc should be explored simulated and validated with the available groundwater head measurements currently the continuation of this study is being conducted by collating groundwater related data of the upper citarum basin 6 conclusions in this paper we improve the accuracy of the water balance components estimates and their uncertainty bounds in a highly groundwater dependent and data scarce region of the upper citarum basin between 2005 and 2018 the analysis starts from hydrological data collection to hydrological simulation using the wflow sbm model which allows uncertainty quantification of water balance components as estimated from these data the rainfall data are sourced from rainfall station based rainfall station and saca d and satellite based trmm and chirps measurements the uncertainty analysis using the extended triple collocation method indicates a preference towards satellite data which is supported by initial rainfall data screening that shows many potentially missing data recorded by the rainfall stations in subsequent analysis chirps rainfall data with an average daily rainfall estimate of 7 80 mm day are used to drive the wflow sbm model hydrological simulation using the wflow sbm model results in two water balance components estimates actual evaporation and discharge the actual evaporation is compared to the other two estimates based upon remote sensing data gleam and era5 all the estimates result in very similar values with etc application on actual evaporation in favor of gleam the simulated discharge of 5 38 mm day is compared to both observation data and glofas era5 estimate with observed data of 3 65 mm day endorsed by the etc we developed two scenarios in estimating groundwater storage change etc based and wflow sbm model based estimate both scenarios involve chirps rainfall estimates and groundwater abstraction estimates based upon population data and industrial abstraction literature the etc based estimates consist of gleam actual evaporation and observed discharge resulting in an average daily groundwater storage change of 0 45 mm day the wflow sbm model based estimates on the other hand consist of evaporation and discharge estimates produced by wflow sbm simulation delivering a result of 0 82 mm day additionally grace satellite observation estimates a similar metric of 0 25 mm day with a variance of 1 57 mm day such a wide range of the groundwater storage change estimates reflects substantial uncertainties and knowledge gaps on subsurface hydrological behavior in the upper citarum basin further it leads towards a need for the next research step to simulate subsurface hydrological processes and to validate that with the available groundwater head measurements which is currently being developed authors contribution steven r rusli conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation

8167,study region east african rift valley basin study focus water availability in the rift valley relies heavily on the discharge from the highlands to rivers that run to the rift floor this research explores the effect of land use land cover lulc and climate change on water yield and groundwater recharge wygr using coupled swat modflow which integrates soil and water assessment tool swat and newton modular finite difference groundwater flow modflow nwt the lulc change was analyzed using artificial neural network based cellular automata new hydrological insights the dominant lulc is cultivated land and expanded by 5 to the forest and grassland areas the average temperature and precipitation are expected to rise by 8 11 and 3 6 respectively climate change affects the spatiotemporal distribution of wygr significantly while lulc change has a trivial effect under the baseline scenario the recharge was 10 of the average annual precipitation but climate change is projected to reduce it by 47 53 water yield reduction up to 48 and change of perennial rivers to intermittent are expected in the coming decades the region will experience water scarcity emerging mainly from climate change keywords climate change land use land cover change rift valley swat modflow water yield groundwater recharge 1 introduction climate change and rapid population growth potentially aggravate water scarcity and affect sustainable development conway and schipper 2011 hirpa et al 2019 hulme et al 2001 otieno and anyah 2012 trauth et al 2003 washington et al 2006 because of the largely arid and semi arid areas and less flexible to remodel agriculture based economic structure the impact of climate change has far reaching implications in africa hirpa et al 2019 nicholson et al 2018 in the region prone to climate variability rainfed agriculture dominates shiferaw et al 2014 thomas et al 2019 millions of people suffer from a lack of affordable freshwater and drought and climate change may cause spatiotemporal variability of water availability in the coming decades shiferaw et al 2014 thomas et al 2019 the impact of historical climate change in east africa was reflected mainly in the fluctuation of lakes level trauth et al 2003 and the adverse effect of future changes on freshwater resources possibly surpasses the benefits konapala et al 2020 moreover the change potentially aggravates the effects of other stresses i e land use land cover lulc change and freshwater scarcity konapala et al 2020 therefore studies on basins hydrological response to climate change are vital for the water resources managers and authorities to assess risks and shape management approaches and adaptation measures karlsson et al 2016 lulc change also often shifts the interception percolation river flow evapotranspiration surface runoff and recharge rates baker and miller 2013 li and yeh 2002 schäfer et al 2016 ultimately both lulc and climate changes may alter basins water balance chen et al 2020 gadissa et al 2019 kalnay and cai 2003 legesse et al 2010 however studies focus either on the impact of historical lulc change baker and miller 2013 hirpa et al 2019 karlsson et al 2016 or future climate change guevara ochoa et al 2020 taye et al 2018 wagesho et al 2013 commonly established on surface water focused models which rely on simplified groundwater modules soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1993 arnold and fohrer 2005 p w gassman et al 2007 is one of the widely employed models to assess the effect of lulc and climate change on water resources recently the application of integrated models is getting more attention bailey et al 2016 for example guevara ochoa et al 2020 used an integrated model to evaluate the effect of climate change in plain areas the swat model has a deterministic nature which enables the isolation of hydrological responses to a single variable including lulc or climate change baker and miller 2013 nonetheless the model performs low in regions with dominant groundwater flow bailey et al 2016 molina navarro et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 water yield and groundwater recharge wygr integrates surface and subsurface flow processes and reflect several physical properties of a region including management practices water availability and surface groundwater interactions and therefore assessing the spatiotemporal distribution needs an integrated approach furthermore since the water table intersects the steep valley far away from the rift floor and creates wetlands springs and perennial rivers surface groundwater interaction is a vital part of the water balance in the rift valley this study aims to model the effect of lulc and climate change on the spatiotemporal distribution of wygr in the east african rift valley basin using an integrated approach we examined the historical and future lulc changes using an artificial neural network ann based cellular automata ca model the climate change data were from selected most representative general circulation models gcms of coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 under the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios to the best of our knowledge this comprehensive work used the integrated swat modflow package bailey et al 2016 integrating swat and modular finite difference groundwater flow modflow harbaugh 2005 to assess both lulc and climate change scenarios for the first time besides the conclusions the methods applied data sources and processing techniques and results of this study can be an input to the water resources development and future analogous studies in the region the output may also show the relative extent of the potential lulc and climate change impact on the water resources and the spatiotemporal water availability to the community and local stakeholders towards responsible resources usage and adaptation measures 2 description of the study region 2 1 topography the east african rift system has a succession of several thousand kilometers long aligned adjacent rift valleys bounded by uplifted shoulders separated from each other by relative ridges the rift valley creates two principal fault lines on the east and west side and a third line which runs through the main ethiopian and kenyan rift turkana lows and ends in north tanzania the study basin the meki basin is in the main ethiopian rift valley which links the kenyan and red sea rifts the ethiopian rift acts as a discharging zone encompassing various perennial rivers fresh and salt lakes cold and thermal springs the lakes occupy the rift floor bounded to the east and west by high elevation escarpments and fed by rivers originating from the highlands the broad physiography of the study area comprises a large scale stepped morphology induced by a sequence of structured fault scarps meki river basin is agricultural and has a total area of approximately 3000 km2 forests and bushes covered the mountainous part of the basin the relatively flat and lower elevation areas are agricultural or covered with grasses the topography varies from 1589 m near ziway lake to 3614 m along the western highlands guraghe mountains above sea level fig 1 shows features of the study area including elevation weather stations and towns 2 2 climate and hydrology relatively high rainfall characterizes the rift valley bounding plateaus the high plane has from humid to semi humid varying environment while the lower area is mainly semi arid the basin receives an average annual 1976 2013 precipitation of 952 7 mm around 60 of precipitation occurs in kiremt jun september which is the main rainy season in the region belge a short rainy season lasting february may contributes 32 and the driest season called bega october january contributes the rest of the annual precipitation the annual average humidity and temperature are 49 and 18 5 c respectively meki river drains from the wester highlands and plays a central role in the hydrology of the ziway lake ayenew 2008 the average 1980 2010 discharge is around 10 1 m3 s gauging station around meki town fig 1 the principal tributaries of the river are intermittent and originate from the highlands the basin also has a small swamp abaya swamps around the lower slope of the mountains 2 3 geology and hydrogeology in the region quaternary sedimentary deposits are the dominant geological features mesele and mechal 2020 mows 2008 these deposits constitute the major aquifer systems in meki river basin however because of the thickness and composition variation across the region the nature of the aquifers is highly variable mows 2008 mainly in the escarpment area mesozoic sedimentary formations and precambrian metamorphic rocks at deep depth 1000 m form low groundwater potential aquifers but little is known about these geological features mows 2008 the regional groundwater flow is from the high rainfall plateau bounding the rift to the rift valley aquifers and depends predominantly on the nature of the bounding faults ayenew 2008 kebede et al 2008 descending from the plateaus to the lacustrine deposits in the valley floor particularly near the lake depth to the groundwater table gets shallower the transmissivity also increases from the escarpment to the rift floor mesele and mechal 2020 mows 2008 the major aquifers are unconfined with low to very high potential productivity but the recorded maximum rate is 6000 m3 day halcrow 2008 the geology and simplified hydrogeology of the study area are presented in fig 2 the major aquifers are in the escarpment guraghe mountains butajira pediment butajira kibet enseno kela tora koshe dugda ridge and meki area fig 2 volcanic aquifers in the escarpments cover a large area groundwater development in the area is limited even though it is rich in seasonal and low yield 43 372 m3 day on average springs the aquifer constitutes very thick rhyolite basalt ignimbrite trachyte and tuff rocks the groundwater flow is dominantly through weathered surfaces fissures and fractures this area is the major recharge zone of the basin ayenew 2008 a complex mixture of alluvial talus and debris with depth varying 80 120 m underlain by tertiary volcanic formations represents the aquifer along the butajira pediment halcrow 2008 the aquifer serves as a local relief area and has moderate productivity since the depth to groundwater table is shallow most of the wells are private and hand dug springs with low to moderate productivity are also important water supply schemes for the rural community descending the slopes from butajira pediment scoria cones form a deep aquifer extending along butajira kibet the basalt cones have a thickness of over 100 m in this section the transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity are high relatively but the depth to the groundwater table is deeper the depth of the majority of boreholes ranges 46 174 m from the surface moreover in butajira kibet springs are rarely found and therefore the water abstraction is principally using pump power the enseno kela area is covered with highly variable thickness lacustrine clayey silt and fine sand pyroclastic and alluvial deposits even though this aquifer is majorly shallow around kela debris and fan deposits dominate and the depth to groundwater table is deeper the thickness of the deposits reaches over 260 m in this area mesele and mechal 2020 mows 2008 comparatively in this aquifer high density of hand dug wells and springs are developed for drinking and small scale irrigation supply the aquifer along tora koshe dugda ridge is composed of deep ignimbrite tuffs and waterlain pyroclastic rocks fractures and joints control the groundwater flow due to the depth family owned wells are less meki area lacustrine deposits composed of mainly poorly sorted gravel pumice sand silt clay diatomite tuff and volcanic sand deposits with a thickness of over 300 m form shallow and unconfined highly productive aquifer the aquifer has intergranular permeability jica and mowe 2012 more details of the major aquifers properties are given in the data section section 3 1 3 3 data and methods this section presents data sources data processing and description and setup processes of models five scenarios future and historic lulc and climate change scenarios and baseline simulation represented the hydrological modeling works the baseline simulation used recorded climate data 1990 2013 and a representative lulc lulc 2000 the first scenario aimed to evaluate the effect of lulc change from 2000 to 2010 the second and third scenarios simulated the effect of climate change in the 2040s 2030 2059 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 assuming no significant lulc change used lulc 2000 the last two scenarios were designed to evaluate the effect of the combined climate rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and lulc changes using predicted lulc data for the year 2030 3 1 data the basic inputs for swat to perform hydrological studies include dem soil properties climate precipitation temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed slope classes and lulc the slope classes were derived from dem 3 1 1 climate data the widely employed technique to evaluate the effect of climate change on hydrological processes is to use an ensemble of gcms projected data taylor et al 2012 gcms from cmip5 produce the fundamental data sets for assessing global climate change effects however the output from gcms is usually coarse for local studies gebrechorkos et al 2019 thus selecting the appropriate gcms downscaling to the required resolution and reducing biases are essential for climate change induced impact assessments the gcms selection is commonly based on the capability to replicate the historical climate in the study area asian pacific economic cooperation apec climate center integrated modeling solution aims provides several raw gcms data downloading analysis bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd and downscaling methods ryu et al 2020 sung et al 2018 these are simple quantile mapping sqm and spatial disaggregation with quantile delta mapping sdqdm cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 in this study rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios correspond to mid range mitigation emission and high emission scenario data from 29 gcms were downloaded using aims algorithms the comparison of the raw historical data 1976 2005 with the measured data at 10 metrological stations obtained from the national metrological agency of ethiopia showed that most gcms underestimated the rainfall on the other hand gcms overestimated the historical maximum and minimum temperatures therefore the top three ranked gcms in the respective order bcc csm1 1 m mri cgcm3 and cmcc cm were chosen hinged on the capacity to reproduce the historical data table 1 the ranking was done based on the precipitation and temperature spatial and temporal correlation coefficients overall coefficient was considered for the selection fig 3 overall rank is given in brackets then we used sdqdm eum and cannon 2017 which combines bcsd with detrended quantile mapping dqm to downscale the data from the selected gcms usually simulation of climate change effect on water resources is performed using all selected gcms individually and presents the mean of hydrological model s results but in this study the average data was used for the hydrological modeling 3 1 2 land use land cover and soil in this study the lulc change analysis was performed by comparing the data of the year 2000 2010 and 2020 obtained from globeland30 jun et al 2014 using ann based ca model fig 4 globeland30 is provided by the national geomatics centre of china ngcc prepared from more than 20000 landsat and chinese hj 1 satellite images besides the high resolution the data has high accuracy brovelli et al 2015 in the simulation of lulc change the slope aspect and dem were incorporated into the change analysis and future prediction transitional changes between lulc classes were simulated using ann and ca was used to predict the plausible future lulc for the year 2030 after validating the model using the lulc of 2020 cohen s kappa coefficient cohen 1960 liu et al 2017 was used to evaluate the simulation performance ca is a common method simulating phenomena having intricate spatial distribution ghosh et al 2017 liu et al 2017 ann is a family of machine learning based on the biological neural networks idea and is widely used to approximate nonlinear functions and to create a fitting bond between input data and training targets via several learning recall iterations li and yeh 2002 the structure of the ann based ca model is very simple and the parameter values for modeling are automatically generated by the training process of neural networks li and yeh 2002 the details of the ca model are provided by ghosh et al 2017 the soil data were acquired from harmonized world soil database v 1 2 abbaspour et al 2019 fao and isric 2012 which has a 1000 m horizontal resolution in the region there are more than 10 soil classes with three layers fig 5 3 1 3 aquifer properties even though recently several researchers e g jica and mowe 2012 kebede et al 2008 mesele and mechal 2020 mows 2008 characterized the hydrogeology of the rift valley data scarcity is an unsolved challenge for groundwater studies in the region particularly the continuous time piezometric head measurements are rare the available groundwater head data are mostly project based collected pumping tests or static water levels in this study 2462 water abstraction schemes including hand dug pumping wells and springs were collected from emwrie the majorities of the hand dug wells are shallow and private with less than 300 m3 day abstraction rate while the pumping wells are relatively deep and equipped with a pump the wells have detailed information including well depth static water level and rate of abstraction the geology and hydrogeology were also obtained from emwrie table 2 summarizes important major aquifers properties in the area hydraulic conductivity varies from 0 6 21 m day mows 2008 the escarpments and tora koshe dugda ridge aquifers are fractured the lacustrine and alluvial deposits dominate the aquifer in the enseno kela while lacustrine sediments constitute the aquifer in the meki area alluvial and debris flows from the escarpments characterize the aquifer in butajira pediment butajira kibet and other minor aquifers are mainly basaltic 3 2 model setup and description 3 2 1 swat and modflow swat is a physically based semi distributed model developed by the usda agricultural research service for modeling basin scale hydrological processes changes and management practices arnold et al 1998 1993 arnold and fohrer 2005 p w gassman et al 2007 in this project swat 2012 with a qgis interface qswat was employed the basin was delineated by setting the outlet at the river flow gauging station the hydrologic response units hrus were defined based on a zero lulc soil and slope threshold value five slope classes were used and the basin has 19 subbasins commonly the assessment of the lulc change on the hydrology of basins using the swat model is performed by updating each class of lulc percentage increase decrease via the land use update lup function however in this study since the data have a decade interval the hru was recreated for each lulc data set therefore the number of hru varies depending on the lulc data 1168 1183 and 1195 for lulc 2000 2010 and 2030 respectively the groundwater flow model was built using modflow harbaugh 2005 package of gms 10 0 groundwater modeling system aquaveo modflow is a physically based finite difference model solving the three dimensional water flow through porous earth material currently modflow has modflow 6 and modfllow 2005 core versions and different new advanced versions newton raphson formulation for modflow 2005 modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 was used in this study modflow nwt uses the upstream weighting upw package and has profound advantages over modflow 2005 upw package simulates flow in an unconfined aquifer without converting dry cells to inactive cells when a dry cell encounters the package sets the outflow from dry cells to zero and computes the hydraulic head from the inflow to the dry cells niswonger et al 2011 3 2 2 modflow model setup and boundary conditions as depicted in the previous sections fig 2 and table 2 even though the hydrogeology is complex and geological features with highly variable hydraulic properties govern the groundwater flow the regional flow is from the mountains to lake ziway the no flow boundary was considered in most of the basin boundary and based on the flow vectors around the basin outlet and koshe dugda area general head boundary was used the region was discretized into 300 m 300 m resulted in 25376 active modflow grid cells the fundamental boundary conditions are the river network swamp area pumping wells and springs the swat model generated river network was added to modflow to build the river cells using the river package the top boundary was extracted from dem and the bottom boundary was interpolated based on ayenew et al 2008 conceptualization and ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity ethiopia description of the hydrogeology of the region the bottom elevation ranges from 285 to 850 m below the surface modflow model has several alternative packages lake drain river and general head boundary to simulate the water exchange between the aquifer and swamp areas ponds and lakes serrano hidalgo et al 2021 drain river and general head boundary are mathematically similar and widely used packages the data requirements are also relatively minimal in this study we have used both general head boundary and river packages to simulate the swamp area cells which overlap with swat model derived river network were modeled using the river package the swamp area covers around 13 km2 but detailed hydrogeological data are scarce however the physical setting shows that the headwater discharges to the swamp area and continues the main river course moreover the distribution of groundwater pumping wells at the downstream side implicates the recharging effect of the swamp starting head sources and sinks recharge pumping wells and springs and hydraulic conductivity and riverbed conductance were processed and imported into the model for steady state simulation swat subbasin scale recharge was summarized and added to the recharge package of modflow pumping wells and springs with a rate of 0 76 432 m3 day were incorporated via the well package the starting head was interpolated from the static water level record besides the hydrogeology data provided in the previous section the location and further details of boundary conditions and the calibrated hydraulic conductivity and head are presented in the results and the appendix sections 3 2 3 integrated swat modflow swat simplifies groundwater flow components and modflow needs groundwater recharge as input moreover the current swat model often underperforms in areas wherein rivers get a substantial volume of groundwater discharge bailey et al 2016 molina navarro et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 to overcome the individual model limitations integrating the two models is suggested by several researchers e g bailey et al 2016 guzman et al 2015 kim et al 2008 in this study the recently integrated package bailey et al 2016 was employed the swat modflow code bailey et al 2016 combines swat 2012 and modflow nwt into a single executable package mainly in swat modflow modflow calculates the groundwater discharge to the river and swat estimates lateral and overland flow and routes water through the river network wygr is the focus of the computation exchanges swat modflow has more plausible outputs and better performance than swat molina navarro et al 2019 3 2 4 calibration and validation both swat and modflow models were calibrated before integration the swat model was calibrated using sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 with calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup interface abbaspour et al 2007 by running for 1000 simulation numbers the model calibration was on a relatively less missed data period 1994 2001 the validation cover was from 2002 to 2010 the most sensitive parameters were selected for further calibration processes in swat modflow table 3 the steady state groundwater model was also calibrated using long term average groundwater recharge from the calibrated swat model using the parameter estimation pest package doherty 2003 in gms in the calibration the hydraulic conductivity was adjusted using pilot points with a minimum and maximum value of 1 10 6 31 5 m day see appendix and the riverbed conductance was calibrated in 0 001 27 m day bounds the initial value of riverbed and swamp area conductance was set to the aquifer conductance in the area and calibrated manually the transient state groundwater flow simulation was initiated after the steady state simulation reached to reasonable match with measured data usually the transient groundwater flow model is calibrated by dividing the simulation time into stress periods using long period records however continuous groundwater level recording instruments are unavailable in this study area and therefore the swat modflow model calibration target was mainly the river flow the specific storage 1 10 5 3 10 6 m 1 and specific yield 2 30 were adjusted more by trial and error after the model coupling based on river flow the simulation was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage bias pbias values abbaspour et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 and graphs 4 results and discussion 4 1 lulc and climate change ethiopian rift is one of the socioeconomically important regions and has gone under several environmental and ecological changes abebe et al 2018 abera et al 2019 ayenew 2004 including loss of water bodies due to a combination of geographical environmental and socio economic factors elias et al 2019 the area is principally covered with cultivated land agricultural area forest grassland shrubland wetland water bodies artificial surface and bare land the lulc analysis shows a significant change particularly in the year 2000 2010 fig 6 a the change was principally in the cultivated land grassland and forest coverage table 4 the cultivated land expanded by 5 while grassland and forest decreased by 4 and 2 6 respectively this implies that the grassland and forest lost 36 and 60 of the area in 2000 2010 the artificial surface urban area and transportation facilities was slightly expanded as well comparatively the changes in 2010 2020 were trivial however the drop in grassland and forest areas continued from 2000 to 2020 the percentage of area coverage of the predicted lulc for the year 2030 was moderately closer to 2010 and 2020 data the cultivated land is expected to stretch by about 2 compared with the 2020 percentage cover moreover the bare land and water bodies are projected to increase while all other covers decrease fig 6 b shows the predicted lulc for 2030 the major change areas are indicated in red circles the predicted lulc reflects the changes from 2010 to 2020 see fig 6 b and c the percentage of correctness and overall kappa statistics were 92 8 and 0 78 in the validation of the lulc simulation the selected ensemble of climate models output shows moderate rise and fall trends both in temperature and precipitation data fig 7 a particularly the first and second ranked climate models bcc csm1 1 m and mri cgcm3 nevertheless the average value was used to present the trend and evaluate the hydrological response of the basin the ensemble gcms average temperature is projected to rise continuously after 2039 in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the precipitation rises and drops almost every three years fig 7a the average annual precipitation is likely to increase by 3 5 and 6 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively in the 2040s compared to the recorded data in 1980 2013 even though the baseline for the hydrological modeling was from 1990 to 2013 we compared the climate change data starting from 1980 to include more from the data used for climate models comparison the duration of the observed climate data used for downscaling the climate change and the swat modflow simulation was different because of the computational cost and data scarcity nevertheless the difference is trivial 0 2 the seasonal analysis revealed that precipitation would probably drop in kiremt by 3 under rcp4 5 and 6 under rcp8 5 while the belg and bega precipitation increase by nearly 1 3 the average daily temperature is expected to increase by about 8 11 thus the climate change effect is likely to be felt in seasonal precipitation and temperature changes than the average annual values fig 7 particularly the rainy season will be affected more 4 2 calibration and validation results figs 8 9 shows observed and swat modflow simulated results the simulated daily river flow in the calibration period agreed with the observed flow with 0 65 and 7 74 values of nse and pbias respectively nse and pbias values in the validation are also in the suggested range moriasi et al 2007 but slightly lower than the calibration period performance the model overestimated the flow in the validation period more than the calibration period simulation the biggest anomalies are in dry periods fig 8 but the model also underestimated most of the peak flows especially in the calibration period as mentioned in the methods section because of the data scarcity the swat modflow calibration was mainly using the river flow data and this is the limitation of this study however the steady state modflow simulation was calibrated before being integrated with the swat model using the data obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity the calibrated steady state modflow model result shows the groundwater level varies from 1650 near meki to 2500 m in the mountains the head measurement wells used for calibration are 37 and cover the model area with a fairly even distribution fig 9a the simulation replicated the average recorded static water level well in most of the area around 20 of the wells measurement has less than 3 m head difference with the simulated data however a few wells around koshe and dugda area showed relatively higher differences in the computed and observed head the model overestimated the head these areas have similar geological features and the aquifer productivity is moderate wells from butajira to the guraghe mountains were relatively underestimated this could be attributed to the undulating topographic nature of the area the groundwater level is close to the contours presented by ayenew 2008 the scatter plot fig 9b presents the simulated hydraulic head and recorded data have a reasonable match with r2 value of 0 99 and rmse 6 83 regardless of the discrepancies the r2 value is high statistically in this study the rmse depicts well the model performance than the r2 value even though there are no established clear guidelines for the accepted range for rmse less than 10 is a widely used range e g hunt et al 2020 4 3 water yield and groundwater recharge under the baseline scenario swat modflow was simulated using calibrated parameters to evaluate the average basin water balance under the baseline scenario fig 10 in the simulation period the average annual basin precipitation was around 1913 9 mm of water the principal flow components were surface runoff and groundwater recharge and the peak values occurred in july while groundwater discharge and lateral soil flow to the river had peaks in august most of the moisture was lost as evaporation groundwater recharge and surface runoff accounted for about 10 and 12 of the precipitation respectively the average annual basin water yield was 149 7 mm from which around 76 occurred in the kiremt jun september and 13 in the belge february may seasons the annual wygr plots figs 11 d and fig 12 a depict the wet and dry periods and water availability the region suffers from drought almost after every flood year 2009 was the driest year these drought and flood years were also reported by teshome and zhang 2019 compared with other flow segments the seasonal groundwater recharge variation was significant nonetheless the pattern was similar to the water yield seasonal changes fig 10 the spatial variations in groundwater recharge magnitude match fairly with the water yield distribution in the basin therefore the spatial distribution of the groundwater recharge is presented seasonally fig 11 but not the water yield to avoid redundancy in the basin the maximum groundwater recharge was from the mountainous area around 85 of the recharge occurred in kiremt and 11 in belge season the large part of the region received a recharge varying from 32 1 to 268 1 m3 day while the bega and belge recharge were less than 32 1 m3 day and 143 8 m3 day respectively the subbasins are grouped based on the water yield percentage calculated from annual basin value and classified into very low to very high fig 11d the contribution of subbasins covering the lower elevation subbasin 1 2 and 19 to the average annual basin water yield was very low these subbasins take around 26 of the basin and on average 94 of the area has a slope class of 0 20 the area also had low forest coverage in the baseline scenario simulation on the other hand the relatively very high water yield contributing subbasins covering about 28 of the basin had a higher forest the slope classes are also higher comparatively 4 4 lulc and climate change effect on water yield and groundwater recharge the average monthly and annual wygr in the baseline and lulc and climate change scenarios are summarized in figs 12 13 and table 5 compared with the lulc change the climate scenarios had a noteworthy effect on the hydrological processes a pronounced effect of historical lulc change was noticed in the spatial distribution of wygr than on the magnitude in scenario1 lulc in 2000 2010 the water yield increased while groundwater recharge decreased fig 12 the water yield increased mainly due to the changes in surface groundwater interaction and surface runoff table 5 surface runoff and groundwater discharge to the river increased by 7 and 27 respectively the water yield was increased by about 8 when the forest area decreased in the highlands in 2010 the high recharge areas also shifted to the lower elevation interestingly this scenario revealed that in the study basin the spatial distribution of the recharge had a strong relationship with forest and shrubland the lulc change effect was more significant in the driest and wettest years fig 12a the climate change scenarios scenarios 2 3 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are expected to reduce the water yield by 46 48 and groundwater recharge by 47 53 the lower limit is scenario 2 and the upper limit scenario 3 under these scenarios most of the region is likely to get in a range of very low to low recharge both the recharge and water yield throughout the 2040s may not drop or rise steadily however in almost every three or four years cycle a substantial decline is expected fig 12c under the rcp4 5 emission scenario the wygr will likely have a six year average steady alternate rise and fall trend under the rcp8 5 emission scenario the water yield will not have any distinct trend across the years but the recharge is projected to decline sharply from 2042 to 2054 moreover the wygr distribution relationship with the lulc or the topography will probably be broken the combined future lulc and climate change scenarios 5 and 6 simulation results are very close to scenarios 2 and 3 the average annual groundwater recharge distribution fig 13c f shows a slight similarity between scenarios in addition to the magnitude and spatial distribution effects climate change is predicted to shift the peaks of flow components the maximum wygr in the kiremt season is projected to move from july to august from all the parameters surface runoff was the most affected one in all climate change scenarios table 5 the groundwater recharge will probably drop from 90 4 mm to 44 mm in response to the future lulc and climate changes results revealed that the least affected flow parameter is lateral soil flow the pronounced drop in surface groundwater interaction terms gwq and swgw along with the groundwater recharge due to climate change is likely to break the connection of small perennial rivers with underlain aquifer system 5 summary and conclusion this paper presents overarching modeling work in the east african rift valley basin in the region 1 water balance was assessed under the baseline scenario 2 decadal past and future lulc changes were simulated 3 the potential climate change data were downscaled from selected gcms and 4 the effect of past and future lulc change and future climate change scenarios on wygr were evaluated using an integrated model the lulc change was simulated using ann based ca and the results show that the major lulc cultivated land expanded to the forest and the grassland area in all simulations in the year 2000 2010 the forest and grassland coverage decreased by about 2 6 and 4 respectively nevertheless from 2010 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2030 the changes were insignificant the climate change data of three gcms from cmip5 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 selected from 29 gcms was downscaled using the sdqdm technique in the study area climate change is projected to increase the average annual precipitation by about 3 under rcp4 5 and 6 under rcp8 5 and the monthly peak precipitation is expected to shift from july to august in recent decades the average temperature potentially increases by 8 and 11 calibrated swat and modflow models were integrated using the recent version of the swat modflow package which couples swat 2012 and newton formulated modflow 2005 modflow nwt the integrated model was recalibrated and validated next the simulation was performed with the calibrated parameters and used as a reference baseline scenario to evaluate the hydrological response to the lulc and climate change scenarios then five scenarios lulc change climate change under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and both lulc and climate change were modeled the results show that under the baseline scenario the average annual water yield was 149 7 mm and increased by 8 under scenario1 and dropped by about 44 48 under all other simulations comparatively the groundwater recharge was affected significantly in all simulations except in scenario 1 which caused a decrease slightly higher than 4 under scenarios 2 5 simulations the recharge declined by 47 53 the seasonal and spatial distribution of the water yield was closely matched with the groundwater recharge in all modeling scenarios the high recharge and water yield contributing areas were the mountains part of the region in the baseline simulation however both the climate and lulc changes disturbed this topographic and water flow components relationships the reduction in water yield amount shows the possible drop in groundwater table and change of small perennial rivers to intermittent rivers future water resources planning and management are probable to be affected notably by climate change than the lulc change the current basin management practice could include water conservation techniques and more efficient

8167,study region east african rift valley basin study focus water availability in the rift valley relies heavily on the discharge from the highlands to rivers that run to the rift floor this research explores the effect of land use land cover lulc and climate change on water yield and groundwater recharge wygr using coupled swat modflow which integrates soil and water assessment tool swat and newton modular finite difference groundwater flow modflow nwt the lulc change was analyzed using artificial neural network based cellular automata new hydrological insights the dominant lulc is cultivated land and expanded by 5 to the forest and grassland areas the average temperature and precipitation are expected to rise by 8 11 and 3 6 respectively climate change affects the spatiotemporal distribution of wygr significantly while lulc change has a trivial effect under the baseline scenario the recharge was 10 of the average annual precipitation but climate change is projected to reduce it by 47 53 water yield reduction up to 48 and change of perennial rivers to intermittent are expected in the coming decades the region will experience water scarcity emerging mainly from climate change keywords climate change land use land cover change rift valley swat modflow water yield groundwater recharge 1 introduction climate change and rapid population growth potentially aggravate water scarcity and affect sustainable development conway and schipper 2011 hirpa et al 2019 hulme et al 2001 otieno and anyah 2012 trauth et al 2003 washington et al 2006 because of the largely arid and semi arid areas and less flexible to remodel agriculture based economic structure the impact of climate change has far reaching implications in africa hirpa et al 2019 nicholson et al 2018 in the region prone to climate variability rainfed agriculture dominates shiferaw et al 2014 thomas et al 2019 millions of people suffer from a lack of affordable freshwater and drought and climate change may cause spatiotemporal variability of water availability in the coming decades shiferaw et al 2014 thomas et al 2019 the impact of historical climate change in east africa was reflected mainly in the fluctuation of lakes level trauth et al 2003 and the adverse effect of future changes on freshwater resources possibly surpasses the benefits konapala et al 2020 moreover the change potentially aggravates the effects of other stresses i e land use land cover lulc change and freshwater scarcity konapala et al 2020 therefore studies on basins hydrological response to climate change are vital for the water resources managers and authorities to assess risks and shape management approaches and adaptation measures karlsson et al 2016 lulc change also often shifts the interception percolation river flow evapotranspiration surface runoff and recharge rates baker and miller 2013 li and yeh 2002 schäfer et al 2016 ultimately both lulc and climate changes may alter basins water balance chen et al 2020 gadissa et al 2019 kalnay and cai 2003 legesse et al 2010 however studies focus either on the impact of historical lulc change baker and miller 2013 hirpa et al 2019 karlsson et al 2016 or future climate change guevara ochoa et al 2020 taye et al 2018 wagesho et al 2013 commonly established on surface water focused models which rely on simplified groundwater modules soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1993 arnold and fohrer 2005 p w gassman et al 2007 is one of the widely employed models to assess the effect of lulc and climate change on water resources recently the application of integrated models is getting more attention bailey et al 2016 for example guevara ochoa et al 2020 used an integrated model to evaluate the effect of climate change in plain areas the swat model has a deterministic nature which enables the isolation of hydrological responses to a single variable including lulc or climate change baker and miller 2013 nonetheless the model performs low in regions with dominant groundwater flow bailey et al 2016 molina navarro et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 water yield and groundwater recharge wygr integrates surface and subsurface flow processes and reflect several physical properties of a region including management practices water availability and surface groundwater interactions and therefore assessing the spatiotemporal distribution needs an integrated approach furthermore since the water table intersects the steep valley far away from the rift floor and creates wetlands springs and perennial rivers surface groundwater interaction is a vital part of the water balance in the rift valley this study aims to model the effect of lulc and climate change on the spatiotemporal distribution of wygr in the east african rift valley basin using an integrated approach we examined the historical and future lulc changes using an artificial neural network ann based cellular automata ca model the climate change data were from selected most representative general circulation models gcms of coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 under the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios to the best of our knowledge this comprehensive work used the integrated swat modflow package bailey et al 2016 integrating swat and modular finite difference groundwater flow modflow harbaugh 2005 to assess both lulc and climate change scenarios for the first time besides the conclusions the methods applied data sources and processing techniques and results of this study can be an input to the water resources development and future analogous studies in the region the output may also show the relative extent of the potential lulc and climate change impact on the water resources and the spatiotemporal water availability to the community and local stakeholders towards responsible resources usage and adaptation measures 2 description of the study region 2 1 topography the east african rift system has a succession of several thousand kilometers long aligned adjacent rift valleys bounded by uplifted shoulders separated from each other by relative ridges the rift valley creates two principal fault lines on the east and west side and a third line which runs through the main ethiopian and kenyan rift turkana lows and ends in north tanzania the study basin the meki basin is in the main ethiopian rift valley which links the kenyan and red sea rifts the ethiopian rift acts as a discharging zone encompassing various perennial rivers fresh and salt lakes cold and thermal springs the lakes occupy the rift floor bounded to the east and west by high elevation escarpments and fed by rivers originating from the highlands the broad physiography of the study area comprises a large scale stepped morphology induced by a sequence of structured fault scarps meki river basin is agricultural and has a total area of approximately 3000 km2 forests and bushes covered the mountainous part of the basin the relatively flat and lower elevation areas are agricultural or covered with grasses the topography varies from 1589 m near ziway lake to 3614 m along the western highlands guraghe mountains above sea level fig 1 shows features of the study area including elevation weather stations and towns 2 2 climate and hydrology relatively high rainfall characterizes the rift valley bounding plateaus the high plane has from humid to semi humid varying environment while the lower area is mainly semi arid the basin receives an average annual 1976 2013 precipitation of 952 7 mm around 60 of precipitation occurs in kiremt jun september which is the main rainy season in the region belge a short rainy season lasting february may contributes 32 and the driest season called bega october january contributes the rest of the annual precipitation the annual average humidity and temperature are 49 and 18 5 c respectively meki river drains from the wester highlands and plays a central role in the hydrology of the ziway lake ayenew 2008 the average 1980 2010 discharge is around 10 1 m3 s gauging station around meki town fig 1 the principal tributaries of the river are intermittent and originate from the highlands the basin also has a small swamp abaya swamps around the lower slope of the mountains 2 3 geology and hydrogeology in the region quaternary sedimentary deposits are the dominant geological features mesele and mechal 2020 mows 2008 these deposits constitute the major aquifer systems in meki river basin however because of the thickness and composition variation across the region the nature of the aquifers is highly variable mows 2008 mainly in the escarpment area mesozoic sedimentary formations and precambrian metamorphic rocks at deep depth 1000 m form low groundwater potential aquifers but little is known about these geological features mows 2008 the regional groundwater flow is from the high rainfall plateau bounding the rift to the rift valley aquifers and depends predominantly on the nature of the bounding faults ayenew 2008 kebede et al 2008 descending from the plateaus to the lacustrine deposits in the valley floor particularly near the lake depth to the groundwater table gets shallower the transmissivity also increases from the escarpment to the rift floor mesele and mechal 2020 mows 2008 the major aquifers are unconfined with low to very high potential productivity but the recorded maximum rate is 6000 m3 day halcrow 2008 the geology and simplified hydrogeology of the study area are presented in fig 2 the major aquifers are in the escarpment guraghe mountains butajira pediment butajira kibet enseno kela tora koshe dugda ridge and meki area fig 2 volcanic aquifers in the escarpments cover a large area groundwater development in the area is limited even though it is rich in seasonal and low yield 43 372 m3 day on average springs the aquifer constitutes very thick rhyolite basalt ignimbrite trachyte and tuff rocks the groundwater flow is dominantly through weathered surfaces fissures and fractures this area is the major recharge zone of the basin ayenew 2008 a complex mixture of alluvial talus and debris with depth varying 80 120 m underlain by tertiary volcanic formations represents the aquifer along the butajira pediment halcrow 2008 the aquifer serves as a local relief area and has moderate productivity since the depth to groundwater table is shallow most of the wells are private and hand dug springs with low to moderate productivity are also important water supply schemes for the rural community descending the slopes from butajira pediment scoria cones form a deep aquifer extending along butajira kibet the basalt cones have a thickness of over 100 m in this section the transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity are high relatively but the depth to the groundwater table is deeper the depth of the majority of boreholes ranges 46 174 m from the surface moreover in butajira kibet springs are rarely found and therefore the water abstraction is principally using pump power the enseno kela area is covered with highly variable thickness lacustrine clayey silt and fine sand pyroclastic and alluvial deposits even though this aquifer is majorly shallow around kela debris and fan deposits dominate and the depth to groundwater table is deeper the thickness of the deposits reaches over 260 m in this area mesele and mechal 2020 mows 2008 comparatively in this aquifer high density of hand dug wells and springs are developed for drinking and small scale irrigation supply the aquifer along tora koshe dugda ridge is composed of deep ignimbrite tuffs and waterlain pyroclastic rocks fractures and joints control the groundwater flow due to the depth family owned wells are less meki area lacustrine deposits composed of mainly poorly sorted gravel pumice sand silt clay diatomite tuff and volcanic sand deposits with a thickness of over 300 m form shallow and unconfined highly productive aquifer the aquifer has intergranular permeability jica and mowe 2012 more details of the major aquifers properties are given in the data section section 3 1 3 3 data and methods this section presents data sources data processing and description and setup processes of models five scenarios future and historic lulc and climate change scenarios and baseline simulation represented the hydrological modeling works the baseline simulation used recorded climate data 1990 2013 and a representative lulc lulc 2000 the first scenario aimed to evaluate the effect of lulc change from 2000 to 2010 the second and third scenarios simulated the effect of climate change in the 2040s 2030 2059 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 assuming no significant lulc change used lulc 2000 the last two scenarios were designed to evaluate the effect of the combined climate rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and lulc changes using predicted lulc data for the year 2030 3 1 data the basic inputs for swat to perform hydrological studies include dem soil properties climate precipitation temperature humidity solar radiation and wind speed slope classes and lulc the slope classes were derived from dem 3 1 1 climate data the widely employed technique to evaluate the effect of climate change on hydrological processes is to use an ensemble of gcms projected data taylor et al 2012 gcms from cmip5 produce the fundamental data sets for assessing global climate change effects however the output from gcms is usually coarse for local studies gebrechorkos et al 2019 thus selecting the appropriate gcms downscaling to the required resolution and reducing biases are essential for climate change induced impact assessments the gcms selection is commonly based on the capability to replicate the historical climate in the study area asian pacific economic cooperation apec climate center integrated modeling solution aims provides several raw gcms data downloading analysis bias correction spatial disaggregation bcsd and downscaling methods ryu et al 2020 sung et al 2018 these are simple quantile mapping sqm and spatial disaggregation with quantile delta mapping sdqdm cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 in this study rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climate scenarios correspond to mid range mitigation emission and high emission scenario data from 29 gcms were downloaded using aims algorithms the comparison of the raw historical data 1976 2005 with the measured data at 10 metrological stations obtained from the national metrological agency of ethiopia showed that most gcms underestimated the rainfall on the other hand gcms overestimated the historical maximum and minimum temperatures therefore the top three ranked gcms in the respective order bcc csm1 1 m mri cgcm3 and cmcc cm were chosen hinged on the capacity to reproduce the historical data table 1 the ranking was done based on the precipitation and temperature spatial and temporal correlation coefficients overall coefficient was considered for the selection fig 3 overall rank is given in brackets then we used sdqdm eum and cannon 2017 which combines bcsd with detrended quantile mapping dqm to downscale the data from the selected gcms usually simulation of climate change effect on water resources is performed using all selected gcms individually and presents the mean of hydrological model s results but in this study the average data was used for the hydrological modeling 3 1 2 land use land cover and soil in this study the lulc change analysis was performed by comparing the data of the year 2000 2010 and 2020 obtained from globeland30 jun et al 2014 using ann based ca model fig 4 globeland30 is provided by the national geomatics centre of china ngcc prepared from more than 20000 landsat and chinese hj 1 satellite images besides the high resolution the data has high accuracy brovelli et al 2015 in the simulation of lulc change the slope aspect and dem were incorporated into the change analysis and future prediction transitional changes between lulc classes were simulated using ann and ca was used to predict the plausible future lulc for the year 2030 after validating the model using the lulc of 2020 cohen s kappa coefficient cohen 1960 liu et al 2017 was used to evaluate the simulation performance ca is a common method simulating phenomena having intricate spatial distribution ghosh et al 2017 liu et al 2017 ann is a family of machine learning based on the biological neural networks idea and is widely used to approximate nonlinear functions and to create a fitting bond between input data and training targets via several learning recall iterations li and yeh 2002 the structure of the ann based ca model is very simple and the parameter values for modeling are automatically generated by the training process of neural networks li and yeh 2002 the details of the ca model are provided by ghosh et al 2017 the soil data were acquired from harmonized world soil database v 1 2 abbaspour et al 2019 fao and isric 2012 which has a 1000 m horizontal resolution in the region there are more than 10 soil classes with three layers fig 5 3 1 3 aquifer properties even though recently several researchers e g jica and mowe 2012 kebede et al 2008 mesele and mechal 2020 mows 2008 characterized the hydrogeology of the rift valley data scarcity is an unsolved challenge for groundwater studies in the region particularly the continuous time piezometric head measurements are rare the available groundwater head data are mostly project based collected pumping tests or static water levels in this study 2462 water abstraction schemes including hand dug pumping wells and springs were collected from emwrie the majorities of the hand dug wells are shallow and private with less than 300 m3 day abstraction rate while the pumping wells are relatively deep and equipped with a pump the wells have detailed information including well depth static water level and rate of abstraction the geology and hydrogeology were also obtained from emwrie table 2 summarizes important major aquifers properties in the area hydraulic conductivity varies from 0 6 21 m day mows 2008 the escarpments and tora koshe dugda ridge aquifers are fractured the lacustrine and alluvial deposits dominate the aquifer in the enseno kela while lacustrine sediments constitute the aquifer in the meki area alluvial and debris flows from the escarpments characterize the aquifer in butajira pediment butajira kibet and other minor aquifers are mainly basaltic 3 2 model setup and description 3 2 1 swat and modflow swat is a physically based semi distributed model developed by the usda agricultural research service for modeling basin scale hydrological processes changes and management practices arnold et al 1998 1993 arnold and fohrer 2005 p w gassman et al 2007 in this project swat 2012 with a qgis interface qswat was employed the basin was delineated by setting the outlet at the river flow gauging station the hydrologic response units hrus were defined based on a zero lulc soil and slope threshold value five slope classes were used and the basin has 19 subbasins commonly the assessment of the lulc change on the hydrology of basins using the swat model is performed by updating each class of lulc percentage increase decrease via the land use update lup function however in this study since the data have a decade interval the hru was recreated for each lulc data set therefore the number of hru varies depending on the lulc data 1168 1183 and 1195 for lulc 2000 2010 and 2030 respectively the groundwater flow model was built using modflow harbaugh 2005 package of gms 10 0 groundwater modeling system aquaveo modflow is a physically based finite difference model solving the three dimensional water flow through porous earth material currently modflow has modflow 6 and modfllow 2005 core versions and different new advanced versions newton raphson formulation for modflow 2005 modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 was used in this study modflow nwt uses the upstream weighting upw package and has profound advantages over modflow 2005 upw package simulates flow in an unconfined aquifer without converting dry cells to inactive cells when a dry cell encounters the package sets the outflow from dry cells to zero and computes the hydraulic head from the inflow to the dry cells niswonger et al 2011 3 2 2 modflow model setup and boundary conditions as depicted in the previous sections fig 2 and table 2 even though the hydrogeology is complex and geological features with highly variable hydraulic properties govern the groundwater flow the regional flow is from the mountains to lake ziway the no flow boundary was considered in most of the basin boundary and based on the flow vectors around the basin outlet and koshe dugda area general head boundary was used the region was discretized into 300 m 300 m resulted in 25376 active modflow grid cells the fundamental boundary conditions are the river network swamp area pumping wells and springs the swat model generated river network was added to modflow to build the river cells using the river package the top boundary was extracted from dem and the bottom boundary was interpolated based on ayenew et al 2008 conceptualization and ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity ethiopia description of the hydrogeology of the region the bottom elevation ranges from 285 to 850 m below the surface modflow model has several alternative packages lake drain river and general head boundary to simulate the water exchange between the aquifer and swamp areas ponds and lakes serrano hidalgo et al 2021 drain river and general head boundary are mathematically similar and widely used packages the data requirements are also relatively minimal in this study we have used both general head boundary and river packages to simulate the swamp area cells which overlap with swat model derived river network were modeled using the river package the swamp area covers around 13 km2 but detailed hydrogeological data are scarce however the physical setting shows that the headwater discharges to the swamp area and continues the main river course moreover the distribution of groundwater pumping wells at the downstream side implicates the recharging effect of the swamp starting head sources and sinks recharge pumping wells and springs and hydraulic conductivity and riverbed conductance were processed and imported into the model for steady state simulation swat subbasin scale recharge was summarized and added to the recharge package of modflow pumping wells and springs with a rate of 0 76 432 m3 day were incorporated via the well package the starting head was interpolated from the static water level record besides the hydrogeology data provided in the previous section the location and further details of boundary conditions and the calibrated hydraulic conductivity and head are presented in the results and the appendix sections 3 2 3 integrated swat modflow swat simplifies groundwater flow components and modflow needs groundwater recharge as input moreover the current swat model often underperforms in areas wherein rivers get a substantial volume of groundwater discharge bailey et al 2016 molina navarro et al 2019 wei and bailey 2019 to overcome the individual model limitations integrating the two models is suggested by several researchers e g bailey et al 2016 guzman et al 2015 kim et al 2008 in this study the recently integrated package bailey et al 2016 was employed the swat modflow code bailey et al 2016 combines swat 2012 and modflow nwt into a single executable package mainly in swat modflow modflow calculates the groundwater discharge to the river and swat estimates lateral and overland flow and routes water through the river network wygr is the focus of the computation exchanges swat modflow has more plausible outputs and better performance than swat molina navarro et al 2019 3 2 4 calibration and validation both swat and modflow models were calibrated before integration the swat model was calibrated using sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 with calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup interface abbaspour et al 2007 by running for 1000 simulation numbers the model calibration was on a relatively less missed data period 1994 2001 the validation cover was from 2002 to 2010 the most sensitive parameters were selected for further calibration processes in swat modflow table 3 the steady state groundwater model was also calibrated using long term average groundwater recharge from the calibrated swat model using the parameter estimation pest package doherty 2003 in gms in the calibration the hydraulic conductivity was adjusted using pilot points with a minimum and maximum value of 1 10 6 31 5 m day see appendix and the riverbed conductance was calibrated in 0 001 27 m day bounds the initial value of riverbed and swamp area conductance was set to the aquifer conductance in the area and calibrated manually the transient state groundwater flow simulation was initiated after the steady state simulation reached to reasonable match with measured data usually the transient groundwater flow model is calibrated by dividing the simulation time into stress periods using long period records however continuous groundwater level recording instruments are unavailable in this study area and therefore the swat modflow model calibration target was mainly the river flow the specific storage 1 10 5 3 10 6 m 1 and specific yield 2 30 were adjusted more by trial and error after the model coupling based on river flow the simulation was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage bias pbias values abbaspour et al 2007 moriasi et al 2007 and graphs 4 results and discussion 4 1 lulc and climate change ethiopian rift is one of the socioeconomically important regions and has gone under several environmental and ecological changes abebe et al 2018 abera et al 2019 ayenew 2004 including loss of water bodies due to a combination of geographical environmental and socio economic factors elias et al 2019 the area is principally covered with cultivated land agricultural area forest grassland shrubland wetland water bodies artificial surface and bare land the lulc analysis shows a significant change particularly in the year 2000 2010 fig 6 a the change was principally in the cultivated land grassland and forest coverage table 4 the cultivated land expanded by 5 while grassland and forest decreased by 4 and 2 6 respectively this implies that the grassland and forest lost 36 and 60 of the area in 2000 2010 the artificial surface urban area and transportation facilities was slightly expanded as well comparatively the changes in 2010 2020 were trivial however the drop in grassland and forest areas continued from 2000 to 2020 the percentage of area coverage of the predicted lulc for the year 2030 was moderately closer to 2010 and 2020 data the cultivated land is expected to stretch by about 2 compared with the 2020 percentage cover moreover the bare land and water bodies are projected to increase while all other covers decrease fig 6 b shows the predicted lulc for 2030 the major change areas are indicated in red circles the predicted lulc reflects the changes from 2010 to 2020 see fig 6 b and c the percentage of correctness and overall kappa statistics were 92 8 and 0 78 in the validation of the lulc simulation the selected ensemble of climate models output shows moderate rise and fall trends both in temperature and precipitation data fig 7 a particularly the first and second ranked climate models bcc csm1 1 m and mri cgcm3 nevertheless the average value was used to present the trend and evaluate the hydrological response of the basin the ensemble gcms average temperature is projected to rise continuously after 2039 in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the precipitation rises and drops almost every three years fig 7a the average annual precipitation is likely to increase by 3 5 and 6 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively in the 2040s compared to the recorded data in 1980 2013 even though the baseline for the hydrological modeling was from 1990 to 2013 we compared the climate change data starting from 1980 to include more from the data used for climate models comparison the duration of the observed climate data used for downscaling the climate change and the swat modflow simulation was different because of the computational cost and data scarcity nevertheless the difference is trivial 0 2 the seasonal analysis revealed that precipitation would probably drop in kiremt by 3 under rcp4 5 and 6 under rcp8 5 while the belg and bega precipitation increase by nearly 1 3 the average daily temperature is expected to increase by about 8 11 thus the climate change effect is likely to be felt in seasonal precipitation and temperature changes than the average annual values fig 7 particularly the rainy season will be affected more 4 2 calibration and validation results figs 8 9 shows observed and swat modflow simulated results the simulated daily river flow in the calibration period agreed with the observed flow with 0 65 and 7 74 values of nse and pbias respectively nse and pbias values in the validation are also in the suggested range moriasi et al 2007 but slightly lower than the calibration period performance the model overestimated the flow in the validation period more than the calibration period simulation the biggest anomalies are in dry periods fig 8 but the model also underestimated most of the peak flows especially in the calibration period as mentioned in the methods section because of the data scarcity the swat modflow calibration was mainly using the river flow data and this is the limitation of this study however the steady state modflow simulation was calibrated before being integrated with the swat model using the data obtained from the ethiopian ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity the calibrated steady state modflow model result shows the groundwater level varies from 1650 near meki to 2500 m in the mountains the head measurement wells used for calibration are 37 and cover the model area with a fairly even distribution fig 9a the simulation replicated the average recorded static water level well in most of the area around 20 of the wells measurement has less than 3 m head difference with the simulated data however a few wells around koshe and dugda area showed relatively higher differences in the computed and observed head the model overestimated the head these areas have similar geological features and the aquifer productivity is moderate wells from butajira to the guraghe mountains were relatively underestimated this could be attributed to the undulating topographic nature of the area the groundwater level is close to the contours presented by ayenew 2008 the scatter plot fig 9b presents the simulated hydraulic head and recorded data have a reasonable match with r2 value of 0 99 and rmse 6 83 regardless of the discrepancies the r2 value is high statistically in this study the rmse depicts well the model performance than the r2 value even though there are no established clear guidelines for the accepted range for rmse less than 10 is a widely used range e g hunt et al 2020 4 3 water yield and groundwater recharge under the baseline scenario swat modflow was simulated using calibrated parameters to evaluate the average basin water balance under the baseline scenario fig 10 in the simulation period the average annual basin precipitation was around 1913 9 mm of water the principal flow components were surface runoff and groundwater recharge and the peak values occurred in july while groundwater discharge and lateral soil flow to the river had peaks in august most of the moisture was lost as evaporation groundwater recharge and surface runoff accounted for about 10 and 12 of the precipitation respectively the average annual basin water yield was 149 7 mm from which around 76 occurred in the kiremt jun september and 13 in the belge february may seasons the annual wygr plots figs 11 d and fig 12 a depict the wet and dry periods and water availability the region suffers from drought almost after every flood year 2009 was the driest year these drought and flood years were also reported by teshome and zhang 2019 compared with other flow segments the seasonal groundwater recharge variation was significant nonetheless the pattern was similar to the water yield seasonal changes fig 10 the spatial variations in groundwater recharge magnitude match fairly with the water yield distribution in the basin therefore the spatial distribution of the groundwater recharge is presented seasonally fig 11 but not the water yield to avoid redundancy in the basin the maximum groundwater recharge was from the mountainous area around 85 of the recharge occurred in kiremt and 11 in belge season the large part of the region received a recharge varying from 32 1 to 268 1 m3 day while the bega and belge recharge were less than 32 1 m3 day and 143 8 m3 day respectively the subbasins are grouped based on the water yield percentage calculated from annual basin value and classified into very low to very high fig 11d the contribution of subbasins covering the lower elevation subbasin 1 2 and 19 to the average annual basin water yield was very low these subbasins take around 26 of the basin and on average 94 of the area has a slope class of 0 20 the area also had low forest coverage in the baseline scenario simulation on the other hand the relatively very high water yield contributing subbasins covering about 28 of the basin had a higher forest the slope classes are also higher comparatively 4 4 lulc and climate change effect on water yield and groundwater recharge the average monthly and annual wygr in the baseline and lulc and climate change scenarios are summarized in figs 12 13 and table 5 compared with the lulc change the climate scenarios had a noteworthy effect on the hydrological processes a pronounced effect of historical lulc change was noticed in the spatial distribution of wygr than on the magnitude in scenario1 lulc in 2000 2010 the water yield increased while groundwater recharge decreased fig 12 the water yield increased mainly due to the changes in surface groundwater interaction and surface runoff table 5 surface runoff and groundwater discharge to the river increased by 7 and 27 respectively the water yield was increased by about 8 when the forest area decreased in the highlands in 2010 the high recharge areas also shifted to the lower elevation interestingly this scenario revealed that in the study basin the spatial distribution of the recharge had a strong relationship with forest and shrubland the lulc change effect was more significant in the driest and wettest years fig 12a the climate change scenarios scenarios 2 3 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are expected to reduce the water yield by 46 48 and groundwater recharge by 47 53 the lower limit is scenario 2 and the upper limit scenario 3 under these scenarios most of the region is likely to get in a range of very low to low recharge both the recharge and water yield throughout the 2040s may not drop or rise steadily however in almost every three or four years cycle a substantial decline is expected fig 12c under the rcp4 5 emission scenario the wygr will likely have a six year average steady alternate rise and fall trend under the rcp8 5 emission scenario the water yield will not have any distinct trend across the years but the recharge is projected to decline sharply from 2042 to 2054 moreover the wygr distribution relationship with the lulc or the topography will probably be broken the combined future lulc and climate change scenarios 5 and 6 simulation results are very close to scenarios 2 and 3 the average annual groundwater recharge distribution fig 13c f shows a slight similarity between scenarios in addition to the magnitude and spatial distribution effects climate change is predicted to shift the peaks of flow components the maximum wygr in the kiremt season is projected to move from july to august from all the parameters surface runoff was the most affected one in all climate change scenarios table 5 the groundwater recharge will probably drop from 90 4 mm to 44 mm in response to the future lulc and climate changes results revealed that the least affected flow parameter is lateral soil flow the pronounced drop in surface groundwater interaction terms gwq and swgw along with the groundwater recharge due to climate change is likely to break the connection of small perennial rivers with underlain aquifer system 5 summary and conclusion this paper presents overarching modeling work in the east african rift valley basin in the region 1 water balance was assessed under the baseline scenario 2 decadal past and future lulc changes were simulated 3 the potential climate change data were downscaled from selected gcms and 4 the effect of past and future lulc change and future climate change scenarios on wygr were evaluated using an integrated model the lulc change was simulated using ann based ca and the results show that the major lulc cultivated land expanded to the forest and the grassland area in all simulations in the year 2000 2010 the forest and grassland coverage decreased by about 2 6 and 4 respectively nevertheless from 2010 to 2020 and from 2020 to 2030 the changes were insignificant the climate change data of three gcms from cmip5 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 selected from 29 gcms was downscaled using the sdqdm technique in the study area climate change is projected to increase the average annual precipitation by about 3 under rcp4 5 and 6 under rcp8 5 and the monthly peak precipitation is expected to shift from july to august in recent decades the average temperature potentially increases by 8 and 11 calibrated swat and modflow models were integrated using the recent version of the swat modflow package which couples swat 2012 and newton formulated modflow 2005 modflow nwt the integrated model was recalibrated and validated next the simulation was performed with the calibrated parameters and used as a reference baseline scenario to evaluate the hydrological response to the lulc and climate change scenarios then five scenarios lulc change climate change under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and both lulc and climate change were modeled the results show that under the baseline scenario the average annual water yield was 149 7 mm and increased by 8 under scenario1 and dropped by about 44 48 under all other simulations comparatively the groundwater recharge was affected significantly in all simulations except in scenario 1 which caused a decrease slightly higher than 4 under scenarios 2 5 simulations the recharge declined by 47 53 the seasonal and spatial distribution of the water yield was closely matched with the groundwater recharge in all modeling scenarios the high recharge and water yield contributing areas were the mountains part of the region in the baseline simulation however both the climate and lulc changes disturbed this topographic and water flow components relationships the reduction in water yield amount shows the possible drop in groundwater table and change of small perennial rivers to intermittent rivers future water resources planning and management are probable to be affected notably by climate change than the lulc change the current basin management practice could include water conservation techniques and more efficient

interventions india has invested about us 14 billion on natural resource management measures through various public welfare programs since 1990 wani et al 2011 meter et al 2016 mandal et al 2020 these

pushing the region into vulnerable state rao et al 2013 thomas et al 2015 garg et al 2020a the region experiences frequent droughts and intermittent long dry spells during monsoon and therefore

traditional technique of flood irrigation method which holds poor distribution efficiency and consume more energy garg et al 2016 due to poor groundwater yield and prolonged well recovery period in the region drudgery on women and children is increasing multifold and at the same time the cost of cultivation on irrigation application also increases as more number of labors to be engaged on day to

wells much efforts have not gone towards quantifying the benefits of various rwm interventions on major water balance components such as surface runoff and groundwater recharge cropping system productivity and land use change in the absence of hydrological monitoring most of the structural designs are based on empirical equations and those are not validated with variable topography soil types land degradation levels and land use moreover there are no insights available on how the rwm interventions are helpful in terms of well recovery period and associated energy consumption especially in shallow dug well system inadequate database on these aspects is also one of the reasons for demonstrating the efficacy of decentralized rainwater management initiatives and influence necessary policy interventions to guide prioritized investment in this area in this backdrop international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics icrisat along with indian council of agricultural research central agroforestry research institute icar cafri jhansi established a site of learning in one of the degraded landscapes of bundelkhand region of uttar pradesh india between 2012 and 2016 for an in depth scientific inquiry with an objective to analyse the impact of rwm interventions on i partitioning of water balance components such as groundwater recharge and outflow from the watershed ii irrigation availability and crop intensification and iii well recovery rates and energy consumption at farm and landscape scale 2 material and methods 2 1 parasai sindh watershed an overview parasai sindh watershed is located in babina block of jhansi district uttar pradesh state of central india covering 1246 ha 12 46 sq km of geographical area it comprises three villages namely parasai chhatpur and bachhauni located between 25 23 56 to 25 27 9 n and 78 19 45 to 78 22 42 e fig 1 soils of this watershed are categorized as alfisols which holds poor retention capacity available water 100 120 mm m farmers in parasai sindh watershed are mostly dependent on agriculture and livestock based activities about 75 of total area was under cultivation 20 left fallow and 5 under other uses before 2011 pre watershed intervention period this landscape has low to moderate slope of 1 3 and all farmers follow the flood irrigation method blackgram and greengram are cultivated under rainfed condition and groundnut with minimum supplemental irrigation during kharif season whereas wheat chickpea and barley are dominating crops during the rabi season which was cultivated with the support of supplemental irrigation total 388 dug wells were the source of the irrigation table 1 shows the topography soil type and land use details of the study watershed 2 2 rainwater management interventions parasai sindh watershed was largely suffering from severe water scarcity garg et al 2020a available groundwater was not sufficient to meet domestic and agricultural demand before 2011 to address water scarcity a range of in situ and ex situ soil and rainwater conservation measures were implemented between 2012 and 2016 garg et al 2020a bundelkhand region has traditional rainwater harvesting system called haveli which in many villages is mostly degraded or dilapidated due to social apathy and technical reasons one such haveli structure in parasai village was rejuvenated with a modified engineering design with a storage capacity of 73 000 m3 by submerging 8 5 ha fields at upstream in place of earthen embankment a masonry core wall was constructed such that it could withstand heavy inflow during high rainfall incidents excess runoff was disposed off safely through a masonry outlet this structure acted as a reservoir during monsoon period while it was cultivated during rabi season by draining the remnant rainwater stored in the structure during october in addition nine masonry check dams of a total harvesting capacity of 25 000 m3 were also constructed on the main and sub drains at suitable sites by following ridge to valley approach refer fig 1 2 3 data monitoring and analysis to understand the impact of rwm interventions on water balance components the state of the art monitoring system was established surface runoff groundwater table and irrigation use was monitored as described below rainfall which is the only source of water for agriculture human and livestock consumption was partitioned in different water balance components as defined in eq 1 1 rainfall mm surface runoff mm groundwater recharge mm evapotranspiration mm change in soil moisture content mm 2 3 1 surface runoff out of the ten rainwater harvesting structures constructed in the study watershed runoff gauging equipment was installed at four locations s1 s3 s5 and s7 a stilling well was constructed on the upstream of the check dam and an automatic pressure transducer i e diver model di801 td having capacity of recording 10 m pressure head was placed at the bottom of the stilling well garg et al 2020a to measure outflow volume outflow is the spilled over runoff from check dam i e runoff generating at the respective location after harvesting water in upstream structures the diver was programed to record pressure head at 15 minute intervals the measured pressure head was used to estimate outflow at respective gauging stations i e s1 s3 s5 and s7 in fig 1 outflow was estimated at a given site by following steps detailed below eqs 2 and 3 2 spillover discharge qt m3 sec 1 705 x l x ht 1 5 where l is length of the rectangular weir and ht is depth of runoff layer passing from gauging station at a given time 3 spillover volume m3 spillover rate m3 sec x time interval sec 2 3 2 groundwater recharge and utilization the water table of 388 dug wells in parasai sindh watershed was measured using water level recorder on monthly scale between 2011 and 2017 water table ﬂuctuation wtf method is a well accepted technique for estimating groundwater recharge in hard rock regions sharda et al 2006 dewandel et al 2010 glendenning and vervoort 2010 garg et al 2020c water balance captured by wtf method is deﬁned by mass balance equation eq 4 4 net

singh et al 2014 and garg et al 2020a water table data was converted to estimate groundwater gw recharge and freshwater utilization during monsoon and post monsoon seasons further gw utilization uptake is estimated using difference in water table between november and may during the respective years 2 3 3 cropping system irrigation use and energy consumption area cultivated under different crops for kharif and rabi seasons was recorded for the entire watershed between 2012 and 2016 for understanding the irrigation application divers were placed in five selected dug wells and programmed to record water level fluctuations at every 30 min interval between 2014 and 2016 hydraulic head drops rapidly during the pumping which was captured with continuous monitoring if the hydraulic head drops more than 0 1 m in 30 min pumping is considered and pumping time was calculated volume of water pumped was further estimated using energy balance equation eq 5 5 q p x p u m p e f f i c i e n c

interventions 3 1 1 water balance components of parasai sindh watershed table 2 summarizes water balance components of parasai sindh watershed during monsoon june october and post monsoon november may seasons for the period of study june is the beginning of the water year and ends by may during the following year water balance components were divided over two major seasons i monsoon period between june and october which receives 85 of total annual rainfall and ii post monsoon period between november and may during the following year a total of 79 700 m3 storage capacity was created during the summer april may of 2013 which was 80 of total target in parasai sindh watershed the impact of this effort began to show since the monsoon season of 2013 june 2013 onwards water balance studies over a period of five years showed that the watershed received an average rainfall of 720 mm between 2013 and 2016 runoff measured at s1 i e upstream location of watershed was 19 136 mm and 14 99 mm at s5 i e downstream location of watershed groundwater recharge on an average was estimated to be 80 mm during the monsoon period out of this 19 mm groundwater was utilized in kharif and 63 mm in rabi seasons a large variability was observed in these components between the years depending on the total rainfall its intensity and distribution rainfall received during 2013 wet year between june and october was 1276 mm this resulted in a significant gain in terms of enhanced groundwater table as average hydraulic head in dug wells increased from 2 0 m to 7 4 m which is equivalent to 108 mm of gw recharge it was also noted that dug wells in year 2013 achieved their maximum saturation level as water table in most of the wells reached close to land surface outflow measured at s5 which spilled over downstream was 351 mm constituted 28 of total rainfall of that year in addition year 2013 14 recorded a rainfall of 147 mm during post monsoon season november may as well in the year 2013 14 the amount of net gw utilization during kharif and rabi seasons was 4 0 and 31 mm respectively residual soil moisture by monsoon end and post monsoonal rains largely met the crop water requirement with the support of supplemental irrigation during rabi season average hydraulic head recorded was 5 9 m in dug wells by end of may 2014 compared to 7 4 m as maximum storage which indicates that 20 of the available groundwater was utilized table 2 rainfall recorded between june and october during 2014 15 was 520 mm as this was one of the dry years generated outflow from watershed at s5 and groundwater recharge were a mere 5 0 mm 1 of total rainfall and 30 mm 5 7 of total rainfall respectively groundwater utilization during kharif and rabi was recorded at 22 and 77 mm respectively despite poor groundwater recharge during 2014 15 the parasai sindh watershed did not experience water scarcity as significant carryover storage was available in the shallow aquifers from the previous year the year 2015 16 was the driest with only 404 mm rainfall between june and october average hydraulic head in dug wells was 2 7 m in beginning of the monsoon june 2015 gw recharge was found 14 mm and absolutely no runoff was recorded a total 19 mm of groundwater was utilized in kharif and 41 mm in rabi which brought average hydraulic head in dug wells below 1 0 m 0 6 m year 2016 17 was a normal year with a rainfall of 768 mm between june and october resulted in 124 mm outflow 16 and a significant amount of groundwater recharge 140 mm average hydraulic head in dug wells increased from 0 6 to 6 6 m during the monsoon season decent rainfall during monsoon recharged the aquifer to its 90 potential 6 6 m vs 7 4 m farmers utilized 18 mm and 109 mm of groundwater for supplemental irrigation during kharif and rabi seasons respectively and the average groundwater level declined from 6 6 m to 1 1 m table 2 also shows groundwater balance during the year 2011 represent in the pre watershed development scenario hydraulic head increased from 3 0 m in june to 4 5 m in october showing a net increment of 1 5 m in addition 1 05 m 21 mm equivalent water was utilized within kharif season for supplemental irrigation thus total groundwater recharge in 2011 was 58 mm despite 1189 mm of rainfall wet year 3 1 2 groundwater dynamics spatial and temporal variability of hydraulic head measured between 2013 and 2016 is presented in fig 2 temporal layers of hydraulic head were derived from measured data of dug wells using inverse distance interpolation technique we present hydraulic heads three times i e before monsoon june after monsoon oct and end of rabi season feb for respective years and results for wet 2013 dry 2014 very dry 2015 and normal 2015 years variation in hydraulic head ranged from 1 0 12 0 m on spatial and temporal scale due to a good rainfall during the year 2013 hydraulic head in more than 85 of the landscape was in range of 8 12 m and in the rest it ranged between 5 8 m dug wells reached their full potential as a maximum head of 12 m was recorded in more than 85 wells due to recurring dry years 2014 and 2015 hydraulic head declined subsequently especially during post monsoon seasons hydraulic head by end of feb 2014 feb 2015 and feb 2016 was recorded as 6 10 m 2 5 9 m and 0 1 9 m respectively whereas no difference in hydraulic head was found between june and oct months in 2014 and 2015 indicating that the recharge that occurred during monsoon period was equal to water consumed during kharif however normal and wet years contributed in terms of enhanced groundwater rainfall during 2016 resulted in all the dry wells turning functional and the hydraulic head ranged between 6 10 m by end of october 2016 3 1 3 crop intensification and change in cropping pattern fig 3 a and b show the change in cropping pattern both in kharif and rabi since 2012 the year 2012 was the first year of project implementation represents the non intervention status groundnut and black greengram were the dominant crops during kharif season with increased water availability the area under groundnut increased from 350 ha in 2012 to 550 ha in 2016 the fallow land during kharif also declined from around 200 ha to 80 ha during the same period a significant change was obserrved cropping pattern especially in rabi season area under wheat which was 400 ha in 2012 increased to 800 ha in 2013 and 2015 and it further increased to 950 ha in 2016 area under mustard which was nearly 200 ha came down to less than 10 ha and area under barley also declined from 200 ha to less than 50 ha during the same period wheat crop which is a staple food and the main source of dry fodder straw for livestock became the preferred crop among farmers with increased availability of water resources it is interesting to observe even in 2014 and 2015 which were dry years farmers could cultivate wheat crop in more than 70 of total watershed area fallow area came down to less than 50 ha and about 150 ha was brought into productive cultivation especially in the upstream 3 2 water energy nexus 3 2 1 groundwater pumping and recovery dynamics in dug wells to understand the relationship between groundwater pumping and recovery rate of water refilling in shallow dug wells divers data were analyzed fig 4 a describes the relationship between pumping hours vs total recovery hours of selected dug wells recovery period is the time required to refill the dug well after switching off the pump recovery ratio ratio of recovery period and pumping period strongly correlated with the average hydraulic head of the watershed at a given time fig 4b when the average hydraulic head in the watershed was 4 0 m refer fig 2 the recovery ratio was between 1 and 2 on the other hand the recovery ratio was between 3 and 4 at 1 0 m hydraulic head higher hydraulic head helped to develop steep hydraulic gradient which facilitated faster refilling of dug wells less than half the time compared to before interventions than with a lower head regression line further indicates that with every meter increment in water table the time required for refilling decreases by 50 3 2 2 irrigation water and energy demand diver data generated for one of the wells that supported a cultivable area of 1 8 ha is presented in fig 5 for year 2014 15 to illustrate irrigation application pattern of the 1 8 ha the farmer cutivated vegetables in 0 2 ha and groundnuts in 1 6 ha with the support of supplemental irrigation drawn from the dug well during kharif season whereas in rabi season the farmer cultivated wheat in 1 6 ha and continued vegetable cultivation in 0 2 ha both the crops were irrigated from the same well diver data obtained from the well shows that water was pumped for 105 h in kharif and 355 h in rabi season using 1 5 horse power 1 hp 746 w capacity the amount of irrigation provided in kharif and rabi season was estimated as 225 mm and 570 mm respectively and the total energy consumed was 515 kw h the hydraulic head in the dug well was 7 0 m during july 2014 and it declined to 6 0 m during oct 2014 further the hydraulic head in the dug well reached to 3 5 4 0 m during february and march 2015 intermittent rainfall in kharif and rabi seasons helped reduce the irrigation requirment and also recharged groundwater levels fig 5 during dryspells the farmer pumped water almost every day as farmer irrigated a portion of field 0 2 0 25 ha day by following flood irrigation method and covered the entire field on rotation basis fig 5b and c fig 5d e present a closer view of pumping and recovery characteristics of the monitored well during 03 04 october 2014 and 20 21 december 2014 respectively with a continous pumping of 5 h on 3 october 2014 6 30 11 30 h the water level in the well dropped from 5 7 to 0 5 m it took almost 18 h to refill the well to its initial level it shows that recovery ratio was 2 5 subsequently on 20 21 december 2014 a 5 h continuous pumping between 8 00 13 00 h brought water level from 4 0 m to 0 5 m and it took nearly 20 h to refill the well to its original level indicating recovery ratio 4 quantity of irrigation applied to different crops groundnut and vegetables in kharif wheat and fodder in rabi as measured during the study is summarized in fig 6 a the total irrigation applied in groundnut in different years was 210 250 mm whereas irrigation applied to cultivate vegetables ranged in between 210 and 380 mm in kharif this range is largely due to rainfall variation from year to year similarly the quantity of irrigation in wheat ranged between 200 and 390 mm while the range was between 220 and 550 mm for fodder crops during rabi season the energy consumption ranged between 50 kw h crop ha and 380 kw h crop ha depending on the quantity of irrigation applied fig 6b fig 7 a shows gross irrigated area in parasai sindh watershed between 2012 and 2016 groundnut was the main crop during kharif which requires supplemental irrigation especially during dry spells whereas barley and wheat were cultivated during rabi season with groundwater support gross area irrigated in 2012 was 1000 ha compared to 1600 ha in 2016 irrigated area under groundnut increrased from 390 ha to 600 ha and wheat area increased from 400 ha to 980 ha however irrigated area under barley declined during this period total energy consumption for irrgation during different seasons and years is presented in fig 7b over 70 of the total energy consumption for irrigation was recorded in rabi season as the kharif season crops were supported by monsoonal rainfall the total irrigated area and the distributon of rainfall during a season are the determining factors for total energy consumption during the year 2013 which was one of the wet years irrigation application was minimal both in kharif and rabi seasons therefore energy consumption was 75 kw h ha including kharif and rabi season energy consumption increased in 2014 and 2015 as more number of irrigations were required to compensate the deficit rains during those years and the energy requirement recorded was 130 180 kw h ha the year 2016 was a normal rainfall year which covered highest area under irrigation due to enhanced water availability farmers tended to apply higher number of irrigations as the water levels in their wells was higher which in turn resulted in higher energy consumption up to 225 kw h ha on average 4 discussion 4 1 building climate resilience in fragile landscapes bundelkhand region of central india is experiencing recurring droughts long term climate data shows that the average rainfall in the region has declined by 200 mm over past 6 decades rao et al 2013 garg et al 2020a as runoff is the most sensitive parameter with declining rainfall pattern the rwm interventions can play an important role in mitigating the effects of climate change this region is also characterized by hard rock geology and perched water table is formed during monsoon which is characterized by poor specific yield as the rainfall distribution in this region is highly skewed and the entire rainfall is received in about 20 40 days during a year 80 rainfall mostly between june and october the rwm interventions provide opportunity to hold a fraction of water and facilitate for groundwater recharge in the absence of rwm interventions it is realized that the runoff generated is not available for the upstream users and besides leading to flooding in downstream areas results from this study clearly show that once the perched water table is recharged it can serve to meet water demand in the consecutive years the perched water table also has its saturation limit i e 120 130 mm as water table in 2013 and 2016 reached almost the ground level in more than 90 of the wells and it was not possible for further harvest of recharge water balance analysis shows that the rwm interventions enhanced groundwater availability from 45 mm to 80 mm enhanced availability of water triggered farmers to intensify their cropping system the soil moisture in fallow lands was lost as non productive evaporation before the project intervention with improved groundwater availability these lands and the residual moisture held in them were converted into productive evapotranspiration thereby enhancing the overall land and water use efficiency this study also provides insights into the recovery ratio of groundwater pumping in shallow dug well systems the recovery ratio is strongly correlated with the average hydraulic head of the watershed the recovery hours in treated watersheds ranged from 10 20 hours during different months whereas during non intervention stage the recovery hours were almost double as available hydraulic head was 2 3 m lower than it was in the treated condition this has a number of implications in terms of labour engagement cost of cultivation drudgery and energy consumption the cost of cultivation also went down drastically due to the project intervention as farmers were able to irrigate their fields at sizable scale 0 5 1 0 acre each day compared to 0 1 0 3 acres before the intervention this was keeping the entire family including women and children busy in irrigating the fields for the entire season as the water in their wells was limited and the recovery period was long with increased availability of groundwater irrigated area and number of irrigations per ha increased by 30 50 and enhanced crop productivity by 20 70 this benefit further translated in terms of enhanced fodder availability milk production and net income which was increased by more than twice compared to pre intervention stage garg et al 2020a b the field scale 2 5 ha water balance indicated that the quantity of irrigation applied during monsoon and post monsoon periods range between 200 and 550 mm depending on soil moisture status and rainfall distribution whereas the water balance of the entire watershed 1200 ha scale indicated that the net consumption of groundwater ranged between 30 and 140 mm during post monsoon season this indicates that a significant amount of return flow 60 from irrigated water into the shallow aquifer system all the farmers in the watershed largely practice flood irrigation method which has poor distribution efficiency and more than 50 of water might be returning back to the shallow aquifer system an introduction of efficient irrigation method e g solar photovoltaic pumping based sprinkler system along with irrigation scheduling protocol may enhance the irrigation use efficiency and reduce energy consumption santra et al 2016 santra 2021 however there is a need for validation of sprinkler system in this region in addition as the landscape in the watershed holds up to 3 of land slope and is also characterized by poor retention capacity landform management interventions such as laser land leveling in suitable fields can further enhance the irrigation distribution efficiency thereby reducing energy consumption and cost of cultivation ali et al 2018 the haveli system of bundelkhand region the traditional practice has become defunct and dilapidated in last 3 4 decades holds enormous potential for revival of the region for ensuring water security and erosion and flood control the haveli system holds an opportunity to harvest surface runoff in a decentralized manner so that the catchment and the command area are within the premises of the hydrological boundary in general havelis are designed with 20 200 ha of catchment which submerge 1 10 ha 5 of the catchment landscape on the upstream during monsoon however farmers whose lands get submerged as part of the haveli system during kharif season do not lose much as they cultivate rabi crop using residual soil moisture and with the support of supplemental irrigation which ensures an assured harvest unlike the kharif crop which is often subjected to droughts and dry spells besides the fertility levels of the haveli fields are 30 40 higher than the normal fields due to the presence of high organic carbon and humus which compensates their loss during the kharif season and at the same time water harvested in the haveli system rejuvenate all nearby dug wells sahu et al 2015 thus the haveli system offers a win win for the farmers while also serving the ecosystem garg et al 2020a showed that the unit water harvesting cost of haveli system was us 0 05 0 1 m3 compared to us 0 5 2 0 m3 for other rainwater harvesting structures such as check dams 4 2 comparison with other studies there is increasing interest among various stakeholders to understand and prioritize their investment in creating irrigation facilities for avoiding recurrent crop failures in fragile ecosystems such as the one under study however there is not much scope for investing in riverine irrigation projects in many parts of the country like india which are too expensive in terms of ecological and human resettlement costs this leaves with an option of finding decentralized rainwater harvesting solutions to provide the quintessential moisture for crop production most parts of india that receive an annual rainfall of over 500 mm are found suitable for such initiatives thus this area offers huge untapped potential to pursue sustainable intensification through scientific design and monitoring of decentralized rainwater harvesting systems there are however not many studies on the typical issues of fragile ecosystems like bundelkhand singh et al 2014 described that agricultural water management interventions in one of the degraded highlands in tikamgarh district of madhya pradesh has transformed livelihood of the farmers with improved availability of groundwater for domestic and agriculture sector this study also showed that rwm interventions have reduced land degradation and soil loss by 4 5 times similarly a few of other studies in southern india garg et al 2012 garg and wani 2013 karlberg et al 2015 anantha and wani 2016 anantha et al 2021a show various ecosystem services which were strengthened by introduction of rainwater harvesting interventions in hard rock agriculture watersheds with increasing water stress under changing climatic conditions evidence based solutions are needed singh et al 2018 garg et al 2021 anantha et al 2021b intensive hydrological and impact monitoring needs to be strengthened in different parts of the region which are characterized by a variety of soil types topography land use and land degradation levels this will help in making prudent investments for restoring degraded ecologies to benefit the poor and smallholder farmers inhabiting them in large numbers 5 conclusion the parasai sindh watershed of 1246 ha was developed with various rwm interventions between 2012 2016 in jhansi district of uttar pradesh in bundelkhand region of central india which typically represents semi arid tropics below are the key findings of the study the water balance analysis showed that the parasai sindh watershed received 720 mm of rainfall between 2013 and 2017 out of this 19 runoff 136 mm was recorded at upstream site of 80 ha catchment whereas runoff downstream across 567 ha was recorded 14 of total rainfall 99 mm thus it indicated that 37 mm of net harvested runoff was retained within the watershed due to various rainwater harvesting interventions the water balance components varied largely in over the study period 2012 2016 out of the five years one was normal one wet and three were dry years runoff generated in wet years was in the range of 28 29 of total rainfall 1276 mm which made a significant contribution to groundwater recharge without affecting downstream water availability as the total runoff generated during this year was much higher than the harvested capacity the runoff during the dry year was in the range between 0 10 of the total rainfall 400 630 mm in the normal year of the 768 mm rainfall runoff recorded at different sites ranged between 16 and 27 rwm interventions reduced the downstream water availability significantly 40 mainly in the normal years groundwater level monitoring indicated that the net increase in water table in treated watershed was 4 0 m which was equivalent to 80 mm of groundwater recharge out of this 25 20 mm is utilized during kharif and 75 60 mm during rabi seasons further year to year variability showed that the net recharge in monsoon period was only 14 mm in 2015 under 50 deficit rainfall condition compared to 140 mm in 2016 with 768 mm rainfall on the other hand groundwater recharge in control watershed was found at 45 mm on an average which was utilized almost in equal segment 20 25 mm in kharif and rabi seasons the groundwater recharge in wet or normal years helped to meet agriculture demand in recurring dry years as shallow aquifer system filled quickly during wet years and held it up to two years improved groundwater availability enhanced irrigated acreage both in kharif and rabi seasons by 50 compared to no intervention stage farmers in rabi season shifted their crops from chickpea mustard and barley area to wheat over 100 ha land which was under permanent fallow was brought into productive cultivation the recovery ratio of shallow dug well system strongly correlated with hydraulic head of the watershed with every 1 0 m decline in hydraulic head the recovery period increased by 50 improved groundwater table helped to reduce recovery period to 10 20 h from 30 to 40 h results show that energy consumption for irrigating 1 0 ha land was between 75 and 225 kw h season depending on amount of annual rainfall and its distribution over seasons in respective years the preceding discussion suggests that there is huge opportunity for sustainable crop intensification in the degraded landscapes which suffer from water scarcity land degradation and mono cropping systems haveli renovation system is one of the promising solutions

interventions on major water balance components irrigation use crop intensification and energy consumption and their interrelationships new hydrological insights for the region rwm interventions harvested additional 35 mm of surface runoff in various masonry structures and facilitated groundwater recharge from 720 mm rainfall received the net groundwater recharge during monsoon season was estimated 75 80 mm out of this 25 15 20 mm was used in kharif and 75 50 60 mm in rabi season groundwater recharge largely took place in wet and normal years due to rwm interventions which supported for meeting freshwater demand in recurring dry years increased groundwater recharge helped to enhance cropping intensity from 120 to 180 by converting significant fallow lands into productive cultivation the time required to refill dug wells decreased by 50 with every one meter increment in hydraulic head therefore well recovery period reduced minimum by 50 after the project interventions

challenges of dryland ecologies schlaepfer et al 2017 singh et al 2019 these areas experience recurring dry spells and flash floods within monsoon season resulting into poor crop yield and or crop failure middleton and sternberg 2013 globally drylands are inhabited with marginal and small farmers with about 80 households earning their livelihoods from agriculture and allied sectors robinson et

rockstrom and falkenmark 2015 various in situ and ex situ interventions also called as rainwater management rwm interventions are the package of biological and engineering measures which facilitate harvest of surface runoff within the field and primary stream networks by following ridge to valley approach dixit et al 2007 reddy et al 2018 abbasi et al 2019 abera et al 2020 ricciardi et al 2020 water harvested through these measures can be utilized within the landscape unlike large irrigation projects in which catchment and commands are entirely different which raises conflicts among stakeholders zhang et al 2017 in recent decades there is increasing investment on different rwm interventions especially in asian and african countries by multiple national international and private agencies to support united nations agenda of sustainable development goals douxchamps et al 2014 garg et al 2020a 2020b mezegebu et al 2020 abera et al 2020 realizing the importance of rwm interventions india has invested about us 14 billion on natural resource management measures through various public welfare programs since 1990 wani et al 2011 meter et al 2016 mandal et al 2020 these programs have focused on most fragile ecosystems in the country and bundelkhand region of central india as one of the focal regions gupta et al 2014 teri the energy and resources institute 2018 bundelkhand region which is shared between uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh states is one of the hotspots of poverty and malnutrition covering 6 million ha inhabited by about 15 million people shakeel et al 2012 the long term rainfall data collected for 23 stations in uttar pradesh part of bundelkhand region 7 districts shows that there was decline in annual rainfall of 200 mm in six decades pushing the region into vulnerable state rao et al 2013 thomas et al 2015 garg et al 2020a the region experiences frequent droughts and intermittent long dry spells during monsoon and therefore farmers are reluctant to cultivate kharif crops i e cultivate during monsoon due to uncertainty in rainfall pattern they largely tend to cultivate single crop during rabi season i e cultivate during post monsoon using residual moisture or supplemental irrigation thomas et al 2014 singh 2020 the traditional practices of decentralized rainwater harvesting locally called as haveli system has off late become dysfunctional due to social apathy and neglect sahu et al 2015 garg et al 2020b about 70 80 of the region is dependent on shallow groundwater system for agricultural and domestic use which is largely under stress as these wells are functional for only a few months shah 2009 thomas et al 2014 farmers in the region generally follow the calendar based irrigation scheduling and still follow traditional technique of flood irrigation method which holds poor distribution efficiency and consume more energy garg et al 2016 due to poor groundwater yield and prolonged well recovery period in the region drudgery on women and children is increasing multifold and at the same time the cost of cultivation on irrigation application also increases as more number of labors to be engaged on day to day basis padmaja et al 2020 there are no insights about the irrigation use pattern crop specific irrigation requirements energy consumption and its relationship with groundwater availability in dug wells much efforts have not gone towards quantifying the benefits of various rwm interventions on major water balance components such as surface runoff and groundwater recharge cropping system productivity and land use change in the absence of hydrological monitoring most of the structural designs are based on empirical equations and those are not validated with variable topography soil types land degradation levels and land use moreover there are no insights available on how the rwm interventions are helpful in terms of well recovery period and associated energy consumption especially in shallow dug well system inadequate database on these aspects is also one of the reasons for demonstrating the efficacy of decentralized rainwater management initiatives and influence necessary policy interventions to guide prioritized investment in this area in this backdrop international crops research institute for the semi arid tropics icrisat along with indian council of agricultural research central agroforestry research institute icar cafri jhansi established a site of learning in one of the degraded landscapes of bundelkhand region of uttar pradesh india between 2012 and 2016 for an in depth scientific inquiry with an objective to analyse the impact of rwm interventions on i partitioning of water balance components such as groundwater recharge and outflow from the watershed ii irrigation availability and crop intensification and iii well recovery rates and energy consumption at farm and landscape scale 2 material and methods 2 1 parasai sindh watershed an overview parasai sindh watershed is located in babina block of jhansi district uttar pradesh state of central india covering 1246 ha 12 46 sq km of geographical area it comprises three villages namely parasai chhatpur and bachhauni located between 25 23 56 to 25 27 9 n and 78 19 45 to 78 22 42 e fig 1 soils of this watershed are categorized as alfisols which holds poor retention capacity available water 100 120 mm m farmers in parasai sindh watershed are mostly dependent on agriculture and livestock based activities about 75 of total area was under cultivation 20 left fallow and 5 under other uses before 2011 pre watershed intervention period this landscape has low to moderate slope of 1 3 and all farmers follow the flood irrigation method blackgram and greengram are cultivated under rainfed condition and groundnut with minimum supplemental irrigation during kharif season whereas wheat chickpea and barley are dominating crops during the rabi season which was cultivated with the support of supplemental irrigation total 388 dug wells were the source of the irrigation table 1 shows the topography soil type and land use details of the study watershed 2 2 rainwater management interventions parasai sindh watershed was largely suffering from severe water scarcity garg et al 2020a available groundwater was not sufficient to meet domestic and agricultural demand before 2011 to address water scarcity a range of in situ and ex situ soil and rainwater conservation measures were implemented between 2012 and 2016 garg et al 2020a bundelkhand region has traditional rainwater harvesting system called haveli which in many villages is mostly degraded or dilapidated due to social apathy and technical reasons one such haveli structure in parasai village was rejuvenated with a modified engineering design with a storage capacity of 73 000 m3 by submerging 8 5 ha fields at upstream in place of earthen embankment a masonry core wall was constructed such that it could withstand heavy inflow during high rainfall incidents excess runoff was disposed off safely through a masonry outlet this structure acted as a reservoir during monsoon period while it was cultivated during rabi season by draining the remnant rainwater stored in the structure during october in addition nine masonry check dams of a total harvesting capacity of 25 000 m3 were also constructed on the main and sub drains at suitable sites by following ridge to valley approach refer fig 1 2 3 data monitoring and analysis to understand the impact of rwm interventions on water balance components the state of the art monitoring system was established surface runoff groundwater table and irrigation use was monitored as described below rainfall which is the only source of water for agriculture human and livestock consumption was partitioned in different water balance components as defined in eq 1 1 rainfall mm surface runoff mm groundwater recharge mm evapotranspiration mm change in soil moisture

well was constructed on the upstream of the check dam and an automatic pressure transducer i e diver model di801 td having capacity of recording 10 m pressure head was placed at the bottom of the stilling well garg et al 2020a to measure outflow volume outflow is the spilled over runoff from check dam i e runoff generating at the respective location after harvesting water in upstream structures the diver was programed to record pressure head at 15 minute intervals the measured pressure head was used to estimate outflow at respective gauging stations i e s1 s3 s5 and s7 in fig 1

parasai sindh watershed was measured using water level recorder on monthly scale between 2011 and 2017 water table ﬂuctuation wtf method is a well accepted technique for estimating groundwater recharge in hard rock regions sharda et al 2006 dewandel et al 2010 glendenning and vervoort 2010 garg et al 2020c water balance captured by wtf method is deﬁned by mass balance equation eq 4 4 net

uptake is estimated using difference in water table between november and may during the respective years 2 3 3 cropping system irrigation use and energy consumption area cultivated under different crops for kharif and rabi seasons was recorded for the entire watershed between 2012 and 2016 for understanding the irrigation application divers were placed in five selected dug wells and programmed to record water level fluctuations at every 30 min interval between 2014 and 2016 hydraulic head drops rapidly during the pumping which was captured with continuous monitoring if the hydraulic head drops more than 0 1 m in 30 min pumping is considered and pumping time was calculated volume of water pumped was further estimated using energy balance equation eq 5 5 q p x p u m p e f f i c i e n c

interventions 3 1 1 water balance components of parasai sindh watershed table 2 summarizes water balance components of parasai sindh watershed during monsoon june october and post monsoon november may seasons for the period of study june is the beginning of the water year and ends by may during the following year water balance components were divided over two major seasons i monsoon period between june and october which receives 85 of total annual rainfall and ii post monsoon period between november and may during the following year a total of 79 700 m3 storage capacity was created during the summer april may of 2013 which was 80 of total target in parasai sindh watershed the impact of this effort began to show since the monsoon season of 2013 june 2013 onwards water balance studies over a period of five years showed that the watershed received an average rainfall of 720 mm between 2013 and 2016 runoff measured at s1 i e upstream location of watershed was 19 136 mm and 14 99 mm at s5 i e downstream location of watershed groundwater recharge on an average was estimated to be 80 mm during the monsoon period out of this 19 mm groundwater was utilized in kharif and 63 mm in rabi seasons a large variability was observed in these components between the years depending on the total rainfall its intensity and distribution rainfall received during 2013 wet year between june and october was 1276 mm this resulted in a significant gain in terms of enhanced groundwater table as average hydraulic head in dug wells increased from 2 0 m to 7 4 m which is equivalent to 108 mm of gw recharge it was also noted that dug wells in year 2013 achieved their maximum saturation level as water table in most of the wells reached close to land surface outflow measured at s5 which spilled over downstream was 351 mm constituted 28 of total rainfall of that year in addition year 2013 14 recorded a rainfall of 147 mm during post monsoon season november may as well in the year 2013 14 the amount of net gw utilization during kharif and rabi seasons was 4 0 and 31 mm respectively residual soil moisture by monsoon end and post monsoonal rains largely met the crop water requirement with the support of supplemental irrigation during rabi season average hydraulic head recorded was 5 9 m in dug wells by end of may 2014 compared to 7 4 m as maximum storage which indicates that 20 of the available groundwater was utilized table 2 rainfall recorded between june and october during 2014 15 was 520 mm as this was one of the dry years generated outflow from watershed at s5 and groundwater recharge were a mere 5 0 mm 1 of total rainfall and 30 mm 5 7 of total rainfall respectively groundwater utilization during kharif and rabi was recorded at 22 and 77 mm respectively despite poor groundwater recharge during 2014 15 the parasai sindh watershed did not experience water scarcity as significant carryover storage was available in the shallow aquifers from the previous year the year 2015 16 was the driest with only 404 mm rainfall between june and october average hydraulic head in dug wells was 2 7 m in beginning of the monsoon june 2015 gw recharge was found 14 mm and absolutely no runoff was recorded a total 19 mm of groundwater was utilized in kharif and 41 mm in rabi which brought average hydraulic head in dug wells below 1 0 m 0 6 m year 2016 17 was a normal year with a rainfall of 768 mm between june and october resulted in 124 mm outflow 16 and a significant amount of groundwater recharge 140 mm average hydraulic head in dug wells increased from 0 6 to 6 6 m during the monsoon season decent rainfall during monsoon recharged the aquifer to its 90 potential 6 6 m vs 7 4 m farmers utilized 18 mm and 109 mm of groundwater for supplemental irrigation during kharif and rabi seasons respectively and the average groundwater level declined from 6 6 m to 1 1 m table 2 also shows groundwater balance during the year 2011 represent in the pre watershed development scenario hydraulic head increased from 3 0 m in june to 4 5 m in october showing a net increment of 1 5 m in addition 1 05 m 21 mm equivalent water was utilized within kharif season for supplemental irrigation thus total groundwater recharge in 2011 was 58 mm despite 1189 mm of rainfall wet year 3 1 2 groundwater dynamics spatial and temporal variability of hydraulic head measured between 2013 and 2016 is presented in fig 2 temporal layers of hydraulic head were derived from measured data of dug wells using inverse distance interpolation technique we present hydraulic heads three times i e before monsoon june after monsoon oct and end of rabi season feb for respective years and results for wet 2013 dry 2014 very dry 2015 and normal 2015 years variation in hydraulic head ranged from 1 0 12 0 m on spatial and temporal scale due to a good rainfall during the year 2013 hydraulic head in more than 85 of the landscape was in range of 8 12 m and in the rest it ranged between 5 8 m dug wells reached their full potential as a maximum head of 12 m was recorded in more than 85 wells due to recurring dry years 2014 and 2015 hydraulic head declined subsequently especially during post monsoon seasons hydraulic head by end of feb 2014 feb 2015 and feb 2016 was recorded as 6 10 m 2 5 9 m and 0 1 9 m respectively whereas no difference in hydraulic head was found between june and oct months in 2014 and 2015 indicating that the recharge that occurred during monsoon period was equal to water consumed during kharif however normal and wet years contributed in terms of enhanced groundwater rainfall during 2016 resulted in all the dry wells turning functional and the hydraulic head ranged between 6 10 m by end of october 2016 3 1 3 crop intensification and change in cropping pattern fig 3 a and b show the change in cropping pattern both in kharif and rabi since 2012 the year 2012 was the first year of project implementation represents the non intervention status groundnut and black greengram were the dominant crops during kharif season with increased water availability the area under groundnut increased from 350 ha in 2012 to 550 ha in 2016 the fallow land during kharif also declined from around 200 ha to 80 ha during the same period a significant change was obserrved cropping pattern especially in rabi season area under wheat which was 400 ha in 2012 increased to 800 ha in 2013 and 2015 and it further increased to 950 ha in 2016 area under mustard which was nearly 200 ha came down to less than 10 ha and area under barley also declined from 200 ha to less than 50 ha during the same period wheat crop which is a staple food and the main source of dry fodder straw for livestock became the preferred crop among farmers with increased availability of water resources it is interesting to observe even in 2014 and 2015 which were dry years farmers could cultivate wheat crop in more than 70 of total watershed area fallow area came down to less than 50 ha and about 150 ha was brought into productive cultivation especially in the upstream 3 2 water energy nexus 3 2 1 groundwater pumping and recovery dynamics in dug wells to understand the relationship between groundwater pumping and recovery rate of water refilling in shallow dug wells divers data were analyzed fig 4 a describes the relationship between pumping hours vs total recovery hours of selected dug wells recovery period is the time required to refill the dug well after switching off the pump recovery ratio ratio of recovery period and pumping period strongly correlated with the average hydraulic head of the watershed at a given time fig 4b when the average hydraulic head in the watershed was 4 0 m refer fig 2 the recovery ratio was between 1 and 2 on the other hand the recovery ratio was between 3 and 4 at 1 0 m hydraulic head higher hydraulic head helped to develop steep hydraulic gradient which facilitated faster refilling of dug wells less than half the time compared to before interventions than with a lower head regression line further indicates that with every meter increment in water table the time required for refilling decreases by 50 3 2 2 irrigation water and energy demand diver data generated for one of the wells that supported a cultivable area of 1 8 ha is presented in fig 5 for year 2014 15 to illustrate irrigation application pattern of the 1 8 ha the farmer cutivated vegetables in 0 2 ha and groundnuts in 1 6 ha with the support of supplemental irrigation drawn from the dug well during kharif season whereas in rabi season the farmer cultivated wheat in 1 6 ha and continued vegetable cultivation in 0 2 ha both the crops were irrigated from the same well diver data obtained from the well shows that water was pumped for 105 h in kharif and 355 h in rabi season using 1 5 horse power 1 hp 746 w capacity the amount of irrigation provided in kharif and rabi season was estimated as 225 mm and 570 mm respectively and the total energy consumed was 515 kw h the hydraulic head in the dug well was 7 0 m during july 2014 and it declined to 6 0 m during oct 2014 further the hydraulic head in the dug well reached to 3 5 4 0 m during february and march 2015 intermittent rainfall in kharif and rabi seasons helped reduce the irrigation requirment and also recharged groundwater levels fig 5 during dryspells the farmer pumped water almost every day as farmer irrigated a portion of field 0 2 0 25 ha day by following flood irrigation method and covered the entire field on rotation basis fig 5b and c fig 5d e present a closer view of pumping and recovery characteristics of the monitored well during 03 04 october 2014 and 20 21 december 2014 respectively with a continous pumping of 5 h on 3 october 2014 6 30 11 30 h the water level in the well dropped from 5 7 to 0 5 m it took almost 18 h to refill the well to its initial level it shows that recovery ratio was 2 5 subsequently on 20 21 december 2014 a 5 h continuous pumping between 8 00 13 00 h brought water level from 4 0 m to 0 5 m and it took nearly 20 h to refill the well to its original level indicating recovery ratio 4 quantity of irrigation applied to different crops groundnut and vegetables in kharif wheat and fodder in rabi as measured during the study is summarized in fig 6 a the total irrigation applied in groundnut in different years was 210 250 mm whereas irrigation applied to cultivate vegetables ranged in between 210 and 380 mm in kharif this range is largely due to rainfall variation from year to year similarly the quantity of irrigation in wheat ranged between 200 and 390 mm while the range was between 220 and 550 mm for fodder crops during rabi season the energy consumption ranged between 50 kw h crop ha and 380 kw h crop ha depending on the quantity of irrigation applied fig 6b fig 7 a shows gross irrigated area in parasai sindh watershed between 2012 and 2016 groundnut was the main crop during kharif which requires supplemental irrigation especially during dry spells whereas barley and wheat were cultivated during rabi season with groundwater support gross area irrigated in 2012 was 1000 ha compared to 1600 ha in 2016 irrigated area under groundnut increrased from 390 ha to 600 ha and wheat area increased from 400 ha to 980 ha however irrigated area under barley declined during this period total energy consumption for irrgation during different seasons and years is presented in fig 7b over 70 of the total energy consumption for irrigation was recorded in rabi season as the kharif season crops were supported by monsoonal rainfall the total irrigated area and the distributon of rainfall during a season are the determining factors for total energy consumption during the year 2013 which was one of the wet years irrigation application was minimal both in kharif and rabi seasons therefore energy consumption was 75 kw h ha including kharif and rabi season energy consumption increased in 2014 and 2015 as more number of irrigations were required to compensate the deficit rains during those years and the energy requirement recorded was 130 180 kw h ha the year 2016 was a normal rainfall year which covered highest area under irrigation due to enhanced water availability farmers tended to apply higher number of irrigations as the water levels in their wells was higher which in turn resulted in higher energy consumption up to 225 kw h ha on average 4 discussion 4 1 building climate resilience in fragile landscapes bundelkhand region of central india is experiencing recurring droughts long term climate data shows that the average rainfall in the region has declined by 200 mm over past 6 decades rao et al 2013 garg et al 2020a as runoff is the most sensitive parameter with declining rainfall pattern the rwm interventions can play an important role in mitigating the effects of climate change this region is also characterized by hard rock geology and perched water table is formed during monsoon which is characterized by poor specific yield as the rainfall distribution in this region is highly skewed and the entire rainfall is received in about 20 40 days during a year 80 rainfall mostly between june and october the rwm interventions provide opportunity to hold a fraction of water and facilitate for groundwater recharge in the absence of rwm interventions it is realized that the runoff generated is not available for the upstream users and besides leading to flooding in downstream areas results from this study clearly show that once the perched water table is recharged it can serve to meet water demand in the consecutive years the perched water table also has its saturation limit i e 120 130 mm as water table in 2013 and 2016 reached almost the ground level in more than 90 of the wells and it was not possible for further harvest of recharge water balance analysis shows that the rwm interventions enhanced groundwater availability from 45 mm to 80 mm enhanced availability of water triggered farmers to intensify their cropping system the soil moisture in fallow lands was lost as non productive evaporation before the project intervention with improved groundwater availability these lands and the residual moisture held in them were converted into productive evapotranspiration thereby enhancing the overall land and water use efficiency this study also provides insights into the recovery ratio of groundwater pumping in shallow dug well systems the recovery ratio is strongly correlated with the average hydraulic head of the watershed the recovery hours in treated watersheds ranged from 10 20 hours during different months whereas during non intervention stage the recovery hours were almost double as available hydraulic head was 2 3 m lower than it was in the treated condition this has a number of implications in terms of labour engagement cost of cultivation drudgery and energy consumption the cost of cultivation also went down drastically due to the project intervention as farmers were able to irrigate their fields at sizable scale 0 5 1 0 acre each day compared to 0 1 0 3 acres before the intervention this was keeping the entire family including women and children busy in irrigating the fields for the entire season as the water in their wells was limited and the recovery period was long with increased availability of groundwater irrigated area and number of irrigations per ha increased by 30 50 and enhanced crop productivity by 20 70 this benefit further translated in terms of enhanced fodder availability milk production and net income which was increased by more than twice compared to pre intervention stage garg et al 2020a b the field scale 2 5 ha water balance indicated that the quantity of irrigation applied during monsoon and post monsoon periods range between 200 and 550 mm depending on soil moisture status and rainfall distribution whereas the water balance of the entire watershed 1200 ha scale indicated that the net consumption of groundwater ranged between 30 and 140 mm during post monsoon season this indicates that a significant amount of return flow 60 from irrigated water into the shallow aquifer system all the farmers in the watershed largely practice flood irrigation method which has poor distribution efficiency and more than 50 of water might be returning back to the shallow aquifer system an introduction of efficient irrigation method e g solar photovoltaic pumping based sprinkler system along with irrigation scheduling protocol may enhance the irrigation use efficiency and reduce energy consumption santra et al 2016 santra 2021 however there is a need for validation of sprinkler system in this region in addition as the landscape in the watershed holds up to 3 of land slope and is also characterized by poor retention capacity landform management interventions such as laser land leveling in suitable fields can further enhance the irrigation distribution efficiency thereby reducing energy consumption and cost of cultivation ali et al 2018 the haveli system of bundelkhand region the traditional practice has become defunct and dilapidated in last 3 4 decades holds enormous potential for revival of the region for ensuring water security and erosion and flood control the haveli system holds an opportunity to harvest surface runoff in a decentralized manner so that the catchment and the command area are within the premises of the hydrological boundary in general havelis are designed with 20 200 ha of catchment which submerge 1 10 ha 5 of the catchment landscape on the upstream during monsoon however farmers whose lands get submerged as part of the haveli system during kharif season do not lose much as they cultivate rabi crop using residual soil moisture and with the support of supplemental irrigation which ensures an assured harvest unlike the kharif crop which is often subjected to droughts and dry spells besides the fertility levels of the haveli fields are 30 40 higher than the normal fields due to the presence of high organic carbon and humus which compensates their loss during the kharif season and at the same time water harvested in the haveli system rejuvenate all nearby dug wells sahu et al 2015 thus the haveli system offers a win win for the farmers while also serving the ecosystem garg et al 2020a showed that the unit water harvesting cost of haveli system was us 0 05 0 1 m3 compared to us 0 5 2 0 m3 for other rainwater harvesting structures such as check dams 4 2 comparison with other studies there is increasing interest among various stakeholders to understand and prioritize their investment in creating irrigation facilities for avoiding recurrent crop failures in fragile ecosystems such as the one under study however there is not much scope for investing in riverine irrigation projects in many parts of the country like india which are too expensive in terms of ecological and human resettlement costs this leaves with an option of finding decentralized rainwater harvesting solutions to provide the quintessential moisture for crop production most parts of india that receive an annual rainfall of over 500 mm are found suitable for such initiatives thus this area offers huge untapped potential to pursue sustainable intensification through scientific design and monitoring of decentralized rainwater harvesting systems there are however not many studies on the typical issues of fragile ecosystems like bundelkhand singh et al 2014 described that agricultural water management interventions in one of the degraded highlands in tikamgarh district of madhya pradesh has transformed livelihood of the farmers with improved availability of groundwater for domestic and agriculture sector this study also showed that rwm interventions have reduced land degradation and soil loss by 4 5 times similarly a few of other studies in southern india garg et al 2012 garg and wani 2013 karlberg et al 2015 anantha and wani 2016 anantha et al 2021a show various ecosystem services which were strengthened by introduction of rainwater harvesting interventions in hard rock agriculture watersheds with increasing water stress under changing climatic conditions evidence based solutions are needed singh et al 2018 garg et al 2021 anantha et al 2021b intensive hydrological and impact monitoring needs to be strengthened in different parts of the region which are characterized by a variety of soil types topography land use and land degradation levels this will help in making prudent investments for restoring degraded ecologies to benefit the poor and smallholder farmers inhabiting them in large numbers 5 conclusion the parasai sindh watershed of 1246 ha was developed with various rwm interventions between 2012 2016 in jhansi district of uttar pradesh in bundelkhand region of central india which typically represents semi arid tropics below are the key findings of the study the water balance analysis showed that the parasai sindh watershed received 720 mm of rainfall between 2013 and 2017 out of this 19 runoff 136 mm was recorded at upstream site of 80 ha catchment whereas runoff downstream across 567 ha was recorded 14 of total rainfall 99 mm thus it indicated that 37 mm of net harvested runoff was retained within the watershed due to various rainwater harvesting interventions the water balance components varied largely in over the study period 2012 2016 out of the five years one was normal one wet and three were dry years runoff generated in wet years was in the range of 28 29 of total rainfall 1276 mm which made a significant contribution to groundwater recharge without affecting downstream water availability as the total runoff generated during this year was much higher than the harvested capacity the runoff during the dry year was in the range between 0 10 of the total rainfall 400 630 mm in the normal year of the 768 mm rainfall runoff recorded at different sites ranged between 16 and 27 rwm interventions reduced the downstream water availability significantly 40 mainly in the normal years groundwater level monitoring indicated that the net increase in water table in treated watershed was 4 0 m which was equivalent to 80 mm of groundwater recharge out of this 25 20 mm is utilized during kharif and 75 60 mm during rabi seasons further year to year variability showed that the net recharge in monsoon period was only 14 mm in 2015 under 50 deficit rainfall condition compared to 140 mm in 2016 with 768 mm rainfall on the other hand groundwater recharge in control watershed was found at 45 mm on an average which was utilized almost in equal segment 20 25 mm in kharif and rabi seasons the groundwater recharge in wet or normal years helped to meet agriculture demand in recurring dry years as shallow aquifer system filled quickly during wet years and held it up to two years improved groundwater availability enhanced irrigated acreage both in kharif and rabi seasons by 50 compared to no intervention stage farmers in rabi season shifted their crops from chickpea mustard and barley area to wheat over 100 ha land which was under permanent fallow was brought into productive cultivation the recovery ratio of shallow dug well system strongly correlated with hydraulic head of the watershed with every 1 0 m decline in hydraulic head the recovery period increased by 50 improved groundwater table helped to reduce recovery period to 10 20 h from 30 to 40 h results show that energy consumption for irrigating 1 0 ha land was between 75 and 225 kw h season depending on amount of annual rainfall and its distribution over seasons in respective years the preceding discussion suggests that there is huge opportunity for sustainable crop intensification in the degraded landscapes which suffer from water scarcity land degradation and mono cropping systems haveli renovation system is one of the promising solutions

8169,study region central eastern continental united states study focus groundwater level prediction is of great significance for the management of global water resources recently machine learning which can deal with highly nonlinear interactions among complex hydrological factors has been widely applied to groundwater level prediction however previous studies mainly focused on improving the simulation performance in specific regions using different machine learning methods while this study focused on the impacts of regional characteristics on improving the accuracy of groundwater level prediction using machine learning new hydrological insights for the region a gated recurrent unit gru neural network was built for groundwater level simulation in 78 catchments in the study region and principal component analysis was used to cluster a variety of catchment hydrological variables and determine the input variables for the gru model detrended fluctuation analysis was applied to analyze the autocorrelation of groundwater level in each catchment this study further explored the influences of the hydrogeological properties of different catchments and the autocorrelation of groundwater levels on machining learning simulations the results showed that the gru model performed better in regions where hydrogeological properties could promote more effective responses of groundwater to external changes moreover a negative correlation between the simulation performance of machine learning and the autocorrelation of the groundwater level was found keywords machine learning groundwater level detrended fluctuation analysis principal component analysis regional characteristics central eastern continental united states 1 introduction the groundwater system is an important part of the hydrological cycle groundwater dynamics are determined by physical hydrogeological properties and system boundary conditions such as climate variability and pumping groundwater level fluctuations can be controlled by a number of hydrological variables such as streamflow hintze et al 2020 brunner et al 2017 precipitation newman 2019 and snowmelt huntington and niswonger 2012 thus creating groundwater level simulations is a complicated task generally traditional process based groundwater level models which focus on the physical processes of water movement zhu et al 2012 require strong mathematical derivation ability and extensive information on basin attributes cuthbert et al 2019 these models are most suitable for cases in which knowledge of the flow path distributed state variables or physical constraints are vital however in real groundwater systems the nonlinear interaction spatial heterogeneity and time lag are difficult to describe sahoo et al 2017 moreover several studies have criticized traditional process based groundwater level models as too parametric complex and difficult to use beven and cloke 2012 clark et al 2015 fatichi et al 2016 therefore in recent years data driven hydrological models based on machine learning have been used to simulate groundwater levels sahoo et al 2017 seyoum et al 2019 poursaeid et al 2020 with the continuous improvement of various algorithms the ability of machine learning to simulate hydrological variables has been widely recognized liu and shi 2019 zhao et al 2019 chen and zhang 2020 in terms of using machine learning for the simulation of time series the volatility relationship between input data and target data is the key to determining the accuracy of the simulation results in the field of hydrology the fluctuation of variables is usually closely related to catchment physical properties although the process of machine learning does not consider physical meaning the performance of the simulation results can often be explained by multiple physical meanings brodrick et al 2019 therefore exploring the catchment physical properties that can affect the performance of machine learning has become a topic worth discussing machine learning models have been widely used in hydrology especially in terms of streamflow simulations commonly applied models include recurrent neural networks rnns such as long short term memory lstm gao et al 2020 feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019a 2019b convolutional neural networks jiang et al 2020 kattenborn et al 2019 and genetic programming chadalawada et al 2017 regarding groundwater level simulation several studies have been conducted on the basis of machine learning malekzadeh et al 2019 sadat noori et al 2019 mo et al 2019 the foundation of machine learning lies on a large amount of data hydrometeorological data of catchments and observational data of groundwater level have been used to build groundwater level models using machine learning current groundwater level simulations with machine learning are performed in specific watersheds to improve the model accuracy jeong et al 2020 di nunno and granata 2020 research in large scale regions is often related to remote sensing and its algorithm is completely different from machine learning models that deal with time series evans et al 2020 previous studies have discussed the different regional characteristics of the main recharge methods of groundwater level in the continental united states conus gleeson et al 2011 indicating that it is possible to explore whether the characteristics of the drainage basin and groundwater fluctuation on the continental scale affect the results using machine learning principal component analysis pca is often used to reduce the data dimensions by extracting the main features from datasets pca has also been widely applied in the field of hydrology benahmed and houichi 2018 owing to the diversity of catchment characteristics when selecting the input variables for machine learning models it is often necessary to screen the data to select the most suitable variables for machine learning artificial screening raises concerns over whether the data are noisy which would weaken the simulation performance of the model pca can help interpret the data lever et al 2017 although pca cannot understand the physical meaning of data it can screen out datasets with characteristics similar to those of the input variables for machine learning models zhang et al 2021 normally natural system signals have long term power law correlations schilling and zhang 2012 the results of analyzing the scaling characteristics of hydrological time series using traditional spectral analysis methods have shown that the power spectrum fluctuations of hydrological time series are often unstable and its slope is difficult to accurately determine zhang and schilling 2004 zhang and li 2005 these difficulties can be overcome using the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa method peng et al 1994 the hydrological system behaves as a series of hierarchical filters that convert unstable or less relevant input signals such as rainfall and its chemical concentration into smoother or relevant outputs such as water flow base flow and chemical composition resulting in long term autocorrelation of hydrological variables yang et al 2017 matsoukas et al 2000 used dfa to prove the existence of long term memory of rainfall and runoff which showed that patterns of alternating wet and dry spells in the basin rather than the actual rainfall intensity controlled the autocorrelation of rainfall in terms of groundwater level dfa has been used to analyze fluctuation autocorrelation liang and zhang 2013 2015 li and zhang 2007 understanding the temporal changes in groundwater level is of great importance for hydrological prediction especially for understanding more frequent extreme hydrological events sagarika et al 2014 whether this property can be reflected in the performance of machine learning in predicting groundwater level is worth exploring the purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of machine learning in groundwater level simulation in combination with catchment characteristics and autocorrelation of groundwater level traditional groundwater models reasonably use the physical properties of catchments as the basis and parameters and the model settings can reflect regional characteristics li et al 2017 if the physical constraints of the catchment are not implemented the impacts of the regional characteristics and fluctuation properties of groundwater level on machine learning can only be reflected in the model performance this study built a gated recurrent unit gru neural network model to simulate groundwater levels for 78 wells catchments in the central eastern conus pca was used to determine the input variables for the gru model dfa was used to detect groundwater level autocorrelation in each well while exploring the applicability of machine learning to groundwater level simulation this study also summarized the common characteristics that are suitable for machine learning that is which common catchment physical properties are the key parameters for obtaining better simulation results using machine learning exploring the commonalities of these properties will guide the choice of implanting the physical constraints of groundwater into machine learning models and will help explore the use of machine learning simulations for groundwater level in ungauged areas 2 study area and data based on the u s geological survey https www usgs gov the conus is divided into 18 major watersheds as shown in the subplot of fig 1 in the order from 1 to 18 the watersheds are as follows new england region mid atlantic region south atlantic gulf region great lakes region ohio region tennessee region upper mississippi region lower mississippi region south red rainy region missouri region arkansas white red region texas gulf region rio grande region upper colorado region lower colorado region great basin region pacific northwest region and california region each major watershed contains either the drainage area of a major river or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers this study focused on 78 catchments from 10 major watersheds located in the central eastern conus shown in the subplot of fig 1 the experimental data for the analysis consisted of two datasets the first dataset was from the publicly available catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset issued by the national center for atmospheric research addor et al 2017 newman et al 2015 including basin averaged daily hydrometeorological forcing data daily streamflow observations and catchment attributes for 671 catchments across the conus with minimal human disturbance each catchment is represented by a unique hydrologic unit code huc most of the data in the camels were recorded from 1980 to 2014 in this study 78 of 671 catchments from the camels dataset were selected for further analysis fig 1 the catchment attributes used for the regional analysis included climate index soil and geological characteristics table s1 these catchment attributes were derived and summarized from publicly available products such as climate data and remote sensing products over conus which were either exact or in close approximation the second dataset was the freely available daily average groundwater level data of 78 monitoring wells collected and compiled by the u s geological survey these wells should meet two principles first they must be the monitoring wells that were closest to the corresponding hydrological monitoring stations that recorded the daily streamflow data we recognized that the groundwater catchment area and streamflow catchment area did not perfectly overlap however among these 78 catchments compared with the average catchment area of 800 km2 the average distance of 24 km between monitoring wells and hydrological monitoring stations was sufficiently small to ensure that groundwater was affected by the hydrometeorological factors from the corresponding camels catchment second the selected monitoring wells must have daily groundwater level data for 25 30 consecutive years from 1980 to 2014 because a large amount of groundwater level data could not match the time scale of the camels dataset the lower limit of 25 years was set to ensure that there were enough monitoring wells available while also ensuring that each monitoring well provided enough data for efficiently performing machine learning in addition we set the upper limit as 30 years to control the differences in time scale among monitoring wells so that the machine learning results were comparable since the streamflow data in the camels dataset was from catchment with minimal human impact groundwater level data we collected should also be least affected by human activities however most of the wells we collected in the western part especially in california region are in urban areas those wells are obviously affected by human activities such as pumping the number of eligible wells in those regions is not enough to represent the regional characteristics as a result we only focused on 78 catchments from 10 major watersheds in the central eastern conus 3 methodology 3 1 gru before introducing a gru neural network we first described rnn and lstm because the structure of gru is relatively similar to that of lstm in addition both lstm and gru networks are updated versions of the rnn with the same fundamental framework an rnn is a type of artificial neural network that uses sequential data or time series data fig 2 b shows the basic structure of the traditional rnn the key point of the rnn structure is the concept of hidden state h t which is calculated from the hidden state at time step t 1 h t 1 and the input vector x t using the following formula 1 h t t a n h u x t w h t 1 b where t a n h is an activation function called the hyperbolic tangent u and w are weight matrices and b is a bias vector because the rnn output is determined by the current input vector and the hidden state of the previous time step theoretically regardless of how long the time series is rnn can make use of all the information from the previous time steps however owing to the gradient vanishing and explosion problems which means that the rnn output is only determined by the hidden states and input vectors from a few time steps before rnn performs poorly in case of long time series simulations to solve the gradient vanishing and explosion problems lstm was first introduced for language processing hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 owing to its excellent long and short term memory ability in time series lstm has been widely used in diverse fields to solve time series forecasting problems lstm neural networks have a chain structure similar to that of a traditional rnn but the internal operations in the lstm cells are more complex which enables lstm to learn long and short term dependencies the core of the lstm structure is shown in fig 2 c it consists of three gates an input gate a forget gate and an output gate these three gates are input data filters fischer and krauss 2018 to adjust the cell and hidden states the input gate determines which information will be stored in the cell state the forget gate determines which information will be deleted from the cell state and the output gate determines which data will be provided as an output from the cell state of the current time step the operation method for the internal structure of the lstm is summarized as follows 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 4 c t ˆ tan h w c h t 1 x t b c 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 6 c t f t c t 1 i t c t ˆ 7 h t o t t a n h c t where σ is the logistic sigmoidal function is the element wise multiplication of two vectors w i w f w c and w o are the network weight matrices b i b f b c and b o are bias vectors and f t i t and o t are activation vectors for the forget gate input gate and output gate respectively lstm has been proven to be an efficient method for long time series predictions kratzert et al 2019a feng et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 2021 however owing to the complexity of the structure lstm often takes a long time to process data to simplify the lstm structure while maintaining the advantages of long and short term memory ability gru neural networks fig 2 d were proposed by cho et al 2014 compared with lstm gru improves the computational efficiency by decreasing the number of calculating parameters while the simulation results remain the same or are improved the computational workflow of the gru is summarized as follows 8 z t σ w z x t h t 1 b z 9 r t σ w r x t h t 1 b r 10 h t ˆ tanh w h x t u h r t h t 1 b h 11 h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t ˆ where w and b are the weight matrices and bias vectors respectively z t and r t are the update and rese gates activation vectors respectively h t ˆ is the potential update vector and σ and tanh are the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions respectively recently several studies have shown that gru has an efficiency comparable to that of lstm ayzel and heistermann 2021 gao et al 2020 thus gru is an alternative to lstm owing to the reduction in computational complexity this study does not focus on comparing the simulation performances of lstm and gru thus gru was selected as the standard machine learning method because of the lower computation cost this study divided all time series data into two sets 80 data were used for model training and the remaining 20 for model validation when building the model we referred to several similar successful cases from previous studies these studies either used the same camels dataset feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019a 2019b jiang et al 2020 or a dataset with a similar time series scale zhang et al 2021 these studies were consistent in the structure of the neural network two layers of core neural networks with advanced algorithms such as lstm cnn and gru and one fully connected neural network to facilitate the output we also performed bias variance trade off experiments with different model structures to determine the framework the model structure proposed in fig 2 a shows the best simulation performance for the collected dataset precipitation and streamflow data were set as input data for the machine learning model and the two gru layers were the core of the model according to the simulation results from numerous computational experiments we set the first gru with an output dimension of 16 and the second with an output dimension of 8 we selected the commonly used rectified linear unit as the activation function we inserted a dropout layer between the two gru layers with a dropout rate of 0 5 based on our previous experience to prevent potential overfitting problems during the training process finally we added a standard full connection layer to provide the simulation results when compiling the layers we chose rmsprop as the optimizer and mae as the loss function the gru model was coded using python 3 6 we used keras as the coding api and tensorflow 1 4 as the machine learning backend the performance of the gru model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse 12 n s e 1 i 1 n q s q o 2 i 1 n q o q o 2 where q s q o and q o are the simulated observed and mean observed groundwater levels respectively nse is widely used for hydrological model assessments and ranges from to 1 the closer the nse is to 1 the better the simulation result 3 2 pca pca has been an important and widely used method for data mining since its introduction by pearson 1901 pca simplifies the complexity of high dimensional data while retaining the trends and patterns of the original data pca transforms high dimensional data into data with fewer dimensions the transformed data serves as a summary of features keeping the variance of the dataset that contributes the most zhang et al 2021 pca uses orthogonal transformation to transform the original random vector related to its component into a new random vector that is not related to the original component this can be represented algebraically by transforming the covariance matrix of the original random vector into a diagonal array and geometrically by transforming the original coordinate system into a new orthogonal coordinate system making it point to several orthogonal directions where the samples are most widely dispersed then the high dimensional variable system is reduced in dimensionality so that it can be converted into a low dimensional variable system while retaining the features of the original system the basic steps of pca are as follows hotelling 1933 1 centralize the data centralization refers to subtracting the average value of the dataset from the data in the dataset the purpose of centralization is to increase the training speed 2 calculate the covariance matrix of the characteristics of the n dimensional data 3 calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix 4 select the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest k eigenvalues 5 project the sample points onto the selected feature vector in this way pca can map n dimensional data features to k dimensional data k n this k dimensional data is the reconstructed feature of the original data that is the principal components of the original dataset pca can be regarded as a machine learning method this study used six variables precipitation streamflow daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure from the camels dataset and groundwater level data to form the initial seven dimensional data pca was used to determine the similarities among the groups of data we then used this as a guideline for the selection of the input variables of the gru model to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using machine learning or physical meaning to guide the selection of input data 3 3 dfa generally groundwater level fluctuation which is affected by natural dynamic forcing factors such as precipitation shows a characteristic of long term autocorrelation power spectrum analysis and dfa are often used to calculate the autocorrelation function of a time series subject to long term correlation owing to the highly non stationary nature of some hydrological signals e g rainfall power spectrum analysis often produces spurious results matsoukas et al 2000 hence in this study dfa was used to analyze the autocorrelations of hydrological signals dfa was first proposed for the study of dna sequences peng et al 1994 this method is suitable for analyzing the long term memory of non stationary time series because it can eliminate trend components in a time series sequence derived from seasonality and periodic factors the noise and data non stationarity in the hydrological sequence affect the calculation of the correlation function after removing the trend representing the external driving force the remaining fluctuations are the real responses of the system to the outside world the specific steps of dfa were as follows first we divided the time series data into n m n m non overlapping subintervals the length of each subinterval was m because the length of the time series n was not necessarily an integer multiple of the subinterval length m there could be unused data to ensure the integrity of the data we reversed the order of the time series and repeated the former step assuming that the time series of the original data on the j th subinterval can be expressed as x j i i 1 2 m we used the k th order polynomial x ˆ j k i to fit x j i with the least squares method x ˆ j k i is the local trend function and is used to represent the general trend of a time series in the local subinterval depending on the k value they were termed the k th order dfa method in this study we adopted the second order dfa method because it is the most suitable method for identifying the long memory of deseasonalized hydrological data yang and bowling 2014 chen et al 2019 after eliminating the time series trend on the j th subinterval by x ˆ j k i the detrended time series on the interval can be obtained as z j i x j i x ˆ j k i i 1 2 m then we calculated the square mean of the detrended time series data on the subinterval as follows 13 f 2 j 1 m i 1 n m z j 2 i then we calculated the square root of the mean of the n m subintervals of the entire original time series data as follows 14 f m 1 n m j 1 n m f 2 j 1 2 m α f m changes with the fractal length m and the slope α was fitted after calculating the logarithm of f m and m 15 α l o g f m log m the autocorrelation of the time series increases when α increases when α 0 5 the time series would show no autocorrelation when 0 5 α 1 the time series could be regarded as a stationary fluctuating time series when 1 α the time series was regarded as a non stationary fractal brownian process koscielny bunde et al 2006 compared the results of using power spectrum analysis wave analysis fa and dfa to process 23 flow data and found that due to statistical errors when m n 4 dfa is inaccurate thus in this study we used the dfa method with a minimum m 4 and a maximum m n 4 for analysis 4 results 4 1 pca results we randomly selected data from nine catchments for pca evaluation each group of data consisted of seven variables i e precipitation streamflow groundwater level daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure from a specific catchment fig 3 shows the 2 dimensional pca results in general pc1 represents approximately 40 50 and pc2 represents approximately 20 25 of the features for the specific dataset the data similarity of the seven variables can be clearly seen in fig 3 the features of daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure were similar which could be better described by pc1 in contrast pc2 could better describe the features of precipitation and streamflow in addition for most groundwater level data the features could be better represented by pc2 therefore the groundwater level data were more similar to the streamflow and precipitation data indicating that the precipitation and streamflow data should be selected as the input forcing for the gru model moreover most groundwater level data showed a negative relationship with pc1 thus the daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure data were not selected for the gru model because these variables could disturb the machine learning process 4 2 gru model simulation results for groundwater level we applied the gru model to simulate the groundwater level of 78 catchments in 10 major watersheds in the central eastern conus which are rarely disturbed by human effects after properly adjusting the parameters and hyperparameters such as the epoch and batch size the average nse ranged from 0 85 to 0 261 with a mean value of 0 478 table 1 we also recorded the delay times between the simulation results and observations and two explanations for the delay times are as follows first optimized rnn models such as lstm and gru are based on a regression algorithm which means that the model might use the value at time t 1 or t 2 as the prediction value to minimize error in such a case the model can be optimized by adding more gru layers however considering overfitting problems we chose two gru layers to achieve the best model performance thus the delay effect from the lstm and gru models is ineluctable in machine learning for time series prediction feng et al 2020 second owing to the slow flow rate of water in the underground layers the response of groundwater to external signals will have a delay effect because there are obvious spatial differences between streamflow observation stations and groundwater wells among the 78 catchments we believe that the second cause was the main reason for the delay effect in this study fig 4 shows the simulation results of the best simulated catchment for each of the 10 major watersheds the gru model performed better for simulating the fluctuation trend of the groundwater level than the extreme points of the groundwater level simulations in the lower mississippi and missouri regions showed higher accuracies whereas those in the new england and great lakes regions were less precise fig 5 shows the worst simulation results for each of the 10 major watersheds apparently for most cases in fig 5 the fluctuation range of simulated groundwater level failed to match the observations this means that although the proposed machine leaning model could learn the groundwater fluctuation pattern from training process there is still much room for improving the simulation accuracy fig 6 shows the nse distributions for the 78 catchments two obvious regional patterns were identified simulations of the coastal regions such as the new england region average nse 0 319 mid atlantic region average nse 0 401 and south atlantic gulf region average nse 0 448 performed worse than simulations of the inland regions such as the upper mississippi region average nse 0 635 lower mississippi region average nse 0 669 and arkansas white red region average nse 0 684 and simulations of the southern regions such as the lower mississippi region average nse 0 669 and south atlantic gulf region average nse 0 448 performed better than those of the northern regions such as the new england region average nse 0 319 and great lakes region average nse 0 322 overall we migrated the successful machine learning building experience from surface water simulation gao et al 2020 feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019a 2019b to the groundwater part and the proposed machine learning methods could provide fairly satisfying results the proposed framework could provide an alternative on traditional groundwater simulation which usually considered it as solving two or three dimensional mathematical problems li et al 2017 mo et al 2017 different from the previous groundwater studies on applying machine learning on a single well detected region jeong et al 2020 di nunno and granata 2020 we explored the possibility to build up a unified groundwater machine learning framework for a larger scale the results also illustrated regional differences of the performance of machine learning model nevertheless according to the simulation results for different regions the most significant limitation of this study was that the proposed framework failed to interpret the physical processes for instance the reason for the poor simulation performance in cold areas such as new england region and great lakes region is that snowfall and rainfall were treated uniformly indicating that the natural snowmelt process could not be reflected in the neural networks the power of machine learning model with physical constraints has been presented in surface water simulation jiang et al 2020 therefore combination of groundwater related physical processes and machine learning algorithm will be an important way to improve the simulation ability on groundwater level in the future 4 3 dfa results the results of the overall dfa for the groundwater level had a distribution of α between 1 391 and 0 818 indicating that the groundwater level in these catchments fluctuated between stationary and non stationary moreover this study compared the autocorrelation of precipitation streamflow and groundwater levels according to the gru model simulation results we randomly chose three catchments with low huc 06921070 median huc 03026500 and high huc 07014500 nse values to compare the autocorrelation for precipitation streamflow and groundwater level fig 7 shows that the groundwater level had the strongest autocorrelation among the three factors there was a significant increase in the autocorrelation for the groundwater level compared with that for precipitation and streamflow moreover precipitation and streamflow contained the characteristics of time series with stationary and relatively weak autocorrelation whereas the groundwater level showed a stronger long term autocorrelation 5 discussion in this section we discuss the influences of catchment characteristics and groundwater level autocorrelation on the simulation performance of the machine learning model using precipitation and streamflow as input data the catchment characteristics data were from the camels dataset addor et al 2017 and the results of gru simulation dfa analysis and pca analysis are presented in the previous sections for the catchment characteristics shown in figs 8 and 9 we clustered the discussions based on the ranges and types of characteristics as a result four hydrometeorological panels with different emphasis were listed in fig 8 while six different hydrogeological panels were listed in fig 9 according to the value range of nse the simulation results of the 78 catchments were divided into four intervals from low to high values the number of values in each interval was approximately the same to make sure the comparisons are fair and convincing 5 1 relations between simulation results and catchment attributes 5 1 1 hydrometeorological characteristics from the catchment perspective hydrometeorological characteristics directly describe the properties of precipitation and streamflow which are regarded as forcing factors for groundwater level fluctuation as shown in fig 8 a compared with the mean precipitation and streamflow the overall changes in catchment mean temperature had a more obvious impact on the simulation performance of the gru model higher mean temperatures tended to be linked to better simulation performance high temperatures can lead to high evapotranspiration and therefore higher temperatures can cause the groundwater level especially the shallow groundwater level to drop faster salem et al 2017 hare et al 2021 this indicates that the groundwater level in regions with higher mean temperatures was more sensitive to dynamic forcing signals such as precipitation as a result the gru model could capture the features of input signals more efficiently for groundwater level simulations in these catchments fig 8 b shows that the gru simulations for catchments with less snow fraction in precipitation and higher aridity were more satisfactory the snowmelt process is a critical factor that can affect the accuracy of hydrological models in cold areas because the lag effect of streamflow and groundwater recharge caused by the snowmelt process would reduce the accuracy of hydrological models jiang et al 2020 carroll et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 moreover the recharge discharge relationship between groundwater and streamflow has been proven to be complicated in snow domain areas huntington and niswonger 2012 this could be reflected in precipitation seasonality as shown in fig 8 b the precipitation peaks in catchments where the gru model performed well were in summer regarding aridity apart from the similar effect of high temperature the phenomenon of groundwater discharge to streamflow would be more obvious in more arid catchments kebede et al 2021 which allowed the model to better learn the relationship between streamflow and groundwater level groundwater levels in catchments with lower mean temperatures and higher snow fractions such as the new england mid atlantic and great lakes regions were affected by the lagged recharging from snowfall and snowmelt as a result it was more difficult to obtain good simulation results in these regions compared with arid regions with high temperatures such as the mississippi ohio and arkansas white red regions fig 8 c presents the relationship between nse values and streamflow properties as the interaction bridge between streamflow and groundwater base flow had an obvious impact on groundwater level simulation whereas streamflow was considered one of the input variables brunner et al 2017 the baseflow index ratio of mean daily baseflow to mean daily discharge reflects the frequency of interaction between surface water and groundwater through base flow in catchments where the simulation performance of machine learning was better the baseflow index showed a significantly higher value in contrast the runoff ratio ratio of mean daily discharge to mean daily precipitation had a negative impact on improving the simulation results indicating that from the perspective of the machine learning model the impact of precipitation on groundwater level would be more obvious than that of streamflow this was reasonable because the relationship between groundwater level and precipitation was much clearer whereas the interaction between groundwater level and streamflow was sometimes difficult to explicate epting et al 2018 catchments with a lower slope of the flow duration curve between the log transformed 33rd and 66th streamflow percentiles and later the half flow date date on which the cumulative discharge since october 1st reaches half of the annual discharge had better simulation performance this indicates that regions with less precipitation in spring and winter and more precipitation in summer and autumn tended to be more suitable for groundwater level simulation by machine learning this finding is consistent with the earlier discussion about the effect of precipitation seasonality fig 8 d focuses on simulations under extreme precipitation and extreme drought conditions traditional hydrological model analysis showed a certain relationship between groundwater level and extreme conditions kidmose et al 2013 however the performance of the machine learning models remains to be explored it was observed that a higher frequency of extreme conditions led to better gru simulation results indicating that the gru model can learn how groundwater responds to fluctuations from external information e g precipitation and baseflow recharging if the groundwater responded to the external fluctuation more obviously the gru model would have more accurate simulation results 5 1 2 hydrogeological characteristics the high spatiotemporal variability of groundwater level fluctuation and its response to climate signals indicate that catchment geology climate and topography have a strong influence on groundwater flow hokanson et al 2019 the relationships between the well attributes and simulation results are shown in fig 9 a distances between the wells and streamflow observation stations were within a reasonable range which had little effect on the gru performance in contrast the delay time and groundwater level had an active influence on the gru performance that is in regions where the delay time was shorter and the groundwater level was shallower simulation results were better because groundwater reacted more quickly to external fluctuations topography factors are often used as important head boundary conditions in traditional groundwater numerical models dai et al 2021 previous studies have shown that in humid catchments with small topographic gradients or low hydraulic conductivity groundwater flux is strongly driven by topographic gradients condon and maxwell 2015 thus it is important to understand the influence of regional topography factors on machine learning model performance fig 9 b presents the impact of topography on the gru simulations demonstrating that regions with larger areas lower mean elevations and less steep slopes tended to show more satisfactory simulation results regarding soil characteristics which can influence the soil water storage and groundwater recharge process šútor et al 2010 they were derived from state soil geographic database statsgo dataset post processed by miller and white 1998 in the camels dataset given the consideration that the soil components extend to 1 5 m for the majority of the conus the soil characteristics were restricted to the top 1 5 m of the soil even though the soil and bedrock might not encounter in some catchments at this depth furthermore the camels dataset calculated the averaged values for heterogeneous characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and bedrock components in the catchment scale as representatives for specific catchments addor et al 2017 fig 9 c shows that simulation performance was better in regions with smaller sand fractions and larger clay fractions moreover the simulation performance was better in regions with a more uniform ratio of sand silt and clay this was also reflected in the relationship between nse and soil hydraulic conductivity fig 9 d because the hydraulic conductivity of soil was much higher than that of clay the smaller the hydraulic conductivity of soil the more evenly the sand silt and clay were distributed in the soil for catchment averaged geological characteristics in deep layers which were characterized with global lithological map hartmann and moosdorf 2012 and global hydroreology maps gleeson et al 2014 in the camels dataset higher carbonate rock fraction and permeability lead to better simulation performance for the gru model fig 9 e this indicated that in this condition the precipitation and baseflow that infiltrated the deep subsurface groundwater were more smoothly performed and thus the groundwater recharge efficiency was higher resulting in a better simulation performance as shown in fig 9 f compared with other characteristics vegetation did not have an obvious influence on the simulation results however there was a slight trend that the gru model performed better if the forest fraction in the catchment was smaller 5 2 groundwater level autocorrelation as shown in fig 10 the groundwater level autocorrelation in these 78 catchments had an obvious negative correlation with the gru simulation results r2 0 528 this indicates that a worse groundwater level autocorrelation would lead to better simulation performance fig 7 shows that the autocorrelation of the groundwater level was generally higher than that of precipitation and streamflow this is consistent with the conclusions of several previous studies liang and zhang 2013 2015 li and zhang 2007 moreover the autocorrelation of groundwater level would be weaker when it responded more actively to streamflow and precipitation signals because the input data for the gru model were precipitation and streamflow the dfa results again confirmed that the gru simulations performed better in regions where the groundwater level reacted more obviously to the external signals 5 3 pca instructions and physical experiences pca is widely recognized as an important method for data analysis however in terms of algorithms pca is a machine learning method that does not consider physical meaning briefly pca was applied to preserve the features that represented the overall high dimensional dataset and remove noise and unimportant features to achieve data dimensionality reduction using pca to determine the input values from high dimensional data for machine learning models has proven to be an appropriate strategy zhang et al 2021 in section 4 we described the application of pca to seven variables for classification showing that precipitation streamflow and groundwater level were classified into one group this could be attributed to the characteristic of machine learning which is consistent with the classification using physical meanings from the point of view of physical common sense streamflow and precipitation would have much greater influence on the groundwater level than daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure we also tested the gru model with more input variables which performed worse than the model using only precipitation and streamflow as input variables this showed that although machine learning could not completely replace the role of human experience and common sense human experience and common sense can be reflected by machine learning to some extent in addition the results indicated that a larger amount of data and more data features did not necessarily result in higher accuracy using machine learning a possible explanation is that from the perspective of the parameterized machine learning model more input features mean that more parameters in the artificial neural networks such as weights and bias are needed to be trained in this case the number of parameters in 6 input model will be three times as large as that in 2 input model more parameters trained for the irrelevant features will lead to a higher risk of overfitting problem at this point the power of machine learning would be maximized when the model is constrained by physical principles because physical constrains would turn the irrelevant features into targets related features for machine learning models 6 conclusions this study presented the simulation results of the groundwater level in 78 catchments in the central eastern conus using the gru model based on the model performances and attributes in specific catchments this study further analyzed and discussed the impacts of regional characteristics on improving the simulation accuracy of the groundwater level using machine learning the main findings of this study are summarized as follows first in terms of hydrometeorological characteristics the gru model performed better in regions with higher average temperature higher precipitation lower snowfall fraction more frequent baseflow interactions and more extreme climate events second from the perspective of geological characteristics the gru model was more suitable for regions with shallower groundwater depths larger catchment areas lower average elevations and milder average slopes in addition when the ratio of sand silt and clay fractions were more uniform and the carbonate rock fraction and subsurface permeability of the deep layer were higher the performances of the gru simulations were better third the dfa results showed that groundwater level autocorrelation had a negative relationship with the gru model performance to some extent the key to groundwater level simulation using machine learning was whether the regional groundwater could sensitively respond to dynamic external information fourth from the seven variables pca selected precipitation and streamflow as the inputs for the gru model for groundwater level simulation which was consistent with our common sense from physical meaning this indicates that machine learning is not completely irrelevant to physical meaning in this study advanced machine learning algorithms were used a suitable model framework was built and the data driven model was successfully combined with regional watershed properties however the black box characteristics of machine learning models remain unchanged which is the point for which machine learning models have been criticized the most by researchers this means that although machine learning models can provide accurate simulation results the physical meaning of the models are not interpretable moreover groundwater level fluctuation is a complex process that is affected by various external factors such as melting snow and river discharge for example in areas where snowfall accounts for a certain proportion of precipitation such as the new england mid atlantic and great lakes regions their overall simulation performances are not particularly good because of the lag effect of snowmelt therefore implanting physical constraints in machine learning models should be a future direction for applying machine learning to groundwater level simulation it is still a significant task to integrate groundwater related dynamic processes into a state of the art data driven model this would maximize the calculation power of the machine learning algorithm while making the model more interpretable and universal this study demonstrates the powerful nonlinear fitting ability of machine learning we believe that the general accuracy of model performance and increasing studies on machine learning would increase trust in data driven approaches and lead to more applications in hydrological sciences instead of focusing on the complex three dimensional problems of the groundwater level in specific catchments this study provides a widely applicable alternative to traditional groundwater level simulation methods with machine learning models when building the machine learning model we did not use the detailed geological data of catchments that are necessary for the traditional groundwater model this provides the possibility for simulating groundwater levels in ungauged or undetected areas machine learning may be a powerful method for solving hydrological simulation problems in catchments that

8169,study region central eastern continental united states study focus groundwater level prediction is of great significance for the management of global water resources recently machine learning which can deal with highly nonlinear interactions among complex hydrological factors has been widely applied to groundwater level prediction however previous studies mainly focused on improving the simulation performance in specific regions using different machine learning methods while this study focused on the impacts of regional characteristics on improving the accuracy of groundwater level prediction using machine learning new hydrological insights for the region a gated recurrent unit gru neural network was built for groundwater level simulation in 78 catchments in the study region and principal component analysis was used to cluster a variety of catchment hydrological variables and determine the input variables for the gru model detrended fluctuation analysis was applied to analyze the autocorrelation of groundwater level in each catchment this study further explored the influences of the hydrogeological properties of different catchments and the autocorrelation of groundwater levels on machining learning simulations the results showed that the gru model performed better in regions where hydrogeological properties could promote more effective responses of groundwater to external changes moreover a negative correlation between the simulation performance of machine learning and the autocorrelation of the groundwater level was found keywords machine learning groundwater level detrended fluctuation analysis principal component analysis regional characteristics central eastern continental united states 1 introduction the groundwater system is an important part of the hydrological cycle groundwater dynamics are determined by physical hydrogeological properties and system boundary conditions such as climate variability and pumping groundwater level fluctuations can be controlled by a number of hydrological variables such as streamflow hintze et al 2020 brunner et al 2017 precipitation newman 2019 and snowmelt huntington and niswonger 2012 thus creating groundwater level simulations is a complicated task generally traditional process based groundwater level models which focus on the physical processes of water movement zhu et al 2012 require strong mathematical derivation ability and extensive information on basin attributes cuthbert et al 2019 these models are most suitable for cases in which knowledge of the flow path distributed state variables or physical constraints are vital however in real groundwater systems the nonlinear interaction spatial heterogeneity and time lag are difficult to describe sahoo et al 2017 moreover several studies have criticized traditional process based groundwater level models as too parametric complex and difficult to use beven and cloke 2012 clark et al 2015 fatichi et al 2016 therefore in recent years data driven hydrological models based on machine learning have been used to simulate groundwater levels sahoo et al 2017 seyoum et al 2019 poursaeid et al 2020 with the continuous improvement of various algorithms the ability of machine learning to simulate hydrological variables has been widely recognized liu and shi 2019 zhao et al 2019 chen and zhang 2020 in terms of using machine learning for the simulation of time series the volatility relationship between input data and target data is the key to determining the accuracy of the simulation results in the field of hydrology the fluctuation of variables is usually closely related to catchment physical properties although the process of machine learning does not consider physical meaning the performance of the simulation results can often be explained by multiple physical meanings brodrick et al 2019 therefore exploring the catchment physical properties that can affect the performance of machine learning has become a topic worth discussing machine learning models have been widely used in hydrology especially in terms of streamflow simulations commonly applied models include recurrent neural networks rnns such as long short term memory lstm gao et al 2020 feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019a 2019b convolutional neural networks jiang et al 2020 kattenborn et al 2019 and genetic programming chadalawada et al 2017 regarding groundwater level simulation several studies have been conducted on the basis of machine learning malekzadeh et al 2019 sadat noori et al 2019 mo et al 2019 the foundation of machine learning lies on a large amount of data hydrometeorological data of catchments and observational data of groundwater level have been used to build groundwater level models using machine learning current groundwater level simulations with machine learning are performed in specific watersheds to improve the model accuracy jeong et al 2020 di nunno and granata 2020 research in large scale regions is often related to remote sensing and its algorithm is completely different from machine learning models that deal with time series evans et al 2020 previous studies have discussed the different regional characteristics of the main recharge methods of groundwater level in the continental united states conus gleeson et al 2011 indicating that it is possible to explore whether the characteristics of the drainage basin and groundwater fluctuation on the continental scale affect the results using machine learning principal component analysis pca is often used to reduce the data dimensions by extracting the main features from datasets pca has also been widely applied in the field of hydrology benahmed and houichi 2018 owing to the diversity of catchment characteristics when selecting the input variables for machine learning models it is often necessary to screen the data to select the most suitable variables for machine learning artificial screening raises concerns over whether the data are noisy which would weaken the simulation performance of the model pca can help interpret the data lever et al 2017 although pca cannot understand the physical meaning of data it can screen out datasets with characteristics similar to those of the input variables for machine learning models zhang et al 2021 normally natural system signals have long term power law correlations schilling and zhang 2012 the results of analyzing the scaling characteristics of hydrological time series using traditional spectral analysis methods have shown that the power spectrum fluctuations of hydrological time series are often unstable and its slope is difficult to accurately determine zhang and schilling 2004 zhang and li 2005 these difficulties can be overcome using the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa method peng et al 1994 the hydrological system behaves as a series of hierarchical filters that convert unstable or less relevant input signals such as rainfall and its chemical concentration into smoother or relevant outputs such as water flow base flow and chemical composition resulting in long term autocorrelation of hydrological variables yang et al 2017 matsoukas et al 2000 used dfa to prove the existence of long term memory of rainfall and runoff which showed that patterns of alternating wet and dry spells in the basin rather than the actual rainfall intensity controlled the autocorrelation of rainfall in terms of groundwater level dfa has been used to analyze fluctuation autocorrelation liang and zhang 2013 2015 li and zhang 2007 understanding the temporal changes in groundwater level is of great importance for hydrological prediction especially for understanding more frequent extreme hydrological events sagarika et al 2014 whether this property can be reflected in the performance of machine learning in predicting groundwater level is worth exploring the purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of machine learning in groundwater level simulation in combination with catchment characteristics and autocorrelation of groundwater level traditional groundwater models reasonably use the physical properties of catchments as the basis and parameters and the model settings can reflect regional characteristics li et al 2017 if the physical constraints of the catchment are not implemented the impacts of the regional characteristics and fluctuation properties of groundwater level on machine learning can only be reflected in the model performance this study built a gated recurrent unit gru neural network model to simulate groundwater levels for 78 wells catchments in the central eastern conus pca was used to determine the input variables for the gru model dfa was used to detect groundwater level autocorrelation in each well while exploring the applicability of machine learning to groundwater level simulation this study also summarized the common characteristics that are suitable for machine learning that is which common catchment physical properties are the key parameters for obtaining better simulation results using machine learning exploring the commonalities of these properties will guide the choice of implanting the physical constraints of groundwater into machine learning models and will help explore the use of machine learning simulations for groundwater level in ungauged areas 2 study area and data based on the u s geological survey https www usgs gov the conus is divided into 18 major watersheds as shown in the subplot of fig 1 in the order from 1 to 18 the watersheds are as follows new england region mid atlantic region south atlantic gulf region great lakes region ohio region tennessee region upper mississippi region lower mississippi region south red rainy region missouri region arkansas white red region texas gulf region rio grande region upper colorado region lower colorado region great basin region pacific northwest region and california region each major watershed contains either the drainage area of a major river or the combined drainage areas of a series of rivers this study focused on 78 catchments from 10 major watersheds located in the central eastern conus shown in the subplot of fig 1 the experimental data for the analysis consisted of two datasets the first dataset was from the publicly available catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset issued by the national center for atmospheric research addor et al 2017 newman et al 2015 including basin averaged daily hydrometeorological forcing data daily streamflow observations and catchment attributes for 671 catchments across the conus with minimal human disturbance each catchment is represented by a unique hydrologic unit code huc most of the data in the camels were recorded from 1980 to 2014 in this study 78 of 671 catchments from the camels dataset were selected for further analysis fig 1 the catchment attributes used for the regional analysis included climate index soil and geological characteristics table s1 these catchment attributes were derived and summarized from publicly available products such as climate data and remote sensing products over conus which were either exact or in close approximation the second dataset was the freely available daily average groundwater level data of 78 monitoring wells collected and compiled by the u s geological survey these wells should meet two principles first they must be the monitoring wells that were closest to the corresponding hydrological monitoring stations that recorded the daily streamflow data we recognized that the groundwater catchment area and streamflow catchment area did not perfectly overlap however among these 78 catchments compared with the average catchment area of 800 km2 the average distance of 24 km between monitoring wells and hydrological monitoring stations was sufficiently small to ensure that groundwater was affected by the hydrometeorological factors from the corresponding camels catchment second the selected monitoring wells must have daily groundwater level data for 25 30 consecutive years from 1980 to 2014 because a large amount of groundwater level data could not match the time scale of the camels dataset the lower limit of 25 years was set to ensure that there were enough monitoring wells available while also ensuring that each monitoring well provided enough data for efficiently performing machine learning in addition we set the upper limit as 30 years to control the differences in time scale among monitoring wells so that the machine learning results were comparable since the streamflow data in the camels dataset was from catchment with minimal human impact groundwater level data we collected should also be least affected by human activities however most of the wells we collected in the western part especially in california region are in urban areas those wells are obviously affected by human activities such as pumping the number of eligible wells in those regions is not enough to represent the regional characteristics as a result we only focused on 78 catchments from 10 major watersheds in the central eastern conus 3 methodology 3 1 gru before introducing a gru neural network we first described rnn and lstm because the structure of gru is relatively similar to that of lstm in addition both lstm and gru networks are updated versions of the rnn with the same fundamental framework an rnn is a type of artificial neural network that uses sequential data or time series data fig 2 b shows the basic structure of the traditional rnn the key point of the rnn structure is the concept of hidden state h t which is calculated from the hidden state at time step t 1 h t 1 and the input vector x t using the following formula 1 h t t a n h u x t w h t 1 b where t a n h is an activation function called the hyperbolic tangent u and w are weight matrices and b is a bias vector because the rnn output is determined by the current input vector and the hidden state of the previous time step theoretically regardless of how long the time series is rnn can make use of all the information from the previous time steps however owing to the gradient vanishing and explosion problems which means that the rnn output is only determined by the hidden states and input vectors from a few time steps before rnn performs poorly in case of long time series simulations to solve the gradient vanishing and explosion problems lstm was first introduced for language processing hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 owing to its excellent long and short term memory ability in time series lstm has been widely used in diverse fields to solve time series forecasting problems lstm neural networks have a chain structure similar to that of a traditional rnn but the internal operations in the lstm cells are more complex which enables lstm to learn long and short term dependencies the core of the lstm structure is shown in fig 2 c it consists of three gates an input gate a forget gate and an output gate these three gates are input data filters fischer and krauss 2018 to adjust the cell and hidden states the input gate determines which information will be stored in the cell state the forget gate determines which information will be deleted from the cell state and the output gate determines which data will be provided as an output from the cell state of the current time step the operation method for the internal structure of the lstm is summarized as follows 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 4 c t ˆ tan h w c h t 1 x t b c 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 6 c t f t c t 1 i t c t ˆ 7 h t o t t a n h c t where σ is the logistic sigmoidal function is the element wise multiplication of two vectors w i w f w c and w o are the network weight matrices b i b f b c and b o are bias vectors and f t i t and o t are activation vectors for the forget gate input gate and output gate respectively lstm has been proven to be an efficient method for long time series predictions kratzert et al 2019a feng et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 2021 however owing to the complexity of the structure lstm often takes a long time to process data to simplify the lstm structure while maintaining the advantages of long and short term memory ability gru neural networks fig 2 d were proposed by cho et al 2014 compared with lstm gru improves the computational efficiency by decreasing the number of calculating parameters while the simulation results remain the same or are improved the computational workflow of the gru is summarized as follows 8 z t σ w z x t h t 1 b z 9 r t σ w r x t h t 1 b r 10 h t ˆ tanh w h x t u h r t h t 1 b h 11 h t 1 z t h t 1 z t h t ˆ where w and b are the weight matrices and bias vectors respectively z t and r t are the update and rese gates activation vectors respectively h t ˆ is the potential update vector and σ and tanh are the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions respectively recently several studies have shown that gru has an efficiency comparable to that of lstm ayzel and heistermann 2021 gao et al 2020 thus gru is an alternative to lstm owing to the reduction in computational complexity this study does not focus on comparing the simulation performances of lstm and gru thus gru was selected as the standard machine learning method because of the lower computation cost this study divided all time series data into two sets 80 data were used for model training and the remaining 20 for model validation when building the model we referred to several similar successful cases from previous studies these studies either used the same camels dataset feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019a 2019b jiang et al 2020 or a dataset with a similar time series scale zhang et al 2021 these studies were consistent in the structure of the neural network two layers of core neural networks with advanced algorithms such as lstm cnn and gru and one fully connected neural network to facilitate the output we also performed bias variance trade off experiments with different model structures to determine the framework the model structure proposed in fig 2 a shows the best simulation performance for the collected dataset precipitation and streamflow data were set as input data for the machine learning model and the two gru layers were the core of the model according to the simulation results from numerous computational experiments we set the first gru with an output dimension of 16 and the second with an output dimension of 8 we selected the commonly used rectified linear unit as the activation function we inserted a dropout layer between the two gru layers with a dropout rate of 0 5 based on our previous experience to prevent potential overfitting problems during the training process finally we added a standard full connection layer to provide the simulation results when compiling the layers we chose rmsprop as the optimizer and mae as the loss function the gru model was coded using python 3 6 we used keras as the coding api and tensorflow 1 4 as the machine learning backend the performance of the gru model was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse 12 n s e 1 i 1 n q s q o 2 i 1 n q o q o 2 where q s q o and q o are the simulated observed and mean observed groundwater levels respectively nse is widely used for hydrological model assessments and ranges from to 1 the closer the nse is to 1 the better the simulation result 3 2 pca pca has been an important and widely used method for data mining since its introduction by pearson 1901 pca simplifies the complexity of high dimensional data while retaining the trends and patterns of the original data pca transforms high dimensional data into data with fewer dimensions the transformed data serves as a summary of features keeping the variance of the dataset that contributes the most zhang et al 2021 pca uses orthogonal transformation to transform the original random vector related to its component into a new random vector that is not related to the original component this can be represented algebraically by transforming the covariance matrix of the original random vector into a diagonal array and geometrically by transforming the original coordinate system into a new orthogonal coordinate system making it point to several orthogonal directions where the samples are most widely dispersed then the high dimensional variable system is reduced in dimensionality so that it can be converted into a low dimensional variable system while retaining the features of the original system the basic steps of pca are as follows hotelling 1933 1 centralize the data centralization refers to subtracting the average value of the dataset from the data in the dataset the purpose of centralization is to increase the training speed 2 calculate the covariance matrix of the characteristics of the n dimensional data 3 calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix 4 select the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest k eigenvalues 5 project the sample points onto the selected feature vector in this way pca can map n dimensional data features to k dimensional data k n this k dimensional data is the reconstructed feature of the original data that is the principal components of the original dataset pca can be regarded as a machine learning method this study used six variables precipitation streamflow daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure from the camels dataset and groundwater level data to form the initial seven dimensional data pca was used to determine the similarities among the groups of data we then used this as a guideline for the selection of the input variables of the gru model to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using machine learning or physical meaning to guide the selection of input data 3 3 dfa generally groundwater level fluctuation which is affected by natural dynamic forcing factors such as precipitation shows a characteristic of long term autocorrelation power spectrum analysis and dfa are often used to calculate the autocorrelation function of a time series subject to long term correlation owing to the highly non stationary nature of some hydrological signals e g rainfall power spectrum analysis often produces spurious results matsoukas et al 2000 hence in this study dfa was used to analyze the autocorrelations of hydrological signals dfa was first proposed for the study of dna sequences peng et al 1994 this method is suitable for analyzing the long term memory of non stationary time series because it can eliminate trend components in a time series sequence derived from seasonality and periodic factors the noise and data non stationarity in the hydrological sequence affect the calculation of the correlation function after removing the trend representing the external driving force the remaining fluctuations are the real responses of the system to the outside world the specific steps of dfa were as follows first we divided the time series data into n m n m non overlapping subintervals the length of each subinterval was m because the length of the time series n was not necessarily an integer multiple of the subinterval length m there could be unused data to ensure the integrity of the data we reversed the order of the time series and repeated the former step assuming that the time series of the original data on the j th subinterval can be expressed as x j i i 1 2 m we used the k th order polynomial x ˆ j k i to fit x j i with the least squares method x ˆ j k i is the local trend function and is used to represent the general trend of a time series in the local subinterval depending on the k value they were termed the k th order dfa method in this study we adopted the second order dfa method because it is the most suitable method for identifying the long memory of deseasonalized hydrological data yang and bowling 2014 chen et al 2019 after eliminating the time series trend on the j th subinterval by x ˆ j k i the detrended time series on the interval can be obtained as z j i x j i x ˆ j k i i 1 2 m then we calculated the square mean of the detrended time series data on the subinterval as follows 13 f 2 j 1 m i 1 n m z j 2 i then we calculated the square root of the mean of the n m subintervals of the entire original time series data as follows 14 f m 1 n m j 1 n m f 2 j 1 2 m α f m changes with the fractal length m and the slope α was fitted after calculating the logarithm of f m and m 15 α l o g f m log m the autocorrelation of the time series increases when α increases when α 0 5 the time series would show no autocorrelation when 0 5 α 1 the time series could be regarded as a stationary fluctuating time series when 1 α the time series was regarded as a non stationary fractal brownian process koscielny bunde et al 2006 compared the results of using power spectrum analysis wave analysis fa and dfa to process 23 flow data and found that due to statistical errors when m n 4 dfa is inaccurate thus in this study we used the dfa method with a minimum m 4 and a maximum m n 4 for analysis 4 results 4 1 pca results we randomly selected data from nine catchments for pca evaluation each group of data consisted of seven variables i e precipitation streamflow groundwater level daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure from a specific catchment fig 3 shows the 2 dimensional pca results in general pc1 represents approximately 40 50 and pc2 represents approximately 20 25 of the features for the specific dataset the data similarity of the seven variables can be clearly seen in fig 3 the features of daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure were similar which could be better described by pc1 in contrast pc2 could better describe the features of precipitation and streamflow in addition for most groundwater level data the features could be better represented by pc2 therefore the groundwater level data were more similar to the streamflow and precipitation data indicating that the precipitation and streamflow data should be selected as the input forcing for the gru model moreover most groundwater level data showed a negative relationship with pc1 thus the daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure data were not selected for the gru model because these variables could disturb the machine learning process 4 2 gru model simulation results for groundwater level we applied the gru model to simulate the groundwater level of 78 catchments in 10 major watersheds in the central eastern conus which are rarely disturbed by human effects after properly adjusting the parameters and hyperparameters such as the epoch and batch size the average nse ranged from 0 85 to 0 261 with a mean value of 0 478 table 1 we also recorded the delay times between the simulation results and observations and two explanations for the delay times are as follows first optimized rnn models such as lstm and gru are based on a regression algorithm which means that the model might use the value at time t 1 or t 2 as the prediction value to minimize error in such a case the model can be optimized by adding more gru layers however considering overfitting problems we chose two gru layers to achieve the best model performance thus the delay effect from the lstm and gru models is ineluctable in machine learning for time series prediction feng et al 2020 second owing to the slow flow rate of water in the underground layers the response of groundwater to external signals will have a delay effect because there are obvious spatial differences between streamflow observation stations and groundwater wells among the 78 catchments we believe that the second cause was the main reason for the delay effect in this study fig 4 shows the simulation results of the best simulated catchment for each of the 10 major watersheds the gru model performed better for simulating the fluctuation trend of the groundwater level than the extreme points of the groundwater level simulations in the lower mississippi and missouri regions showed higher accuracies whereas those in the new england and great lakes regions were less precise fig 5 shows the worst simulation results for each of the 10 major watersheds apparently for most cases in fig 5 the fluctuation range of simulated groundwater level failed to match the observations this means that although the proposed machine leaning model could learn the groundwater fluctuation pattern from training process there is still much room for improving the simulation accuracy fig 6 shows the nse distributions for the 78 catchments two obvious regional patterns were identified simulations of the coastal regions such as the new england region average nse 0 319 mid atlantic region average nse 0 401 and south atlantic gulf region average nse 0 448 performed worse than simulations of the inland regions such as the upper mississippi region average nse 0 635 lower mississippi region average nse 0 669 and arkansas white red region average nse 0 684 and simulations of the southern regions such as the lower mississippi region average nse 0 669 and south atlantic gulf region average nse 0 448 performed better than those of the northern regions such as the new england region average nse 0 319 and great lakes region average nse 0 322 overall we migrated the successful machine learning building experience from surface water simulation gao et al 2020 feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019a 2019b to the groundwater part and the proposed machine learning methods could provide fairly satisfying results the proposed framework could provide an alternative on traditional groundwater simulation which usually considered it as solving two or three dimensional mathematical problems li et al 2017 mo et al 2017 different from the previous groundwater studies on applying machine learning on a single well detected region jeong et al 2020 di nunno and granata 2020 we explored the possibility to build up a unified groundwater machine learning framework for a larger scale the results also illustrated regional differences of the performance of machine learning model nevertheless according to the simulation results for different regions the most significant limitation of this study was that the proposed framework failed to interpret the physical processes for instance the reason for the poor simulation performance in cold areas such as new england region and great lakes region is that snowfall and rainfall were treated uniformly indicating that the natural snowmelt process could not be reflected in the neural networks the power of machine learning model with physical constraints has been presented in surface water simulation jiang et al 2020 therefore combination of groundwater related physical processes and machine learning algorithm will be an important way to improve the simulation ability on groundwater level in the future 4 3 dfa results the results of the overall dfa for the groundwater level had a distribution of α between 1 391 and 0 818 indicating that the groundwater level in these catchments fluctuated between stationary and non stationary moreover this study compared the autocorrelation of precipitation streamflow and groundwater levels according to the gru model simulation results we randomly chose three catchments with low huc 06921070 median huc 03026500 and high huc 07014500 nse values to compare the autocorrelation for precipitation streamflow and groundwater level fig 7 shows that the groundwater level had the strongest autocorrelation among the three factors there was a significant increase in the autocorrelation for the groundwater level compared with that for precipitation and streamflow moreover precipitation and streamflow contained the characteristics of time series with stationary and relatively weak autocorrelation whereas the groundwater level showed a stronger long term autocorrelation 5 discussion in this section we discuss the influences of catchment characteristics and groundwater level autocorrelation on the simulation performance of the machine learning model using precipitation and streamflow as input data the catchment characteristics data were from the camels dataset addor et al 2017 and the results of gru simulation dfa analysis and pca analysis are presented in the previous sections for the catchment characteristics shown in figs 8 and 9 we clustered the discussions based on the ranges and types of characteristics as a result four hydrometeorological panels with different emphasis were listed in fig 8 while six different hydrogeological panels were listed in fig 9 according to the value range of nse the simulation results of the 78 catchments were divided into four intervals from low to high values the number of values in each interval was approximately the same to make sure the comparisons are fair and convincing 5 1 relations between simulation results and catchment attributes 5 1 1 hydrometeorological characteristics from the catchment perspective hydrometeorological characteristics directly describe the properties of precipitation and streamflow which are regarded as forcing factors for groundwater level fluctuation as shown in fig 8 a compared with the mean precipitation and streamflow the overall changes in catchment mean temperature had a more obvious impact on the simulation performance of the gru model higher mean temperatures tended to be linked to better simulation performance high temperatures can lead to high evapotranspiration and therefore higher temperatures can cause the groundwater level especially the shallow groundwater level to drop faster salem et al 2017 hare et al 2021 this indicates that the groundwater level in regions with higher mean temperatures was more sensitive to dynamic forcing signals such as precipitation as a result the gru model could capture the features of input signals more efficiently for groundwater level simulations in these catchments fig 8 b shows that the gru simulations for catchments with less snow fraction in precipitation and higher aridity were more satisfactory the snowmelt process is a critical factor that can affect the accuracy of hydrological models in cold areas because the lag effect of streamflow and groundwater recharge caused by the snowmelt process would reduce the accuracy of hydrological models jiang et al 2020 carroll et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 moreover the recharge discharge relationship between groundwater and streamflow has been proven to be complicated in snow domain areas huntington and niswonger 2012 this could be reflected in precipitation seasonality as shown in fig 8 b the precipitation peaks in catchments where the gru model performed well were in summer regarding aridity apart from the similar effect of high temperature the phenomenon of groundwater discharge to streamflow would be more obvious in more arid catchments kebede et al 2021 which allowed the model to better learn the relationship between streamflow and groundwater level groundwater levels in catchments with lower mean temperatures and higher snow fractions such as the new england mid atlantic and great lakes regions were affected by the lagged recharging from snowfall and snowmelt as a result it was more difficult to obtain good simulation results in these regions compared with arid regions with high temperatures such as the mississippi ohio and arkansas white red regions fig 8 c presents the relationship between nse values and streamflow properties as the interaction bridge between streamflow and groundwater base flow had an obvious impact on groundwater level simulation whereas streamflow was considered one of the input variables brunner et al 2017 the baseflow index ratio of mean daily baseflow to mean daily discharge reflects the frequency of interaction between surface water and groundwater through base flow in catchments where the simulation performance of machine learning was better the baseflow index showed a significantly higher value in contrast the runoff ratio ratio of mean daily discharge to mean daily precipitation had a negative impact on improving the simulation results indicating that from the perspective of the machine learning model the impact of precipitation on groundwater level would be more obvious than that of streamflow this was reasonable because the relationship between groundwater level and precipitation was much clearer whereas the interaction between groundwater level and streamflow was sometimes difficult to explicate epting et al 2018 catchments with a lower slope of the flow duration curve between the log transformed 33rd and 66th streamflow percentiles and later the half flow date date on which the cumulative discharge since october 1st reaches half of the annual discharge had better simulation performance this indicates that regions with less precipitation in spring and winter and more precipitation in summer and autumn tended to be more suitable for groundwater level simulation by machine learning this finding is consistent with the earlier discussion about the effect of precipitation seasonality fig 8 d focuses on simulations under extreme precipitation and extreme drought conditions traditional hydrological model analysis showed a certain relationship between groundwater level and extreme conditions kidmose et al 2013 however the performance of the machine learning models remains to be explored it was observed that a higher frequency of extreme conditions led to better gru simulation results indicating that the gru model can learn how groundwater responds to fluctuations from external information e g precipitation and baseflow recharging if the groundwater responded to the external fluctuation more obviously the gru model would have more accurate simulation results 5 1 2 hydrogeological characteristics the high spatiotemporal variability of groundwater level fluctuation and its response to climate signals indicate that catchment geology climate and topography have a strong influence on groundwater flow hokanson et al 2019 the relationships between the well attributes and simulation results are shown in fig 9 a distances between the wells and streamflow observation stations were within a reasonable range which had little effect on the gru performance in contrast the delay time and groundwater level had an active influence on the gru performance that is in regions where the delay time was shorter and the groundwater level was shallower simulation results were better because groundwater reacted more quickly to external fluctuations topography factors are often used as important head boundary conditions in traditional groundwater numerical models dai et al 2021 previous studies have shown that in humid catchments with small topographic gradients or low hydraulic conductivity groundwater flux is strongly driven by topographic gradients condon and maxwell 2015 thus it is important to understand the influence of regional topography factors on machine learning model performance fig 9 b presents the impact of topography on the gru simulations demonstrating that regions with larger areas lower mean elevations and less steep slopes tended to show more satisfactory simulation results regarding soil characteristics which can influence the soil water storage and groundwater recharge process šútor et al 2010 they were derived from state soil geographic database statsgo dataset post processed by miller and white 1998 in the camels dataset given the consideration that the soil components extend to 1 5 m for the majority of the conus the soil characteristics were restricted to the top 1 5 m of the soil even though the soil and bedrock might not encounter in some catchments at this depth furthermore the camels dataset calculated the averaged values for heterogeneous characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity and bedrock components in the catchment scale as representatives for specific catchments addor et al 2017 fig 9 c shows that simulation performance was better in regions with smaller sand fractions and larger clay fractions moreover the simulation performance was better in regions with a more uniform ratio of sand silt and clay this was also reflected in the relationship between nse and soil hydraulic conductivity fig 9 d because the hydraulic conductivity of soil was much higher than that of clay the smaller the hydraulic conductivity of soil the more evenly the sand silt and clay were distributed in the soil for catchment averaged geological characteristics in deep layers which were characterized with global lithological map hartmann and moosdorf 2012 and global hydroreology maps gleeson et al 2014 in the camels dataset higher carbonate rock fraction and permeability lead to better simulation performance for the gru model fig 9 e this indicated that in this condition the precipitation and baseflow that infiltrated the deep subsurface groundwater were more smoothly performed and thus the groundwater recharge efficiency was higher resulting in a better simulation performance as shown in fig 9 f compared with other characteristics vegetation did not have an obvious influence on the simulation results however there was a slight trend that the gru model performed better if the forest fraction in the catchment was smaller 5 2 groundwater level autocorrelation as shown in fig 10 the groundwater level autocorrelation in these 78 catchments had an obvious negative correlation with the gru simulation results r2 0 528 this indicates that a worse groundwater level autocorrelation would lead to better simulation performance fig 7 shows that the autocorrelation of the groundwater level was generally higher than that of precipitation and streamflow this is consistent with the conclusions of several previous studies liang and zhang 2013 2015 li and zhang 2007 moreover the autocorrelation of groundwater level would be weaker when it responded more actively to streamflow and precipitation signals because the input data for the gru model were precipitation and streamflow the dfa results again confirmed that the gru simulations performed better in regions where the groundwater level reacted more obviously to the external signals 5 3 pca instructions and physical experiences pca is widely recognized as an important method for data analysis however in terms of algorithms pca is a machine learning method that does not consider physical meaning briefly pca was applied to preserve the features that represented the overall high dimensional dataset and remove noise and unimportant features to achieve data dimensionality reduction using pca to determine the input values from high dimensional data for machine learning models has proven to be an appropriate strategy zhang et al 2021 in section 4 we described the application of pca to seven variables for classification showing that precipitation streamflow and groundwater level were classified into one group this could be attributed to the characteristic of machine learning which is consistent with the classification using physical meanings from the point of view of physical common sense streamflow and precipitation would have much greater influence on the groundwater level than daily mean temperature day length shortwave downward radiation and vapor pressure we also tested the gru model with more input variables which performed worse than the model using only precipitation and streamflow as input variables this showed that although machine learning could not completely replace the role of human experience and common sense human experience and common sense can be reflected by machine learning to some extent in addition the results indicated that a larger amount of data and more data features did not necessarily result in higher accuracy using machine learning a possible explanation is that from the perspective of the parameterized machine learning model more input features mean that more parameters in the artificial neural networks such as weights and bias are needed to be trained in this case the number of parameters in 6 input model will be three times as large as that in 2 input model more parameters trained for the irrelevant features will lead to a higher risk of overfitting problem at this point the power of machine learning would be maximized when the model is constrained by physical principles because physical constrains would turn the irrelevant features into targets related features for machine learning models 6 conclusions this study presented the simulation results of the groundwater level in 78 catchments in the central eastern conus using the gru model based on the model performances and attributes in specific catchments this study further analyzed and discussed the impacts of regional characteristics on improving the simulation accuracy of the groundwater level using machine learning the main findings of this study are summarized as follows first in terms of hydrometeorological characteristics the gru model performed better in regions with higher average temperature higher precipitation lower snowfall fraction more frequent baseflow interactions and more extreme climate events second from the perspective of geological characteristics the gru model was more suitable for regions with shallower groundwater depths larger catchment areas lower average elevations and milder average slopes in addition when the ratio of sand silt and clay fractions were more uniform and the carbonate rock fraction and subsurface permeability of the deep layer were higher the performances of the gru simulations were better third the dfa results showed that groundwater level autocorrelation had a negative relationship with the gru model performance to some extent the key to groundwater level simulation using machine learning was whether the regional groundwater could sensitively respond to dynamic external information fourth from the seven variables pca selected precipitation and streamflow as the inputs for the gru model for groundwater level simulation which was consistent with our common sense from physical meaning this indicates that machine learning is not completely irrelevant to physical meaning in this study advanced machine learning algorithms were used a suitable model framework was built and the data driven model was successfully combined with regional watershed properties however the black box characteristics of machine learning models remain unchanged which is the point for which machine learning models have been criticized the most by researchers this means that although machine learning models can provide accurate simulation results the physical meaning of the models are not interpretable moreover groundwater level fluctuation is a complex process that is affected by various external factors such as melting snow and river discharge for example in areas where snowfall accounts for a certain proportion of precipitation such as the new england mid atlantic and great lakes regions their overall simulation performances are not particularly good because of the lag effect of snowmelt therefore implanting physical constraints in machine learning models should be a future direction for applying machine learning to groundwater level simulation it is still a significant task to integrate groundwater related dynamic processes into a state of the art data driven model this would maximize the calculation power of the machine learning algorithm while making the model more interpretable and universal this study demonstrates the powerful nonlinear fitting ability of machine learning we believe that the general accuracy of model performance and increasing studies on machine learning would increase trust in data driven approaches and lead to more applications in hydrological sciences instead of focusing on the complex three dimensional problems of the groundwater level in specific catchments this study provides a widely applicable alternative to traditional groundwater level simulation methods with machine learning models when building the machine learning model we did not use the detailed geological data of catchments that are necessary for the traditional groundwater model this provides the possibility for simulating groundwater levels in ungauged or undetected areas machine learning may be a powerful method for solving hydrological simulation problems in catchments that
