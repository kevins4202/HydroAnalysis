shipping has promoted rapid developments in the shipping industry which are needed to handle the growing number of ships transiting through ports and inland waterways ship hydrodynamic performance is affected by interference between the ship hull and channel river or harbor bottom in some cases such conditions can undermine the safety of maneuvering solutions to problems such as these generally involve the application of experimental and numerical methods with the latter approach being more repeatable and generally less costly although numerical simulations based on the potential flow method are faster and require fewer computational resources than simulations that apply viscosity taking viscous effects into account results in a more realistic simulation in the following sub sections we briefly summarize each research method currently applied in this field 1 1 model test newton 1960 studied the parallel navigation of two ships in deep water and analyzed other works to assess the feasibility of two ship replenishment remery 1974 modeled the hydrodynamic effect of sailing vessels on moored ships in shallow water in the netherlands ship model basin dand 1981 studied hydrodynamic interference between two ships sailing along parallel routes vantorre et al 2002 carried out a comprehensive constrained model test at the university of ghent belgium in which the results of the cross testing of four ship models were used to obtain the forces of interaction between ships in shallow water as a result of their work an empirical interaction formula based on a number of parameters was developed pinkster and ruijter 2004 carried out a series of model tests in shallow water and studied the effects of passing ships on the hydrodynamics of moored ships under different interaction parameters mousaviraad et al 2016b also investigated the interaction between pairs of ships in deep water and assessed the effect of various parameters on ship motion and the hydrodynamic forces between ships 1 2 numerical simulation kaplan and sankaranarayanan 1991 used numerical methods based on potential flow to study the hydrodynamic interference of two ships in restricted water while chitrapu et al 2007 studied the seakeeping and maneuverability of two ships navigating in parallel under the effects of wind waves and current by applying the time domain method sutulo and guedes soares 2008 created a code based on the hess and smith panel method to calculate hydrodynamic interaction force on ships and the code was applied to the simulation of an overtaking maneuver of two ships in uncontrolled rudder fixed and controlled motion sutulo and guedes soares 2009 they also validated their code against experimental data for a tug operating near a larger vessel and assessed the calculation accuracy and efficiency in their results sutulo et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 also applied the double body method to develop a moving patch approach and a set of computational programs based on potential flow method under their approach the calculation area was continuously updated to obtain the force of a ship in a given channel although their method had a significant advantage in terms of its ability to handle channels of arbitrary shape it increased computational load to analyze the free surface effect yuan et al 2015a developed the mhydro program based on the 3d rankine source method and release the heave and pitch motions of ships in overtaking conditions their results were in good agreement with the experimental values obtained by vantorre et al 2002 yuan et al 2015b further investigated the influence of the free surface and calculated the hydrodynamic interaction between two ships both in head sea and beam sea conditions xu and zou 2016 used the high order boundary element method hobem with the influence of the free surface neglected to analyze the forces on a wigley ship during straight line navigation toward another fixed wigley ship and compared their results with the theoretical calculations for slender body dynamics basing on this preceding work xu et al 2019 calculated the meeting and overtaking situations discussed in vantorre et al 2002 by applying the constant panel method cpm and hobem respectively in addition to potential flow viscous flow can also be simulated to predict ship to ship interference chen et al 2002a applied the rans method to study multi ship interactions in restricted water under the influence of parameters such as ship speed wind ship to wharf distance and water depth chen et al 2002b further calculated the unsteady forces of ship to ship interference in a restricted channel and found that their results were in close agreement with the experimental results dand 1981 using the cfx and star ccm commercial software packages fonfach et al 2011 simulated four operating conditions ideal fluids considering free surface effects ideal fluids ignoring free surface effects viscous fluids considering free surface effects and viscous fluids ignoring free surface effects to determine how viscosity and the free surface condition affect results they found that while viscosity has little effect the effect of the free surface was magnified when the two ships were at closer lateral distances yang et al 2011 applied the fluent commercial cfd software package to simulate the interaction between two kvlcc2 ship models in restricted water with the influence of the free surface effect neglected and found that his results were in close agreement with xiang and faltinsen 2011 by applying the boundary element method which further suggested the limited role of viscosity in such situations lo 2012 used cfd package flow 3d to simulate two ships interference forces and angular velocity during overtaking and meeting conditions zou and larsson 2013 simulated the ship to ship interaction problem using the rans equation while ignoring the effects of the free surface as well as the heave and pitch motions of the ships and used their approach to study the effects of ship speed water depth and lateral distance on kvlcc2 and aframax hulls using the open source cfd software open foam lee 2015 applied the volume of fluid method to model the free surface and the arbitrary coupled mesh interface method to simulate the moving mesh to study the passing of a kvccc1 hull through a moored kcs ship in restricted water mousaviraad et al 2016a used the ship iowa cfd software package to apply the urans equation in simulating the interactions between two ships in calm water and wavy conditions using the overlapping grid technique wnęk et al 2018 simulated the hydrodynamic interaction of two ships advancing parallel with different lateral distances and water depths using a commercial cfd code their cfd results were strictly discussed in terms of reaching iterative and grid convergence and the effects of turbulence models on two ships interactions were studied they found that viscosity has less influence on such problems while the free surface may become important when the lateral distance between two ships is small 1 3 present work a comparison of the experimental data and numerical results described above reveals that potential flow solvers can generally provide satisfactory predictions in some cases however the peak force and moment results provided by the potential flow solver are smaller than the corresponding experimental data a result of neglecting viscosity and the free surface effect yuan 2019 found that the asymmetry of flow passing on the sides of a hull as the result of a lifting force will affect the yaw moment as vortex influence is not considered in potential flow simulation cfd simulation will be required to determine the lifting force caused by asymmetric flow on the other hand the free surface effect has been found to depend on the ship s froude number and to a certain extent the lateral distance between two ships in the context of the unsteady flow involved in ship ship interactions the free surface condition is complicated and difficult to simulate and its influence on ship forces therefore remains a challenging research problem although cfd programs are capable of investigating many complex hydrodynamic problems they have a high computational requirement which suggest that the most efficient way to simulate ship to ship problems is to use potential flow theory accordingly the primary goal of this study was to develop a high precision and efficient potential flow simulation solution for ship to ship problems and to verify the influence of factors neglected under potential flow simulation to conduct these analyses the ghent university belgium test model was used as the research object and the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem was used to simulate the problem by applying tebem we avoided the difficulty of arranging the points at sharp corners of structural which improved the accuracy of calculation and delivered more robust results the commercial star ccm cfd software was also used to conduct the simulation finally we examined the influence of different parameters speeds of the respective ships water depth and lateral distance on the ships hydrodynamics and summarized the patterns of the results based on an analysis of the potential flow results 2 boundary value problem of the interaction between two ships 2 1 coordinate system of the interaction between two ships a model of two ships navigating in shallow water is shown fig 1 in which ship o the origin ship sails at a constant speed u o ship t the target ship sails at a constant speed u t s t is the longitudinal distance between the two ships y b b is the lateral distance between the two ships and h is the water depth fig 1 also shows the local coordinate system used in the simulation o x y z which follows the right handed rule with the z axis running perpendicular to the water surface the fixed coordinate system used on each ship also follows the right handed rule with the x axis pointing in the direction of motion of the ship the coordinate system of ship o o x o y o z o sails with o at speed u o while that of ship t o x t y t z t follows t at speed u t all three planes o x y z o x o y o z o and o x t y t z t are fixed on the still water surface and the origin of the local coordinate system is located at the midpoint of the longitudinal distance between the two ships 2 2 mathematical formulation of the interaction between two ships several assumptions are made in solving the problem 1 the fluid in the flow field is an ideal fluid with viscosity ignored 2 the speed of each ship is low enough to neglect the influence of the free surface effect that is the free surface is considered to be a rigid wall and 3 to simplify the model the bottom is considered to be a plane expressing the velocity potential in the flow field as φ x y z t the laplace equation and boundary conditions can be applied as follows 1 2 φ 0 φ n u n o n s h φ z 0 o n z 0 φ z 0 o n z h where s h indicates the surface of the ship o and ship t n is the normal vector which points toward the ship positively the bernoulli equation can be used to obtain the pressure distribution on the hull surface when we get the velocity potential and its derivatives then the near field pressure integral can be used to obtain the force and moment acting on the ships 2 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ φ 3 f ρ s h φ t 1 2 φ φ n d s 4 m ρ s h φ t 1 2 φ φ r n d s the final expression of the hydrodynamic force and moment could be obtained using the transport theory and gauss theory in the fluid domain 5 f ρ d d t s h φ n d s ρ s h φ n φ 1 2 φ φ n d s 6 m ρ d d t s h φ r n d s ρ s h φ n r φ 1 2 φ φ r n d s in order to compare with the numerical results of xu et al 2019 the same non dimensionalised manner of force and moment is adopted as follows 7 c f x y f x y 1 2 ρ l o t o u o 2 u o u t u t 2 8 c m z m z 1 2 ρ l o 2 t o u o 2 u o u t u t 2 where f x f y m z indicates the longitudinal force lateral force yaw moment respectively ρ is the water density l o t o and u o are respectively the origin ship s length draught and speed and l t and u t are respectively the target ship s length and speed 2 3 application of tebem in establishing the boundary integral equation to solve the boundary value problem eq 1 of interaction between two ships by a mixed distribution of sources and dipoles the boundary integral equation takes the form of 9 2 π φ p s φ q g p q n q d s q s g p q φ q n q d s q where p x y z indicates the field point and q ξ η ζ indicates the source point n q is the normal vector g p q represents the green function which is expressed as 10 g x y z ξ η ζ m 1 r m 1 r m 11 r m x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 m h 2 r m x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 m h 2 where m is the number of virtual mirrors s is the fluid domain boundary which can be divided into n quadrilateral or triangle surface elements s j 1 n δ s j when p is located in the element i the discrete expression of the eq 9 can be constructed as follows 12 2 π φ p j 1 j i n δ s j φ q g p i q j n q d s j 1 n δ s j g p i q j φ q n q d s to accurately obtain the induced velocity on the sharp corner on boundary the tebem was proposed by duan 2012 a simple idea is introduced after space discretization of the boundary as shown in fig 2 on each panel the dipole strength is no longer regarded as a constant but assumed by taylor expansions about the center of each panel such as 13 φ q φ q 0 ξ φ ξ q 0 η φ η q 0 where ξ η ζ is the local coordinate of the source point q in element q referring to fig 2 where the direction of ζ is the same with n q x y z is the local coordinate of the field point p in element p where the direction of z is the same with n the source and dipole strengths on each element in low order bem are assumed to be constant while in the tebem they are expressed through the taylor expansion at the centroid of each element the dipole strength from eq 13 can be substituted into eq 12 to obtain the boundary integral equation in two ship interaction problems 14 2 π φ t p j 1 j i n φ t q 0 δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 ξ δ s j ξ g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 η δ s j η g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q δ s j g p i q j d s the number of unknowns in eq 14 is 3 n which are φ φ ξ and φ η respectively in order to supply the boundary integral equation for the tebem the first order partial derivative of potential at the field point p along the x and y directions referring to fig 2 for eq 12 is as follows 15 2 π φ t p x j 1 j i n φ t q 0 x δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q x δ s j g p i q j d s 16 2 π φ t p y j 1 j i n φ t q 0 y δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q y δ s j g p i q j d s similarly substitute eq 13 into the dipole strengths in eqs 15 and 16 17 2 π φ t p x j 1 j i n φ t q 0 x δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 ξ x δ s j ξ g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 η x δ s j η g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q x δ s j g p i q j d s 18 2 π φ t p y j 1 j i n φ t q 0 y δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 ξ y δ s j ξ g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 η y δ s j η g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q y δ s j g p i q j d s hence eqs 14 17 and 18 form the boundary integral equations of tebem it can be found that the dipole strength and its first order derivatives tangential induced velocity are unknowns and could be obtained by solving the coupling equations while the source strength normal induced velocity is known many influence coefficients are involved in eqs 14 17 and 18 whose principle value and numerical implementation can be referred to duan et al 2015a 2015b consequently tebem could solve the velocity potential and its derivatives directly the tangential derivatives of dipole strength φ ξ and φ η and source strength φ n form the induced velocity field under the local coordinate system in each panel and could be transferred to the earth coordinate system using the coordinate transformation it has been demonstrated in duan et al 2015a 2015b that the tebem can effectively improve the accuracy of the induced velocity at the sharp corner which in turn can improve accuracy in calculating hydrodynamic of structures with sharp corners at present this program can only calculate parallel motion of ships and does not consider the maneuvering motions of the ships 3 convergence analysis 3 1 convergence analysis based on tebem the parameters of the origin ship o and the target ship t are listed in table 1 in which o and t indicate the respective models the ships are divided into respective quadrilateral meshes and a total of four matching meshes are selected see table 2 and fig 3 fig 4 show time series of the lateral force cfy and the yaw moment cmz where the parameter ξ as a non dimensional representation of the longitudinal distance between two ships 19 ξ 2 s t l o l t s t is the longitudinal distance between two ships it is seen that using a total number of 1509 panels allows the calculated results to converge the results of using time steps of 0 5 and 0 75 s on a minimum grid are shown in fig 5 from which either time step appears to give a satisfactory result based on these results the modeling was conducted with 1509 panels and a time step of 0 5 s to ensure convergence 3 2 convergence analysis based on viscous flow calculation the details of the numerical simulation approaches used in the cfd calculation will be discussed before the convergence analysis in order to compare with the experimental results of vantorre et al 2002 an identical computational domain size is adopted with a domain width of 7 m and depth of 0 2484 m in order to ensure completion of the interference process between two ships the length of the domain needs to be set long enough thus the length was set to 25 m in meeting condition and 50 m in overtaking condition mesh generation was performed using the automatic meshing facility in star ccm and about 80 grids per wave length and 20 grids per wave height were used to refine the mesh around the free surface while no mesh refinement was needed at the free surface location for the double body condition the overset mesh was used for both ship models and forced movement was applied with the hull straightly over a static background mesh without any vertical motion fig 6 shows a cross section of the computation mesh with the refinement of the overset mesh region around the hull the setup of the boundary conditions is presented in fig 7 the wall boundary condition was set on both sides and the bottom of the domain for simulating the effect of the narrow channel in shallow water and there is no damping introduced in the domain while the front and back of the domain were selected as the pressure outlet at which the pressure is specified and the top boundary was selected as the velocity inlet the free surface in simulations can be handled in two ways one is the double body method which means that the free surface is treated as a rigid wall and the other is to consider the actual effect of the wavemaking and use the volume of fluid vof method to capture the free surface the s s t k ω turbulence model was selected in cfd calculations this model has also been used in many other studies in two ships interference problem such as sian et al 2016 and fonfach et al 2011 the boundary layer grids are designed to achieve y 1 at all froude numbers for both ships with 6 prismatic layers near the hull the second order upwind scheme was used to discretize the convection term and the implicit unsteady solver was used in a time advanced manner to ensure calculation stability in the two ships interaction process the second order temporal discretization was used in free surface condition in order to accurately capture sharp interfaces between the different phases cd adapco 2014 while first order temporal discretization was used in double body condition the inner iteration of each time step was used to ensure that the reduction of momentum residuals by three orders of magnitude and the reduction of continuity residuals by two orders of magnitude which is usually achieved in about 10 iterations in the simulation process the simulation with the meeting process of two ships was selected for convergence analysis for grid and time step in cfd calculation three grids were generated in star ccm with the mesh refinement ratio of r g 2 in the overlapping region which means that the background mesh configuration was not altered this resulted in fine medium and coarse grids with approximately 5 27m 3 03m and 1 48m grid points respectively these solutions required for the grid study were run with the same time step t 0 02 while in the convergence analysis of time step t 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 were selected with the ratio of r t 2 and the study was conducted on the fine grid the root mean square rms value of the calculated lateral force for the meeting process of two ships was used to estimate the convergence of grid and time step which are shown in fig 8 and table 3 the difference value in rms for different meshes and time steps can be calculated as follows ε g 12 s g 1 s g 2 0 0201 ε g 23 s g 2 s g 3 0 1606 ε t 12 s t 1 s t 2 0 0369 ε t 23 s t 2 s t 3 0 1183 the calculations show that ε g 12 ε g 23 and ε t 23 ε t 13 indicating monotonic convergence of the grid and time step therefore it can be concluded that they have good convergence property accordingly the medium grid and time step t 0 01 are used for all cfd calculations in this paper 4 meeting conditions the test model at the ghent university of belgium was used as the research object to enable comparison with the experimental results of vantorre et al 2002 and numerical results based on cpm and hobem by xu et al 2019 parameters consistent with those used in these studies were used the speeds of ships o and t were both set to 12 knots u o u t 12knots the ratio of lateral distance to ship width was set to 0 5 y b b b o 0 5 and the ratio of water depth to ship draught was set to 1 2 h d o 1 2 the force and moment results for the origin ship are shown in fig 9 the tebem results appear to be essentially identical to the hobem results from the lateral force data that the difference between the results based on the viscous flow simulation and those obtained by the potential flow method are within 10 in peak and valley as well as the yaw moment the viscous effect can be inferred as being insignificant during the ships encounter there were however some differences in terms of both lateral force and yaw moment between the numerical simulation and experimental results with nearly 50 error in peak value the results of sutulo et al 2012 for two ship interactions in shallow water showed the same phenomenon in order to verify whether the error is caused by ignoring the free surface the simulation of cfd with free surface is performed below 4 1 influence of the free surface we used a star ccm simulation to specifically study the free surface effect with the other parameters keep constant in the numerical simulation the force and moment generated by the two ships are sensitive to the free surface so the mesh is refinement at the free surface area however the number of meshes is sharply increased at the same time the total number of grids in meeting conditions is about 30 million the force and yaw moment results are shown in fig 10 a comparison of the results reveals that the free surface results were nearly the same as the double body no free surface results apart from the lateral force when two ships are close possibly because the numerical error of simulation with free surface in shallow water using cfd the wave patterns generated between the ships are shown in fig 11 wave patterns induced by the approach of the target ship onto the two sides of the origin ship appear to be asymmetrical but have less effect due to the low speed of the ship it can be explained that the free surface has less effect in the meeting conditions 4 2 effect of different parameters interference between ships will be affected by parameters such as water depth lateral distance between ships and speed these standardized parameters can be represented in terms of the speeds of the respective ships u o and u t knots the water depth ratio h t o and the lateral distance ratio y b b b o the forces encountered by the respective ships vary with these parameters and the effect of each must be assessed in isolation i e by changing it while keeping the other parameters unchanged the values used to assess each parameter are shown in table 4 the forces and moments caused by changing each of the above parameters are plotted in figs 12 15 figs 12 and 13 show that changing the water depth did not affect the patterns in which the lateral force or moment changed only the force amplitudes were affected in the form of decreases in amplitude as the water depth increased in particular the force and moment results were most altered at water depth ratios h t o of between 1 1 and 1 3 as with the water depth results changing the lateral distance did not change the patterns in which the force or moment varied with the magnitudes of both decreasing as the lateral distance increased figs 14 and 15 show that changes in the speed of the origin ship had no effect on the overall patterns of force and moment change with both decreasing as the speed increased although the speed of the target ship also had no effect on the patterns both the force and moment increased with the target ship speed changes in u t had a more significant effect than changes in u o on the lateral force and moment 5 overtaking conditions the same basic parameters with the exception of the origin ship s velocity which was set to u o 8 knots were used to analyze the ship to ship overtaking condition to validate the tebem results the calculated force and moment were compared with existing published results including the experimental values obtained by vantorre et al 2002 the numerical results based on cpm and hobem by xu et al 2019 and viscous flow results obtained using the double body method the origin ship results are shown in fig 16 which reveals that the tebem and hobem results are in close agreement however the peak value in lateral force and yaw moment obtained from the viscous flow simulation is larger than the potential flow result by more than 30 possibly as a result of the flow field asymmetry on the origin ship s sides arising from the lifting force generated by the approach of the target ship to the stern of the origin ship during the overtaking process see fig 17 this result indicates that viscosity during the overtaking process must be taken into account however more than 50 error occurred in peak value in yaw moment between the numerical simulation and experimental result in order to verify whether the error is caused by ignoring the free surface cfd simulation with free surface was performed 5 1 influence of the free surface to investigate the effect of the free surface condition the other parameters were held fixed and the overtaking condition was simulated using star ccm the grid generated is the same as the meeting condition due to the larger computational domain in this problem the total number of grids increased to 50 million fig 18 shows that the free surface results were the same as the double body no free surface results it can be concluded that the free surface has less effect in the overtaking condition the wave patterns generated when the target ship overtook the origin ship are shown in fig 19 5 2 effect of different parameters as in the ship meeting case the interference between ships during the overtaking process will also be affected by parameters such as water depth lateral distance between the ships and speed these were represented using the following standardized parameters the speeds of the respective ships u o knots and u t knots the water depth ratio h t o and the lateral distance ratio y b b b o to more clearly analyze the influence of the respective parameters the effects of each were changed with the others held constant the respective parameter settings used are listed in table 5 as shown in figs 20 23 the variations in force and moment resulting from changing the respective parameters were affected by the longitudinal distance between the two ships for instance fig 20 shows that the water depth changed the amplitudes but not the patterns of change in force and moment which both decreased as the water depth increased in a manner similar to the meeting condition results the force and moment were most affected in the range of water depth ratio h t o of 1 1 1 3 from fig 21 it is seen that the lateral distance did not affect the patterns of change in the force or moment although the amplitudes of both decreased as the lateral distance increased with a maximum effect in the lateral distance ratio range of 0 25 1 00 in particular at y b b b o 0 25 the force was large in the relative longitudinal distance range of ξ 0 to 0 25 fig 22 shows that the speed of ship o had no effect on the overall trends in force or moment as u o is increased both the longitudinal force and yaw moment increased while the lateral force decreased similarly fig 23 shows that u t had no effect on the overall trends in the interference force or moment of ship o and exerted little influence on its amplitude 6 conclusions in this study we compared the interference force and moment of two ships in restricted water between tebem and other computational methods the comparisons show that the present method has the same accuracy as hobem moreover the calculation point in tebem is arranged at the center of the panel instead of the corner thus it is very convenient to arrange the panel in the corner of the structure however the computational efficiency of this method is not as high as the panel method proposed by sutulo and guedes soares 2008 and hobem because it uses triple variables in solving the linear algebraic equations thus the calculation efficiency of this method needs to be improved in the future the effects of viscosity lifting force and the free surface effect on ship to ship interaction were studied in detail with the free surface ignored our findings suggest that the viscosity has an insignificant contribution in the meeting condition with less than 10 difference in peak between viscous flow and tebem results in lateral force and yaw moment while under the overtaking condition however the viscous simulation shows more accurate results in yaw moment which were 30 large than the tebem results in peak as the latter approach does not take into account the effects of lifting force caused by asymmetric flow this suggests that the effect of viscosity on the peak value of interference force and moment needs to be considered in the overtaking condition when considering the free surface the results show that the free surface has less effect in both the meeting and overtaking conditions at the same time the viscous flow simulation considering the free surface is very time consuming and demands a high computational cost thus the double body method can be used in two ship interface problems with low speeds of the ships the effects of different parameters such as speed water depth and lateral distance between the two ships were analyzed based on tebem while changing the water depth and lateral distance did not affect the patterns of force or moment their values decreased with increasing water depth and lateral distance further assessment of the speeds of the origin and target ships revealed that in the meeting case changing the speed of the target ship had a greater effect on the origin ship while in the overtaking case the origin ship results were primarily affected by its own speed in future research it would be useful to vary the parameters used in this study to determine how they affect the free surface and viscosity and in turn the solution of the two ship interference

shipping has promoted rapid developments in the shipping industry which are needed to handle the growing number of ships transiting through ports and inland waterways ship hydrodynamic performance is affected by interference between the ship hull and channel river or harbor bottom in some cases such conditions can undermine the safety of maneuvering solutions to problems such as these generally involve the application of experimental and numerical methods with the latter approach being more repeatable and generally less costly although numerical simulations based on the potential flow method are faster and require fewer computational resources than simulations that apply viscosity taking viscous effects into account results in a more realistic simulation in the following sub sections we briefly summarize each research method currently applied in this field 1 1 model test newton 1960 studied the parallel navigation of two ships in deep water and analyzed other works to assess the

between ships 1 2 numerical simulation kaplan and sankaranarayanan 1991 used numerical methods based on potential flow to study the hydrodynamic interference of two ships in restricted water while chitrapu et al 2007 studied the seakeeping and maneuverability of two ships navigating in parallel under the effects of wind waves and current by applying the time domain method sutulo and guedes soares 2008 created a code based on the hess and smith panel method to calculate hydrodynamic interaction force on ships and the code was applied to the simulation of an overtaking maneuver of two ships in uncontrolled rudder fixed and controlled motion sutulo and guedes soares 2009 they also validated their code against experimental data for a tug operating near a larger vessel and assessed the calculation accuracy and efficiency in their results sutulo et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 also applied the double body method to develop a moving patch approach and a set of computational programs based on potential flow method under their approach the calculation area was continuously updated to obtain the force of a ship in a given channel although their method had a significant advantage in terms of its ability to handle channels of arbitrary shape it increased computational load to analyze the free surface effect yuan et al 2015a developed the mhydro program based on the 3d rankine source method and release the heave and pitch motions of ships in overtaking conditions their results were in good agreement with the experimental values obtained by vantorre et al 2002 yuan et al 2015b further investigated the influence of the free surface and calculated the hydrodynamic interaction between two ships both in head sea and beam sea conditions xu and zou 2016 used the high order boundary element method hobem with the influence of the free surface neglected to analyze the forces on a wigley ship during straight line navigation toward another fixed wigley ship and compared their results with the theoretical calculations for slender body dynamics basing on this preceding work xu et al 2019 calculated the meeting and overtaking situations discussed in vantorre et al 2002 by applying the constant panel method cpm and hobem respectively in addition to potential flow viscous flow can also be simulated to predict ship to ship interference chen et al 2002a applied the rans method to study multi ship interactions in restricted water under the influence of parameters such as ship speed wind ship to wharf distance and water depth chen et al 2002b further calculated the unsteady forces of ship to ship interference in a restricted channel and found that their results were in close agreement with the experimental results dand 1981 using the cfx and star ccm commercial software packages fonfach et al 2011 simulated four operating conditions ideal fluids considering free surface effects ideal fluids ignoring free surface effects viscous fluids considering free surface effects and viscous fluids ignoring free surface effects to determine how viscosity and the free surface condition affect results they found that while viscosity has little effect the effect of the free surface was magnified when the two ships were at closer lateral distances yang et al 2011 applied the fluent commercial cfd software package to simulate the interaction between two kvlcc2 ship models in restricted water with the influence of the free surface effect neglected and found that his results were in close agreement with xiang and faltinsen 2011 by applying the boundary element method which further suggested the limited role of viscosity in such situations lo 2012 used cfd package flow 3d to simulate two ships interference forces and angular velocity during overtaking and meeting conditions zou and larsson 2013 simulated the ship to ship interaction problem using the rans equation while ignoring the effects of the free surface as well as the heave and pitch motions of the ships and used their approach to study the effects of ship speed water depth and lateral distance on kvlcc2 and aframax hulls using the open source cfd software open foam lee 2015 applied the volume of fluid method to model the free surface and the arbitrary coupled mesh interface method to simulate the moving mesh to study the passing of a kvccc1 hull through a moored kcs ship in restricted water mousaviraad et al 2016a used the ship iowa cfd software package to apply the urans equation in simulating the interactions between two ships in calm water and wavy conditions using the overlapping grid technique wnęk et al 2018 simulated the hydrodynamic interaction of two ships advancing parallel with different lateral distances and water depths using a commercial cfd code their cfd results were strictly discussed in terms of reaching iterative and grid convergence and the effects of turbulence models on two ships interactions were studied they found that viscosity has less influence on such problems while the free surface may become important when the lateral distance between two ships is small 1 3 present work a comparison of the experimental data and numerical results described above reveals that potential flow solvers can generally provide satisfactory predictions in some cases however the peak force and moment results provided by the potential flow solver are smaller than the corresponding experimental data a result of neglecting viscosity and the free surface effect yuan 2019 found that the asymmetry of flow passing on the sides of a hull as the result of a lifting force will affect the yaw moment as vortex influence is not considered in potential flow simulation cfd simulation will be required to determine the lifting force caused by asymmetric flow on the other hand the free surface effect has been found to depend on the ship s froude number and to a certain extent the lateral distance between two ships in the context of the unsteady flow involved in ship ship interactions the free surface condition is complicated and difficult to simulate and its influence on ship forces therefore remains a challenging research problem although cfd programs are capable of investigating many complex hydrodynamic problems they have a high computational requirement which suggest that the most efficient way to simulate ship to ship problems is to use potential flow theory accordingly the primary goal of this study was to develop a high precision and efficient potential flow simulation solution for ship to ship problems and to verify the influence of factors neglected under potential flow simulation to conduct these analyses the ghent university belgium test model was used as the research object and the taylor expansion boundary element method tebem was used to simulate the problem by applying tebem we avoided the difficulty of arranging the points at sharp corners of structural which improved the accuracy of calculation and delivered more robust results the commercial star ccm cfd software was also used to conduct the simulation finally we examined the influence of different parameters speeds of the respective ships water depth and lateral distance on the ships hydrodynamics and summarized the patterns of the results based on an analysis of the potential flow results 2 boundary value problem of the interaction between two ships 2 1 coordinate system of the interaction between two ships a model of two ships navigating in shallow water is shown fig 1 in which ship o the origin ship sails at a constant speed u o ship t the target ship sails at a constant speed u t s t is the longitudinal distance between the two ships y b b is the lateral distance between the two ships and h is the water depth fig 1 also shows the local coordinate system used in the simulation o x y z which follows the right handed rule with the z axis running perpendicular to the water surface the fixed coordinate system used on each ship also follows the right handed rule with the x axis pointing in the direction of motion of the ship the coordinate system of ship o o x o y o z o sails with o at speed u o while that of ship t o x t y t z t follows t at speed u t all three planes o x y z o x o y o z o and o x t y t z t are fixed on the still water surface and the origin of the local coordinate system is located at the midpoint of the longitudinal distance between the two ships 2 2 mathematical formulation of the interaction between two ships several assumptions are made in solving the problem 1 the fluid in the flow field is an ideal fluid with viscosity ignored 2 the speed of each ship is low enough to neglect the influence of the free surface effect that is the free surface is considered to be a rigid wall and 3 to simplify the model the bottom is considered to be a plane expressing the velocity potential in the flow field as φ x y z t the laplace equation and boundary conditions can be applied as follows 1 2 φ 0 φ n u n o n s h φ z 0 o n z 0 φ z 0 o n z h where s h indicates the surface of the ship o and ship t n is the normal vector which points toward the ship positively the bernoulli equation can be used to obtain the pressure distribution on the hull surface when we get the velocity potential and its derivatives then the near field pressure integral can be used to obtain the force and moment acting on the ships 2 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ φ 3 f ρ s h φ t 1 2 φ φ n d s 4 m ρ s h φ t 1 2 φ φ r n d s the final expression of the hydrodynamic force and moment could be obtained using the transport theory and gauss theory in the fluid domain 5 f ρ d d t s h φ n d s ρ s h φ n φ 1 2 φ φ n d s 6 m ρ d d t s h φ r n d s ρ s h φ n r φ 1 2 φ φ r n d s in order to compare with the numerical results of xu et al 2019 the same non dimensionalised manner of force and moment is adopted as follows 7 c f x y f x y 1 2 ρ l o t o u o 2 u o u t u t 2 8 c m z m z 1 2 ρ l o 2 t o u o 2 u o u t u t 2 where f x f y m z indicates the longitudinal force lateral force yaw moment respectively ρ is the water density l o t o and u o are respectively the origin ship s length draught and speed and l t and u t are respectively the target ship s length and speed 2 3 application of tebem in establishing the boundary integral equation to solve the boundary value problem eq 1 of interaction between two ships by a mixed distribution of sources and dipoles the boundary integral equation takes the form of 9 2 π φ p s φ q g p q n q d s q s g p q φ q n q d s q where p x y z indicates the field point and q ξ η ζ indicates the source point n q is the normal vector g p q represents the green function which is expressed as 10 g x y z ξ η ζ m 1 r m 1 r m 11 r m x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 m h 2 r m x ξ 2 y η 2 z ζ 2 m h 2 where m is the number of virtual mirrors s is the fluid domain boundary which can be divided into n quadrilateral or triangle surface elements s j 1 n δ s j when p is located in the element i the discrete expression of the eq 9 can be constructed as follows 12 2 π φ p j 1 j i n δ s j φ q g p i q j n q d s j 1 n δ s j g p i q j φ q n q d s to accurately obtain the induced velocity on the sharp corner on boundary the tebem was proposed by duan 2012 a simple idea is introduced after space discretization of the boundary as shown in fig 2 on each panel the dipole strength is no longer regarded as a constant but assumed by taylor expansions about the center of each panel such as 13 φ q φ q 0 ξ φ ξ q 0 η φ η q 0 where ξ η ζ is the local coordinate of the source point q in element q referring to fig 2 where the direction of ζ is the same with n q x y z is the local coordinate of the field point p in element p where the direction of z is the same with n the source and dipole strengths on each element in low order bem are assumed to be constant while in the tebem they are expressed through the taylor expansion at the centroid of each element the dipole strength from eq 13 can be substituted into eq 12 to obtain the boundary integral equation in two ship interaction problems 14 2 π φ t p j 1 j i n φ t q 0 δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 ξ δ s j ξ g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 η δ s j η g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q δ s j g p i q j d s the number of unknowns in eq 14 is 3 n which are φ φ ξ and φ η respectively in order to supply the boundary integral equation for the tebem the first order partial derivative of potential at the field point p along the x and y directions referring to fig 2 for eq 12 is as follows 15 2 π φ t p x j 1 j i n φ t q 0 x δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q x δ s j g p i q j d s 16 2 π φ t p y j 1 j i n φ t q 0 y δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q y δ s j g p i q j d s similarly substitute eq 13 into the dipole strengths in eqs 15 and 16 17 2 π φ t p x j 1 j i n φ t q 0 x δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 ξ x δ s j ξ g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 η x δ s j η g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q x δ s j g p i q j d s 18 2 π φ t p y j 1 j i n φ t q 0 y δ s j g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 ξ y δ s j ξ g p i q j n q d s j 1 j i n φ t q 0 η y δ s j η g p i q j n q d s j 1 n φ t q 0 n q y δ s j g p i q j d s hence eqs 14 17 and 18 form the boundary integral equations of tebem it can be found that the dipole strength and its first order derivatives tangential induced velocity are unknowns and could be obtained by solving the coupling equations while the source strength normal induced velocity is known many influence coefficients are involved in eqs 14 17 and 18 whose principle value and numerical implementation can be referred to duan et al 2015a 2015b consequently tebem could solve the velocity potential and its derivatives directly the tangential derivatives of dipole strength φ ξ and φ η and source strength φ n form the induced velocity field under the local coordinate system in each panel and could be transferred to the earth coordinate system using the coordinate transformation it has been demonstrated in duan et al 2015a 2015b that the tebem can effectively improve the accuracy of the induced velocity at the sharp corner which in turn can improve accuracy in calculating hydrodynamic of structures with sharp corners at present this program can only calculate parallel motion of ships and does not consider the maneuvering motions of the ships 3 convergence analysis 3 1 convergence analysis based on tebem the parameters of the origin ship o and the target ship t are listed in table 1 in which o and t indicate the respective models the ships are divided into respective quadrilateral meshes and a total of four matching meshes are selected see table 2 and fig 3 fig 4 show time series of the lateral force cfy and the yaw moment cmz where the parameter ξ as a non dimensional representation of the longitudinal distance between two ships 19 ξ 2 s t l o l t s t is the longitudinal distance between two ships it is seen that using a total number of 1509 panels allows the calculated results to converge the results of using time steps of 0 5 and 0 75 s on a minimum grid are shown in fig 5 from which either time step appears to give a satisfactory result based on these results the modeling was conducted with 1509 panels and a time step of 0 5 s to ensure convergence 3 2 convergence analysis based on viscous flow calculation the details of the numerical simulation approaches used in the cfd calculation will be discussed before the convergence analysis in order to compare with the experimental results of vantorre et al 2002 an identical computational domain size is adopted with a domain width of 7 m and depth of 0 2484 m in order to ensure completion of the interference process between two ships the length of the domain needs to be set long enough thus the length was set to 25 m in meeting condition and 50 m in overtaking condition mesh generation was performed using the automatic meshing facility in star ccm and about 80 grids per wave length and 20 grids per wave height were used to refine the mesh around the free surface while no mesh refinement was needed at the free surface location for the double body condition the overset mesh was used for both ship models and forced movement was applied with the hull straightly over a static background mesh without any vertical motion fig 6 shows a cross section of the computation mesh with the refinement of the overset mesh region around the hull the setup of the boundary conditions is presented in fig 7 the wall boundary condition was set on both sides and the bottom of the domain for simulating the effect of the narrow channel in shallow water and there is no damping introduced in the domain while the front and back of the domain were selected as the pressure outlet at which the pressure is specified and the top boundary was selected as the velocity inlet the free surface in simulations can be handled in two ways one is the double body method which means that the free surface is treated as a rigid wall and the other is to consider the actual effect of the wavemaking and use the volume of fluid vof method to capture the free surface the s s t k ω turbulence model was selected in cfd calculations this model has also been used in many other studies in two ships interference problem such as sian et al 2016 and fonfach et al 2011 the boundary layer grids are designed to achieve y 1 at all froude numbers for both ships with 6 prismatic layers near the hull the second order upwind scheme was used to discretize the convection term and the implicit unsteady solver was used in a time advanced manner to ensure calculation stability in the two ships interaction process the second order temporal discretization was used in free surface condition in order to accurately capture sharp interfaces between the different phases cd adapco 2014 while first order temporal discretization was used in double body condition the inner iteration of each time step was used to ensure that the reduction of momentum residuals by three orders of magnitude and the reduction of continuity residuals by two orders of magnitude which is usually achieved in about 10 iterations in the simulation process the simulation with the meeting process of two ships was selected for convergence analysis for grid and time step in cfd calculation three grids were generated in star ccm with the mesh refinement ratio of r g 2 in the overlapping region which means that the background mesh configuration was not altered this resulted in fine medium and coarse grids with approximately 5 27m 3 03m and 1 48m grid points respectively these solutions required for the grid study were run with the same time step t 0 02 while in the convergence analysis of time step t 0 005 0 01 and 0 02 were selected with the ratio of r t 2 and the study was conducted on the fine grid the root mean square rms value of the calculated lateral force for the meeting process of two ships was used to estimate the convergence of grid and time step which are shown in fig 8 and table 3 the difference value in rms for different meshes and time steps can be calculated as follows ε g 12 s g 1 s g 2 0 0201 ε g 23 s g 2 s g 3 0 1606 ε t 12 s t 1 s t 2 0 0369 ε t 23 s t 2 s t 3 0 1183 the calculations show that ε g 12 ε g 23 and ε t 23 ε t 13 indicating monotonic convergence of the grid and time step therefore it can be concluded that they have good convergence property accordingly the medium grid and time step t 0 01 are used for all cfd calculations in this paper 4 meeting conditions the test model at the ghent university of belgium was used as the research object to enable comparison with the experimental results of vantorre et al 2002 and numerical results based on cpm and hobem by xu et al 2019 parameters consistent with those used in these studies were used the speeds of ships o and t were both set to 12 knots u o u t 12knots the ratio of lateral distance to ship width was set to 0 5 y b b b o 0 5 and the ratio of water depth to ship draught was set to 1 2 h d o 1 2 the force and moment results for the origin ship are shown in fig 9 the tebem results appear to be essentially identical to the hobem results from the lateral force data that the difference between the results based on the viscous flow simulation and those obtained by the potential flow method are within 10 in peak and valley as well as the yaw moment the viscous effect can be inferred as being insignificant during the ships encounter there were however some differences in terms of both lateral force and yaw moment between the numerical simulation and experimental results with nearly 50 error in peak value the results of sutulo et al 2012 for two ship interactions in shallow water showed the same phenomenon in order to verify whether the error is caused by ignoring the free surface the simulation of cfd with free surface is performed below 4 1 influence of the free surface we used a star ccm simulation to specifically study the free surface effect with the other parameters keep constant in the numerical simulation the force and moment generated by the two ships are sensitive to the free surface so the mesh is refinement at the free surface area however the number of meshes is sharply increased at the same time the total number of grids in meeting conditions is about 30 million the force and yaw moment results are shown in fig 10 a comparison of the results reveals that the free surface results were nearly the same as the double body no free surface results apart from the lateral force when two ships are close possibly because the numerical error of simulation with free surface in shallow water using cfd the wave patterns generated between the ships are shown in fig 11 wave patterns induced by the approach of the target ship onto the two sides of the origin ship appear to be asymmetrical but have less effect due to the low speed of the ship it can be explained that the free surface has less effect in the meeting conditions 4 2 effect of different parameters interference between ships will be affected by parameters such as water depth lateral distance between ships and speed these standardized parameters can be represented in terms of the speeds of the respective ships u o and u t knots the water depth ratio h t o and the lateral distance ratio y b b b o the forces encountered by the respective ships vary with these parameters and the effect of each must be assessed in isolation i e by changing it while keeping the other parameters unchanged the values used to assess each parameter are shown in table 4 the forces and moments caused by changing each of the above parameters are plotted in figs 12 15 figs 12 and 13 show that changing the water depth did not affect the patterns in which the lateral force or moment changed only the force amplitudes were affected in the form of decreases in amplitude as the water depth increased in particular the force and moment results were most altered at water depth ratios h t o of between 1 1 and 1 3 as with the water depth results changing the lateral distance did not change the patterns in which the force or moment varied with the magnitudes of both decreasing as the lateral distance increased figs 14 and 15 show that changes in the speed of the origin ship had no effect on the overall patterns of force and moment change with both decreasing as the speed increased although the speed of the target ship also had no effect on the patterns both the force and moment increased with the target ship speed changes in u t had a more significant effect than changes in u o on the lateral force and moment 5 overtaking conditions the same basic parameters with the exception of the origin ship s velocity which was set to u o 8 knots were used to analyze the ship to ship overtaking condition to validate the tebem results the calculated force and moment were compared with existing published results including the experimental values obtained by vantorre et al 2002 the numerical results based on cpm and hobem by xu et al 2019 and viscous flow results obtained using the double body method the origin ship results are shown in fig 16 which reveals that the tebem and hobem results are in close agreement however the peak value in lateral force and yaw moment obtained from the viscous flow simulation is larger than the potential flow result by more than 30 possibly as a result of the flow field asymmetry on the origin ship s sides arising from the lifting force generated by the approach of the target ship to the stern of the origin ship during the overtaking process see fig 17 this result indicates that viscosity during the overtaking process must be taken into account however more than 50 error occurred in peak value in yaw moment between the numerical simulation and experimental result in order to verify whether the error is caused by ignoring the free surface cfd simulation with free surface was performed 5 1 influence of the free surface to investigate the effect of the free surface condition the other parameters were held fixed and the overtaking condition was simulated using star ccm the grid generated is the same as the meeting condition due to the larger computational domain in this problem the total number of grids increased to 50 million fig 18 shows that the free surface results were the same as the double body no free surface results it can be concluded that the free surface has less effect in the overtaking condition the wave patterns generated when the target ship overtook the origin ship are shown in fig 19 5 2 effect of different parameters as in the ship meeting case the interference between ships during the overtaking process will also be affected by parameters such as water depth lateral distance between the ships and speed these were represented using the following standardized parameters the speeds of the respective ships u o knots and u t knots the water depth ratio h t o and the lateral distance ratio y b b b o to more clearly analyze the influence of the respective parameters the effects of each were changed with the others held constant the respective parameter settings used are listed in table 5 as shown in figs 20 23 the variations in force and moment resulting from changing the respective parameters were affected by the longitudinal distance between the two ships for instance fig 20 shows that the water depth changed the amplitudes but not the patterns of change in force and moment which both decreased as the water depth increased in a manner similar to the meeting condition results the force and moment were most affected in the range of water depth ratio h t o of 1 1 1 3 from fig 21 it is seen that the lateral distance did not affect the patterns of change in the force or moment although the amplitudes of both decreased as the lateral distance increased with a maximum effect in the lateral distance ratio range of 0 25 1 00 in particular at y b b b o 0 25 the force was large in the relative longitudinal distance range of ξ 0 to 0 25 fig 22 shows that the speed of ship o had no effect on the overall trends in force or moment as u o is increased both the longitudinal force and yaw moment increased while the lateral force decreased similarly fig 23 shows that u t had no effect on the overall trends in the interference force or moment of ship o and exerted little influence on its amplitude 6 conclusions in this study we compared the interference force and moment of two ships in restricted water between tebem and other computational methods the comparisons show that the present method has the same accuracy as hobem moreover the calculation point in tebem is arranged at the center of the panel instead of the corner thus it is very convenient to arrange the panel in the corner of the structure however the computational efficiency of this method is not as high as the panel method proposed by sutulo and guedes soares 2008 and hobem because it uses triple variables in solving the linear algebraic equations thus the calculation efficiency of this method needs to be improved in the future the effects of viscosity lifting force and the free surface effect on ship to ship interaction were studied in detail with the free surface ignored our findings suggest that the viscosity has an insignificant contribution in the meeting condition with less than 10 difference in peak between viscous flow and tebem results in lateral force and yaw moment while under the overtaking condition however the viscous simulation shows more accurate results in yaw moment which were 30 large than the tebem results in peak as the latter approach does not take into account the effects of lifting force caused by asymmetric flow this suggests that the effect of viscosity on the peak value of interference force and moment needs to be considered in the overtaking condition when considering the free surface the results show that the free surface has less effect in both the meeting and overtaking conditions at the same time the viscous flow simulation considering the free surface is very time consuming and demands a high computational cost thus the double body method can be used in two ship interface problems with low speeds of the ships the effects of different parameters such as speed water depth and lateral distance between the two ships were analyzed based on tebem while changing the water depth and lateral distance did not affect the patterns of force or moment their values decreased with increasing water depth and lateral distance further assessment of the speeds of the origin and target ships revealed that in the meeting case changing the speed of the target ship had a greater effect on the origin ship while in the overtaking case the origin ship results were primarily affected by its own speed in future research it would be useful to vary the parameters used in this study to determine how they affect the free surface and viscosity and in turn the solution of the two ship interference

21981,this paper proposes a topological analysis model of ship encounter space using a geographic information system gis spatial analysis technology herein the characteristics of the elements organization and structure of the ship encountered in the sea were studied to solve problems of ship collision risk analysis in this model it is necessary to construct the topological structure of the ship encounter space based on the risk situation of the ship the topological points and connection lines established in the encounter space were analyzed using the shape and geometric relationship of the ship s space topology and the collision danger in the ship s navigation is thus analyzed moreover information regarding the dangerous ship target and encounter characteristics were calculated and extracted this study uses the model to conduct a simulation based on data from the collision between m t sanchi and m v cf crystal on january 06 2018 and analyzes the collision risk characteristics during the two periods prior to the collision results show that the proposed model is effective and feasible for marine vessel safety analysis keywords ship encounter space spatial topological analysis collision risk spatial topological relationships 1 introduction according to the united nations conference on trade and development 2018 the world s total seaborne trade has steadily grown over the past 50 years with an average annual growth rate of approximately 3 1 in 2016 the global seaborne trade volume reached 10 3 billion tons accounting for approximately 80 of the world s total merchandize trade however shipping safety issues have always been important factors constraining the steady development of marine transportation the world accident statistics yearbook of lloyd s register shows that between 1990 and 2010 each year approximately 200 ships experienced total damage caused by maritime traffic accidents and the number of non all damage ships has been generally increasing year by year at the same time a report released by allianz se in 2016 documented 25 434 maritime traffic accidents worldwide during 2006 2015 including 1231 ship total loss accidents since 2015 2018 china s maritime security departments have received more than 3000 fire alarms of different types of ships each year additionally approximately 2000 maritime rescue operations have been organized each year with 10 000 ships and more than 300 search and rescue aircraft having been dispatched for search and rescue each year more than 1800 ships in distress are assisted of which more than 1450 have been rescued more than 350 ships are overturned annually and more than 15 000 people in distress are successfully rescued where the search and rescue success rate is more than 85 in 2018 the panamanian tanker m t sanchi and the hong kong based bulk carrier m v cf crystal collided causing fire aboard the sanchi the results of this collision are shown in fig 1 in addition statistics from the ministry of transport of china showed that there were 4920 waterborne traffic accidents in 2003 2015 resulting in 4532 deaths 2803 shipwrecks or total ship losses and direct economic losses of 5 127 billion yuan therefore further research on ship navigation risk assessment and navigation feature information extraction can reduce the probability of occurrence of maritime traffic accidents this is an important research topic related to safety environmental protection and economic development and has always attracted universal research attention over the years the international maritime organization imo has formulated a series of international conventional rules to the improve maritime traffic safety such as the international convention for safety of life at sea international convention on standards of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers and convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs to address the problem of safe ship navigation scholars have also conducted voluminous research in areas such as intelligent ship navigation navigation safety risk assessment and ship collision avoidance and have achieved encouraging research results in the area of intelligent navigation system research scholars have developed various ship navigation systems to provide technical support for correctly guiding the safe ship navigation for example the navigational decision support system for a sea going vessel navdec developed by pietrzykowski et al 2012 is widely used navdec combines information from multiple devices such as automatic identification systems ais electronic navigational charts automatic radar plotting aids and global navigational satellite systems to fuse and present the motion parameter information of surrounding targets navdec can therefore provide meeting situation information based on the colregs thereby improving navigation safety pietrzykowski et al 2009 further developed a navigation decision support system for sea going vessels their system introduces artificial intelligence methods that can learn navigator knowledge and implement it in the system these navigation safety systems provide a massive intelligence improvement providing information necessary for the navigation environment and navigation plan support for safe ship navigation perera et al 2012a b proposed a decision action execution model that can make multiple parallel collision avoidance decisions for multiple target ship collision situations their system promotes intelligent collision avoidance in marine navigation systems in terms of shipping safety ship navigation risk assessment has always been a major research direction in 2002 most countries adopted the formal safety assessment method issued by the imo imo 2002 2003 which has quickly become the standard for judging the safety of maritime navigation and has accelerated the research and development of additional navigation risk analysis methods subsequently gemelos and ventikos 2008 used a survey of maritime transport risks and found that human factors are also among the main causes of maritime accidents therefore the relationship between human factors and accident risk has become an important research direction the accident risk attributed to human factors is also a type of random risk for the random risk assessment of marine collisions and the probability of occurrence of risks statistical analysis can be used to evaluate the cases of maritime transport risks in different sea areas and under different conditions with an improved bayesian belief network then used to effectively solve and apply these evaluations goerland et al 2014 therefore predicting possible risks in the course of ship navigation has become a key issue in the shipping safety domain various mathematical models have been applied to the analysis of navigation risk prediction including the navigation safety assessment of navigable waters based on grey correlation analysis and factor analysis zheng and li 2008 an alternative risk assessment method is based on the safety index method dai and wu 2016 widely used in china s maritime management departments this method was first proposed by professor wu zhaolin of dalian maritime university their study proposes a combination of safety system engineering theory and marine traffic engineering theory this combination is of great significance for the quantitative assessment of navigation risks moreover speed is another main factor influencing a ship s navigational danger and different ship widths and depths require different safe speeds fuzzy mathematical theory solves the quantitative method of determining safe speed well chen et al 2009 in terms of ship collision avoidance methods scholars have also conducted numerous studies to address the problem of ship collision dangers previous authors have emphasized the proposal and improvement of various collision avoidance algorithms and the collision avoidance algorithm based on the ship domain model remains the most widely used among such algorithms a potential risk ship domain model was proposed by im and luong 2019 with a clear meaning of risk degree based on the ship domain model realizing the real time calculation of different collision danger values for different navigation risk levels zhang and meng 2019 proposed a new concept in the probabilistic ship domain their concept evaluates the collision risk of different ships by calculating the safe distance with high accuracy szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 expressed the safety distance based on the approximate elliptic domain and proposed two safety parameters based on the ship domain degree of domain violation ddv and time to domain violation tdv they showed that the collision avoidance accuracy of ddv tdv outperforms that of distance to closest point of approach dcpa time to closest point of approach tcpa zhang et al 2016 proposed a method based on ais data and combined with the ship domain model to determine the distance to the closest point of approach to realize a ranking of the severity of ship collision dangers chen et al 2018 proposed a feasible method of ship collision candidate detection based on a non linear speed obstacle algorithm combined with ais data these methods are based on the ship domain model or ais data for ship collision risk assessment research and have generally achieved good results despite these improvements scholars continue to cite advanced technologies and theories to optimize and upgrade navigation risk assessment methods more in depth research continues to be needed in the analysis and mining of navigation risk information because of the introduction of ais data ship domain models or other analysis methods however owing to the large amount of data difficult data conversions complex model calculations redundancy and conflicts between information sets and the inability to accurately measure the spatial relationships of ships basic navigation safety problems remain to be solved therefore there is an urgent need for related research on navigation risk analysis and assessment under a spatial information platform that can provide accurate navigational targets with spatial relationships and attributes navigation risk analysis under the spatial information platform can improve the utilization rate of navigation safety data and integrate various rich and perfect spatial data processing and analysis model libraries these possibilities are conducive to improving the efficiency and accuracy of navigation data processing by simplifying the data calculation process the spatial information platform also has powerful visualization functions and symbol library information which can visualize and output the calculation results in various ways thereby extracting increasingly intuitive spatial information regarding ship encounters for ship navigation risk assessment the spatial information system is based on computer and network communication technology and uses systems engineering and information science theories and methods to comprehensively and dynamically acquire store transmit manage analyze and use spatial information its main structure is shown in fig 2 geographic information system gis is a typical spatial information platform gis is an emerging spatial data processing and analysis technology that can qualitatively or quantitatively define the spatial relationship between objects by means such as geometric analysis numerical statistical analysis mathematical modeling or geographic calculation using geographic information spatial position distribution shape distance orientation and topological relationships such analyses can then further serve the decision making process the spatial information platform can also combine spatial information and attribute information to describe and analyze spatial entities in many aspects from different perspectives at present research on gis based spatial analysis technology has mainly focused on traffic accessibility optimal path analysis spatial pattern optimization and robotic navigation and the study of marine traffic safety analysis and ship space collision risk calculation is quite rare however such research methods based on location information are urgently needed to improve analysis accuracy in the navigation field moreover maritime traffic accident cases have been increasing in recent years therefore it is important to analyze ship navigation risks to ensure safe maritime traffic and effective maritime emergency supervision therefore this paper focuses on analytical technology related to sailing ships encountering situations a topological structure analysis model of ships encounter space is proposed for the first time based on the spatial information platform this model includes a construction analysis of the spatial topological structure and a topological structure analysis of the ship s encounter space this model first builds the topological structure of a vessel s encounter space based on encounter risk and then analyzes the topological structure to examine risk trends for the ship s voyage it can extract the spatial relationship of the navigation target this determines the navigational hazard situation of the ship s encounter space thus facilitating the ship s safe navigation in crowded waters fig 3 introduces a detailed research framework of the topological analysis model of ship encounter space in this paper the analysis is divided into three main steps the first is to calculate the spatial positions of all ship targets and ship dynamic parameters in the ship s meeting space and then extract the ship s space layout information and ship meeting parameters next the gis platform is used to construct the topological structure of the ship s meeting space based on the ship s meeting parameter and spatial layout information finally topological points and topological connection line spatial characteristics in the meeting space are analyzed to realize the extraction of the target information of dangerous ships in the meeting space to verify the feasibility of the model we also conducted relevant case studies 2 correlation investigation and current situation analysis of ship accident causes based on the imo statement and referring to the statistical method of water traffic accidents published by the ministry of communications of the people s republic of china maritime traffic accident severity can be divided into four grades not serious serious very serious and particularly serious valdez banda et al 2015 imo 2008a b as shown in table 1 this classification mainly depends on an accident s effects on people property and the environment at the same time the types and main causes of marine accidents are analyzed in detail based on the data investigation maritime accidents are described in relation to accident type and accident reason in figs 4 and 5 respectively the sanchi collision is taken as an example of applied research in this paper the ship collided approximately 160 nm east of china s yangtze river estuary the investigation found that the main cause of the sanchi collision accident was human error categorizing it as an accident that caused 32 deaths the information in this paper comes from multi source remote sensing data and officially released data including data from the china ship information center the ais information service platform and the china maritime network accident data include information on the ship s name logo type and tonnage accident coordinates accident cause accident results accident scale and the accident s impact on the crew and economy at the same time marine meteorological data of the accident sea area were obtained from the china meteorological observatory and the china weather network the data prepared in the study were all from official websites 3 methods and model 3 1 situation classification of ship encounter space a vessel encounter situation is formed by the convergence of ships with different orientations zhang et al 2015 zhen et al 2017 to establish a spatial topological analytic model and simplify the calculation steps involved with ship encounter data this paper refers to colregs a vessel encounter situation can be divided into three categories overtaking a head on situation and a crossing situation crossing situations can be further divided into starboard and portside crossings details on these types of ship encounters are shown in table 2 fig 6 shows a schematic of ship encounter situation classification 3 2 method for constructing ship encounter space topology 3 2 1 spatial topology theory the basic relationships between spatial entities are the point to point point to line point to surface line line line to surface and surface to surface relationships to accurately describe the topological relationship between spatial objects güting 1988 considered spatial entities to be a set of points and egenhofer and franzosa 1991 proposed a 4 intersection model 4im which establishes a spatial topology relationship of a 2 2 matrix to determine topological relationships between spatial objects this matrix is shown as 1 r ij a b a b a b a b a b in equation 1 a and b represent two spaces where a and a respectively represent the internal space and edge space in space a b and b respectively represent the internal space and edge space in space b when the result of the intersection is null 0 or non empty 1 4im can describe multiple meaningful topological relationships between point line and plane objects 4im can express eight meaningful spatial topological relationships which as shown in table 3 represent the adjacency connectivity closure inclusiveness and consistency of topological relationships among spatial entities these relationships form the basis for spatial feature analysis of spatial data 3 2 2 construction of spatial topological structure based on a ship encountering danger during ship navigation the ship and another ship or the ship and the obstacle can have staggered complex dynamic and static spatial characteristics the ship has a certain geometric relationship with the target with certain geometric regularities thus establishing a spatial topology between ships is an abstract description of the spatial relationship between them this is also the key basis for spatial analysis and affects spatial analysis accuracy the ship s sensing device acquires the target and data are pre processed using geometric position registration and correction to determine the ship s spatial position information using topological geometric theory the distance bearing and dcpa information between the ship is determined to build topology rules different rules determine the connected ship and fig 8 shows the principle of ship encounter space construction if the spatial topology of the i ship and j ship is constructed then the topology must be established based on the risk of encounter r for the topology connection rule of a b c n ships in l u time there is a judgment matrix as shown in eq 2 2 r ij r ij l r ij u 1 r ab l r ab u r an l r an u r ba l r ba u 1 r bn l r bn u r na l r na u r nb l r nb u 1 in equation 2 r ij l represents the meeting danger degree of ship i and ship j at time l r ij u represents the meeting danger degree of ship i and ship j at time u and r ij represents the comparison result of the danger degree of all ships the risk of a ship encountering a hazard is a vague concept referring to the measure of probability of a ship having a collision during its voyage this risk is affected by a combination of dcpa ship domain and shipboard angle first this paper calculates the euclidean distance between ships and data on the nearest encounter distance the euclidean distance van der heijden et al 2005 is the most common representation of the distance between two or more points this is defined in the euclidean space such as the distance between x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n as shown in eq 3 3 d x 1 y 1 2 x 2 y 2 2 x n y n 2 i 1 n x i y i 2 in equation 3 d represents the euclidean distance between the ships and x i and y i represent the spatial coordinate information of the ships dcpa indicates the shortest distance between two ships during an encounter it can also refer to the shortest path of a collision between a given ship and a target ship on the opposite route dcpa is the main basis for determining whether two ships will collide a dcpa value of 0 implies that the two ships will eventually collide if they keep their headings and speeds unchanged dcpa values greater than 0 do not indicate absolute safety they rather indicate that there is a certain passing distance between the two ships when two ships meet at less than a certain value whether that value is based on objective reality or psychological feeling of the driver there will be a risk of collision between them ahna et al 2012 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 we indicate the ship s velocity and course as v 0 and c 0 respectively with the geographic position point x 0 y 0 similarly v t and c t denote speed and course and x t y t indicates the geographical point of the target ship as shown in fig 7 the ship s side angle is q the relative speed of the target vessel is v r and the heading is c r the relative course can then be calculated as follows 4 v r v o 2 v t 2 2 v o v t cos c o c t after calculating the above parameters we apply the sine theorem to find the right angled edge of collision triangle o a b for one right side o b d c p a is one right side o b which can be expressed as 5 d d c p a d sin c r q when considering the risk of ship encounters based on the concept of the ship domain proposed by japanese scholar and british scholar fuji and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 the minimum safe passing distance required by a ship varies the formula for calculating this distance between a ship and a target ship and thus the safe passage distance is as follows 6 d 1 1 5 ρ θ γ 7 d 2 2 d 1 8 ρ θ γ 1 1 θ γ 180 0 20 θ γ 112 5 1 0 θ γ 180 0 4 112 5 θ γ 180 1 0 360 θ γ 180 0 4 180 θ γ 247 5 1 1 360 θ γ 180 0 4 247 5 θ γ 360 in equations 6 8 d 1 represents the minimum safe encounter distance of the ship d 2 represents the safe passage distance of the ship and θ γ represents the relative orientation of the ship after calculating d 1 and d 2 using the above formula we compare dcpa with d 2 if dcpa is greater than d 2 there is no danger in contrast if dcpa is less than d 2 the situation is dangerous as shown in fig 8 assuming that the dcpa of both ac and bd ships is greater than d 2 the topology connection rule between a and c ships and b and d ships can be expressed as follows 9 w a c d p c a a c d 2 a c 10 w b d d p c a b d d 2 b d 11 r ij r a c r b d min w a c w b d therefore b and d ships should be topologically connected last we perform a topology check and error modification zhang et al 2015 on the elements of the constructed spatial topology and determine the spatial features and spatial errors without topological relations the topology of the logic error is then fixed in arcgis thereby reducing the error of the spatial topology analysis result in the next step table 4 describes the topological structure of the space encountered by the ship in terms of point and line features in table 4 a b c and d represent the different ship targets a b c and d are abstracted into different space entity targets through the space topology model of the ship encounter thereby forming topology elements points lines and faces then the logical relationship of topological space is described according to the three basic graphic elements of point line and area this description includes area features p1 and p2 where p1 comprises three point features b c and d or three line features bc dc and bd p2 comprises three point features a c and d or three line features ab ad and bd 3 3 topological analytical algorithms of the ship encounter space spatial topology analysis is a modern mathematical analysis technique that abstracts spatial features into points lines and faces and can resolve the inherent structural relations of spatial elements costa et al 2007 the basic concept of spatial topology analysis involves dividing the space encountered by the ship and analyzing the spatial relation between the ships based on the encountered space s topological relation spatial analysis often plays an important role in gis and the topological analysis model is a relatively mature spatial analysis method because any spatial system has a space entity and free space a g and j k o 2010 in this paper space entities mainly refer to ships whereas free space refers to the space in which ships are free to sail in this study the topology construction method of the ship encounter space has been described in section 3 2 for the spatial shape analysis method of the ship encounter space we use topological points and links as the basic units and then analyze the topology based on the geometric relation between the spatial entities based on allen 2010 theory of spatial structuring this paper proposes three spatial topological indicators representing ship navigation safety limitations of navigation average meeting value of ships and agglomeration of ships the specific calculation process is as follows 1 the limitation of navigation n lim i represents the degree of interaction between connected nodes in a spatial topology in other words it represents the degree of navigation restrictions imposed by a ship on a ship intersecting the topology and reflects the extent to which a ship affects the normal navigation of other ships this value is mainly affected by the number of adjacent ships without considering external interference and is calculated as follows 12 n lim i j 1 n 1 c j in this formula j j 1 2 3 n represents the node directly connected to node i and c j represents the topological connection value of all nodes connected to node j 2 the average meeting value of ships m a i indicates the average meeting value of the ship s topological point relative to other connected ship topological points this can express the possibility of the ship meeting a connected ship a smaller m a i value indicates a greater probability of an encounter m a i can be expressed as follows 13 m a i j 1 n d i j sin c r q k 1 here d i j is the shortest distance between the topological points of the two ships on the spatial topology map and k is the number of axes involved in the ship connection 3 the agglomeration of ships f o c i represents the degree of a ship s dispersion in the topology which can express the ship s degree of dispersion in the topological space and is calculated as 14 f o c i n log 2 n 2 3 1 1 n 1 m a i 1 based on the spatial topological distribution of the ship s position the agglomeration of ships can represent the degree of dispersion in the target ship s space and the overall risk of encounter and measures the overall organizational characteristics of the ship s topological space a greater degree of agglomeration indicates a greater degree of aggregation between ships in the meeting space i e a poorer spatial balance can lead to a higher risk 4 application of the methodology case study 4 1 application examples and data preprocessing this section uses relevant data provided by the chinese maritime department as a foundation for applied research on the model based on the survey at around 20 00 china standard time on january 06 2018 the panamanian tanker m t sanchi and the hong kong based bulk carrier m v cf crystal were in the yangtze river estuary a collision occurred 160 nautical miles east of china causing the sanchi to catch fire marine traffic data provide basic technical parameters of the sanchi as shown in table 5 the cf crystal was 225 m long and 32 26 m wide with a designed maximum load of 75 725 tons during the incident it was loaded with approximately 64 000 tons of grain had 14 m of draft and a speed of 6 5 kts the two ships were sailing in opposite directions at that time the surrounding vessels included cclningbo maersk shams trf mongstad mantucket zhejiang daiyu 03187 zhejiang daiyu 01272 zhejiang daiyu 01215 and zhejiang daiyu 02151 first we performed geometric correction and other preprocessing on the accident data using the arcgis platform and then visually displayed the collision location on google maps and electronic charts as shown in fig 9 a and 9 b the location of the ship collision is indicated by the red point in the figure 30 50 00 n 124 56 00 e on january 14 2018 the sanchi sank approximately 10 nm from china s 200 nm exclusive economic zone at 28 22 00 n 125 55 00 e after investigating the data ship certificate crew certificate company safety management system port state control inspection report general layout ship control data vdr information of sanchi before collision vdr data recovered from the cf crystal and other information from the two ships were qualified fig 9 c shows the navigation s trajectory before the collision between the two ships twenty minutes before the collision the sanchi and the cf crystal formed a crossing situation on the right side of the heading line the provisions listed in article 15 of colregs indicate that during the crossing situation the sanchi should have paid close attention to the navigational situation of the right side of the ship taken timely concessions and adjusted the heading and speed to avoid collision however the sanchi s third officer did not analyze the threat degree of the cf crystal and thus did not take measures to avoid collision missing the opportunity to avoid which was the main cause of this accident second as a direct sailing ship the cf crystal violated article 17 of colregs that is as a direct sailing ship the cf crystal did not take proper avoidance actions when giving way to the sanchi and did not take manipulation action alone within a reasonable timeframe to avoid collision which violated the direct sailing ship action therefore the accident was because of the failure of the ship s pilots to fulfill their obligation to give way which resulted in an urgent situation with serious consequences this study considers the real accident of sanchi as a case study and verifies the feasibility of the model by analyzing the dangerous situation of the ship at different time periods this analysis shows that the model in this paper can realize the ship s early safety warning provide ship navigation safety information and provide navigation assistance information for the ship s on duty pilot s navigation decision our analysis uses the sanchi and cf crystal collision as a model application example using the radar image before the collision as the database to obtain ship position information and analyzing the safety situation between the ships 5 results 5 1 topological structure construction of ship encounter space fig 9 shows the trajectory of the two ships prior to the collision at 19 44 the cf crystal was at 30 52 1n 124 58 8e with a heading of approximately 225 and speed of approximately 13 3 kts the sanchi s position was 26 42 73n 123 39 43e its heading was 21 and its speed was 9 2 kts in this study the c programming language and gis components were used to implement a topological analysis model of the ship encounter space first based on the spatial position relationship between the ships under the spatial information platform the dcpa and euclidean distances of the ships were calculated and it was judged that there would be a dangerous situation using the topological geometry method topology data of the ships were constructed describing the topological relationship between spatial entities presently relies mainly on network based topology models and topology models based on point set topology theory huang 2013 the former has the advantages of being intuitive clear in structure strong in mutual conductivity and easy to organize and analyze therefore we selected data from two moments before the collision that is the ship encountered the data topology structure at 19 31 and 19 45 cst fig 10 at 19 31 fig 10 a the sanchi s speed was 10 4 knots and a total of 10 ship targets were displayed in the corresponding radar chart target e indicated the cf crystal which had a speed of 13 2 knots target a indicated the sanchi which was 6 8 nm from the cf crystal at 19 45 the sanchi and cf crystal both belonged to the state where dcpa was 0 which was 5 min before the collision by calculating the risk of encounter between all ships in two time periods the topology of the data space could be constructed then the natural discontinuity method proposed by jenks was used to create the topology connection line based on the distance in a hierarchical display you can increase the visual display the next section will analyze the topology of the space encountered by the ship 5 2 analysis of topological analysis results of ship encounter space using the spatial topology analysis algorithm shown in section 3 n lim i m a i and f o c i were calculated based on the established connection line between the topological points in the spatial topology of the ship to obtain the analysis efficiency of this model under different test environments we used three different parameter graphics processing workstations to calculate and process the model the specific parameters are shown in table 6 statistics show the processing time of the spatial topology model at two moments 19 31 and 19 45 as shown in fig 11 the degree index analyzes the overall ship network topology characteristics in the spatial distribution to obtain the spatial structure and potential spatial relationship between ships first the network topology of the space encountered by the ship at two time periods was dynamically analyzed and the topological index values corresponding to those two time periods were obtained the result of this calculation is shown in fig 12 fig 12 a shows the results for n lim i at 19 31 during which time the lines a sanchi to c zhejiang daiyu 03187 and a sanchi to e cf crystal were curves near the peak ships c zhejiang daiyu 03187 and e cf crystal indicated higher navigational limits for ship a sanchi fig 12 b shows calculation results for m a i which indicate that the values for ships a sanchi and c zhejiang daiyu 03187 and ships a sanchi e cf crystal and f were all close to the trough position indicating that the two ships had a high probability of encounter and thus prone to collision fig 12 c shows the calculation results of f o c i in which space accumulation among ships c zhejiang daiyu 03187 e cf crystal and a sanchi was higher whereas other space between ships had relatively discrete structures and were near the average indicating no risk of collision fig 12 d shows the results of n lim i at 19 45 where the navigation limit between ships a sanchi and e cf crystal is at the peak of the curve this indicates that ship e cf crystal has the greatest interference to the normal navigation of ship a sanchi and thus poses a collision threat ship c zhejiang daiyu 03187 showed a slight decrease in the degree of navigation disturbance to ship a sanchi compared to that at 19 31 the navigational limits between all other ships were average indicating that the degree of navigation disturbance between the other ships was low fig 12 e shows the calculation results for m a i at 19 45 where ships a sanchi and e cf crystal were in a trough position and the encounter value continued to decline compared to the previous time the two ships were thus very prone to collision fig 12 f shows the calculation results for f o c i at 19 45 indicating the degree of dispersion of ships in the meeting space at that moment where the ship collection degree of the sanchi and cf crystal was at the peak position this indicates that the two ships had high density and high correlation in the topological form ships c f and j were relatively low in concentration relative to ship a sanchi this indicates that the ship was in a discrete state in space organization and that the navigational threat between the ships was low 5 3 correlation analysis between spatial topology analysis results and dcpa in this study n lim i m a i and f o c i were obtained using a topological analysis model of the ship encounter space to reflect the safety status of the ship s navigation space and extract the potential spatial relationship between the ships to determine the model s reliability the correlation between the dcpa value and model results was used to analyze the model results consistency and we use the correlation method to calculate the correlation results of other models the correlation coefficient was selected as the metric because it reflects the tightness of the linear relationship between independent variable and dependent variable the correlation coefficient was calculated by the difference plot method the same respective means of two variables based on deviation multiplied by two to reflect the deviation closeness between two variables classic methods include the pearson correlation coefficient and spearman correlation coefficient we used the pearson correlation coefficient and spearman s rank correlation coefficient to measure the closeness of relationships between the variables the calculation formulas for pearson correlation coefficient and spearman correlation coefficient are shown in equations 15 and 16 in general when the correlation coefficient γ 0 8 variables were highly correlated when 0 5 γ 0 8 the variables were moderately correlated when 0 3 γ 0 5 there was a low correlation between the variables and when γ 0 3 the correlation between the two variables was extremely weak table 7 shows the correlation results among n lim i m a i and f o c i the three topological analysis obtained results that were strongly correlated with dcpa above 90 and n lim i and f o c i showed strong negative correlations with dcpa additionally fig 13 compares average results of the absolute values of correlations 15 r n i 1 x i x y i y n i 1 x i x 2 n i 1 y i y 2 16 r s 1 6 n i 1 x i y i 2 n n 2 1 6 discussion this study used a topological analysis model of ship encounter space to analyze the spatial security situation between ships many scholars have also proposed collision risk calculation methods for example kayano and imazu 2009 proposed an ozt based route optimization perera et al 2012a b proposed a collision risk algorithm based on fuzzy theory and liu and hu 2012 developed an algorithm based on the collision risk algorithm of subjective evaluation these algorithms can evaluate a ship s navigation safety with an accuracy of more than 80 if such algorithms are to be further promoted and applied to actual ship voyages more in depth research is needed in the analysis and mining of navigation risk information our proposed model is comparable with other collision risk algorithms this study proposes a correlation analysis based on a spatial information platform for the dangers encountered by ships this platform can effectively combine the ship s spatial topology information with attribute information and provide analysis in a more realistic geographic context the analysis results possess accurate spatial reference information moreover the model in this paper utilizes the rich and perfect spatial data processing and analysis model library under the spatial information platform thereby improving the utilization rate of navigation safety data and simplifying the data analysis process the model proposed in this paper can extract collision risk information as well as other potential navigation space feature information more effectively and intuitively measure detailed spatial relationships between ships and reduce the uncertainty during navigation this model also lays a good foundation for the accurate analysis of multi ship encounter situations as shown in fig 13 the ship encounter space topological analysis model proposed is this paper was compared with dcpa and the model accuracy was found to be greater than 90 which indicates that the model can quickly extract navigation space relationships between ships the model also analyzes dangerous ship targets and provides technical support for guiding the ship to intelligent collision avoidance and safe navigation during ship navigation the speed heading distance and azimuth of surrounding ships determines the impact on the ship dcpa and time of closest point of approach are classic solutions for ship collision risk this study took the risk of encounter as the model positioning idea and constructed the spatial topology of the ship s encountering space then n lim i m a i and f o c i were obtained separately table 7 shows that m a i and dcpa have a contrast error s of at least 4 2 whereas n lim i and f o c i are 6 6 and 9 7 respectively therefore the comprehensive error obtained by averaging the above was 6 8 additionally the model results were compared with the overall accuracy of previous ship collision risk calculation methods based on the correlation calculation method as shown in table 8 the proposed model analyzed the ship s navigation safety state by constructing the encountering space s topological structure with a calculation error of between 4 2 and 9 7 and an overall error of 6 8 the proposed model was successfully applied to a navigational hazard analysis of the collision between the sanchi and the cf crystal therefore the proposed method can meet the needs of ship navigation safety assessment 7 conclusions and future work to improve the assessment of ship collision risk in different encounter spaces this paper proposes a topological analysis model of ship encounter space using gis spatial analysis technology this model analyzes and calculates the ship s encounter space from the perspective of spatial structure the model can extract not only ship collision danger information but also other potential navigation space feature information the model can measures the spatial relationship between ships in a more intuitive and detailed way analyzes the navigation safety situation in different encounter spaces and reduces the uncertainty during navigation to verify the validity and feasibility of the model this paper uses the sanchi wheel collision accident as a case study for model application the results show that the model can accurately evaluate the safety situation of the ship and provide certain auxiliary information for safe navigation of the ship in the future we will further introduce gis spatial analysis technology into marine vessel navigation safety research and extract more spatial features in the navigation space the research in this paper is only a preliminary attempt as the acquisition of accident data was incomplete this makes research difficult and there are still many deficiencies and limitations in many aspects the next phase of our research will be conducted in the following four aspects 1 research on the model space dimension our future research work will introduce ship draft and water depth information which are very valuable for studying critical problems such as stranded ships and reef strikes and particularly for collision avoidance for inland river vessels studying the draft depth allows computation of the basic load capacity and freeboard of the ship and studying the depth data allows computation of the z axis change values of the three dimensional topological structure the parameters for the z axis are different for ships with different drafts therefore the ship draft and water depth information will be introduced into the spatial topology thereby forming a three dimensional spatial topology these advances will further improve the accuracy of the topological analysis results and enable the model to analyze not only the danger of collisions between ships but also other navigational hazard information such as stranding and reef collisions fig 14 shows our next preliminary study of the three dimensional spatial topology the size of the ship domain is undergoing further investigation 2 since our model has some deficiencies in analyzing the dangers encountered by ships for ship collision risk analysis our next step will be to improve the topological analysis model of ship encounter space based on the theory of ship domains szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 szlapczynski et al 2018 the ship domain is a generalized representation of the safety distance of a ship and the safety distance is different in each direction fig 14 shows a preliminary schematic diagram of the three dimensional space topology structure of a ship encounter space based on a ship elliptic domain szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 moreover we also consider the time collision danger and colregs in the model such as different navigation waters e g narrow waterways open waters and navigable lanes ship types visibility and avoidance responsibilities e g ships not taking action and other special circumstances in the future we will launch model experiments for more complex ship encounter scenarios the model in this paper will continue to be optimized according to the theories of ship domain and colregs to improve the accuracy and applicability of the model in the future increasingly accurate ship navigation safety information will be provided for ship drivers 3 for the application of the model to actually guide collision avoidance this article focuses on researching the algorithm that analyzes the spatial topology of ships in the early stage a preliminary attempt has been made to verify the accuracy of the model however the conditions for verification by an actual ship are not yet available in upcoming research work we will continue to improve the model in this article we will implement our model using our team s experimental ship as shown in fig 15 table 9 shows the relevant parameters of the experimental ship we will conduct further in depth research on the real time problems and collision danger predictions of the model and continue to improve this model in the future the model will more quickly provide accurate and rich ship navigation safety information for ship pilots in real time 4 furthermore future research will focus on the deep theory of spatial analysis of maritime spatial information we will use spatial

21981,this paper proposes a topological analysis model of ship encounter space using a geographic information system gis spatial analysis technology herein the characteristics of the elements organization and structure of the ship encountered in the sea were studied to solve problems of ship collision risk analysis in this model it is necessary to construct the topological structure of the ship encounter space based on the risk situation of the ship the topological points and connection lines established in the encounter space were analyzed using the shape and geometric relationship of the ship s space topology and the collision danger in the ship s navigation is thus analyzed moreover information regarding the dangerous ship target and encounter characteristics were calculated and extracted this study uses the model to conduct a simulation based on data from the collision between m t sanchi and m v cf crystal on january 06 2018 and analyzes the collision risk characteristics during the two periods prior to the collision results show that the proposed model is effective and feasible for marine vessel safety analysis keywords ship encounter space spatial topological analysis collision risk spatial topological relationships 1 introduction according to the united nations conference on trade and development 2018 the world s total seaborne trade has steadily grown over the past 50 years with an average annual growth rate of approximately 3 1 in 2016 the global seaborne trade volume reached 10 3 billion tons accounting for approximately 80 of the world s total merchandize trade however shipping safety issues have always been important factors constraining the steady development of marine transportation the world accident statistics yearbook of lloyd s register shows that between 1990 and 2010 each year approximately 200 ships experienced total damage caused by maritime traffic accidents and the number of non all damage ships has been generally increasing year by year at the same time a report released by allianz se in 2016 documented 25 434 maritime traffic accidents worldwide during 2006 2015 including 1231 ship total loss accidents since 2015 2018 china s maritime security departments have received more than 3000 fire alarms of different types of ships each year additionally approximately 2000 maritime rescue operations have been organized each year with 10 000 ships and more than 300 search and rescue aircraft having been dispatched for search and rescue each year more than 1800 ships in distress are assisted of which more than 1450 have been rescued more than 350 ships are overturned annually and more than 15 000 people in distress are successfully rescued where the search and rescue success rate is more than 85 in 2018 the panamanian tanker m t sanchi and the hong kong based bulk carrier m v cf crystal collided causing fire aboard the sanchi the results of this collision are shown in fig 1 in addition statistics from the ministry of transport of china showed that there were 4920 waterborne traffic accidents in 2003 2015 resulting in 4532 deaths 2803 shipwrecks or total ship losses and direct economic losses of 5 127 billion yuan therefore further research on ship navigation risk assessment and navigation feature information extraction can reduce the probability of occurrence of maritime traffic accidents this is an important research topic related to safety environmental protection and economic development and has always attracted universal research attention over the years the international maritime organization imo has formulated a series of international conventional rules to the improve maritime traffic safety such as the international convention for safety of life at sea international convention on standards of training certification and watchkeeping for seafarers and convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs to address the problem of safe ship navigation scholars have also conducted voluminous research in areas such as intelligent ship navigation navigation safety risk assessment and ship collision avoidance and have achieved encouraging research results in the area of intelligent navigation system research scholars have developed various ship navigation systems to provide technical support for correctly guiding the safe ship navigation for example the navigational decision support system for a sea going vessel navdec developed by pietrzykowski et al 2012 is widely used navdec combines information from multiple devices such as automatic identification systems ais electronic navigational charts automatic radar plotting aids and global navigational satellite systems to fuse and present the motion parameter information of surrounding targets navdec can therefore provide meeting situation information based on the colregs thereby improving navigation safety pietrzykowski et al 2009 further developed a navigation decision support system for sea going vessels their system introduces artificial intelligence methods that can learn navigator knowledge and implement it in the system these navigation safety systems provide a massive intelligence improvement providing information necessary for the navigation environment and navigation plan support for safe ship navigation perera et al 2012a b proposed a decision action execution model that can make multiple parallel collision avoidance decisions for multiple target ship collision situations their system promotes intelligent collision avoidance in marine navigation systems in terms of shipping safety ship navigation risk assessment has always been a major research direction in 2002 most countries adopted the formal safety assessment method issued by the imo imo 2002 2003 which has quickly become the standard for judging the safety of maritime navigation and has accelerated the research and development of additional navigation risk analysis methods subsequently gemelos and ventikos 2008 used a survey of maritime transport risks and found that human factors are also among the main causes of maritime accidents therefore the relationship between human factors and accident risk has become an important research direction the accident risk attributed to human factors is also a type of random risk for the random risk assessment of marine collisions and the probability of occurrence of risks statistical analysis can be used to evaluate the cases of maritime transport risks in different sea areas and under different conditions with an improved bayesian belief network then used to effectively solve and apply these evaluations goerland et al 2014 therefore predicting possible risks in the course of ship navigation has become a key issue in the shipping safety domain various mathematical models have been applied to the analysis of navigation risk prediction including the navigation safety assessment of navigable waters based on grey correlation analysis and factor analysis zheng and li 2008 an alternative risk assessment method is based on the safety index method dai and wu 2016 widely used in china s maritime management departments this method was first proposed by professor wu zhaolin of dalian maritime university their study proposes a combination of safety system engineering theory and marine traffic engineering theory this combination is of great significance for the quantitative assessment of navigation risks moreover speed is another main factor influencing a ship s navigational danger and different ship widths and depths require different safe speeds fuzzy mathematical theory solves the quantitative method of determining safe speed well chen et al 2009 in terms of ship collision avoidance methods scholars have also conducted numerous studies to address the problem of ship collision dangers previous authors have emphasized the proposal and improvement of various collision avoidance algorithms and the collision avoidance algorithm based on the ship domain model remains the most widely used among such algorithms a potential risk ship domain model was proposed by im and luong 2019 with a clear meaning of risk degree based on the ship domain model realizing the real time calculation of different collision danger values for different navigation risk levels zhang and meng 2019 proposed a new concept in the probabilistic ship domain their concept evaluates the collision risk of different ships by calculating the safe distance with high accuracy szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 expressed the safety distance based on the approximate elliptic domain and proposed two safety parameters based on the ship domain degree of domain violation ddv and time to domain violation tdv they showed that the collision avoidance accuracy of ddv tdv outperforms that of distance to closest point of approach dcpa time to closest point of approach tcpa zhang et al 2016 proposed a method based on ais data and combined with the ship domain model to determine the distance to the closest point of approach to realize a ranking of the severity of ship collision dangers chen et al 2018 proposed a feasible method of ship collision candidate detection based on a non linear speed obstacle algorithm combined with ais data these methods are based on the ship domain model or ais data for ship collision risk assessment research and have generally achieved good results despite these improvements scholars continue to cite advanced technologies and theories to optimize and upgrade navigation risk assessment methods more in depth research continues to be needed in the analysis and mining of navigation risk information because of the introduction of ais data ship domain models or other analysis methods however owing to the large amount of data difficult data conversions complex model calculations redundancy and conflicts between information sets and the inability to accurately measure the spatial relationships of ships basic navigation safety problems remain to be solved therefore there is an urgent need for related research on navigation risk analysis and assessment under a spatial information platform that can provide accurate navigational targets with spatial relationships and attributes navigation risk analysis under the spatial information platform can improve the utilization rate of navigation safety data and integrate various rich and perfect spatial data processing and analysis model libraries these possibilities are conducive to improving the efficiency and accuracy of navigation data processing by simplifying the data calculation process the spatial information platform also has powerful visualization functions and symbol library information which can visualize and output the calculation results in various ways thereby extracting increasingly intuitive spatial information regarding ship encounters for ship navigation risk assessment the spatial information system is based on computer and network communication technology and uses systems engineering and information science theories and methods to comprehensively and dynamically acquire store transmit manage analyze and use spatial information its main structure is shown in fig 2 geographic information system gis is a typical spatial information platform gis is an emerging spatial data processing and analysis technology that can qualitatively or quantitatively define the spatial relationship between objects by means such as geometric analysis numerical statistical analysis mathematical modeling or geographic calculation using geographic information spatial position distribution shape distance orientation and topological relationships such analyses can then further serve the decision making process the spatial information platform can also combine spatial information and attribute information to describe and analyze spatial entities in many aspects from different perspectives at present research on gis based spatial analysis technology has mainly focused on traffic accessibility optimal path analysis spatial pattern optimization and robotic navigation and the study of marine traffic safety analysis and ship space collision risk calculation is quite rare however such research methods based on location information are urgently needed to improve analysis accuracy in the navigation field moreover maritime traffic accident cases have been increasing in recent years therefore it is important to analyze ship navigation risks to ensure safe maritime traffic and effective maritime emergency supervision therefore this paper focuses on analytical technology related to sailing ships encountering situations a topological structure analysis model of ships encounter space is proposed for the first time based on the spatial information platform this model includes a construction analysis of the spatial topological structure and a topological structure analysis of the ship s encounter space this model first builds the topological structure of a vessel s encounter space based on encounter risk and then analyzes the topological structure to examine risk trends for the ship s voyage it can extract the spatial relationship of the navigation target this determines the navigational hazard situation of the ship s encounter space thus facilitating the ship s safe navigation in crowded waters fig 3 introduces a detailed research framework of the topological analysis model of ship encounter space in this paper the analysis is divided into three main steps the first is to calculate the spatial positions of all ship targets and ship dynamic parameters in the ship s meeting space and then extract the ship s space layout information and ship meeting parameters next the gis platform is used to construct the topological structure of the ship s meeting space based on the ship s meeting parameter and spatial layout information finally topological points and topological connection line spatial characteristics in the meeting space are analyzed to realize the extraction of the target information of dangerous ships in the meeting space to verify the feasibility of the model we also conducted relevant case studies 2 correlation investigation and current situation analysis of ship accident causes based on the imo statement and referring to the statistical method of water traffic accidents published by the ministry of communications of the people s republic of china maritime traffic accident severity can be divided into four grades not serious serious very serious and particularly serious valdez banda et al 2015 imo 2008a b as shown in table 1 this classification mainly depends on an accident s effects on people property and the environment at the same time the types and main causes of marine accidents are analyzed in detail based on the data investigation maritime accidents are described in relation to accident type and accident reason in figs 4 and 5 respectively the sanchi collision is taken as an example of applied research in this paper the ship collided approximately 160 nm east of china s yangtze river estuary the investigation found that the main cause of the sanchi collision accident was human error categorizing it as an accident that caused 32 deaths the information in this paper comes from multi source remote sensing data and officially released data including data from the china ship information center the ais information service platform and the china maritime network accident data include information on the ship s name logo type and tonnage accident coordinates accident cause accident results accident scale and the accident s impact on the crew and economy at the same time marine meteorological data of the accident sea area were obtained from the china meteorological observatory and the china weather network the data prepared in the study were all from official websites 3 methods and model 3 1 situation classification of ship encounter space a vessel encounter situation is formed by the convergence of ships with different orientations zhang et al 2015 zhen et al 2017 to establish a spatial topological analytic model and simplify the calculation steps involved with ship encounter data this paper refers to colregs a vessel encounter situation can be divided into three categories overtaking a head on situation and a crossing situation crossing situations can be further divided into starboard and portside crossings details on these types of ship encounters are shown in table 2 fig 6 shows a schematic of ship encounter situation classification 3 2 method for constructing ship encounter space topology 3 2 1 spatial topology theory the basic relationships between spatial entities are the point to point point to line point to surface line line line to surface and surface to surface relationships to accurately describe the topological relationship between spatial objects güting 1988 considered spatial entities to be a set of points and egenhofer and franzosa 1991 proposed a 4 intersection model 4im which establishes a spatial topology relationship of a 2 2 matrix to determine topological relationships between spatial objects this matrix is shown as 1 r ij a b a b a b a b a b in equation 1 a and b represent two spaces where a and a respectively represent the internal space and edge space in space a b and b respectively represent the internal space and edge space in space b when the result of the intersection is null 0 or non empty 1 4im can describe multiple meaningful topological relationships between point line and plane objects 4im can express eight meaningful spatial topological relationships which as shown in table 3 represent the adjacency connectivity closure inclusiveness and consistency of topological relationships among spatial entities these relationships form the basis for spatial feature analysis of spatial data 3 2 2 construction of spatial topological structure based on a ship encountering danger during ship navigation the ship and another ship or the ship and the obstacle can have staggered complex dynamic and static spatial characteristics the ship has a certain geometric relationship with the target with certain geometric regularities thus establishing a spatial topology between ships is an abstract description of the spatial relationship between them this is also the key basis for spatial analysis and affects spatial analysis accuracy the ship s sensing device acquires the target and data are pre processed using geometric position registration and correction to determine the ship s spatial position information using topological geometric theory the distance bearing and dcpa information between the ship is determined to build topology rules different rules determine the connected ship and fig 8 shows the principle of ship encounter space construction if the spatial topology of the i ship and j ship is constructed then the topology must be established based on the risk of encounter r for the topology connection rule of a b c n ships in l u time there is a judgment matrix as shown in eq 2 2 r ij r ij l r ij u 1 r ab l r ab u r an l r an u r ba l r ba u 1 r bn l r bn u r na l r na u r nb l r nb u 1 in equation 2 r ij l represents the meeting danger degree of ship i and ship j at time l r ij u represents the meeting danger degree of ship i and ship j at time u and r ij represents the comparison result of the danger degree of all ships the risk of a ship encountering a hazard is a vague concept referring to the measure of probability of a ship having a collision during its voyage this risk is affected by a combination of dcpa ship domain and shipboard angle first this paper calculates the euclidean distance between ships and data on the nearest encounter distance the euclidean distance van der heijden et al 2005 is the most common representation of the distance between two or more points this is defined in the euclidean space such as the distance between x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n as shown in eq 3 3 d x 1 y 1 2 x 2 y 2 2 x n y n 2 i 1 n x i y i 2 in equation 3 d represents the euclidean distance between the ships and x i and y i represent the spatial coordinate information of the ships dcpa indicates the shortest distance between two ships during an encounter it can also refer to the shortest path of a collision between a given ship and a target ship on the opposite route dcpa is the main basis for determining whether two ships will collide a dcpa value of 0 implies that the two ships will eventually collide if they keep their headings and speeds unchanged dcpa values greater than 0 do not indicate absolute safety they rather indicate that there is a certain passing distance between the two ships when two ships meet at less than a certain value whether that value is based on objective reality or psychological feeling of the driver there will be a risk of collision between them ahna et al 2012 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 we indicate the ship s velocity and course as v 0 and c 0 respectively with the geographic position point x 0 y 0 similarly v t and c t denote speed and course and x t y t indicates the geographical point of the target ship as shown in fig 7 the ship s side angle is q the relative speed of the target vessel is v r and the heading is c r the relative course can then be calculated as follows 4 v r v o 2 v t 2 2 v o v t cos c o c t after calculating the above parameters we apply the sine theorem to find the right angled edge of collision triangle o a b for one right side o b d c p a is one right side o b which can be expressed as 5 d d c p a d sin c r q when considering the risk of ship encounters based on the concept of the ship domain proposed by japanese scholar and british scholar fuji and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 the minimum safe passing distance required by a ship varies the formula for calculating this distance between a ship and a target ship and thus the safe passage distance is as follows 6 d 1 1 5 ρ θ γ 7 d 2 2 d 1 8 ρ θ γ 1 1 θ γ 180 0 20 θ γ 112 5 1 0 θ γ 180 0 4 112 5 θ γ 180 1 0 360 θ γ 180 0 4 180 θ γ 247 5 1 1 360 θ γ 180 0 4 247 5 θ γ 360 in equations 6 8 d 1 represents the minimum safe encounter distance of the ship d 2 represents the safe passage distance of the ship and θ γ represents the relative orientation of the ship after calculating d 1 and d 2 using the above formula we compare dcpa with d 2 if dcpa is greater than d 2 there is no danger in contrast if dcpa is less than d 2 the situation is dangerous as shown in fig 8 assuming that the dcpa of both ac and bd ships is greater than d 2 the topology connection rule between a and c ships and b and d ships can be expressed as follows 9 w a c d p c a a c d 2 a c 10 w b d d p c a b d d 2 b d 11 r ij r a c r b d min w a c w b d therefore b and d ships should be topologically connected last we perform a topology check and error modification zhang et al 2015 on the elements of the constructed spatial topology and determine the spatial features and spatial errors without topological relations the topology of the logic error is then fixed in arcgis thereby reducing the error of the spatial topology analysis result in the next step table 4 describes the topological structure of the space encountered by the ship in terms of point and line features in table 4 a b c and d represent the different ship targets a b c and d are abstracted into different space entity targets through the space topology model of the ship encounter thereby forming topology elements points lines and faces then the logical relationship of topological space is described according to the three basic graphic elements of point line and area this description includes area features p1 and p2 where p1 comprises three point features b c and d or three line features bc dc and bd p2 comprises three point features a c and d or three line features ab ad and bd 3 3 topological analytical algorithms of the ship encounter space spatial topology analysis is a modern mathematical analysis technique that abstracts spatial features into points lines and faces and can resolve the inherent structural relations of spatial elements costa et al 2007 the basic concept of spatial topology analysis involves dividing the space encountered by the ship and analyzing the spatial relation between the ships based on the encountered space s topological relation spatial analysis often plays an important role in gis and the topological analysis model is a relatively mature spatial analysis method because any spatial system has a space entity and free space a g and j k o 2010 in this paper space entities mainly refer to ships whereas free space refers to the space in which ships are free to sail in this study the topology construction method of the ship encounter space has been described in section 3 2 for the spatial shape analysis method of the ship encounter space we use topological points and links as the basic units and then analyze the topology based on the geometric relation between the spatial entities based on allen 2010 theory of spatial structuring this paper proposes three spatial topological indicators representing ship navigation safety limitations of navigation average meeting value of ships and agglomeration of ships the specific calculation process is as follows 1 the limitation of navigation n lim i represents the degree of interaction between connected nodes in a spatial topology in other words it represents the degree of navigation restrictions imposed by a ship on a ship intersecting the topology and reflects the extent to which a ship affects the normal navigation of other ships this value is mainly affected by the number of adjacent ships without considering external interference and is calculated as follows 12 n lim i j 1 n 1 c j in this formula j j 1 2 3 n represents the node directly connected to node i and c j represents the topological connection value of all nodes connected to node j 2 the average meeting value of ships m a i indicates the average meeting value of the ship s topological point relative to other connected ship topological points this can express the possibility of the ship meeting a connected ship a smaller m a i value indicates a greater probability of an encounter m a i can be expressed as follows 13 m a i j 1 n d i j sin c r q k 1 here d i j is the shortest distance between the topological points of the two ships on the spatial topology map and k is the number of axes involved in the ship connection 3 the agglomeration of ships f o c i represents the degree of a ship s dispersion in the topology which can express the ship s degree of dispersion in the topological space and is calculated as 14 f o c i n log 2 n 2 3 1 1 n 1 m a i 1 based on the spatial topological distribution of the ship s position the agglomeration of ships can represent the degree of dispersion in the target ship s space and the overall risk of encounter and measures the overall organizational characteristics of the ship s topological space a greater degree of agglomeration indicates a greater degree of aggregation between ships in the meeting space i e a poorer spatial balance can lead to a higher risk 4 application of the methodology case study 4 1 application examples and data preprocessing this section uses relevant data provided by the chinese maritime department as a foundation for applied research on the model based on the survey at around 20 00 china standard time on january 06 2018 the panamanian tanker m t sanchi and the hong kong based bulk carrier m v cf crystal were in the yangtze river estuary a collision occurred 160 nautical miles east of china causing the sanchi to catch fire marine traffic data provide basic technical parameters of the sanchi as shown in table 5 the cf crystal was 225 m long and 32 26 m wide with a designed maximum load of 75 725 tons during the incident it was loaded with approximately 64 000 tons of grain had 14 m of draft and a speed of 6 5 kts the two ships were sailing in opposite directions at that time the surrounding vessels included cclningbo maersk shams trf mongstad mantucket zhejiang daiyu 03187 zhejiang daiyu 01272 zhejiang daiyu 01215 and zhejiang daiyu 02151 first we performed geometric correction and other preprocessing on the accident data using the arcgis platform and then visually displayed the collision location on google maps and electronic charts as shown in fig 9 a and 9 b the location of the ship collision is indicated by the red point in the figure 30 50 00 n 124 56 00 e on january 14 2018 the sanchi sank approximately 10 nm from china s 200 nm exclusive economic zone at 28 22 00 n 125 55 00 e after investigating the data ship certificate crew certificate company safety management system port state control inspection report general layout ship control data vdr information of sanchi before collision vdr data recovered from the cf crystal and other information from the two ships were qualified fig 9 c shows the navigation s trajectory before the collision between the two ships twenty minutes before the collision the sanchi and the cf crystal formed a crossing situation on the right side of the heading line the provisions listed in article 15 of colregs indicate that during the crossing situation the sanchi should have paid close attention to the navigational situation of the right side of the ship taken timely concessions and adjusted the heading and speed to avoid collision however the sanchi s third officer did not analyze the threat degree of the cf crystal and thus did not take measures to avoid collision missing the opportunity to avoid which was the main cause of this accident second as a direct sailing ship the cf crystal violated article 17 of colregs that is as a direct sailing ship the cf crystal did not take proper avoidance actions when giving way to the sanchi and did not take manipulation action alone within a reasonable timeframe to avoid collision which violated the direct sailing ship action therefore the accident was because of the failure of the ship s pilots to fulfill their obligation to give way which resulted in an urgent situation with serious consequences this study considers the real accident of sanchi as a case study and verifies the feasibility of the model by analyzing the dangerous situation of the ship at different time periods this analysis shows that the model in this paper can realize the ship s early safety warning provide ship navigation safety information and provide navigation assistance information for the ship s on duty pilot s navigation decision our analysis uses the sanchi and cf crystal collision as a model application example using the radar image before the collision as the database to obtain ship position information and analyzing the safety situation between the ships 5 results 5 1 topological structure construction of ship encounter space fig 9 shows the trajectory of the two ships prior to the collision at 19 44 the cf crystal was at 30 52 1n 124 58 8e with a heading of approximately 225 and speed of approximately 13 3 kts the sanchi s position was 26 42 73n 123 39 43e its heading was 21 and its speed was 9 2 kts in this study the c programming language and gis components were used to implement a topological analysis model of the ship encounter space first based on the spatial position relationship between the ships under the spatial information platform the dcpa and euclidean distances of the ships were calculated and it was judged that there would be a dangerous situation using the topological geometry method topology data of the ships were constructed describing the topological relationship between spatial entities presently relies mainly on network based topology models and topology models based on point set topology theory huang 2013 the former has the advantages of being intuitive clear in structure strong in mutual conductivity and easy to organize and analyze therefore we selected data from two moments before the collision that is the ship encountered the data topology structure at 19 31 and 19 45 cst fig 10 at 19 31 fig 10 a the sanchi s speed was 10 4 knots and a total of 10 ship targets were displayed in the corresponding radar chart target e indicated the cf crystal which had a speed of 13 2 knots target a indicated the sanchi which was 6 8 nm from the cf crystal at 19 45 the sanchi and cf crystal both belonged to the state where dcpa was 0 which was 5 min before the collision by calculating the risk of encounter between all ships in two time periods the topology of the data space could be constructed then the natural discontinuity method proposed by jenks was used to create the topology connection line based on the distance in a hierarchical display you can increase the visual display the next section will analyze the topology of the space encountered by the ship 5 2 analysis of topological analysis results of ship encounter space using the spatial topology analysis algorithm shown in section 3 n lim i m a i and f o c i were calculated based on the established connection line between the topological points in the spatial topology of the ship to obtain the analysis efficiency of this model under different test environments we used three different parameter graphics processing workstations to calculate and process the model the specific parameters are shown in table 6 statistics show the processing time of the spatial topology model at two moments 19 31 and 19 45 as shown in fig 11 the degree index analyzes the overall ship network topology characteristics in the spatial distribution to obtain the spatial structure and potential spatial relationship between ships first the network topology of the space encountered by the ship at two time periods was dynamically analyzed and the topological index values corresponding to those two time periods were obtained the result of this calculation is shown in fig 12 fig 12 a shows the results for n lim i at 19 31 during which time the lines a sanchi to c zhejiang daiyu 03187 and a sanchi to e cf crystal were curves near the peak ships c zhejiang daiyu 03187 and e cf crystal indicated higher navigational limits for ship a sanchi fig 12 b shows calculation results for m a i which indicate that the values for ships a sanchi and c zhejiang daiyu 03187 and ships a sanchi e cf crystal and f were all close to the trough position indicating that the two ships had a high probability of encounter and thus prone to collision fig 12 c shows the calculation results of f o c i in which space accumulation among ships c zhejiang daiyu 03187 e cf crystal and a sanchi was higher whereas other space between ships had relatively discrete structures and were near the average indicating no risk of collision fig 12 d shows the results of n lim i at 19 45 where the navigation limit between ships a sanchi and e cf crystal is at the peak of the curve this indicates that ship e cf crystal has the greatest interference to the normal navigation of ship a sanchi and thus poses a collision threat ship c zhejiang daiyu 03187 showed a slight decrease in the degree of navigation disturbance to ship a sanchi compared to that at 19 31 the navigational limits between all other ships were average indicating that the degree of navigation disturbance between the other ships was low fig 12 e shows the calculation results for m a i at 19 45 where ships a sanchi and e cf crystal were in a trough position and the encounter value continued to decline compared to the previous time the two ships were thus very prone to collision fig 12 f shows the calculation results for f o c i at 19 45 indicating the degree of dispersion of ships in the meeting space at that moment where the ship collection degree of the sanchi and cf crystal was at the peak position this indicates that the two ships had high density and high correlation in the topological form ships c f and j were relatively low in concentration relative to ship a sanchi this indicates that the ship was in a discrete state in space organization and that the navigational threat between the ships was low 5 3 correlation analysis between spatial topology analysis results and dcpa in this study n lim i m a i and f o c i were obtained using a topological analysis model of the ship encounter space to reflect the safety status of the ship s navigation space and extract the potential spatial relationship between the ships to determine the model s reliability the correlation between the dcpa value and model results was used to analyze the model results consistency and we use the correlation method to calculate the correlation results of other models the correlation coefficient was selected as the metric because it reflects the tightness of the linear relationship between independent variable and dependent variable the correlation coefficient was calculated by the difference plot method the same respective means of two variables based on deviation multiplied by two to reflect the deviation closeness between two variables classic methods include the pearson correlation coefficient and spearman correlation coefficient we used the pearson correlation coefficient and spearman s rank correlation coefficient to measure the closeness of relationships between the variables the calculation formulas for pearson correlation coefficient and spearman correlation coefficient are shown in equations 15 and 16 in general when the correlation coefficient γ 0 8 variables were highly correlated when 0 5 γ 0 8 the variables were moderately correlated when 0 3 γ 0 5 there was a low correlation between the variables and when γ 0 3 the correlation between the two variables was extremely weak table 7 shows the correlation results among n lim i m a i and f o c i the three topological analysis obtained results that were strongly correlated with dcpa above 90 and n lim i and f o c i showed strong negative correlations with dcpa additionally fig 13 compares average results of the absolute values of correlations 15 r n i 1 x i x y i y n i 1 x i x 2 n i 1 y i y 2 16 r s 1 6 n i 1 x i y i 2 n n 2 1 6 discussion this study used a topological analysis model of ship encounter space to analyze the spatial security situation between ships many scholars have also proposed collision risk calculation methods for example kayano and imazu 2009 proposed an ozt based route optimization perera et al 2012a b proposed a collision risk algorithm based on fuzzy theory and liu and hu 2012 developed an algorithm based on the collision risk algorithm of subjective evaluation these algorithms can evaluate a ship s navigation safety with an accuracy of more than 80 if such algorithms are to be further promoted and applied to actual ship voyages more in depth research is needed in the analysis and mining of navigation risk information our proposed model is comparable with other collision risk algorithms this study proposes a correlation analysis based on a spatial information platform for the dangers encountered by ships this platform can effectively combine the ship s spatial topology information with attribute information and provide analysis in a more realistic geographic context the analysis results possess accurate spatial reference information moreover the model in this paper utilizes the rich and perfect spatial data processing and analysis model library under the spatial information platform thereby improving the utilization rate of navigation safety data and simplifying the data analysis process the model proposed in this paper can extract collision risk information as well as other potential navigation space feature information more effectively and intuitively measure detailed spatial relationships between ships and reduce the uncertainty during navigation this model also lays a good foundation for the accurate analysis of multi ship encounter situations as shown in fig 13 the ship encounter space topological analysis model proposed is this paper was compared with dcpa and the model accuracy was found to be greater than 90 which indicates that the model can quickly extract navigation space relationships between ships the model also analyzes dangerous ship targets and provides technical support for guiding the ship to intelligent collision avoidance and safe navigation during ship navigation the speed heading distance and azimuth of surrounding ships determines the impact on the ship dcpa and time of closest point of approach are classic solutions for ship collision risk this study took the risk of encounter as the model positioning idea and constructed the spatial topology of the ship s encountering space then n lim i m a i and f o c i were obtained separately table 7 shows that m a i and dcpa have a contrast error s of at least 4 2 whereas n lim i and f o c i are 6 6 and 9 7 respectively therefore the comprehensive error obtained by averaging the above was 6 8 additionally the model results were compared with the overall accuracy of previous ship collision risk calculation methods based on the correlation calculation method as shown in table 8 the proposed model analyzed the ship s navigation safety state by constructing the encountering space s topological structure with a calculation error of between 4 2 and 9 7 and an overall error of 6 8 the proposed model was successfully applied to a navigational hazard analysis of the collision between the sanchi and the cf crystal therefore the proposed method can meet the needs of ship navigation safety assessment 7 conclusions and future work to improve the assessment of ship collision risk in different encounter spaces this paper proposes a topological analysis model of ship encounter space using gis spatial analysis technology this model analyzes and calculates the ship s encounter space from the perspective of spatial structure the model can extract not only ship collision danger information but also other potential navigation space feature information the model can measures the spatial relationship between ships in a more intuitive and detailed way analyzes the navigation safety situation in different encounter spaces and reduces the uncertainty during navigation to verify the validity and feasibility of the model this paper uses the sanchi wheel collision accident as a case study for model application the results show that the model can accurately evaluate the safety situation of the ship and provide certain auxiliary information for safe navigation of the ship in the future we will further introduce gis spatial analysis technology into marine vessel navigation safety research and extract more spatial features in the navigation space the research in this paper is only a preliminary attempt as the acquisition of accident data was incomplete this makes research difficult and there are still many deficiencies and limitations in many aspects the next phase of our research will be conducted in the following four aspects 1 research on the model space dimension our future research work will introduce ship draft and water depth information which are very valuable for studying critical problems such as stranded ships and reef strikes and particularly for collision avoidance for inland river vessels studying the draft depth allows computation of the basic load capacity and freeboard of the ship and studying the depth data allows computation of the z axis change values of the three dimensional topological structure the parameters for the z axis are different for ships with different drafts therefore the ship draft and water depth information will be introduced into the spatial topology thereby forming a three dimensional spatial topology these advances will further improve the accuracy of the topological analysis results and enable the model to analyze not only the danger of collisions between ships but also other navigational hazard information such as stranding and reef collisions fig 14 shows our next preliminary study of the three dimensional spatial topology the size of the ship domain is undergoing further investigation 2 since our model has some deficiencies in analyzing the dangers encountered by ships for ship collision risk analysis our next step will be to improve the topological analysis model of ship encounter space based on the theory of ship domains szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 szlapczynski et al 2018 the ship domain is a generalized representation of the safety distance of a ship and the safety distance is different in each direction fig 14 shows a preliminary schematic diagram of the three dimensional space topology structure of a ship encounter space based on a ship elliptic domain szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 moreover we also consider the time collision danger and colregs in the model such as different navigation waters e g narrow waterways open waters and navigable lanes ship types visibility and avoidance responsibilities e g ships not taking action and other special circumstances in the future we will launch model experiments for more complex ship encounter scenarios the model in this paper will continue to be optimized according to the theories of ship domain and colregs to improve the accuracy and applicability of the model in the future increasingly accurate ship navigation safety information will be provided for ship drivers 3 for the application of the model to actually guide collision avoidance this article focuses on researching the algorithm that analyzes the spatial topology of ships in the early stage a preliminary attempt has been made to verify the accuracy of the model however the conditions for verification by an actual ship are not yet available in upcoming research work we will continue to improve the model in this article we will implement our model using our team s experimental ship as shown in fig 15 table 9 shows the relevant parameters of the experimental ship we will conduct further in depth research on the real time problems and collision danger predictions of the model and continue to improve this model in the future the model will more quickly provide accurate and rich ship navigation safety information for ship pilots in real time 4 furthermore future research will focus on the deep theory of spatial analysis of maritime spatial information we will use spatial autocorrelation and spatial correlation analysis techniques to superimpose and segment spatial positional relationships and spatial topological relationships of ship navigation data to form new data forms the information layer then completes in depth analysis and correlation analysis of the maritime navigation data and extracts information on potential navigation space characteristics the gradual enhancement of spatial analysis capabilities of gis for spatial data in the future will play an increasingly important role in the maritime traffic safety field credit authorship contribution

21982,the blade element momentum theory bemt is one of the most common and widely used methods in horizontal axis wind and tidal turbine performance prediction it mainly relies on two dimensional 2 d hydrodynamic lift and drag coefficients which are used to calculate the hydrodynamic forces within the blade element section of the model these coefficients are greatly affected by both reynolds numbers and turbulence transition parameter ncrit the performance sensitivity of scale models tidal current turbines tcts to the change of reynolds numbers and ncrit parameter was assessed initially the bemt was validated with experimental measurements of two scale models of horizontal axis tidal current turbines a very good agreement was seen thus confidence in both the implementation of the theory and the applicability of the method was built up lift and drag coefficients were calculated from xfoil through the use of different sets of reynolds numbers at different ncrit values the best bemt validations with experimental data were seen when the hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated at two sets of reynolds numbers considered at optimal performance the first set was calculated at 75 of the blade span while the second set was calculated at every local elemental position of the blade for facilitation reduction of time and effort reynolds numbers at 75 of the blade span is considered the best choice furthermore the bemt model results showed better agreements with experimental data when lift and drag coefficients were calculated at low values of ncrit parameter the predicted tidal turbine performances of previous experimental data by the present bem model were compared with those derived from the academic serg tidal bem code the present bem model based on the proper selection of both reynolds number and ncrit parameter showed an obvious superiority over serg tidal model keywords scale model tidal current turbines blade element momentum theory experimental validation performance modeling assessment reynolds number and ncrit effect 1 introduction energy extraction from marine currents has leaped from the conservative type of devices to full scale machines many companies currently work on developing devices in various forms that can exploit marine current energy resources around the world tidal current turbines tcts have recently been used as converters of river tidal and marine currents to electrical energy yuce and muratoglu 2015 the principle and working theory of tcts are almost the same as those of wind turbines marine currents have many advantages over wind with a time varying flow speed and direction they are more predictable which is beneficial for the control of the electrical grid clarke et al 2006 improvements in numerical modeling techniques enabled the analysis of tcts by the use of complex cfd simulations edmunds et al 2017 cfd modeling capabilities of tcts include prediction of detailed assessments of performance fluid interactions and wake formation to a high degree of accuracy which require high computational cost and long processing time the blade element momentum theory bemt is an integral method combined with 2 d airfoil characteristics data of section lift and drag vaz et al 2011 for predicting turbine performance and rotor thrust hansen 2007 although the bemt model is simple it is effective and well understood it has been commonly used in the wind industry and more recently has been adapted for tidal applications with commercial dnv gl garrad hassan 2012 and research led masters et al 2011 models the bemt model has been intensively used for blade design particularly in the field of wind turbines tavares dias do rio vaz et al 2013 and also applied successfully in the design of hydrokinetic turbines batten et al 2006 goundar and ahmed 2014 despite the low computational cost of the bemt model the initial preparation efforts for modeling and validation cannot be neglected benefits of the bemt method over other modeling types such as cfd include significant reduction of running times and low computational cost as a result the bemt model becomes more suitable for applications requiring multiple iterative engineering assessments or restricted access to high grade computational resources the bemt method mainly depends on 2 d hydrodynamic characteristics of a hydrofoil lift and drag coefficients which are generated either experimentally from wind tunnel experiments or theoretically from xfoil code drela 1989 the lift and drag coefficients calculated from xfoil dependability mainly rely on two parameters including the chord based reynolds number and the turbulence transition parameter ncrit chord based reynolds number is calculated according to the following equation 1 r e c ρ w c μ where w u 0 2 ω r 2 is the relative velocity over the surface of the hydrofoil m s 1 ρ is the flow density k g m 3 μ is the dynamic viscosity n s m 2 r is the local element radius m and c is the local element chord m from the previous equations it is clear that reynolds number calculation depends mainly on local chord and radius of each element the best location of blade span at which these parameters must be specified to calculate the proper reynolds number for the whole rotor should be clearly defined it is also well known that turbine performance curves must be calculated for different rotor angular velocities to determine the overall performance at different tip speed ratios tsrs so according to relative velocity equation the proper angular velocity used for the calculation of relative velocity in reynolds number equation should also be specified a majority of previous studies that used the bemt in tidal turbines modeling haven t mentioned clearly the used reynolds numbers for generating lift and drag coefficients batten et al 2007 2008 kaufmann et al 2017 besides a few studies mentioned the reynolds numbers but didn t clarify the reasons behind working at these numbers specifically for example the study presented by masters et al 2015 where the sensitivity of turbine performance to small changes in lift and drag characteristics was investigated three different rotors were modeled by the use of the bemt where lift and drag properties for each rotor were taken either from experimental studies of wind tunnel hassan 1993 or standard tables abbott and von doenhoff 1959 the author used lift and drag coefficients from standard tables abbott and von doenhoff 1959 for naca 63 418 section at r e 9 10 6 for the same hydrofoil section at the same reference standard tables of lift and drag coefficients were presented at different reynolds numbers other than the chosen one such as at r e 3 10 6 the reason behind the use of lift and drag coefficients generated at r e 9 10 6 for naca 63 418 was not declared few studies allsop et al 2016 2017 mentioned that the reynolds number should be calculated at 75 of the blade length depending on viterna extrapolation function that uses chord and thickness values at that location of the blade length ning 2013 according to these studies it is reasonable to use the same location in blade span for reynolds number calculation the effects of reynolds number on the accuracy of bem applied to tidal turbines was studied by koh and ng 2016 where various sets of hydrodynamic coefficients were used for different reynolds numbers against one set of hydrodynamic coefficients for one reynolds number the power prediction by the model was increased at high tsrs when using various sets of lift and drag coefficients while the effect on thrust coefficient was neglected during this study the proper reynolds number that must be used in generating lift and drag coefficients which can lead to the best validation with experimental data was not revealed for xfoil as a 2 d linear vorticity stream function panel method the turbulence transition is governed by the e n transition criterion method the n ncrit is the critical number used to determine transition a suitable value for this parameter in aerodynamic applications has been suggested by xfoil code drela 1989 drela and youngren 2001 for hydrodynamic applications the code hasn t suggested any reference values as xfoil was initially prepared for the design and analysis of airfoils later for tidal turbine experiments xfoil results were assessed and showed reasonable agreements with experimental data molland et al 2004 goundar and ahmed 2013 however in these studies no details have been provided about the value of ncrit that must be considered for hydrodynamic applications furthermore majority of previous bemt modeling studies that used xfoil for generating lift and drag coefficients have not mentioned either ncrit value or its impact on the performance of tidal turbines batten et al 2006 2007 2008 masters et al 2011 goundar and ahmed 2014 allsop et al 2016 2017 however there are few studies kaufmann et al 2017 koh and ng 2016 in which the values of ncrit parameter were mentioned the reasons behind choosing these values were not declared for the numerical study carried out by kaufmann et al 2017 the bemt method was used for predicting the performance of two scale horizontal axis tct models submerged in towing tank and cavitation tunnel where the ncrit value was set as 1 besides the lift and drag coefficients of four naca series of 4415 6615 63 215 and 63 815 were investigated experimentally as well as numerically by molland et al 2004 the experiments were performed in a cavitation tunnel where the hydrofoil lift and drag forces were measured over a wide range of angles of attack furthermore xfoil code was used for the numerical prediction of lift and drag coefficients while the value of ncrit that provided the best match with experimental data has not been mentioned later by trial and error koh and ng 2016 has found that the ncrit value of 0 5 was the value that provided the best curve fit to experimental data since the ncrit values of 1 and 0 5 were suggested by the studies of kaufmann et al 2017 and koh and ng 2016 respectively the measured lift and drag coefficients by molland et al 2004 are compared with the predicted coefficients by xfoil at these values to illustrate the difference between them as shown in fig 1 by using xfoil lift and drag coefficients are almost in line with experimental data for negative angles of attack for positive angles of attack in pre stall region the xfoil slightly over predicted lift coefficients while under predicted drag coefficients in stall region the xfoil doesn t correlate very well to the experimental data so it can be considered that xfoil may not be capable of predicting lift and drag coefficients accurately for separated flows as a result the bem model performs corrections to take the 3 d stall in consideration as explained in detail in section 2 the predicted lift and drag coefficients by xfoil at both ncrit values of 1 and 0 5 are completely compatible for all naca sections and a reasonable agreements can be seen with experimental hydrodynamic data so the value of ncrit parameter of 1 can be considered as a representative of the two values the calculated lift and drag coefficients from xfoil are very sensitive to ncrit values and in turn does the turbine performance for performance prediction of scale model tcts by the bem modeling there are no enough details about the value of ncrit parameter that must be considered when xfoil code is used for predicting the hydrofoil lift and drag coefficients so further investigations in regard to the ncrit parameter are needed to reveal the suitable value that must be used in such scale model experiments submerged in towing tanks or cavitation tunnels which are characterized by low turbulence level national academies press 2000 myers et al 2011 furthermore the effects of changing ncrit value on the tidal turbine performance modeling by the bemt are substantial to be investigated where higher values than the mentioned by kaufmann et al 2017 and koh and ng 2016 were implemented by other studies in tidal turbines bachant and wosnik 2016 evans et al 2013 in the experimental and numerical studies performed by bachant et al 2016 the value of ncrit 9 was considered where reynolds number effects on the behavior of cross flow turbine were investigated in addition a parametric study of a megawatt scale axial flow tidal turbine rotor was presented by evans et al 2013 where ncrit was set as 6 the reason behind the choice of these values for ncrit and their effects on tidal turbine performance was not clearly explained in the present study in light of above further investigations are carried out in regard to performing the bemt modeling where the hydrodynamic coefficients are generated at different reynolds numbers and ncrit values which help to reveal the proper reynolds number and ncrit parameter and contribute to improving scale tcts modeling by the bemt so to study the effect of changing ncrit parameter on scale model tcts performance two values of ncrit are considered ncrit 1 and 9 where the lift and drag coefficients are generated at both values for studying the effect of reynolds number variation four sets of reynolds numbers are studied as will be discussed in section 5 this paper is structured as section 2 introduces a brief explanation about the bem theory section 3 presents the structure of the used numerical model section 4 shows the data of the rotor scale models section 5 explains the different classifications of reynolds numbers the results are discussed in section 6 and section 7 concludes the paper 2 bem methodology the blade is divided into a number of discrete 2 d elements where blade element theory defines the forces that cause thrust and torque on the blade elements as a function of lift drag coefficients and angle of attack as shown in fig 2 2 d t 1 2 ρ w 2 b c c l c o s φ c d s i n φ d r 3 d q 1 2 ρ w 2 b c c l s i n φ c d c o s φ r d r where d t is the local thrust force n d q is the local torque force n m ρ is the flow density k g m 3 r is the local element radius m c is the local element chord m d r is the local element length m b is the number of blades φ is the inflow angle w is the relative velocity at the blade m s 1 c l and c d are lift and drag coefficients respectively in momentum theory the rotor is represented by an actuator disc which slows down the incoming flow velocity far upstream the rotor the following equation for thrust can be determined by the application of linear momentum conservation to the control volume 4 d t 4 f π ρ u 0 2 a 1 a r d r where u 0 is the inflow velocity m s 1 a is the axial induction factor and f is the tip and hub correction factor momentum theory is extended for the case where the rotor generates angular momentum which can be related to rotor torque the exerted torque on each annular element at local radius r is given by the following equation 5 d q 4 f π ρ a ω u 0 1 a r 3 d r where a is the tangential induction factor around the tip radial flow is not accounted for due to the 2 d flow assumptions of the theory therefore a correction factor was introduced by glauert 1935 by taking prandtl s approximation of helical wake structure as a succession of discs travelling at a velocity between the wake and free stream burton et al 2011 at the hub a similar expression is also proposed by moriarty and hansen 2005 the blade element momentum theory is established by the incorporation of blade element and momentum theories the axial induction factor can be derived by equating the thrust forces from momentum and blade element theories 6 a 1 1 4 f s i n 2 φ σ c l c o s φ c d s i n φ where σ b c 2 π r is the local solidity representing the ratio of the blades to the swept area of element rotor the tangential induction factor can be deduced by equating the torque equations for both momentum and blade element theories 7 a 1 4 f s i n φ c o s φ σ c l s i n φ c d c o s φ 1 another equation for tangential induction factor can be deduced by equating incremental thrust force 8 a 1 2 1 4 λ r 2 a 1 a 1 where λ r ω r u 0 is the local tip speed ratio the tangential induction factor values evaluated by eq 8 led to a more accurate mathematical representation of the blade tip losses jonkman 2003 consequently the simulated torque curve presented by the study of lanzafame and messina 2007 was closer to experimental data when the tangential induction factor was evaluated by eq 8 so in the present bem calculations a using eq 8 is implemented as the hydrodynamic characteristics from experiments or from xfoil software are only 2 d data so the 3 d flow effects in the blade are not accounted which significantly affects the bemt accuracy the 3 d effects delay boundary layer separation which are counted by du and selig 2000 and eggars hansen 2004 models for lift and drag coefficients respectively the angles of attack may exceed the predicted range due to a high range of inflow angles as a result further extrapolations beyond the stall angle were predicted by viterna and corrigan 1982 methodology for post stall lift and drag coefficients at high load conditions the momentum theory breaks down where unphysical reversal flow in the wake is indicated so thrust forces are under predicted due to stream tube model assumption of no interactions with the control volume this particular problem was overcome and formulated by buhl s correction buhl 2005 chapman et al 2013 for calculating thrust under highly loaded conditions in which a 0 4 9 c t 8 9 4 f 40 9 a 50 9 4 f a 2 for more details and full derivations about the bemt the following text are recommended burton et al 2011 for the reader to represent the tidal turbine performance rotor power and thrust coefficients i e c p and c t are calculated by the present bem modeling to be shown against tsr these coefficients are calculated according to the following equations 10 c p r h r d t 1 2 ρ a u 0 2 11 c p r h r d q ω 1 2 ρ a u 0 3 12 t s r ω r u 0 3 numerical model a bemt model written in matlab programming language was developed to combine blade element and momentum theory equations and perform an iterative loop for solving the axial induction factor with a tolerance being less than 1 10 5 user specified inputs including turbine data rotor geometry flow properties and aerodynamic coefficients of blade sections lift and drag coefficients were read into the code and post processing operations were developed to present turbine performance of power and thrust curves against tsr the overall code structure of the bemt is shown in fig 3 in addition the bem model procedures of calculating the turbine performance c p and c t are provided in appendix a 4 experimental data two datasets were used to validate the bemt model based on model experiments of two different scales one for a 3 bladed and the other for a 4 bladed horizontal axis tidal turbines which are performed under different experimental conditions summarized in table 1 case 1 bahaj et al 2007a as shown in fig 4 left is a 1 20 scale model of a 3 bladed horizontal axis tidal current turbine hatct submerged in a cavitation tunnel the length width and height of the cavitation tunnel were 5 m 2 4 m and 1 2 m respectively the tunnel was fully enclosed therefore it was not affected by free surface effects and the flow speed was measured by the use of a pitot static tube a rotor diameter of 800 mm was used where the blades were developed from the profile shape of naca 63 8xx over the testing period five hub pitch angles ranging from 0 to 15 were tested at flow tunnel speeds ranging from 0 8 to 2 0 m s the range of required tip speed ratios tsr for these experiments was achieved with constant tunnel flow speed gained by variation of the rotor rpm through changes of the loading on a rheostats system a strain gauge dynamometer mounted next to the turbine rotor and enclosed in the hub was used to measure the thrust and torque via a belt drive system the output power was absorbed into a dc generator connected to the rheostats case 2 jeffcoate et al 2015 2016 is a 1 10 scale model of a 4 bladed hatct as shown in fig 4 right which was immersed in a towing tank the towing tank was 460 m 13 5 m and 6 5 m in length width and depth respectively it was significantly large compared with the turbine dimensions for reducing blockage effects a horizontal axis rotor of 1 5 m diameter consisting of four eppler e387 wind turbine blades mounted into the rotor hub the turbine was mounted on a moving carriage to simulate flow speeds of 0 8 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s and 1 4 m s which were measured by the use of acoustic doppler velocimeters advs by blade rotation the power train composed of a torque sensor a 1 10 gearbox and a generator was driven by the main shaft the torque sensor was used for measuring the rotor rpm and shaft torque the thrust loading was transferred into the housing through a roller bearing and was measured by the use of the load pin the blockage ratio of the experimental setup in case 1 was 17 where the results were quoted by the author in their blockage corrected form bahaj et al 2007a in case 2 the cross sectional blockage ratio was 2 and the tank was significantly deeper than the rotor so blockage effects were deemed negligible jeffcoate et al 2015 5 hydrodynamic coefficients hydrofoil lift and drag coefficients are the main core of this study of tidal turbine performance sensitivity to the change of both reynolds numbers and ncrit parameter for our cases case 1 and case 2 lift and drag coefficients were calculated through the use of xfoil code as xfoil calculations are based on 2d static flow the 3 d nature of flow caused by the rotation of the blade is not accounted for so as explained in section 2 lift and drag coefficients are 3 d stall delay corrected as a function of location along the blade span and then extrapolated beyond the stall delay angle to corresponding angles of attack from 180 to 180 chord based reynolds numbers in each case were calculated according to eq 1 in the current study for case 1 four sets of reynolds numbers were used for each velocity i e v 1 73 m s 1 v 1 54 m s 1 and v 1 3 m s 1 these reynolds numbers were calculated according to the following conditions 1 the first set of reynolds numbers were calculated where the rotational velocity was taken at the optimal performance the local chord and radius were then taken at 75 of the blade span 2 for the second set the rotational velocity was considered at the optimal performance and the local chord and radius were taken for each element individually for case 1 according to table 2 the rotor blades were divided into 17 elements for each element a different reynolds number was calculated according to its local chord and radius with totally 17 reynolds numbers for all the blade elements then hydrodynamic coefficients were generated for each element in accordance with its reynolds number 3 for the third set the rotational velocity was calculated at low tip speed ratio tsr 2 besides the local chord and radius were taken at 75 of the blade span 4 finally the fourth set the rotational velocity was calculated at high tip speed ratio tsr 10 where the local chord and radius were considered at 75 of the blade span table 3 shows the four sets of reynolds numbers calculated for cases 1a 1b and 1c respectively 6 results and discussion results are shown into five main parts in the first part a validation between the bemt model and experimental results of cases 1 and 2 is presented to check the theory applicability and model accuracy in the second part the gained enhancements in regard to power coefficient prediction were presented through two different definitions for investigating the effect of reynolds number change on the bem modeling the validation of case 1 is presented by the use of the four sets of reynolds numbers previously mentioned in section 5 for each velocity in this comparison reynolds numbers that lead to the best validation with experimental results are revealed concerning the first second and third parts of results all lift and drag coefficients are calculated from xfoil code at ncrit parameter of 1 in the fourth part validation of cases 1 and 2 is shown while lift and drag coefficients are calculated at both values of ncrit parameter of 1 and 9 to show the tidal turbine performance sensitivity to turbulence transition change along with the introduction of the suitable value of ncrit which corresponds more with experimental data in the last part of results a comparison between the results of the present bem model and serg tidal model is presented 6 1 the present bemt model validation for case 1 the rotor blades were developed from naca 63 8xx profile shape which consisted of five sections from hub to tip 63 824 63 821 63 818 63 815 and 63 812 while in case 2 eppler e387 hydrofoil is used for the entire blade length as shown from fig 5 the hydrodynamic lift and drag coefficients against angle of attack were generated by the use of xfoil at reynolds numbers of 2 93 10 5 left and 1 22 10 5 right corresponding to case 1 a and case 2 respectively these coefficients were stall delay corrected and then extrapolated to higher corresponding values of angle of attack in this part the validation of the present bemt model with experimental data is presented where the hydrodynamic coefficients were generated according to the first set of reynolds numbers shown in table 3 the first set was chosen as it was used previously for the numerical studies of allsop et al 2016 2017 where the results were relatively consistent with experimental data in these studies only one reynolds number r e c 3 10 5 was considered for all the cases of 1 a 1 b and 1 c while in the present study the reynolds number is considered different for each case according to its current velocity and optimal performance in regard to the first set of reynolds numbers for the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c r e c 2 93 10 5 2 19 10 5 and 1 67 10 5 respectively while for case 2 r e c 1 22 10 5 figs 6 9 show the comparison between the experimental data and the bemt model results for the cases 1 a 1 b 1 c and case 2 respectively for case 1 a shown in fig 6 a very good agreement between the bem model and the experimental data is seen for both power and thrust curves ensuring the good performance of the bemt modeling for tsr 5 3 the bemt model over predicted power of up to 3 at peak point at optimal performance tsr 6 for thrust the bemt model has an excellent agreement with experimental data for all the range of tsr fig 7 shows the comparison between the experimental data of case 1 b and the bemt modeling at r e c 2 19 10 5 where the current velocity is much lower than the previous case case 1 a it is obvious that there is a very good agreement between experimental data and the present bemt modeling for both power and thrust especially at peak performance where tsr 5 for fig 8 case 1 c the same agreements as the previous two cases were obtained between the bem model and experimental results of both the power and thrust coefficient curves the bem model slightly over predicted thrust coefficient at optimal tsr of up to 4 5 for fig 9 a comparison between the experimental results of case 2 and its bem modeling at r e 1 22 10 5 is presented a satisfactory agreement between the experimental data and the bemt code can be seen from the figure for both power and thrust the bemt model over predicted power for some intervals of tsr 2 5 and under predicted thrust for tsr 2 to be in line with experimental results for both power and thrust for tsr 2 5 from the previous comparisons for a majority of tsr range the bemt model results showed a very good agreement with the experimental data ensuring that the bem theory is well implemented in the present numerical model 6 2 power coefficient calculation through the bem modeling the power coefficient was initially calculated through the integration from hub to tip speed ratios based on vries s definition vries 1979 as shown in eq 13 13 c p 8 λ 2 λ h λ f s i n 2 φ c o s φ λ r s i n φ s i n φ λ r c o s φ 1 c d c l c o t φ λ r 2 d λ r where λ is the tsr λ h ω r h u 0 is the local tip speed ratio at hub and r h is the hub radius it has been found that the predicted power coefficients were over estimated comparing with the experimental data as shown in fig 10 for the cases of 1 a 1 b and at some intervals of case 1 c alternatively the power coefficient was then calculated by using eq 14 which was driven by galloway et al 2014 with the integration through the radius fraction x r r from the first x 0 r 1 r to the last x n r n r blade element where r 1 and r n are the local first and last blade elements respectively 14 c p x 0 x n λ b c r π r 2 1 a 2 c l s i n φ c d c o s φ s i n 2 φ d x by using eq 14 for predicting the power coefficient the results had very good agreements with the experimental data as shown from fig 10 especially for the cases 1 a and 1 b for case 1 c the power was well predicted at optimal point while be slightly under estimated for tsr 5 5 the over predicted data that resulted from eq 13 may be attributed to the inclusion of the circular hub connection section which connects the hub with blade sections where the integration in this equation was performed from the hub to the tip speed ratios actually this connection starts with a circular part in the hub which then be lofted to the first hydrofoil section as shown in fig 11 its inclusion through the integration limits led to the exaggeration of the power coefficient prediction for investigating this issue based on eq 14 integration limits eq 13 was performed while the hub speed ratio was replaced by the local speed ratio at the first blade element λ r 1 ω r 1 u 0 as shown in eq 15 15 c p 8 λ 2 λ r 1 λ f s i n 2 φ c o s φ λ r s i n φ s i n φ λ r c o s φ 1 c d c l c o t φ λ r 2 d λ r the power coefficient graphs using this method eq 15 were drawn in dashed lines and compared with the other results of eqs 13 and 14 as shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the predicted power coefficients for the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c by implementing eq 15 are identical to those predicted by eq 14 having very good agreements with the experimental results so it can be concluded that implementing the bemt modeling for predicting the power coefficients using eq 13 for rotors that have a circular hub connection results in an over predicted data for such cases using eqs 14 or 15 can be considered as an alternative solutions on the other hand for the rotors which doesn t have the hub connection part where the hub is connected with the first hydrofoil section directly such as case 2 implementing eqs 13 or 14 results in the same power coefficient 6 3 the effect of reynolds number variation fig 12 shows lift and drag coefficients for case 1 a generated according to the four sets of reynolds numbers that previously explained i e r e c 1 14 10 5 2 93 10 5 4 8 10 5 and local elemental reynolds numbers respectively according to table 3 it can be seen that the increase of reynolds numbers leads to increase of both lift and drag coefficients especially at the three elements near the hub i e 63 824 63 821 and 63 818 this augmentation of lift and drag coefficients affects the tidal turbine performance for the local elemental reynolds numbers 17 reynolds numbers according to table 2 were calculated where lift and drag coefficients were generated for each element by considering the bounds at first element r r 0 2 and last element r r 1 the values of generated lift and drag coefficients were intermediate between those generated at r e c 1 14 10 5 and r e c 4 8 10 5 and quite similar to those generated at r e c 2 93 10 5 compared with other sets of reynolds numbers the subroutine behind the coefficients generated at local elemental reynolds numbers required hard effort this is attributed to calculation of lift and drag coefficients application of 3 d stall delay corrections and extrapolating lift and drag coefficients to higher corresponding values of angle of attack for each element separately in this part performance curves of case 1 1 a 1 b and 1 c resulted from both the experimental data and the bemt modeling through the use of the four sets of reynolds numbers table 3 are presented as shown in figs 13 15 this part also introduces the reynolds number at which the best agreement with experimental data is seen which helps to clarify the basics that must be followed for calculating the reynolds number used in generating the hydrodynamic coefficients for case 1 a at low reynolds number of 1 14 10 5 the bemt model under predicted power until tsr was nearly equal to 9 and also under predicted thrust for tsr 5 3 it is also shown that the bemt curves at both reynolds numbers of 2 93 10 5 and local elemental were totally identical and gave almost the same results all over the range of tsr these two curves predicted power very well until tsr 5 5 while slightly over predicted it for tsr 6 for thrust curve the two identical curves predicted thrust perfectly all over the total range of tsr for high reynolds number of 4 8 10 5 the bemt model over predicted power for tsr 5 and also over predicted thrust for tsr 7 5 so generally for case 1 a for all the range of tsr especially at optimal tsr tsr 6 it is clear that the bemt results at both reynolds numbers of 2 93 10 5 and local elemental have the best agreement with experimental results compared with other bemt results for case 1 b the same trend of case 1 a of the bemt results was repeated where at low reynolds number of 1 02 10 5 the bemt model under predicted power for a major tsr range until tsr 7 7 and also under predicted thrust for tsr 4 7 for high reynolds number of 4 27 10 5 it over predicted power especially for tsr 5 and also over predicted thrust until almost tsr 6 for the bemt results from both reynolds numbers of 2 19 10 5 and local elemental they were identical and performed very well for power and thrust prediction they have an excellent agreement with power s experimental data until tsr 7 while slightly over predicted it at higher values of tsr for thrust they showed a small over prediction at tsr 4 5 generally it can be seen that the bem modeling at these two sets of reynolds numbers are having good agreements with experimental data for the majority of tsr range for case 1 c the same trend of cases 1 a and 1 b was obtained where the bemt over estimated power and thrust at higher reynolds number r e c 3 6 10 5 while under estimated them at low reynolds number r e c 0 85 10 5 as shown in fig 15 the bemt results at both reynold numbers of 1 67 10 5 and local elemental have the best agreement with experimental results of power and thrust from the previous comparisons it can be concluded that the bemt results at high reynolds numbers of 4 8 10 5 4 27 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 for the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c respectively over predicted experimental data of both power and thrust for the majority of tsr range contrary to high reynolds numbers the bemt results at low reynolds numbers of 1 14 10 5 1 02 10 5 and 0 85 10 5 under estimated experimental data of both power and thrust for almost the whole range of tsr for the bemt results at both reynolds numbers calculated according to the first set r e c 2 93 10 5 2 19 10 5 a n d 1 67 10 5 and local elemental reynolds numbers which are calculated according to the second set are totally identical all over the range of tsr furthermore they are representing an intermediate modeling between the bemt at higher and lower reynolds numbers having the best agreement with results of power and thrust all over the range of tsr especially at optimal values 6 4 the effect of ncrit parameter variation by the decrease of the ncrit parameter from 9 to 1 as shown in fig 16 for case 1 a the generated lift and drag coefficients were increased to higher values and the stall was delayed to greater angles of attack in case of ncrit 9 at element of r r 0 2 the stall was delayed to an angle of attack of 20 where lift and drag coefficients were equal to 2 46 and 0 36 respectively while in case of ncrit 1 the stall was delayed to a higher angle of attack of 33 5 where lift and drag coefficients at this angle were increased to 3 54 and 1 43 respectively the effects of these changes in hydrofoil coefficients on tct s performance curves are presented in this section the effect of ncrit parameter variation on tidal turbine performance is presented through the change of its values in cases 1 and 2 the first set of reynolds numbers table 3 are used as they gave the best agreement with experimental results as shown in the previous section figs 17 20 show the effect of the change of ncrit parameter through comparing the bemt modeling and experimental results of cases 1 and 2 respectively in fig 17 it is noticed that power at ncrit 9 has slightly lower values than at ncrit 1 for tsr 3 while for tsr 3 power at ncrit 9 has higher values for ncrit 9 the bemt over predicted power from tsr 4 of up to 30 4 at tsr 10 while the bemt for ncrit 1 over predicted power from nearly tsr 5 5 of up to 20 6 at tsr 10 for thrust curve the same trend of power curve was observed where bem modeling at ncrit 9 has lower values at tsr 3 4 while has higher values than ncrit 1 beyond this value of tsr for the bemt model at ncrit 1 it has a very good agreement with experimental data and predicted thrust very well all over the range of tsr in case of ncrit 9 the bemt doesn t agree well with experimental data and over predicted thrust from 3 5 tsr 7 5 so it can be concluded from power and thrust curves of case 1 a that the bemt model at ncrit 1 has a better agreement than the bemt model at ncrit 9 by comparison with the experimental data for figs 18 and 19 of cases 1 b and 1 c respectively the same trend of case 1 a of thrust and power curves was also obtained but with less differences between the bemt at ncrit 1 and ncrit 9 as the current velocities at these cases are lower than case 1 a for case 2 fig 20 the same trend of case 1 was observed for both power and thrust curves where the bemt at ncrit 9 has slightly lower values than at ncrit 1 at tsr 2 2 while has higher values at tsr 2 3 in case of power and at tsr 3 5 in case of thrust for power curve at tsr 4 the bemt at ncrit 9 over predicted the power which led the results at ncrit 1 to have a better agreement with the experimental data in case of thrust curve for tsr 2 3 the bemt at ncrit 1 has a better agreement with experimental data while for 2 3 tsr 4 3 the bemt at both ncrit values agreed well with experimental data for tsr 4 3 the bemt at ncrit 9 over predicted thrust while bemt at ncrit 1 was in line with the experimental data from these comparisons of case 1 and case 2 it could be concluded that the bemt model at ncrit 1 agree better with the experimental data of both power and thrust than the bemt at ncrit 9 as a result generating lift and drag coefficients at low ncrit values ncrit 1 leads to a better prediction of turbine performance by the bem modeling 6 5 comparison with serg tidal bem model to reveal the importance of selecting the proper reynolds number and ncrit parameter on the tidal turbine performance a comparison between the present bem model and serg tidal model for predicting the power and thrust coefficients of the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c was performed serg tidal is an academic code based on the bem theory which was developed by the southampton university bahaj et al 2007b validated this model by comparing its results with the experimental data of bahaj et al 2007a by using the serg tidal model the lift and drag coefficients of the hydrofoil sections were derived by using xfoil code at only one reynolds number for all the experimental cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c where neither the reynolds number nor the ncrit parameter has been declared bahaj et al 2007b in this comparison the present bem model was implemented by considering the first set of reynolds numbers and ncrit 1 through generating the lift and drag coefficients by xfoil it is well known that the first set of reynolds numbers are different for each case depending on its current velocity as well as optimal performance at which rotational speed should be considered the comparison between the experimental data of case 1 a and the numerical predictions of power and thrust coefficients resulted from the present bem model and serg tidal model is shown in fig 21 serg tidal model predicted the power coefficient very well at optimal tsr but significantly over predicted the data at high tsr values however the present bem model slightly over predicted the power with 3 at optimal tsr its results remained closer to the experimental data at high tsrs for the thrust coefficient prediction the present bem model showed an obvious superiority over the serg tidal model that under predicted the thrust for all the range of tsr for case 1 b shown in fig 22 both the present bem and serg tidal models predicted the power accurately until tsr 7 after which the present bem model showed better agreements with the experimental data than serg tidal model that over estimated the power in regard to the thrust coefficient serg tidal model clearly resulted in a very under predicted data for all the range of tsr values for the present bem model it slightly over predicted the thrust until tsr 4 8 after which was in line with the experimental data the comparison of case 1 c is shown in fig 23 where the serg tidal model significantly over predicted the power for tsr 3 5 contrarily the present bem model predicted the power accurately for all the range of tsr for thrust coefficient prediction the present bem model also showed more realistic behavior than serg tidal model from this comparison it is obvious that the present bem model has more consistency with experimental results of all the cases than serg tidal model which further emphasized the accuracy of the present model based on the proper selection of reynolds numbers and ncrit parameter furthermore allsop et al 2017 used a bem model for validating with the experimental data of the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c where also only one reynolds number was used for all the cases through generating lift and drag coefficients by xfoil it is worth noting that allsop model s results are relatively identical to those predicted by serg tidal model moreover the calculated lift and drag coefficients by allsop et al 2017 which were generated at r e c 3 10 5 and the calculated coefficients in the present study for case 1 a which were generated at r e c 2 93 10 5 fig 16 are investigated and compared it has been found that allsop s lift and drag coefficient were generated at ncrit 9 which ensures the importance of the present study of illustrating the suitable ncrit values that must be considered through this comparison it has been illustrated the great role of calculating the proper reynolds number and selecting the suitable ncrit parameter on the improvement of the bem modeling of tidal turbine performance 7 conclusions in this study a detailed investigation of the effects of both reynolds number and ncrit parameter change on the bemt modeling of scale model hatcts was presented firstly a validation between the bemt model and two scale models of tidal turbines was carried out to check the implementation of the theory in the model and give the confidence for further investigations for the change of reynolds number in case 1 modeling it is obvious that for high reynolds numbers calculated at tsr 10 the bemt model over predicted power and thrust while for low reynolds numbers calculated at tsr 2 the bemt model under predicted both power and thrust the best performance was seen by reynolds numbers calculated according to the first set and local elemental reynolds numbers calculated according to the second set the corresponding results were identical having better agreements with experimental results and forming an intermediate solution between low and high tsr s reynolds numbers in regard to variation of the turbulence transition in case 1 and case 2 modeling by adjusting ncrit parameter 1 the bemt model predicted power and thrust very well and better than at ncrit parameter 9 the bemt at ncrit 9 under estimated experimental data at low tsr values while over predicted it at higher tsr values for scale model hatcts the bemt output performance curves are very sensitive to the generated hydrodynamic coefficients from xfoil these coefficients depend mainly on reynolds number which is better to be calculated at peak point either at 75 of blade span or at local elements for reducing the number of cumbersome analyses of local elemental reynolds numbers it is recommended that the bemt modeling by the use of the first set of reynolds numbers to be the best representative of the whole blade length furthermore tidal turbine performance depends on the ncrit parameter which is better to be considered at low values ncrit 1 through the generation of hydrodynamic coefficients for not exaggerating the power coefficient prediction the circular part that connects the hub with the blade sections must not be included through the integration limits based on the proper selection of reynolds number and ncrit parameter the present bem model showed a notable superiority over serg tidal model emphasizing the

21982,the blade element momentum theory bemt is one of the most common and widely used methods in horizontal axis wind and tidal turbine performance prediction it mainly relies on two dimensional 2 d hydrodynamic lift and drag coefficients which are used to calculate the hydrodynamic forces within the blade element section of the model these coefficients are greatly affected by both reynolds numbers and turbulence transition parameter ncrit the performance sensitivity of scale models tidal current turbines tcts to the change of reynolds numbers and ncrit parameter was assessed initially the bemt was validated with experimental measurements of two scale models of horizontal axis tidal current turbines a very good agreement was seen thus confidence in both the implementation of the theory and the applicability of the method was built up lift and drag coefficients were calculated from xfoil through the use of different sets of reynolds numbers at different ncrit values the best bemt validations with experimental data were seen when the hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated at two sets of reynolds numbers considered at optimal performance the first set was calculated at 75 of the blade span while the second set was calculated at every local elemental position of the blade for facilitation reduction of time and effort reynolds numbers at 75 of the blade span is considered the best choice furthermore the bemt model results showed better agreements with experimental data when lift and drag coefficients were calculated at low values of ncrit parameter the predicted tidal turbine performances of previous experimental data by the present bem model were compared with those derived from the academic serg tidal bem code the present bem model based on the proper selection of both reynolds number and ncrit parameter showed an obvious superiority over serg tidal model keywords scale model tidal current turbines blade element momentum theory experimental validation performance modeling assessment reynolds number and ncrit effect 1 introduction energy extraction from marine currents has leaped from the conservative type of devices to full scale machines many companies currently work on developing devices in various forms that can exploit marine current energy resources around the world tidal current turbines tcts have recently been used as converters of river tidal and marine currents to electrical energy yuce and muratoglu 2015 the principle and working theory of tcts are almost the same as those of wind turbines marine currents have many advantages over wind with a time varying flow speed and direction they are more predictable which is beneficial for the control of the electrical grid clarke et al 2006 improvements in numerical modeling techniques enabled the analysis of tcts by the use of complex cfd simulations edmunds et al 2017 cfd modeling capabilities of tcts include prediction of detailed assessments of performance fluid interactions and wake formation to a high degree of accuracy which require high computational cost and long processing time the blade element momentum theory bemt is an integral method combined with 2 d airfoil characteristics data of section lift and drag vaz et al 2011 for predicting turbine performance and rotor thrust hansen 2007 although the bemt model is simple it is effective and well understood it has been commonly used in the wind industry and more recently has been adapted for tidal applications with commercial dnv gl garrad hassan 2012 and research led masters et al 2011 models the bemt model has been intensively used for blade design particularly in the field of wind turbines tavares dias do rio vaz et al 2013 and also applied successfully in the design of hydrokinetic turbines batten et al 2006 goundar and ahmed 2014 despite the low computational cost of the bemt model the initial preparation efforts for modeling and validation cannot be neglected benefits of the bemt method over other modeling types such as cfd include significant reduction of running times and low computational cost as a result the bemt model becomes more suitable for applications requiring multiple iterative engineering assessments or restricted access to high grade computational resources the bemt method mainly depends on 2 d hydrodynamic characteristics of a hydrofoil lift and drag coefficients which are generated either experimentally from wind tunnel experiments or theoretically from xfoil code drela 1989 the lift and drag coefficients calculated from xfoil dependability mainly rely on two parameters including the chord based reynolds number and the turbulence transition parameter ncrit chord based reynolds number is calculated according to the following equation 1 r e c ρ w c μ where w u 0 2 ω r 2 is the relative velocity over the surface of the hydrofoil m s 1 ρ is the flow density k g m 3 μ is the dynamic viscosity n s m 2 r is the local element radius m and c is the local element chord m from the previous equations it is clear that reynolds number calculation depends mainly on local chord and radius of each element the best location of blade span at which these parameters must be specified to calculate the proper reynolds number for the whole rotor should be clearly defined it is also well known that turbine performance curves must be calculated for different rotor angular velocities to determine the overall performance at different tip speed ratios tsrs so according to relative velocity equation the proper angular velocity used for the calculation of relative velocity in reynolds number equation should also be specified a majority of previous studies that used the bemt in tidal turbines modeling haven t mentioned clearly the used reynolds numbers for generating lift and drag coefficients batten et al 2007 2008 kaufmann et al 2017 besides a few studies mentioned the reynolds numbers but didn t clarify the reasons behind working at these numbers specifically for example the study presented by masters et al 2015 where the sensitivity of turbine performance to small changes in lift and drag characteristics was investigated three different rotors were modeled by the use of the bemt where lift and drag properties for each rotor were taken either from experimental studies of wind tunnel hassan 1993 or standard tables abbott and von doenhoff 1959 the author used lift and drag coefficients from standard tables abbott and von doenhoff 1959 for naca 63 418 section at r e 9 10 6 for the same hydrofoil section at the same reference standard tables of lift and drag coefficients were presented at different reynolds numbers other than the chosen one such as at r e 3 10 6 the reason behind the use of lift and drag coefficients generated at r e 9 10 6 for naca 63 418 was not declared few studies allsop et al 2016 2017 mentioned that the reynolds number should be calculated at 75 of the blade length depending on viterna extrapolation function that uses chord and thickness values at that location of the blade length ning 2013 according to these studies it is reasonable to use the same location in blade span for reynolds number calculation the effects of reynolds number on the accuracy of bem applied to tidal turbines was studied by koh and ng 2016 where various sets of hydrodynamic coefficients were used for different reynolds numbers against one set of hydrodynamic coefficients for one reynolds number the power prediction by the model was increased at high tsrs when using various sets of lift and drag coefficients while the effect on thrust coefficient was neglected during this study the proper reynolds number that must be used in generating lift and drag coefficients which can lead to the best validation with experimental data was not revealed for xfoil as a 2 d linear vorticity stream function panel method the turbulence transition is governed by the e n transition criterion method the n ncrit is the critical number used to determine transition a suitable value for this parameter in aerodynamic applications has been suggested by xfoil code drela 1989 drela and youngren 2001 for hydrodynamic applications the code hasn t suggested any reference values as xfoil was initially prepared for the design and analysis of airfoils later for tidal turbine experiments xfoil results were assessed and showed reasonable agreements with experimental data molland et al 2004 goundar and ahmed 2013 however in these studies no details have been provided about the value of ncrit that must be considered for hydrodynamic applications furthermore majority of previous bemt modeling studies that used xfoil for generating lift and drag coefficients have not mentioned either ncrit value or its impact on the performance of tidal turbines batten et al 2006 2007 2008 masters et al 2011 goundar and ahmed 2014 allsop et al 2016 2017 however there are few studies kaufmann et al 2017 koh and ng 2016 in which the values of ncrit parameter were mentioned the reasons behind choosing these values were not declared for the numerical study carried out by kaufmann et al 2017 the bemt method was used for predicting the performance of two scale horizontal axis tct models submerged in towing tank and cavitation tunnel where the ncrit value was set as 1 besides the lift and drag coefficients of four naca series of 4415 6615 63 215 and 63 815 were investigated experimentally as well as numerically by molland et al 2004 the experiments were performed in a cavitation tunnel where the hydrofoil lift and drag forces were measured over a wide range of angles of attack furthermore xfoil code was used for the numerical prediction of lift and drag coefficients while the value of ncrit that provided the best match with experimental data has not been mentioned later by trial and error koh and ng 2016 has found that the ncrit value of 0 5 was the value that provided the best curve fit to experimental data since the ncrit values of 1 and 0 5 were suggested by the studies of kaufmann et al 2017 and koh and ng 2016 respectively the measured lift and drag coefficients by molland et al 2004 are compared with the predicted coefficients by xfoil at these values to illustrate the difference between them as shown in fig 1 by using xfoil lift and drag coefficients are almost in line with experimental data for negative angles of attack for positive angles of attack in pre stall region the xfoil slightly over predicted lift coefficients while under predicted drag coefficients in stall region the xfoil doesn t correlate very well to the experimental data so it can be considered that xfoil may not be capable of predicting lift and drag coefficients accurately for separated flows as a result the bem model performs corrections to take the 3 d stall in consideration as explained in detail in section 2 the predicted lift and drag coefficients by xfoil at both ncrit values of 1 and 0 5 are completely compatible for all naca sections and a reasonable agreements can be seen with experimental hydrodynamic data so the value of ncrit parameter of 1 can be considered as a representative of the two values the calculated lift and drag coefficients from xfoil are very sensitive to ncrit values and in turn does the turbine performance for performance prediction of scale model tcts by the bem modeling there are no enough details about the value of ncrit parameter that must be considered when xfoil code is used for predicting the hydrofoil lift and drag coefficients so further investigations in regard to the ncrit parameter are needed to reveal the suitable value that must be used in such scale model experiments submerged in towing tanks or cavitation tunnels which are characterized by low turbulence level national academies press 2000 myers et al 2011 furthermore the effects of changing ncrit value on the tidal turbine performance modeling by the bemt are substantial to be investigated where higher values than the mentioned by kaufmann et al 2017 and koh and ng 2016 were implemented by other studies in tidal turbines bachant and wosnik 2016 evans et al 2013 in the experimental and numerical studies performed by bachant et al 2016 the value of ncrit 9 was considered where reynolds number effects on the behavior of cross flow turbine were investigated in addition a parametric study of a megawatt scale axial flow tidal turbine rotor was presented by evans et al 2013 where ncrit was set as 6 the reason behind the choice of these values for ncrit and their effects on tidal turbine performance was not clearly explained in the present study in light of above further investigations are carried out in regard to performing the bemt modeling where the hydrodynamic coefficients are generated at different reynolds numbers and ncrit values which help to reveal the proper reynolds number and ncrit parameter and contribute to improving scale tcts modeling by the bemt so to study the effect of changing ncrit parameter on scale model tcts performance two values of ncrit are considered ncrit 1 and 9 where the lift and drag coefficients are generated at both values for studying the effect of reynolds number variation four sets of reynolds numbers are studied as will be discussed in section 5 this paper is structured as section 2 introduces a brief explanation about the bem theory section 3 presents the structure of the used numerical model section 4 shows the data of the rotor scale models section 5 explains the different classifications of reynolds numbers the results are discussed in section 6 and section 7 concludes the paper 2 bem methodology the blade is divided into a number of discrete 2 d elements where blade element theory defines the forces that cause thrust and torque on the blade elements as a function of lift drag coefficients and angle of attack as shown in fig 2 2 d t 1 2 ρ w 2 b c c l c o s φ c d s i n φ d r 3 d q 1 2 ρ w 2 b c c l s i n φ c d c o s φ r d r where d t is the local thrust force n d q is the local torque force n m ρ is the flow density k g m 3 r is the local element radius m c is the local element chord m d r is the local element length m b is the number of blades φ is the inflow angle w is the relative velocity at the blade m s 1 c l and c d are lift and drag coefficients respectively in momentum theory the rotor is represented by an actuator disc which slows down the incoming flow velocity far upstream the rotor the following equation for thrust can be determined by the application of linear momentum conservation to the control volume 4 d t 4 f π ρ u 0 2 a 1 a r d r where u 0 is the inflow velocity m s 1 a is the axial induction factor and f is the tip and hub correction factor momentum theory is extended for the case where the rotor generates angular momentum which can be related to rotor torque the exerted torque on each annular element at local radius r is given by the following equation 5 d q 4 f π ρ a ω u 0 1 a r 3 d r where a is the tangential induction factor around the tip radial flow is not accounted for due to the 2 d flow assumptions of the theory therefore a correction factor was introduced by glauert 1935 by taking prandtl s approximation of helical wake structure as a succession of discs travelling at a velocity between the wake and free stream burton et al 2011 at the hub a similar expression is also proposed by moriarty and hansen 2005 the blade element momentum theory is established by the incorporation of blade element and momentum theories the axial induction factor can be derived by equating the thrust forces from momentum and blade element theories 6 a 1 1 4 f s i n 2 φ σ c l c o s φ c d s i n φ where σ b c 2 π r is the local solidity representing the ratio of the blades to the swept area of element rotor the tangential induction factor can be deduced by equating the torque equations for both momentum and blade element theories 7 a 1 4 f s i n φ c o s φ σ c l s i n φ c d c o s φ 1 another equation for tangential induction factor can be deduced by equating incremental thrust force 8 a 1 2 1 4 λ r 2 a 1 a 1 where λ r ω r u 0 is the local tip speed ratio the tangential induction factor values evaluated by eq 8 led to a more accurate mathematical representation of the blade tip losses jonkman 2003 consequently the simulated torque curve presented by the study of lanzafame and messina 2007 was closer to experimental data when the tangential induction factor was evaluated by eq 8 so in the present bem calculations a using eq 8 is implemented as the hydrodynamic characteristics from experiments or from xfoil software are only 2 d data so the 3 d flow effects in the blade are not accounted which significantly affects the bemt accuracy the 3 d effects delay boundary layer separation which are counted by du and selig 2000 and eggars hansen 2004 models for lift and drag coefficients respectively the angles of attack may exceed the predicted range due to a high range of inflow angles as a result further extrapolations beyond the stall angle were predicted by viterna and corrigan 1982 methodology for post stall lift and drag coefficients at high load conditions the momentum theory breaks down where unphysical reversal flow in the wake is indicated so thrust forces are under predicted due to stream tube model assumption of no interactions with the control volume this particular problem was overcome and formulated by buhl s correction buhl 2005 chapman et al 2013

programming language was developed to combine blade element and momentum theory equations and perform an iterative loop for solving the axial induction factor with a tolerance being less than 1 10 5 user specified inputs including turbine data rotor geometry flow properties and aerodynamic coefficients of blade sections lift and drag coefficients were read into the code and post processing operations were developed to present turbine performance of power and thrust curves against tsr the overall code structure of the bemt is shown in fig 3 in addition the bem model procedures of calculating the turbine performance c p and c t are provided in appendix a 4 experimental data two datasets were used to validate the bemt model based on model experiments of two different scales one for a 3 bladed and the other for a 4 bladed horizontal axis tidal turbines which are performed under different experimental conditions summarized in table 1 case 1 bahaj et al 2007a as shown in fig 4 left is a 1 20 scale model of a 3 bladed horizontal axis tidal current turbine hatct submerged in a cavitation tunnel the length width and height of the cavitation tunnel were 5 m 2 4 m and 1 2 m respectively the tunnel was fully enclosed therefore it was not affected by free surface effects and the flow speed was measured by the use of a pitot static tube a rotor diameter of 800 mm was used where the blades were developed from the profile shape of naca 63 8xx over the testing period five hub pitch angles ranging from 0 to 15 were tested at flow tunnel speeds ranging from 0 8 to 2 0 m s the range of required tip speed ratios tsr for these experiments was achieved with constant tunnel flow speed gained by variation of the rotor rpm through changes of the loading on a rheostats system a strain gauge dynamometer mounted next to the turbine rotor and enclosed in the hub was used to measure the thrust and torque via a belt drive system the output power was absorbed into a dc generator connected to the rheostats case 2 jeffcoate et al 2015 2016 is a 1 10 scale model of a 4 bladed hatct as shown in fig 4 right which was immersed in a towing tank the towing tank was 460 m 13 5 m and 6 5 m in length width and depth respectively it was significantly large compared with the turbine dimensions for reducing blockage effects a horizontal axis rotor of 1 5 m diameter consisting of four eppler e387 wind turbine blades mounted into the rotor hub the turbine was mounted on a moving carriage to simulate flow speeds of 0 8 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s and 1 4 m s which were measured by the use of acoustic doppler velocimeters advs by blade rotation the power train composed of a torque sensor a 1 10 gearbox and a generator was driven by the main shaft the torque sensor was used for measuring the rotor rpm and shaft torque the thrust loading was transferred into the housing through a roller bearing and was measured by the use of the load pin the blockage ratio of the experimental setup in case 1 was 17 where the results were quoted by the author in their blockage corrected form bahaj et al 2007a in case 2 the cross sectional blockage ratio was 2 and the tank was significantly deeper than the rotor so blockage effects were deemed negligible jeffcoate et al 2015 5 hydrodynamic coefficients hydrofoil lift and drag coefficients are the main core of this study of tidal turbine performance sensitivity to the change of both reynolds numbers and ncrit parameter for our cases case 1 and case 2 lift and drag coefficients were calculated through the use of xfoil code as xfoil calculations are based on 2d static flow the 3 d nature of flow caused by the rotation of the blade is not accounted for so as explained in section 2 lift and drag coefficients are 3 d stall delay corrected as a function of location along the blade span and then extrapolated beyond the stall delay angle to corresponding angles of attack from 180 to 180 chord based reynolds numbers in each case were calculated according to eq 1 in the current study for case 1 four sets of reynolds numbers were used for each velocity i e v 1 73 m s 1 v 1 54 m s 1 and v 1 3 m s 1 these reynolds numbers were calculated according to the following conditions 1 the first set of reynolds numbers were calculated where the rotational velocity was taken at the optimal performance the local chord and radius were then taken at 75 of the blade span 2 for the second set the rotational velocity was considered at the optimal performance and the local chord and radius were taken for each element individually for case 1 according to table 2 the rotor blades were divided into 17 elements for each element a different reynolds number was calculated according to its local chord and radius with totally 17 reynolds numbers for all the blade elements then hydrodynamic coefficients were generated for each element in accordance with its reynolds number 3 for the third set the rotational velocity was calculated at low tip speed ratio tsr 2 besides the local chord and radius were taken at 75 of the blade span 4 finally the fourth set the rotational velocity was calculated at high tip speed ratio tsr 10 where the local chord and radius were considered at 75 of the blade span table 3 shows the four sets of reynolds numbers calculated for cases 1a 1b and 1c respectively 6 results and discussion results are shown into five main parts in the first part a validation between the bemt model and experimental results of cases 1 and 2 is presented to check the theory applicability and model accuracy in the second part the gained enhancements in regard to power coefficient prediction were presented through two different definitions for investigating the effect of reynolds number change on the bem modeling the validation of case 1 is presented by the use of the four sets of reynolds numbers previously mentioned in section 5 for each velocity in this comparison reynolds numbers that lead to the best validation with experimental results are revealed concerning the first second and third parts of results all lift and drag coefficients are calculated from xfoil code at ncrit parameter of 1 in the fourth part validation of cases 1 and 2 is shown while lift and drag coefficients are calculated at both values of ncrit parameter of 1 and 9 to show the tidal turbine performance sensitivity to turbulence transition change along with the introduction of the suitable value of ncrit which corresponds more with experimental data in the last part of results a comparison between the results of the present bem model and serg tidal model is presented 6 1 the present bemt model validation for case 1 the rotor blades were developed from naca 63 8xx profile shape which consisted of five sections from hub to tip 63 824 63 821 63 818 63 815 and 63 812 while in case 2 eppler e387 hydrofoil is used for the entire blade length as shown from fig 5 the hydrodynamic lift and drag coefficients against angle of attack were generated by the use of xfoil at reynolds numbers of 2 93 10 5 left and 1 22 10 5 right corresponding to case 1 a and case 2 respectively these coefficients were stall delay corrected and then extrapolated to higher corresponding values of angle of attack in this part the validation of the present bemt model with experimental data is presented where the hydrodynamic coefficients were generated according to the first set of reynolds numbers shown in table 3 the first set was chosen as it was used previously for the numerical studies of allsop et al 2016 2017 where the results were relatively consistent with experimental data in these studies only one reynolds number r e c 3 10 5 was considered for all the cases of 1 a 1 b and 1 c while in the present study the reynolds number is considered different for each case according to its current velocity and optimal performance in regard to the first set of reynolds numbers for the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c r e c 2 93 10 5 2 19 10 5 and 1 67 10 5 respectively while for case 2 r e c 1 22 10 5 figs 6 9 show the comparison between the experimental data and the bemt model results for the cases 1 a 1 b 1 c and case 2 respectively for case 1 a shown in fig 6 a very good agreement between the bem model and the experimental data is seen for both power and thrust curves ensuring the good performance of the bemt modeling for tsr 5 3 the bemt model over predicted power of up to 3 at peak point at optimal performance tsr 6 for thrust the bemt model has an excellent agreement with experimental data for all the range of tsr fig 7 shows the comparison between the experimental data of case 1 b and the bemt modeling at r e c 2 19 10 5 where the current velocity is much lower than the previous case case 1 a it is obvious that there is a very good agreement between experimental data and the present bemt modeling for both power and thrust especially at peak performance where tsr 5 for fig 8 case 1 c the same agreements as the previous two cases were obtained between the bem model and experimental results of both the power and thrust coefficient curves the bem model slightly over predicted thrust coefficient at optimal tsr of up to 4 5 for fig 9 a comparison between the experimental results of case 2 and its bem modeling at r e 1 22 10 5 is presented a satisfactory agreement between the experimental data and the bemt code can be seen from the figure for both power and thrust the bemt model over predicted power for some intervals of tsr 2 5 and under predicted thrust for tsr 2 to be in line with experimental results for both power and thrust for tsr 2 5 from the previous comparisons for a majority of tsr range the bemt model results showed a very good agreement with the experimental data ensuring that the bem theory is well implemented in the present numerical model 6 2 power coefficient calculation through the bem modeling the power coefficient was initially calculated through the integration from hub to tip speed ratios based on vries s definition vries 1979 as shown in eq 13 13 c p 8 λ 2 λ h λ f s i n 2 φ c o s φ λ r s i n φ s i n φ λ r c o s φ 1 c d c l c o t φ λ r 2 d λ r where λ is the tsr λ h ω r h u 0 is the local tip speed ratio at hub and r h is the hub radius it has been found that the predicted power coefficients were over estimated comparing with the experimental data as shown in fig 10 for the cases of 1 a 1 b and at some intervals of case 1 c alternatively the power coefficient was then calculated by using eq 14 which was driven by galloway et al 2014 with the integration through the radius fraction x r r from the first x 0 r 1 r to the last x n r n r blade element where r 1 and r n are the local first and last blade elements respectively 14 c p x 0 x n λ b c r π r 2 1 a 2 c l s i n φ c d c o s φ s i n 2 φ d x by using eq 14 for predicting the power coefficient the results had very good agreements with the experimental data as shown from fig 10 especially for the cases 1 a and 1 b for case 1 c the power was well predicted at optimal point while be slightly under estimated for tsr 5 5 the over predicted data that resulted from eq 13 may be attributed to the inclusion of the circular hub connection section which connects the hub with blade sections where the integration in this equation was performed from the hub to the tip speed ratios actually this connection starts with a circular part in the hub which then be lofted to the first hydrofoil section as shown in fig 11 its inclusion through the integration limits led to the exaggeration of the power coefficient prediction for investigating this issue based on eq 14 integration limits eq 13 was performed while the hub speed ratio was replaced by the local speed ratio at the first blade element λ r 1 ω r 1 u 0 as shown in eq 15 15 c p 8 λ 2 λ r 1 λ f s i n 2 φ c o s φ λ r s i n φ s i n φ λ r c o s φ 1 c d c l c o t φ λ r 2 d λ r the power coefficient graphs using this method eq 15 were drawn in dashed lines and compared with the other results of eqs 13 and 14 as shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the predicted power coefficients for the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c by implementing eq 15 are identical to those predicted by eq 14 having very good agreements with the experimental results so it can be concluded that implementing the bemt modeling for predicting the power coefficients using eq 13 for rotors that have a circular hub connection results in an over predicted data for such cases using eqs 14 or 15 can be considered as an alternative solutions on the other hand for the rotors which doesn t have the hub connection part where the hub is connected with the first hydrofoil section directly such as case 2 implementing eqs 13 or 14 results in the same power coefficient 6 3 the effect of reynolds number variation fig 12 shows lift and drag coefficients for case 1 a generated according to the four sets of reynolds numbers that previously explained i e r e c 1 14 10 5 2 93 10 5 4 8 10 5 and local elemental reynolds numbers respectively according to table 3 it can be seen that the increase of reynolds numbers leads to increase of both lift and drag coefficients especially at the three elements near the hub i e 63 824 63 821 and 63 818 this augmentation of lift and drag coefficients affects the tidal turbine performance for the local elemental reynolds numbers 17 reynolds numbers according to table 2 were calculated where lift and drag coefficients were generated for each element by considering the bounds at first element r r 0 2 and last element r r 1 the values of generated lift and drag coefficients were intermediate between those generated at r e c 1 14 10 5 and r e c 4 8 10 5 and quite similar to those generated at r e c 2 93 10 5 compared with other sets of reynolds numbers the subroutine behind the coefficients generated at local elemental reynolds numbers required hard effort this is attributed to calculation of lift and drag coefficients application of 3 d stall delay corrections and extrapolating lift and drag coefficients to higher corresponding values of angle of attack for each element separately in this part performance curves of case 1 1 a 1 b and 1 c resulted from both the experimental data and the bemt modeling through the use of the four sets of reynolds numbers table 3 are presented as shown in figs 13 15 this part also introduces the reynolds number at which the best agreement with experimental data is seen which helps to clarify the basics that must be followed for calculating the reynolds number used in generating the hydrodynamic coefficients for case 1 a at low reynolds number of 1 14 10 5 the bemt model under predicted power until tsr was nearly equal to 9 and also under predicted thrust for tsr 5 3 it is also shown that the bemt curves at both reynolds numbers of 2 93 10 5 and local elemental were totally identical and gave almost the same results all over the range of tsr these two curves predicted power very well until tsr 5 5 while slightly over predicted it for tsr 6 for thrust curve the two identical curves predicted thrust perfectly all over the total range of tsr for high reynolds number of 4 8 10 5 the bemt model over predicted power for tsr 5 and also over predicted thrust for tsr 7 5 so generally for case 1 a for all the range of tsr especially at optimal tsr tsr 6 it is clear that the bemt results at both reynolds numbers of 2 93 10 5 and local elemental have the best agreement with experimental results compared with other bemt results for case 1 b the same trend of case 1 a of the bemt results was repeated where at low reynolds number of 1 02 10 5 the bemt model under predicted power for a major tsr range until tsr 7 7 and also under predicted thrust for tsr 4 7 for high reynolds number of 4 27 10 5 it over predicted power especially for tsr 5 and also over predicted thrust until almost tsr 6 for the bemt results from both reynolds numbers of 2 19 10 5 and local elemental they were identical and performed very well for power and thrust prediction they have an excellent agreement with power s experimental data until tsr 7 while slightly over predicted it at higher values of tsr for thrust they showed a small over prediction at tsr 4 5 generally it can be seen that the bem modeling at these two sets of reynolds numbers are having good agreements with experimental data for the majority of tsr range for case 1 c the same trend of cases 1 a and 1 b was obtained where the bemt over estimated power and thrust at higher reynolds number r e c 3 6 10 5 while under estimated them at low reynolds number r e c 0 85 10 5 as shown in fig 15 the bemt results at both reynold numbers of 1 67 10 5 and local elemental have the best agreement with experimental results of power and thrust from the previous comparisons it can be concluded that the bemt results at high reynolds numbers of 4 8 10 5 4 27 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 for the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c respectively over predicted experimental data of both power and thrust for the majority of tsr range contrary to high reynolds numbers the bemt results at low reynolds numbers of 1 14 10 5 1 02 10 5 and 0 85 10 5 under estimated experimental data of both power and thrust for almost the whole range of tsr for the bemt results at both reynolds numbers calculated according to the first set r e c 2 93 10 5 2 19 10 5 a n d 1 67 10 5 and local elemental reynolds numbers which are calculated according to the second set are totally identical all over the range of tsr furthermore they are representing an intermediate modeling between the bemt at higher and lower reynolds numbers having the best agreement with results of power and thrust all over the range of tsr especially at optimal values 6 4 the effect of ncrit parameter variation by the decrease of the ncrit parameter from 9 to 1 as shown in fig 16 for case 1 a the generated lift and drag coefficients were increased to higher values and the stall was delayed to greater angles of attack in case of ncrit 9 at element of r r 0 2 the stall was delayed to an angle of attack of 20 where lift and drag coefficients were equal to 2 46 and 0 36 respectively while in case of ncrit 1 the stall was delayed to a higher angle of attack of 33 5 where lift and drag coefficients at this angle were increased to 3 54 and 1 43 respectively the effects of these changes in hydrofoil coefficients on tct s performance curves are presented in this section the effect of ncrit parameter variation on tidal turbine performance is presented through the change of its values in cases 1 and 2 the first set of reynolds numbers table 3 are used as they gave the best agreement with experimental results as shown in the previous section figs 17 20 show the effect of the change of ncrit parameter through comparing the bemt modeling and experimental results of cases 1 and 2 respectively in fig 17 it is noticed that power at ncrit 9 has slightly lower values than at ncrit 1 for tsr 3 while for tsr 3 power at ncrit 9 has higher values for ncrit 9 the bemt over predicted power from tsr 4 of up to 30 4 at tsr 10 while the bemt for ncrit 1 over predicted power from nearly tsr 5 5 of up to 20 6 at tsr 10 for thrust curve the same trend of power curve was observed where bem modeling at ncrit 9 has lower values at tsr 3 4 while has higher values than ncrit 1 beyond this value of tsr for the bemt model at ncrit 1 it has a very good agreement with experimental data and predicted thrust very well all over the range of tsr in case of ncrit 9 the bemt doesn t agree well with experimental data and over predicted thrust from 3 5 tsr 7 5 so it can be concluded from power and thrust curves of case 1 a that the bemt model at ncrit 1 has a better agreement than the bemt model at ncrit 9 by comparison with the experimental data for figs 18 and 19 of cases 1 b and 1 c respectively the same trend of case 1 a of thrust and power curves was also obtained but with less differences between the bemt at ncrit 1 and ncrit 9 as the current velocities at these cases are lower than case 1 a for case 2 fig 20 the same trend of case 1 was observed for both power and thrust curves where the bemt at ncrit 9 has slightly lower values than at ncrit 1 at tsr 2 2 while has higher values at tsr 2 3 in case of power and at tsr 3 5 in case of thrust for power curve at tsr 4 the bemt at ncrit 9 over predicted the power which led the results at ncrit 1 to have a better agreement with the experimental data in case of thrust curve for tsr 2 3 the bemt at ncrit 1 has a better agreement with experimental data while for 2 3 tsr 4 3 the bemt at both ncrit values agreed well with experimental data for tsr 4 3 the bemt at ncrit 9 over predicted thrust while bemt at ncrit 1 was in line with the experimental data from these comparisons of case 1 and case 2 it could be concluded that the bemt model at ncrit 1 agree better with the experimental data of both power and thrust than the bemt at ncrit 9 as a result generating lift and drag coefficients at low ncrit values ncrit 1 leads to a better prediction of turbine performance by the bem modeling 6 5 comparison with serg tidal bem model to reveal the importance of selecting the proper reynolds number and ncrit parameter on the tidal turbine performance a comparison between the present bem model and serg tidal model for predicting the power and thrust coefficients of the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c was performed serg tidal is an academic code based on the bem theory which was developed by the southampton university bahaj et al 2007b validated this model by comparing its results with the experimental data of bahaj et al 2007a by using the serg tidal model the lift and drag coefficients of the hydrofoil sections were derived by using xfoil code at only one reynolds number for all the experimental cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c where neither the reynolds number nor the ncrit parameter has been declared bahaj et al 2007b in this comparison the present bem model was implemented by considering the first set of reynolds numbers and ncrit 1 through generating the lift and drag coefficients by xfoil it is well known that the first set of reynolds numbers are different for each case depending on its current velocity as well as optimal performance at which rotational speed should be considered the comparison between the experimental data of case 1 a and the numerical predictions of power and thrust coefficients resulted from the present bem model and serg tidal model is shown in fig 21 serg tidal model predicted the power coefficient very well at optimal tsr but significantly over predicted the data at high tsr values however the present bem model slightly over predicted the power with 3 at optimal tsr its results remained closer to the experimental data at high tsrs for the thrust coefficient prediction the present bem model showed an obvious superiority over the serg tidal model that under predicted the thrust for all the range of tsr for case 1 b shown in fig 22 both the present bem and serg tidal models predicted the power accurately until tsr 7 after which the present bem model showed better agreements with the experimental data than serg tidal model that over estimated the power in regard to the thrust coefficient serg tidal model clearly resulted in a very under predicted data for all the range of tsr values for the present bem model it slightly over predicted the thrust until tsr 4 8 after which was in line with the experimental data the comparison of case 1 c is shown in fig 23 where the serg tidal model significantly over predicted the power for tsr 3 5 contrarily the present bem model predicted the power accurately for all the range of tsr for thrust coefficient prediction the present bem model also showed more realistic behavior than serg tidal model from this comparison it is obvious that the present bem model has more consistency with experimental results of all the cases than serg tidal model which further emphasized the accuracy of the present model based on the proper selection of reynolds numbers and ncrit parameter furthermore allsop et al 2017 used a bem model for validating with the experimental data of the cases 1 a 1 b and 1 c where also only one reynolds number was used for all the cases through generating lift and drag coefficients by xfoil it is worth noting that allsop model s results are relatively identical to those predicted by serg tidal model moreover the calculated lift and drag coefficients by allsop et al 2017 which were generated at r e c 3 10 5 and the calculated coefficients in the present study for case 1 a which were generated at r e c 2 93 10 5 fig 16 are investigated and compared it has been found that allsop s lift and drag coefficient were generated at ncrit 9 which ensures the importance of the present study of illustrating the suitable ncrit values that must be considered through this comparison it has been illustrated the great role of calculating the proper reynolds number and selecting the suitable ncrit parameter on the improvement of the bem modeling of tidal turbine performance 7 conclusions in this study a detailed investigation of the effects of both reynolds number and ncrit parameter change on the bemt modeling of scale model hatcts was presented firstly a validation between the bemt model and two scale models of tidal turbines was carried out to check the implementation of the theory in the model and give the confidence for further investigations for the change of reynolds number in case 1 modeling it is obvious that for high reynolds numbers calculated at tsr 10 the bemt model over predicted power and thrust while for low reynolds numbers calculated at tsr 2 the bemt model under predicted both power and thrust the best performance was seen by reynolds numbers calculated according to the first set and local elemental reynolds numbers calculated according to the second set the corresponding results were identical having better agreements with experimental results and forming an intermediate solution between low and high tsr s reynolds numbers in regard to variation of the turbulence transition in case 1 and case 2 modeling by adjusting ncrit parameter 1 the bemt model predicted power and thrust very well and better than at ncrit parameter 9 the bemt at ncrit 9 under estimated experimental data at low tsr values while over predicted it at higher tsr values for scale model hatcts the bemt output performance curves are very sensitive to the generated hydrodynamic coefficients from xfoil these coefficients depend mainly on reynolds number which is better to be calculated at peak point either at 75 of blade span or at local elements for reducing the number of cumbersome analyses of local elemental reynolds numbers it is recommended that the bemt modeling by the use of the first set of reynolds numbers to be the best representative of the whole blade length furthermore tidal turbine performance depends on the ncrit parameter which is better to be considered at low values ncrit 1 through the generation of hydrodynamic coefficients for not exaggerating the power coefficient prediction the circular part that connects the hub with the blade sections must not be included through the integration limits based on the proper selection of reynolds number and ncrit parameter the present bem model showed a notable superiority over serg tidal model emphasizing the

21983,numerical simulations of two degree of freedom flow induced vibration of three elastically mounted tandem cylinders are performed for a low reynolds number of re 150 the spacing ratio l d is varied from 2 to 5 where l is the center to center between the cylinders and d is the cylinder diameter and the reduced velocity v r is varied from 3 to 14 the results show a typical vortex induced vibration response of the upstream cylinder except for those at l d 2 where the response amplitudes are about twice those of the single cylinder both the midstream and downstream cylinders have large response amplitudes at all the examined spacing ratios depending on the flow interferences among three cylinders the large amplitudes at high reduced velocities are contributed to the gap flow mechanism in the proximity regime and wake induced vibration mechanism in the co shedding regime respectively the periodic beating phenomenon occurs on both the midstream and downstream cylinders and the range of v r for beating phenomenon increases with l d depending on the spacing ratios and reduced velocities six different flow regimes are identified single bluff body flow alternating shear layer reattachment flow deflected gap flow two parallel vortex streets with co shedding flow chaotic wake and 2s wake flow keywords flow induced vibration three tandem cylinders spacing ratio vibration response flow pattern 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures has been investigated extensively due to its importance in offshore and ocean engineering applications such as offshore wind turbine foundations mooring lines marine risers and pipelines etc a comprehensive understanding of the effects of mass ratio reduced velocity degree of freedom damping ratio and reynolds number on the dynamic responses and flow behavior of an isolated elastically mounted cylinder has been achieved in literatures feng 1968 khalak and williamson 1996 1999 govardhan and williamson 2000 sarpkaya 2004 jauvtis and williamson 2004 singh and mittal 2005 prasanth et al 2006 williamson and govardhan 2008 compared to the viv of an isolated cylinder flow induced vibration of multiple tandem cylinders is much more complicated due to the strong flow interferences among the cylinders especially when the cylinders are in a close proximity most of the previous investigations were focused on the vibration response and wake interference of two tandem cylinders undergoing flow induced vibrations either in the cross flow direction or in both the cross flow and in line flow directions borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 assi et al 2010 2013 bearman 2011 huera huarte and bearman 2011 bao et al 2012 huang and herfjord 2013 assi 2014 several experimental investigations were performed for flow induced vibration of one downstream cylinder in the cross flow directions in the wake of an upstream stationary cylinder at subcritical reynolds numbers hover and triantafyllou 2001 showed that different from the case of an isolated cylinder the vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder remain large at high reduced velocities assi et al 2010 found that a typical wake induced vibration wiv response for two tandem cylinders which is characterized by the build up of amplitude persisting to high reduced velocities wiv is excited by not only the vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder itself but also the dynamic effects of the upstream wake depending on the spacing ratios and reduced velocities huera huarte and bearman 2011 proposed three response regimes viv wiv and combination of both for two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement numerous numerical studies have also been performed to illustrate the effect of spacing ratios and reduced velocities on the flow induced vibrations of two tandem cylinders at low reynolds numbers mittal and kumar 2001 pointed out that at a spacing ratio l d 5 5 where l is the center to center spacing between two cylinders and d is the diameter of the cylinder the response of the downstream cylinder is more complicated than that of an isolated cylinder with large vibration amplitude prasanth and mittal 2009 reported that the maximum vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder is about 1 1d borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 concluded that the vortex shedding mechanism is responsible for initiating viv of the downstream cylinder with small vibration amplitudes while the large transverse gap between the cylinders is a crucial factor to trigger the gap flow mechanism that leads to the large vibration amplitudes carmo et al 2011 and carmo et al 2013 found that at small spacing ratio l d the vibration of the downstream cylinder synchronizes with the vortex shedding of the upstream cylinder resulting in increase in the vibration amplitude at high reduced velocities griffith et al 2017 numerically studied the dynamic response of two elastically mounted cylinders in tandem and staggered arrangement they found seven major modes of flow response depending on the influencing strength of the gap flow and the symmetricity of the vibration a number of numerical studies have also been performed on flow induced vibration of multiple cylinders in a square configuration zhao and cheng 2012 han et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 gao et al 2019 in the study of gao et al 2019 special attention was paid on the effects of incident angle 0 α 45 on the vortex induced vibration of the four cylinder array at a constant spacing ratio l d 5 the results showed that the incident angle has a significant effect on the vibration amplitudes force coefficients and orbital responses of four cylinders as well as the wake flow patterns while flow induced vibration of two tandem cylinders has been studied extensively much less attention has been paid to the response of three tandem cylinders in fluid flow a numerical study by yu et al 2016 shows a significant increase in the streamwise vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders compared with that of a single cylinder chen et al 2018 demonstrated that two different vibration mechanisms i e wake induced galloping for l d 1 2 and vortex induced vibration for l d 1 5 are responsible for the large vibration amplitudes occurred at high reduced velocities shaaban and mohany 2018 performed a numerical investigation on the flow induced vibration of three unevenly spaced in line cylinders and suggested that the varying phase between the lift force and the displacement is responsible for the high transverse vibration amplitude at high reduced velocities the previously mentioned experimental and numerical investigations of flow induced vibration of three tandem cylinders are mostly focused on the case of three cylinders with free vibration in the cross flow direction the principle aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of spacing ratios and reduced velocities on two degree of freedom flow induced vibration of three tandem cylinders in both transverse and streamwise directions at low reynolds number the mechanisms for the large amplitude vibration at high reduced velocities and beating phenomenon of the midstream and downstream cylinders are discovered the rest of the paper is structured as follows numerical methods are described in section 2 the numerical results of for the flow induced vibration of three tandem cylinders are discussed in section 3 and conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations the flow around the three cylinders is simulated by solving the unsteady two dimensional incompressible navier stokes n s equations which are expressed as 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j 2 u i x i 0 where x i is the coordinate u i is the fluid velocity in the x i direction t is the time ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure and ν is the kinematic viscosity the motions in the streamwise and transverse directions of each elastically mounted cylinder are predicted by solving the equations of motion 3 m x c x k x f d t 4 m y c y k y f l t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness of each cylinder respectively x x x and y y y represent the streamwise and transverse accelerations velocities displacements respectively f d and f l are the fluid force on the cylinder in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively the two dimensional n s equations are solved by the open source field operation and manipulation openfoam the finite volume method fvm is applied and pressure velocity coupling is based on the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso method and the simple algorithm the over pimple dym foam solver is adopted to solve the moving mesh in the present study the cell limited gauss linear scheme is applied to discretize the convection terms while the gauss linear scheme is used to discretize the laplacian and pressure terms the euler implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretization the motion equations of the three elastically mounted cylinders are solved by the newmark β method the overset grid method is used to capture the 2 dof motion of the three cylinders two types of grids such as the background grid and the body grid are used to discrete the flow field where the background grid is generated to discretize the whole flow domain and the body fitted grid dealing with the motion of the cylinders is generated on top of the background mesh three sub steps such as hole cutting fringe search and donor search are required to generate the communicating information harimi and saghafian 2012 ye and wan 2017 chen et al 2019 the gird cells lying inside the three cylinders are deactivated as hole cells as shown in fig 1 b a part of background mesh inside the cylinders is blanked out the interpolation algorithm is applied to achieve the data transition between the background grid and the body grid in the overlapping region for instance the fringe cells surrounding the hole are used to exchange the flow information between component meshes and the donor cells provide information used for interpolation the velocity pressure and turbulent variables at the fringe cells are obtained from the interpolation of the donors 2 2 computational domain and boundary condition the diameter of the cylinder is d 0 01 mm and a 40d 70d rectangular computational domain is used for the viv of three tandem circular cylinders as shown in fig 1 the upstream midstream and downstream cylinders are labeled as c1 c2 and c3 respectively the coordinate origin 0 0 is at the center of c1 the inlet boundary is 20d upstream from c1 the outlet boundary is 50d downstream from c1 the width of the domain in the cross flow direction is 40d where the top and bottom boundaries are 20d away from the cylinders the same as those in the references zhao et al 2012 zhao 2015 zhao et al 2012 simulated viv of a cylinder between two lateral side boundaries and found that the two side boundaries have little effect on the response if the distance between them is greater than 20d zhao 2015 further pointed that the effect of the computational domain width of 40d on the response of the cylinder undergoing viv in a spanwise shear flow could be negligibly weak at the inlet boundary the flow velocity is set as u i u 0 01 m s in the streamwise direction and u j 0 in the transverse direction where u is the free stream velocity the viscosity of the fluid is 1 10 6 m2 s corresponding a reynolds number of re 150 which has been widely adopted in the previous numerical studies for vortex induced vibrations of a single cylinder and multiple cylinders carmo et al 2011 bao et al 2012 zhao 2013 han et al 2015 shaaban and mohany 2018 it is expected that the present two dimensional numerical study could improve the understanding of the effect of spacing ratios and reduced velocities on the dynamic responses and vortex shedding modes for three tandem cylinders and provide some database for the numerical validation of flow induced vibration of multiple cylinders the two dimensional numerical results could also give guidance for the further investigation on three dimensional simulations of multiple cylinders encountered in practical offshore and ocean engineering applications the reduced velocity is varied by changing the stiffness of the cylinders the pressure and the normal gradient of the velocity are set to zero u i y 0 u j x 0 and p 0 on the outlet boundary symmetry condition is employed on the top and bottom boundaries and no slip condition is applied on the surfaces of three tandem cylinders the overset grid system for three tandem cylinders and the grid mesh around the cylinder surface are shown in fig 1 b as pointed by park and lee 2014 due to the regular vortex shedding parallel to the cylinder axis the three dimensionality was relatively weak in the near wake region behind a two dimensional cylinder the effects of the boundary layer flows from the ends of the three tandem cylinders could be ignored in the present two dimensional numerical study on the other hand the distance between the top and bottom boundaries is 40d in the present study which has been found to be large enough to ignore the effect of boundary layer flow in the reported numerical studies zhao et al 2012 zhao 2015 the mass ratio is chosen to be m 2 0 and the damping coefficient for each cylinder is set to be zero the reduced velocity v r u f n d is varied from 3 to 14 by changing the natural frequency f n is the structural natural frequency the center to center spacing ratio between two adjacent cylinders is chosen to be l d 2 3 4 and 5 2 3 validation of the numerical model both mesh and time step dependency studies are performed for viv of an isolated cylinder to ensure the results are convergent in order to ensure the numerical accuracy of the numerical model the computational mesh size around the cylinder surfaces is chosen based on a mesh dependency study 2 dof viv of an isolated cylinder at re 150 and v r 5 0 is simulated using three different meshes with different node numbers on the cylinder surface referred to as coarse mesh m1 medium mesh m2 and fine mesh m3 respectively similar to the study of tong et al 2015 the three meshes differ from each other not only in the mesh density near the cylinder surface but also in the wake region where the element numbers for both the background grid and body grid are also changed as well as the nodes along the circumference and radial directions of the cylinder surface the calculated non dimensional transverse and streamwise vibration amplitudes and force coefficients for re 150 and v r 5 from the three meshes are compared with published data in table 1 while the effect of the time step on the numerical results is shown in table 1 fig 2 shows the comparison of the response amplitude and force coefficients calculated from overset mesh mesh 2 in the whole lock in regime with published results obtained from the dynamic mesh x m a x d and y m a x d are the non dimensional maximum vibration amplitudes in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively c d and c l are the mean drag coefficient and root mean square lift coefficient respectively the drag and lift coefficients are defined as 5 c d 2 f d ρ d u 2 6 c l 2 f l ρ d u 2 as shown in table 1 and fig 2 the maximum discrepancies in the non dimensional streamwise and transverse vibration amplitudes x m a x d and y m a x d obtained from the coarse mesh m1 and medium mesh m2 are 1 6 and 0 8 respectively and the discrepancies in x m a x d and y m a x d are reduced to only 0 63 and 0 32 between the results of medium and fine meshes the maximum transverse vibration amplitude obtained from the medium mesh is in good agreement with the published results carmo et al 2011 bao et al 2012 zhao 2013 han et al 2015 shaaban and mohany 2018 gao et al 2019 the maximum discrepancies between m2 and the results of bao et al 2012 and han et al 2015 are 0 49 and 1 3 respectively the discrepancies in the values of c d and c l between m1 and m2 are 0 93 and 1 3 respectively whereas the discrepancies are reduced to only 0 2 and 0 64 between m2 and m3 respectively the values of c d and c l obtained from the medium mesh are in consistent with the reported results bao et al 2012 zhao 2013 gao et al 2019 where the discrepancies between the present study and bao et al 2012 are about 0 1 and 0 32 respectively the results indicate that the numerical model with the medium mesh m2 is dense enough to resolve all the important flow features and provide an acceptable accuracy for fiv of three tandem cylinders the time step dependency study is conducted by conducting simulation of 2 dof viv of a single cylinder with m2 at re 150 and v r 5 0 using three non dimensional time steps δtu d 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 and the results are shown in table 2 which δt is the computational time step the maximum difference in x m a x d between δtu d 0 02 and 0 01 is 1 55 and decreases to 0 94 when δtu d decreases to 0 005 moreover similar trends are observed in the values of y m a x d c d and c l with variations of non dimensional time step sizes the non dimensional time step size δtu d 0 01 is sufficient for the accuracy of the present simulation to further validate the numerical models numerical simulations on 2 dof viv of two tandem cylinders with the medium mesh m2 are performed at re 150 and l d 5 fig 3 shows the comparisons of the vibration amplitudes and force coefficients obtained from the present simulations and published results both the streamwise and transverse vibration amplitudes show good agreements with those in bao et al 2012 and yu et al 2016 the present results of mean drag coefficients and root mean square lift coefficients are also in accordance with those reported in bao et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 response amplitudes of three tandem cylinders fig 4 presents the variations of the non dimensional streamwise and transverse amplitudes of three cylinders with the reduced velocities at different spacing ratios the non dimensional amplitudes in the streamwise and transverse directions are defined as a x d x m a x x m i n 2 d and a y d y m a x y m i n 2 d where the subscripts min and max stand for the minimum and maximum vibration displacement respectively to identify the lock in regimes the dominant response vibration frequencies in the streamwise and transverse directions are plotted as functions of reduced velocity in fig 5 the response vibration frequencies are obtained from the fast fourier transform fft of the vibration displacements the non dimensional response vibration frequencies f x f n and f y f n are defined as the ratios of the streamwise and transverse vibration frequencies to the natural frequency respectively for the case of 2 dof viv of an isolated cylinder regardless of the reduced velocities the ratio of the dominant streamwise to the transverse vibration frequencies is approximately 2 in agreement with the study of wang et al 2017 compared with those in the case of an isolated elastically mounted cylinder the fiv amplitudes for three tandem cylinders in both streamwise and transverse directions are increased significantly for all the examined spacing ratios the transverse vibration frequencies of the three cylinders are smaller than the natural frequency in the lock in regime especially for those at a small spacing ratio l d 2 it is plausible to think that the strong influences among the three cylinders reduce the onset of the vibration frequency resulting in more easily motivating the vibrations of the three cylinders than that of a single cylinder which can also be confirmed at high reduced velocities the f y f n increases with spacing ratio however at high reduced velocities v r 9 the transverse response vibration frequencies f y f n of the three cylinders generally increase with reduced velocity except for the downstream cylinder at l d 5 where a sudden drop of f y f n is observed at v r 13 due to the irregular vibration response different from the 2 dof viv of a single cylinder the ratios of the streamwise vibration frequency to the transverse vibration frequency are not always equal to 2 for three tandem cylinders at 4 v r 7 the streamwise response vibration frequencies f x f n for the three tandem cylinders are lower than that of an isolated cylinder for all the examined spacing ratios especially for the midstream and downstream cylinders at small spacing ratio l d 2 the midstream and downstream cylinders experience streamwise responses at low frequencies around 1 5 for 4 v r 5 and decrease to about 1 for 6 v r 9 where the streamwise vibration frequency is synchronized with the natural frequency f n the low component in the streamwise vibration frequency may be due to shielding effect by the upstream cylinder where the flow velocities decrease in the wake of the upstream cylinder when the spacing ratio is sufficient take the case of l d 5 for example the streamwise response vibration frequency of the downstream cylinder f x f n is lower than 1 at 4 v r 8 the low frequency components in the streamwise vibration responses for the midstream and downstream cylinders may be contributed to the effect of the unsteady vortex shedding and synchronized vibrations of the upstream cylinder the streamwise and transverse response amplitudes of the upstream cylinder exhibit similar trends with those of the single cylinder similar to the studies of mittal and kumar 2001 zhao 2013 and zhao and yan 2013 the lock in regime for the upstream cylinder is determined as the range of the reduced velocity where the transverse vibration amplitude is significantly greater than zero as shown in fig 4 at l d 2 and 3 the vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder in the regime of 4 v r 9 is significantly larger than those at other reduced velocities especially for the case of l d 2 where the maximum response amplitudes in both directions are increased significantly and about twice those of a single cylinder respectively on the other and the boundary v r of the lock in regime can be identified by the sudden change of the vibration frequency as shown in fig 5 the response frequency of the upstream cylinder increases slowly with the increasing v r at 4 v r 5 and keep almost constant in the regime of 5 v r 9 therefore the lock in regime for the upstream cylinder is believed to be 4 v r 9 at l d 2 and 3 at most of the examined reduced velocities the response amplitudes for the midstream and downstream cylinders are much larger than those of the upstream cylinder the amplification of the transverse amplitudes of the two downstream cylinders to about 1 3d in the high reduced velocity range 11 v r 14 is similar to the phenomenon observed by prasanth and mittal 2009 and assi 2014 for the case of two tandem cylinders the maximum value of the non dimensional streamwise response amplitude a x d for the downstream cylinder approaches to about 1 1 at l d 3 which is comparable to the transverse response amplitude it is interesting that at large spacing ratio l d 5 and in the high reduced velocity range 11 v r 14 the streamwise response amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders maintain large values of 0 8d and 0 4d respectively at l d 2 and 3 the streamwise response vibration frequency f x f n is twice the transverse response vibration frequency f y f n at high reduced velocities v r 10 time histories of the transverse vibration displacements for the three tandem cylinders at different reduced velocities and spacing ratios are presented in figs 6 7 at l d 2 the transverse vibration amplitudes of the reduced velocities are periodic for all the examined reduced velocities except for v r 8 and 9 where the quasi periodic beating phenomenon is observed from the time histories of the transverse vibration amplitudes for the three cylinders as shown in fig 6 b and c when the beating phenomenon occurs each time history of the transverse vibration displacement comprises multiple frequency components a sudden drop of the vibration amplitude occurs at the end of each beating period similar to the study of voorhees et al 2008 for different parts of the traces the irregularities can be clearly seen in the oscillation amplitude after a few beating periods the amplitude becomes either irregular or even constant for several more cycles with the increase of l d the range of the reduced velocities for the occurrence of beating phenomenon widens at l d 2 the beating period at v r 9 appears to be longer than that at v r 8 with increasing of l d to 4 as shown in fig 7 the range of the beating occurrence extends to 6 v r 13 it is noteworthy that at the low reduced velocities v r 5 the transverse amplitude of the upstream cylinder is higher than those of the midstream and downstream cylinders as 6 v r 7 the transverse amplitude of the midstream cylinder increases to a value greater than those of the upstream and downstream cylinders at high reduced velocities v r 7 the transverse vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder becomes the largest similar phenomenon of switching the largest vibration amplitudes with variation of the reduced velocities among the three cylinders is also observed at l d 3 and 5 the normalized fft spectra of the transverse and streamwise displacements at different spacing ratios are plotted as functions of v r and f f n in figs 8 and 9 respectively each fft spectra is normalized by the magnitude of the largest peak it can be seen that with the increase of l d and at large reduced velocities the fft spectra of the transverse and streamwise displacements of the midstream and downstream cylinders have multiple peak response frequencies at small spacing ratio l d 2 a dominant response frequency is observed from both the spectra of the transverse and streamwise displacements at most of the reduced velocities for all the three cylinders except for those at v r 8 and 9 with the increase of l d unlike the spectrum of the upstream cylinder both the spectra of the transverse displacements of the midstream and downstream cylinders are broadband with multiple peak frequencies especially for the downstream cylinder when l d 3 one dominant peak vibration frequency in the transverse direction is observed for each cylinder at different reduced velocities except for v r 6 and 7 where two peak frequencies are observed for the midstream cylinder and three peaks for the downstream cylinder as l d increases to 4 and 5 multiple peaks are observed from both the spectra of the transverse displacements for the downstream cylinder at a wide range of reduced velocities 6 v r 13 indicating the complex response of the downstream cylinder influenced by the vortices shed from the upstream and midstream cylinders 3 2 force coefficients the mean drag coefficient c d root mean square lift and drag coefficients c l and c d for the three cylinders are plotted as functions of the reduced velocity in figs 10 and 11 respectively the variations of c d c l and c d with v r for the upstream cylinder at different spacing ratios are similar to that of the single cylinder except for l d 2 where the large values of c d and c l are also observed at high reduced velocities due to the shielding effect of the upstream cylinder the c d of the midstream and downstream cylinders are significantly reduced at v r 9 compared with that of a single cylinder the minimum c d of the midstream cylinder is reduced to 0 2 and the maximum c d of the midstream and downstream cylinders are reduced by almost 50 because of the combined effects of the proximity interference and vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder the variations of the c l and c d for the midstream and downstream cylinders are more complex especially for v r 9 the c l of the midstream and downstream cylinders are maintained with large values around 0 5 at high reduced velocities 10 v r 14 for all the examined spacing ratios at large spacing ratios l d 4 and 5 the maximum value of c l for the downstream cylinder decreases to about 40 of the single cylinder moreover it is interesting to note that the root mean square lift coefficient c l on the midstream cylinder c2 is significant large at low reduced velocity v r 3 similar phenomenon is also observed in the viv of two tandem cylinders at l d 4 by bao et al 2012 and zhao 2013 when l d 4 the gap spacing is sufficiently large for the vortex shedding from each cylinder at v r 3 similar to those of stationary cylinders the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder impinge on the midstream cylinder and two parallel rows of vortex streets are observed behind the downstream cylinder the great value of the c l on the midstream cylinder c2 may be caused by the combined influences of the unsteady vortex shedding flow from the upstream cylinder c1 and wake interference with the downstream cylinder c3 different from the case of a single cylinder the variations of the c d of the downstream cylinder exhibit multiple peaks and the downstream cylinder experiences larger values of c d at v r 6 for all the examined spacing ratios comparisons of the present numerical results and those obtained by gao et al 2019 are performed at l d 5 as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the variations of the vibration amplitudes with v r for three tandem cylinders are significantly different from those for the four cylinder arrays in gao et al 2019 where the midstream and downstream cylinders c2 and c3 exhibit much larger amplitudes in both the transverse and streamwise directions especially at high reduced velocities v r 9 for instance the maximum transverse and streamwise vibration amplitudes of the downstream cylinder c3 do not occur at the lock in range of the reduced velocities but approach to about 1 4d and 0 9d at 10 v r 14 moreover the mean drag coefficient c d on the three tandem cylinders appear to be generally smaller than those on four cylinder arrays while the root mean square lift coefficient c l on the three tandem cylinders are smaller than those on four cylinder arrays at v r 8 the correlation coefficient and phase difference between the lift coefficient and the response displacement in the transverse direction for three tandem cylinders at different spacing ratios are shown in fig 13 the definitions of the correlation coefficient and phase difference are defined using the method in zhao et al 2016 and qin et al 2017 the maximum correlation coefficient is defined as 7 r f l y τ y t f l t τ y t 2 1 2 f l t τ 2 1 2 where r f l y is the maximum correlation coefficient τ is the time lag the maximum correlation coefficient reaches a value of 1 as the two signals are in phase with each other similar to the studies of zhao and cheng 2014 and zhao et al 2016 the phase angle φ between the lift coefficient and the displacement is defined as the phase difference between the peak frequency component of the displacement and the lift coefficient at the same frequency which is calculated based on the cross correlation coefficient r f l y as shown in fig 13 similar to the single cylinder the maximum correlation coefficient of the upstream cylinder almost maintains close to 1 at most of the spacing ratios if the harmonic of the lift force and transverse vibration amplitude is in phase or anti phase with each other however the maximum correlation coefficient of the upstream cylinder at small spacing ratio l d 2 is smaller than 1 when the harmonic of the lift force and transverse vibration amplitude is in anti phase the variations of the maximum correlation coefficients with reduced velocities for the midstream and downstream cylinders are much more complex than that of the upstream cylinder especially for the downstream cylinder where the maximum correlation coefficient decreases to about 0 6 at large reduced velocity v r 10 for l d 5 for the upstream cylinder c1 the harmonics of lift coefficient and transverse displacement are in phase φ 0 at v r 7 for l d 2 3 and 5 the transverse vibration frequency is lower than the natural frequency f y f n 1 in consistent with the variation of the response vibration frequency in fig 5 a phase jump occurs when the vibration frequency equals to the natural frequency where the phase angle between the lift coefficient and transverse displacement shifts from 0 to 180 at v r 8 the transverse vibration frequency is larger than the natural frequency f y f n 1 at v r 9 however at l d 4 the harmonics of lift coefficient and transverse displacement are in phase for v r 6 a sudden phase jumps to about φ 150 at v r 7 and then shifts to φ 180 at v r 9 the harmonics of the lift coefficient and transverse displacement of the midstream and downstream cylinders are in phase φ 0 for v r 8 and v r 7 respectively where the transverse vibration frequency is lower than the natural frequency f y f n 1 at small spacing ratios l d 2 and 3 the phase angle φ shifts from 0 to 180 at v r 9 it is interesting to note that different from the cases for the upstream and midstream cylinders the phase angle for the downstream cylinder is smaller than 180 where the phase angle φ shifts to about 120 and 150 at 9 v r 11 for l d 4 and decreases from 180 at v r 9 to 120 at high reduced velocity v r 14 for l d 5 the sudden jump in phase between the lift force and transverse displacement is found to be associated with a change in the direction of mechanical energy transfer blackburn and henderson 1999 carberry et al 2001 and the abrupt switching of the vorticity concentration to the opposite side of the cylinder lu and dalton 1996 in the forced vibration cases however since the motion of the cylinder is intrinsically coupled with the wake structure in the vortex induced vibration cases the phase jump appears to be more complex than the forced vibration the 180 jump in the phase between the lift and transverse displacement of a single cylinder and two cylinders is found to be associated with mode shift in the primary vortex shedding from 2s to 2p mode khalak and williamson 1999 brika and laneville 1992 govardhan and williamson 2000 in the study of prasanth and mittal 2008 they did not observe the change in vortex shedding pattern the phase jump is caused by the changes in the location and value of the maximum suction on the lower and upper surface of the cylinder in the present study of the fiv of three tandem cylinders due to the wake interferences among three cylinders the phase shift between the lift force and transverse displacements is not only caused by the changes in the vortex shedding modes but also the energy transfer between the fluid and the cylinder 3 3 trajectory responses figs 14 15 show the x y trajectories of the three tandem cylinders at different reduced velocities for l d 2 and 4 at small spacing ratio l d 2 and outside the lock in regime the trajectories of the three cylinders resemble the figure of 8 at low reduced velocities 3 v r 5 and high reduced velocities 10 v r 14 where the dominant vibration frequency in the streamwise direction f x is twice of that in the transverse direction f y as shown in fig 5 as v r increases to 6 and 7 the trajectories of the three cylinders change from the figure of 8 to the enclosed loop shape in the lock in regime where the streamwise vibration frequency is the same as that of the transverse vibration frequency when v r further increases to 8 and 9 the x y trajectories appear to be chaotic which contributes to the beating phenomenon and multiple vibration frequencies in both the streamwise and transverse directions at l d 4 the x y trajectories of the three cylinders become much more complicated compared with that at l d 2 with the increase of the reduced velocity the upstream cylinder exhibits different orbital trajectories the figure of 8 shape at 3 v r 6 the chaotic shape at 7 v r 12 and the enclosed loop at v r 13 it is obvious that at low reduced velocities 3 v r 5 similar to the upstream cylinder the x y trajectories of the midstream and downstream cylinders resemble the figure of 8 shape with different vibration amplitudes as 6 v r 13 the x y trajectories of the midstream and downstream cylinders become chaotic with irregular shapes especially for the downstream cylinder as v r further increases to 14 the x y trajectories of the three cylinders become regular with the enclosed loop shapes 3 4 wake flow patterns in general six different wake flow patterns such as a single bluff body flow mode 1 alternating shear layer reattachment flow mode 2 deflected gap flow mode 3 and 2s mode 4 two parallel rows of vortex streets with co shedding flow mode 5 and chaotic wake mode 6 are classified with variation of l d and v r as shown in fig 16 to present these wake flow patterns the instantaneous vorticity contours at different reduced velocities for two typical spacing ratios l d 2 and 4 are presented in figs 17 18 single bluff body vortex shedding mode can only be observed at very low reduced velocity and small spacing ratio as shown in the vorticity contours for v r 3 and l d 2 in fig 17 where the midstream and downstream cylinders are completely immersed in the wake of upstream cylinder because wake vortex shedding only occurs behind the downstream cylinder the drag coefficients on the midstream and downstream cylinders are small and the response amplitudes for the three cylinders are very low with the increase of v r to 4 and 5 the shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder appear to be alternately reattached on the surface of the midstream cylinder two rows of vortices are formed behind the downstream cylinder leading to small transverse vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders as 6 v r 9 the midstream cylinder oscillates away from the flow axes of the upstream and downstream cylinders and the shear layers separated from the upstream and midstream cylinders are deflected to the gaps among the three cylinders as a result part of the incoming flow goes through the gaps and impinged on the midstream and downstream cylinders the irregular wake flow pattern dominated by the gap flow is similar to the case of two staggered stationary cylinders sumner et al 2000 the flow interferences become strong resulting in increase of the vibration amplitudes of the three cylinders which is in consistent with the mechanism for the flow induced vibration of two staggered cylinders proposed by griffith et al 2017 as v r further increases the wake patterns behind the downstream cylinder become more regular and a 2s vortex shedding mode is observed in the wake of the downstream cylinder at 13 v r 14 it is notably that at high reduced velocities v r 10 although the wake flow becomes more regular than those at the lock in regime the vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders are still maintained with large values due to the strong influences of vortex formation through the two gaps when the three cylinders are close to each other when l d increases to 4 the gap spacing is sufficiently large for vortex shedding from the upstream and midstream cylinders at v r 3 the vortices that are shed from the upstream and midstream cylinders impinge on the downstream cylinders and two parallel rows of vortex streets are observed behind the downstream cylinder at 3 v r 5 resulting in small transverse vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders at 6 v r 10 the enhanced interaction among the vortices results in chaotic and complicated wake behind the downstream cylinder and leads to increase of the response amplitudes for the midstream and downstream cylinders as reduced velocity further increases to 11 v r 14 a 2s vortex shedding mode is observed however different from the gap flow mechanism dominated for l d 2 and 3 the mechanism for the large vibration amplitudes existed at high reduced velocities for l d 4 is the wake induced vibration by the incoming vorticity shed from the upstream and midstream cylinders in consistent with the wake induced vibration of two tandem cylinders by assi et al 2010 and huera huarte and bearman 2011 in order to investigate the beating phenomenon the instantaneous vorticity contours at different instants for two typical cases of v r 8 and l d 2 v r 12 and l d 4 are further presented in figs 19 20 where the instants corresponding to the vorticity contours are marked on the time histories of the transverse displacements and lift coefficients it can be seen that for small spacing ratio l d 2 different from the vibration amplitude the lift coefficient of each cylinder behaves irregularly at v r 8 the transverse vibration of the midstream cylinder is almost in anti phase with those of the upstream and downstream cylinders during the time instants from a to d the shear layers separated from the upper and lower side of the upstream cylinder alternately reattach on the midstream cylinder respectively meanwhile the shear layers separated from the midstream cylinder alternately reattach on the downstream cylinders respectively the vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder is always larger than those of the midstream and downstream cylinders when the beating phenomenon occurs during the time instants from e to h it is notably that the vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders are in anti phase with each other a sudden jump of the transverse vibration amplitude occurs for both the midstream and downstream cylinders resulting into the sufficient vertical separations for the occurrence of the deflected gap flows among the three cylinders the complex interactions among the gap flows and three cylinders may trigger the onset of the beating phenomenon different from the case of l d 2 the lift coefficient behaves regularly at v r 12 for large spacing ratio l d 4 and is in anti phase with the transverse vibration amplitude for each cylinder phase lag exists in both the lift coefficients and transverse amplitudes among the three cylinders it is interesting to note that the onset of the beating phenomenon for each cylinder is not at the same instant where a sudden jump of the lift coefficient occurs there is always a phase lag between the vibration amplitudes and lift coefficient for the case of three tandem cylinders on the other hand the increases of the vibration amplitudes for the midstream and downstream cylinders are always occurred at the instants when the positive vortices shed from the frontal cylinder roll up and impinge on the lower side of the rear cylinder for both two cases the transverse vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders are always in anti phase with each other 4 conclusions numerical simulations on two degree of freedom flow induced vibration of three elastically mounted cylinders in tandem configuration are performed at different spacing ratios and reduced velocities the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 compared with those of an isolated elastically mounted cylinders both the streamwise and transverse response amplitudes of the upstream cylinder are increased significantly in the lock in regime and reach to about twice those of the single cylinder at small spacing ratio l d 2 2 different from the upstream cylinder both the midstream and downstream cylinders have much larger response amplitudes than a single cylinder at all the examined spacing ratios response amplitudes remain high at high reduced velocities the gap flow mechanism and wake induced vibration mechanism are found to be contributed to the large response amplitudes in the proximity interference flow regime l d 2 and 3 and co shedding flow regime l d 4 and 5 respectively moreover periodic beating phenomena of the midstream and downstream cylinder occur at all the examined spacing ratios and the range for the occurrence of beating phenomenon is found to increase with l d 3 in the proximity interference flow regime four vortex shedding modes are identified with variations of reduced velocities including a single bluff body flow v r 3 alternating shear layer reattachment flow 4 v r 5 deflected gap flow 6 v r 9 and 2s wake flow 10 v r 14 in the co shedding flow regime vortex shedding is observed behind each cylinder two parallel rows of vortex streets are observed behind the downstream cylinder at 3 v r 5 the interactions among the shed vortices are enhanced with more chaotic and complicated wake behind the downstream cylinder at 6 v r 10 and 2s wake flow mode is observed at 11 v r 14 credit author statement yangyang gao conceptualization

21983,numerical simulations of two degree of freedom flow induced vibration of three elastically mounted tandem cylinders are performed for a low reynolds number of re 150 the spacing ratio l d is varied from 2 to 5 where l is the center to center between the cylinders and d is the cylinder diameter and the reduced velocity v r is varied from 3 to 14 the results show a typical vortex induced vibration response of the upstream cylinder except for those at l d 2 where the response amplitudes are about twice those of the single cylinder both the midstream and downstream cylinders have large response amplitudes at all the examined spacing ratios depending on the flow interferences among three cylinders the large amplitudes at high reduced velocities are contributed to the gap flow mechanism in the proximity regime and wake induced vibration mechanism in the co shedding regime respectively the periodic beating phenomenon occurs on both the midstream and downstream cylinders and the range of v r for beating phenomenon increases with l d depending on the spacing ratios and reduced velocities six different flow regimes are identified single bluff body flow alternating shear layer reattachment flow deflected gap flow two parallel vortex streets with co shedding flow chaotic wake and 2s wake flow keywords flow induced vibration three tandem cylinders spacing ratio vibration response flow pattern 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv of cylindrical structures has been investigated extensively due to its importance in offshore and ocean engineering applications such as offshore wind turbine foundations mooring lines marine risers and pipelines etc a comprehensive understanding of the effects of mass ratio reduced velocity degree of freedom damping ratio and reynolds number on the dynamic responses and flow behavior of an isolated elastically mounted cylinder has been achieved in literatures feng 1968 khalak and williamson 1996 1999 govardhan and williamson 2000 sarpkaya 2004 jauvtis and williamson 2004 singh and mittal 2005 prasanth et al 2006 williamson and govardhan 2008 compared to the viv of an isolated cylinder flow induced vibration of multiple tandem cylinders is much more complicated due to the strong flow interferences among the cylinders especially when the cylinders are in a close proximity most of the previous investigations were focused on the vibration response and wake interference of two tandem cylinders undergoing flow induced vibrations either in the cross flow direction or in both the cross flow and in line flow directions borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 assi et al 2010 2013 bearman 2011 huera huarte and bearman 2011 bao et al 2012 huang and herfjord 2013 assi 2014 several experimental investigations were performed for flow induced vibration of one downstream cylinder in the cross flow directions in the wake of an upstream stationary cylinder at subcritical reynolds numbers hover and triantafyllou 2001 showed that different from the case of an isolated cylinder the vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder remain large at high reduced velocities assi et al 2010 found that a typical wake induced vibration wiv response for two tandem cylinders which is characterized by the build up of amplitude persisting to high reduced velocities wiv is excited by not only the vortex shedding of the downstream cylinder itself but also the dynamic effects of the upstream wake depending on the spacing ratios and reduced velocities huera huarte and bearman 2011 proposed three response regimes viv wiv and combination of both for two flexible cylinders in tandem arrangement numerous numerical studies have also been performed to illustrate the effect of spacing ratios and reduced velocities on the flow induced vibrations of two tandem cylinders at low reynolds numbers mittal and kumar 2001 pointed out that at a spacing ratio l d 5 5 where l is the center to center spacing between two cylinders and d is the diameter of the cylinder the response of the downstream cylinder is more complicated than that of an isolated cylinder with large vibration amplitude prasanth and mittal 2009 reported that the maximum vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder is about 1 1d borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 concluded that the vortex shedding mechanism is responsible for initiating viv of the downstream cylinder with small vibration amplitudes while the large transverse gap between the cylinders is a crucial factor to trigger the gap flow mechanism that leads to the large vibration amplitudes carmo et al 2011 and carmo et al 2013 found that at small spacing ratio l d the vibration of the downstream cylinder synchronizes with the vortex shedding of the upstream cylinder resulting in increase in the vibration amplitude at high reduced velocities griffith et al 2017 numerically studied the dynamic response of two elastically mounted cylinders in tandem and staggered arrangement they found seven major modes of flow response depending on the influencing strength of the gap flow and the symmetricity of the vibration a number of numerical studies have also been performed on flow induced vibration of multiple cylinders in a square configuration zhao and cheng 2012 han et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 gao et al 2019 in the study of gao et al 2019 special attention was paid on the effects of incident angle 0 α 45 on the vortex induced vibration of the four cylinder array at a constant spacing ratio l d 5 the results showed that the incident angle has a significant effect on the vibration amplitudes force coefficients and orbital responses of four cylinders as well as the wake flow patterns while flow induced vibration of two tandem cylinders has been studied extensively much less attention has been paid to the response of three tandem cylinders in fluid flow a numerical study by yu et al 2016 shows a significant increase in the streamwise vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders compared with that of a single cylinder chen et al 2018 demonstrated that two different vibration mechanisms i e wake induced galloping for l d 1 2 and vortex induced vibration for l d 1 5 are responsible for the large vibration amplitudes occurred at high reduced velocities shaaban and mohany 2018 performed a numerical investigation on the flow induced vibration of three unevenly spaced in line cylinders and suggested that the varying phase between the lift force and the displacement is responsible for the high transverse vibration amplitude at high reduced velocities the previously mentioned experimental and numerical investigations of flow induced vibration of three tandem cylinders are mostly focused on the case of three cylinders with free vibration in the cross flow direction the principle aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of spacing ratios and reduced velocities on two degree of freedom flow induced vibration of three tandem cylinders in both transverse and streamwise directions at low reynolds number the mechanisms for the large amplitude vibration at high reduced velocities and beating phenomenon of the midstream and downstream cylinders are discovered the rest of the paper is structured as follows numerical methods are described in section 2 the numerical results of for the flow induced vibration of three tandem cylinders are discussed in section 3 and conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 numerical method 2 1 governing equations the flow around the three cylinders is simulated by solving the unsteady two dimensional incompressible navier stokes n s equations which are expressed as 1 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j 2 u i x i 0 where x i is the coordinate u i is the fluid velocity in the x i direction t is the time ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure and ν is the kinematic viscosity the motions in the streamwise and transverse directions of each elastically mounted cylinder are predicted by solving the equations of motion 3 m x c x k x f d t 4 m y c y k y f l t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness of each cylinder respectively x x x and y y y represent the streamwise and transverse accelerations velocities displacements respectively f d and f l are the fluid force on the cylinder in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively the two dimensional n s equations are solved by the open source field operation and manipulation openfoam the finite volume method fvm is applied and pressure velocity coupling is based on the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso method and the simple algorithm the over pimple dym foam solver is adopted to solve the moving mesh in the present study the cell limited gauss linear scheme is applied to discretize the convection terms while the gauss linear scheme is used to discretize the laplacian and pressure terms the euler implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretization the motion equations of the three elastically mounted cylinders are solved by the newmark β method the overset grid method is used to capture the 2 dof motion of the three cylinders two types of grids such as the background grid and the body grid are used to discrete the flow field where the background grid is generated to discretize the whole flow domain and the body fitted grid dealing with the motion of the cylinders is generated on top of the background mesh three sub steps such as hole cutting fringe search and donor search are required to generate the communicating information harimi and saghafian 2012 ye and wan 2017 chen et al 2019 the gird cells lying inside the three cylinders are deactivated as hole cells as shown in fig 1 b a part of background mesh inside the cylinders is blanked out the interpolation algorithm is applied to achieve the data transition between the background grid and the body grid in the overlapping region for instance the fringe cells surrounding the hole are used to exchange the flow information between component meshes and the donor cells provide information used for interpolation the velocity pressure and turbulent variables at the fringe cells are obtained from the interpolation of the donors 2 2 computational domain and boundary condition the diameter of the cylinder is d 0 01 mm and a 40d 70d rectangular computational domain is used for the viv of three tandem circular cylinders as shown in fig 1 the upstream midstream and downstream cylinders are labeled as c1 c2 and c3 respectively the coordinate origin 0 0 is at the center of c1 the inlet boundary is 20d upstream from c1 the outlet boundary is 50d downstream from c1 the width of the domain in the cross flow direction is 40d where the top and bottom boundaries are 20d away from the cylinders the same as those in the references zhao et al 2012 zhao 2015 zhao et al 2012 simulated viv of a cylinder between two lateral side boundaries and found that the two side boundaries have little effect on the response if the distance between them is greater than 20d zhao 2015 further pointed that the effect of the computational domain width of 40d on the response of the cylinder undergoing viv in a spanwise shear flow could be negligibly weak at the inlet boundary the flow velocity is set as u i u 0 01 m s in the streamwise direction and u j 0 in the transverse direction where u is the free stream velocity the viscosity of the fluid is 1 10 6 m2 s corresponding a reynolds number of re 150 which has been widely adopted in the previous numerical studies for vortex induced vibrations of a single cylinder and multiple cylinders carmo et al 2011 bao et al 2012 zhao 2013 han et al 2015 shaaban and mohany 2018 it is expected that the present two dimensional numerical study could improve the understanding of the effect of spacing ratios and reduced velocities on the dynamic responses and vortex shedding modes for three tandem cylinders and provide some database for the numerical validation of flow induced vibration of multiple cylinders the two dimensional numerical results could also give guidance for the further investigation on three dimensional simulations of multiple cylinders encountered in practical offshore and ocean engineering applications the reduced velocity is varied by changing the stiffness of the cylinders the pressure and the normal gradient of the velocity are set to zero u i y 0 u j x 0 and p 0 on the outlet boundary symmetry condition is employed on the top and bottom boundaries and no slip condition is applied on the surfaces of three tandem cylinders the overset grid system for three tandem cylinders and the grid mesh around the cylinder surface are shown in fig 1 b as pointed by park and lee 2014 due to the regular vortex shedding parallel to the cylinder axis the three dimensionality was relatively weak in the near wake region behind a two dimensional cylinder the effects of the boundary layer flows from the ends of the three tandem cylinders could be ignored in the present two dimensional numerical study on the other hand the distance between the top and bottom boundaries is 40d in the present study which has been found to be large enough to ignore the effect of boundary layer flow in the reported numerical studies zhao et al 2012 zhao 2015 the mass ratio is chosen to be m 2 0 and the damping coefficient for each cylinder is set to be zero the reduced velocity v r u f n d is varied from 3 to 14 by changing the natural frequency f n is the structural natural frequency the center to center spacing ratio between two adjacent cylinders is chosen to be l d 2 3 4 and 5 2 3 validation of the numerical model both mesh and time step dependency studies are performed for viv of an isolated cylinder to ensure the results are convergent in order to ensure the numerical accuracy of the numerical model the computational mesh size around the cylinder surfaces is chosen based on a mesh dependency study 2 dof viv of an isolated cylinder at re 150 and v r 5 0 is simulated using three different meshes with different node numbers on the cylinder surface referred to as coarse mesh m1 medium mesh m2 and fine mesh m3 respectively similar to the study of tong et al 2015 the three meshes differ from each other not only in the mesh density near the cylinder surface but also in the wake region where the element numbers for both the background grid and body grid are also changed as well as the nodes along the circumference and radial directions of the cylinder surface the calculated non dimensional transverse and streamwise vibration amplitudes and force coefficients for re 150 and v r 5 from the three meshes are compared with published data in table 1 while the effect of the time step on the numerical results is shown in table 1 fig 2 shows the comparison of the response amplitude and force coefficients calculated from overset mesh mesh 2 in the whole lock in regime with published results obtained from the dynamic mesh x m a x d and y m a x d are the non dimensional maximum vibration amplitudes in the streamwise and transverse directions respectively c d and c l are the mean drag coefficient and root mean square lift coefficient respectively the drag and lift coefficients are defined as 5 c d 2 f d ρ d u 2 6 c l 2 f l ρ d u 2 as shown in table 1 and fig 2 the maximum discrepancies in the non dimensional streamwise and transverse vibration amplitudes x m a x d and y m a x d obtained from the coarse mesh m1 and medium mesh m2 are 1 6 and 0 8 respectively and the discrepancies in x m a x d and y m a x d are reduced to only 0 63 and 0 32 between the results of medium and fine meshes the maximum transverse vibration amplitude obtained from the medium mesh is in good agreement with the published results carmo et al 2011 bao et al 2012 zhao 2013 han et al 2015 shaaban and mohany 2018 gao et al 2019 the maximum discrepancies between m2 and the results of bao et al 2012 and han et al 2015 are 0 49 and 1 3 respectively the discrepancies in the values of c d and c l between m1 and m2 are 0 93 and 1 3 respectively whereas the discrepancies are reduced to only 0 2 and 0 64 between m2 and m3 respectively the values of c d and c l obtained from the medium mesh are in consistent with the reported results bao et al 2012 zhao 2013 gao et al 2019 where the discrepancies between the present study and bao et al 2012 are about 0 1 and 0 32 respectively the results indicate that the numerical model with the medium mesh m2 is dense enough to resolve all the important flow features and provide an acceptable accuracy for fiv of three tandem cylinders the time step dependency study is conducted by conducting simulation of 2 dof viv of a single cylinder with m2 at re 150 and v r 5 0 using three non dimensional time steps δtu d 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 and the results are shown in table 2 which δt is the computational time step the maximum difference in x m a x d between δtu d 0 02 and 0 01 is 1 55 and decreases to 0 94 when δtu d decreases to 0 005 moreover similar trends are observed in the values of y m a x d c d and c l with variations of non dimensional time step sizes the non dimensional time step size δtu d 0 01 is sufficient for the accuracy of the present simulation to further validate the numerical models numerical simulations on 2 dof viv of two tandem cylinders with the medium mesh m2 are performed at re 150 and l d 5 fig 3 shows the comparisons of the vibration amplitudes and force coefficients obtained from the present simulations and published results both the streamwise and transverse vibration amplitudes show good agreements with those in bao et al 2012 and yu et al 2016 the present results of mean drag coefficients and root mean square lift coefficients are also in accordance with those reported in bao et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 response amplitudes of three tandem cylinders fig 4 presents the variations of the non dimensional streamwise and transverse amplitudes of three cylinders with the reduced velocities at different spacing ratios the non dimensional amplitudes in the streamwise and transverse directions are defined as a x d x m a x x m i n 2 d and a y d y m a x y m i n 2 d where the subscripts min and max stand for the minimum and maximum vibration displacement respectively to identify the lock in regimes the dominant response vibration frequencies in the streamwise and transverse directions are plotted as functions of reduced velocity in fig 5 the response vibration frequencies are obtained from the fast fourier transform fft of the vibration displacements the non dimensional response vibration frequencies f x f n and f y f n are defined as the ratios of the streamwise and transverse vibration frequencies to the natural frequency respectively for the case of 2 dof viv of an isolated cylinder regardless of the reduced velocities the ratio of the dominant streamwise to the transverse vibration frequencies is approximately 2 in agreement with the study of wang et al 2017 compared with those in the case of an isolated elastically mounted cylinder the fiv amplitudes for three tandem cylinders in both streamwise and transverse directions are increased significantly for all the examined spacing ratios the transverse vibration frequencies of the three cylinders are smaller than the natural frequency in the lock in regime especially for those at a small spacing ratio l d 2 it is plausible to think that the strong influences among the three cylinders reduce the onset of the vibration frequency resulting in more easily motivating the vibrations of the three cylinders than that of a single cylinder which can also be confirmed at high reduced velocities the f y f n increases with spacing ratio however at high reduced velocities v r 9 the transverse response vibration frequencies f y f n of the three cylinders generally increase with reduced velocity except for the downstream cylinder at l d 5 where a sudden drop of f y f n is observed at v r 13 due to the irregular vibration response different from the 2 dof viv of a single cylinder the ratios of the streamwise vibration frequency to the transverse vibration frequency are not always equal to 2 for three tandem cylinders at 4 v r 7 the streamwise response vibration frequencies f x f n for the three tandem cylinders are lower than that of an isolated cylinder for all the examined spacing ratios especially for the midstream and downstream cylinders at small spacing ratio l d 2 the midstream and downstream cylinders experience streamwise responses at low frequencies around 1 5 for 4 v r 5 and decrease to about 1 for 6 v r 9 where the streamwise vibration frequency is synchronized with the natural frequency f n the low component in the streamwise vibration frequency may be due to shielding effect by the upstream cylinder where the flow velocities decrease in the wake of the upstream cylinder when the spacing ratio is sufficient take the case of l d 5 for example the streamwise response vibration frequency of the downstream cylinder f x f n is lower than 1 at 4 v r 8 the low frequency components in the streamwise vibration responses for the midstream and downstream cylinders may be contributed to the effect of the unsteady vortex shedding and synchronized vibrations of the upstream cylinder the streamwise and transverse response amplitudes of the upstream cylinder exhibit similar trends with those of the single cylinder similar to the studies of mittal and kumar 2001 zhao 2013 and zhao and yan 2013 the lock in regime for the upstream cylinder is determined as the range of the reduced velocity where the transverse vibration amplitude is significantly greater than zero as shown in fig 4 at l d 2 and 3 the vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder in the regime of 4 v r 9 is significantly larger than those at other reduced velocities especially for the case of l d 2 where the maximum response amplitudes in both directions are increased significantly and about twice those of a single cylinder respectively on the other and the boundary v r of the lock in regime can be identified by the sudden change of the vibration frequency as shown in fig 5 the response frequency of the upstream cylinder increases slowly with the increasing v r at 4 v r 5 and keep almost constant in the regime of 5 v r 9 therefore the lock in regime for the upstream cylinder is believed to be 4 v r 9 at l d 2 and 3 at most of the examined reduced velocities the response amplitudes for the midstream and downstream cylinders are much larger than those of the upstream cylinder the amplification of the transverse amplitudes of the two downstream cylinders to about 1 3d in the high reduced velocity range 11 v r 14 is similar to the phenomenon observed by prasanth and mittal 2009 and assi 2014 for the case of two tandem cylinders the maximum value of the non dimensional streamwise response amplitude a x d for the downstream cylinder approaches to about 1 1 at l d 3 which is comparable to the transverse response amplitude it is interesting that at large spacing ratio l d 5 and in the high reduced velocity range 11 v r 14 the streamwise response amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders maintain large values of 0 8d and 0 4d respectively at l d 2 and 3 the streamwise response vibration frequency f x f n is twice the transverse response vibration frequency f y f n at high reduced velocities v r 10 time histories of the transverse vibration displacements for the three tandem cylinders at different reduced velocities and spacing ratios are presented in figs 6 7 at l d 2 the transverse vibration amplitudes of the reduced velocities are periodic for all the examined reduced velocities except for v r 8 and 9 where the quasi periodic beating phenomenon is observed from the time histories of the transverse vibration amplitudes for the three cylinders as shown in fig 6 b and c when the beating phenomenon occurs each time history of the transverse vibration displacement comprises multiple frequency components a sudden drop of the vibration amplitude occurs at the end of each beating period similar to the study of voorhees et al 2008 for different parts of the traces the irregularities can be clearly seen in the oscillation amplitude after a few beating periods the amplitude becomes either irregular or even constant for several more cycles with the increase of l d the range of the reduced velocities for the occurrence of beating phenomenon widens at l d 2 the beating period at v r 9 appears to be longer than that at v r 8 with increasing of l d to 4 as shown in fig 7 the range of the beating occurrence extends to 6 v r 13 it is noteworthy that at the low reduced velocities v r 5 the transverse amplitude of the upstream cylinder is higher than those of the midstream and downstream cylinders as 6 v r 7 the transverse amplitude of the midstream cylinder increases to a value greater than those of the upstream and downstream cylinders at high reduced velocities v r 7 the transverse vibration amplitude of the downstream cylinder becomes the largest similar phenomenon of switching the largest vibration amplitudes with variation of the reduced velocities among the three cylinders is also observed at l d 3 and 5 the normalized fft spectra of the transverse and streamwise displacements at different spacing ratios are plotted as functions of v r and f f n in figs 8 and 9 respectively each fft spectra is normalized by the magnitude of the largest peak it can be seen that with the increase of l d and at large reduced velocities the fft spectra of the transverse and streamwise displacements of the midstream and downstream cylinders have multiple peak response frequencies at small spacing ratio l d 2 a dominant response frequency is observed from both the spectra of the transverse and streamwise displacements at most of the reduced velocities for all the three cylinders except for those at v r 8 and 9 with the increase of l d unlike the spectrum of the upstream cylinder both the spectra of the transverse displacements of the midstream and downstream cylinders are broadband with multiple peak frequencies especially for the downstream cylinder when l d 3 one dominant peak vibration frequency in the transverse direction is observed for each cylinder at different reduced velocities except for v r 6 and 7 where two peak frequencies are observed for the midstream cylinder and three peaks for the downstream cylinder as l d increases to 4 and 5 multiple peaks are observed from both the spectra of the transverse displacements for the downstream cylinder at a wide range of reduced velocities 6 v r 13 indicating the complex response of the downstream cylinder influenced by the vortices shed from the upstream and midstream cylinders 3 2 force coefficients the mean drag coefficient c d root mean square lift and drag coefficients c l and c d for the three cylinders are plotted as functions of the reduced velocity in figs 10 and 11 respectively the variations of c d c l and c d with v r for the upstream cylinder at different spacing ratios are similar to that of the single cylinder except for l d 2 where the large values of c d and c l are also observed at high reduced velocities due to the shielding effect of the upstream cylinder the c d of the midstream and downstream cylinders are significantly reduced at v r 9 compared with that of a single cylinder the minimum c d of the midstream cylinder is reduced to 0 2 and the maximum c d of the midstream and downstream cylinders are reduced by almost 50 because of the combined effects of the proximity interference and vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder the variations of the c l and c d for the midstream and downstream cylinders are more complex especially for v r 9 the c l of the midstream and downstream cylinders are maintained with large values around 0 5 at high reduced velocities 10 v r 14 for all the examined spacing ratios at large spacing ratios l d 4 and 5 the maximum value of c l for the downstream cylinder decreases to about 40 of the single cylinder moreover it is interesting to note that the root mean square lift coefficient c l on the midstream cylinder c2 is significant large at low reduced velocity v r 3 similar phenomenon is also observed in the viv of two tandem cylinders at l d 4 by bao et al 2012 and zhao 2013 when l d 4 the gap spacing is sufficiently large for the vortex shedding from each cylinder at v r 3 similar to those of stationary cylinders the vortices shed from the upstream cylinder impinge on the midstream cylinder and two parallel rows of vortex streets are observed behind the downstream cylinder the great value of the c l on the midstream cylinder c2 may be caused by the combined influences of the unsteady vortex shedding flow from the upstream cylinder c1 and wake interference with the downstream cylinder c3 different from the case of a single cylinder the variations of the c d of the downstream cylinder exhibit multiple peaks and the downstream cylinder experiences larger values of c d at v r 6 for all the examined spacing ratios comparisons of the present numerical results and those obtained by gao et al 2019 are performed at l d 5 as shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the variations of the vibration amplitudes with v r for three tandem cylinders are significantly different from those for the four cylinder arrays in gao et al 2019 where the midstream and downstream cylinders c2 and c3 exhibit much larger amplitudes in both the transverse and streamwise directions especially at high reduced velocities v r 9 for instance the maximum transverse and streamwise vibration amplitudes of the downstream cylinder c3 do not occur at the lock in range of the reduced velocities but approach to about 1 4d and 0 9d at 10 v r 14 moreover the mean drag coefficient c d on the three tandem cylinders appear to be generally smaller than those on four cylinder arrays while the root mean square lift coefficient c l on the three tandem cylinders are smaller than those on four cylinder arrays at v r 8 the correlation coefficient and phase difference between the lift coefficient and the response displacement in the transverse direction for three tandem cylinders at different spacing ratios are shown in fig 13 the definitions of the correlation coefficient and phase difference are defined using the method in zhao et al 2016 and qin et al 2017 the maximum correlation coefficient is defined as 7 r f l y τ y t f l t τ y t 2 1 2 f l t τ 2 1 2 where r f l y is the maximum correlation coefficient τ is the time lag the maximum correlation coefficient reaches a value of 1 as the two signals are in phase with each other similar to the studies of zhao and cheng 2014 and zhao et al 2016 the phase angle φ between the lift coefficient and the displacement is defined as the phase difference between the peak frequency component of the displacement and the lift coefficient at the same frequency which is calculated based on the cross correlation coefficient r f l y as shown in fig 13 similar to the single cylinder the maximum correlation coefficient of the upstream cylinder almost maintains close to 1 at most of the spacing ratios if the harmonic of the lift force and transverse vibration amplitude is in phase or anti phase with each other however the maximum correlation coefficient of the upstream cylinder at small spacing ratio l d 2 is smaller than 1 when the harmonic of the lift force and transverse vibration amplitude is in anti phase the variations of the maximum correlation coefficients with reduced velocities for the midstream and downstream cylinders are much more complex than that of the upstream cylinder especially for the downstream cylinder where the maximum correlation coefficient decreases to about 0 6 at large reduced velocity v r 10 for l d 5 for the upstream cylinder c1 the harmonics of lift coefficient and transverse displacement are in phase φ 0 at v r 7 for l d 2 3 and 5 the transverse vibration frequency is lower than the natural frequency f y f n 1 in consistent with the variation of the response vibration frequency in fig 5 a phase jump occurs when the vibration frequency equals to the natural frequency where the phase angle between the lift coefficient and transverse displacement shifts from 0 to 180 at v r 8 the transverse vibration frequency is larger than the natural frequency f y f n 1 at v r 9 however at l d 4 the harmonics of lift coefficient and transverse displacement are in phase for v r 6 a sudden phase jumps to about φ 150 at v r 7 and then shifts to φ 180 at v r 9 the harmonics of the lift coefficient and transverse displacement of the midstream and downstream cylinders are in phase φ 0 for v r 8 and v r 7 respectively where the transverse vibration frequency is lower than the natural frequency f y f n 1 at small spacing ratios l d 2 and 3 the phase angle φ shifts from 0 to 180 at v r 9 it is interesting to note that different from the cases for the upstream and midstream cylinders the phase angle for the downstream cylinder is smaller than 180 where the phase angle φ shifts to about 120 and 150 at 9 v r 11 for l d 4 and decreases from 180 at v r 9 to 120 at high reduced velocity v r 14 for l d 5 the sudden jump in phase between the lift force and transverse displacement is found to be associated with a change in the direction of mechanical energy transfer blackburn and henderson 1999 carberry et al 2001 and the abrupt switching of the vorticity concentration to the opposite side of the cylinder lu and dalton 1996 in the forced vibration cases however since the motion of the cylinder is intrinsically coupled with the wake structure in the vortex induced vibration cases the phase jump appears to be more complex than the forced vibration the 180 jump in the phase between the lift and transverse displacement of a single cylinder and two cylinders is found to be associated with mode shift in the primary vortex shedding from 2s to 2p mode khalak and williamson 1999 brika and laneville 1992 govardhan and williamson 2000 in the study of prasanth and mittal 2008 they did not observe the change in vortex shedding pattern the phase jump is caused by the changes in the location and value of the maximum suction on the lower and upper surface of the cylinder in the present study of the fiv of three tandem cylinders due to the wake interferences among three cylinders the phase shift between the lift force and transverse displacements is not only caused by the changes in the vortex shedding modes but also the energy transfer between the fluid and the cylinder 3 3 trajectory responses figs 14 15 show the x y trajectories of the three tandem cylinders at different reduced velocities for l d 2 and 4 at small spacing ratio l d 2 and outside the lock in regime the trajectories of the three cylinders resemble the figure of 8 at low reduced velocities 3 v r 5 and high reduced velocities 10 v r 14 where the dominant vibration frequency in the streamwise direction f x is twice of that in the transverse direction f y as shown in fig 5 as v r increases to 6 and 7 the trajectories of the three cylinders change from the figure of 8 to the enclosed loop shape in the lock in regime where the streamwise vibration frequency is the same as that of the transverse vibration frequency when v r further increases to 8 and 9 the x y trajectories appear to be chaotic which contributes to the beating phenomenon and multiple vibration frequencies in both the streamwise and transverse directions at l d 4 the x y trajectories of the three cylinders become much more complicated compared with that at l d 2 with the increase of the reduced velocity the upstream cylinder exhibits different orbital trajectories the figure of 8 shape at 3 v r 6 the chaotic shape at 7 v r 12 and the enclosed loop at v r 13 it is obvious that at low reduced velocities 3 v r 5 similar to the upstream cylinder the x y trajectories of the midstream and downstream cylinders resemble the figure of 8 shape with different vibration amplitudes as 6 v r 13 the x y trajectories of the midstream and downstream cylinders become chaotic with irregular shapes especially for the downstream cylinder as v r further increases to 14 the x y trajectories of the three cylinders become regular with the enclosed loop shapes 3 4 wake flow patterns in general six different wake flow patterns such as a single bluff body flow mode 1 alternating shear layer reattachment flow mode 2 deflected gap flow mode 3 and 2s mode 4 two parallel rows of vortex streets with co shedding flow mode 5 and chaotic wake mode 6 are classified with variation of l d and v r as shown in fig 16 to present these wake flow patterns the instantaneous vorticity contours at different reduced velocities for two typical spacing ratios l d 2 and 4 are presented in figs 17 18 single bluff body vortex shedding mode can only be observed at very low reduced velocity and small spacing ratio as shown in the vorticity contours for v r 3 and l d 2 in fig 17 where the midstream and downstream cylinders are completely immersed in the wake of upstream cylinder because wake vortex shedding only occurs behind the downstream cylinder the drag coefficients on the midstream and downstream cylinders are small and the response amplitudes for the three cylinders are very low with the increase of v r to 4 and 5 the shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder appear to be alternately reattached on the surface of the midstream cylinder two rows of vortices are formed behind the downstream cylinder leading to small transverse vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders as 6 v r 9 the midstream cylinder oscillates away from the flow axes of the upstream and downstream cylinders and the shear layers separated from the upstream and midstream cylinders are deflected to the gaps among the three cylinders as a result part of the incoming flow goes through the gaps and impinged on the midstream and downstream cylinders the irregular wake flow pattern dominated by the gap flow is similar to the case of two staggered stationary cylinders sumner et al 2000 the flow interferences become strong resulting in increase of the vibration amplitudes of the three cylinders which is in consistent with the mechanism for the flow induced vibration of two staggered cylinders proposed by griffith et al 2017 as v r further increases the wake patterns behind the downstream cylinder become more regular and a 2s vortex shedding mode is observed in the wake of the downstream cylinder at 13 v r 14 it is notably that at high reduced velocities v r 10 although the wake flow becomes more regular than those at the lock in regime the vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders are still maintained with large values due to the strong influences of vortex formation through the two gaps when the three cylinders are close to each other when l d increases to 4 the gap spacing is sufficiently large for vortex shedding from the upstream and midstream cylinders at v r 3 the vortices that are shed from the upstream and midstream cylinders impinge on the downstream cylinders and two parallel rows of vortex streets are observed behind the downstream cylinder at 3 v r 5 resulting in small transverse vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders at 6 v r 10 the enhanced interaction among the vortices results in chaotic and complicated wake behind the downstream cylinder and leads to increase of the response amplitudes for the midstream and downstream cylinders as reduced velocity further increases to 11 v r 14 a 2s vortex shedding mode is observed however different from the gap flow mechanism dominated for l d 2 and 3 the mechanism for the large vibration amplitudes existed at high reduced velocities for l d 4 is the wake induced vibration by the incoming vorticity shed from the upstream and midstream cylinders in consistent with the wake induced vibration of two tandem cylinders by assi et al 2010 and huera huarte and bearman 2011 in order to investigate the beating phenomenon the instantaneous vorticity contours at different instants for two typical cases of v r 8 and l d 2 v r 12 and l d 4 are further presented in figs 19 20 where the instants corresponding to the vorticity contours are marked on the time histories of the transverse displacements and lift coefficients it can be seen that for small spacing ratio l d 2 different from the vibration amplitude the lift coefficient of each cylinder behaves irregularly at v r 8 the transverse vibration of the midstream cylinder is almost in anti phase with those of the upstream and downstream cylinders during the time instants from a to d the shear layers separated from the upper and lower side of the upstream cylinder alternately reattach on the midstream cylinder respectively meanwhile the shear layers separated from the midstream cylinder alternately reattach on the downstream cylinders respectively the vibration amplitude of the upstream cylinder is always larger than those of the midstream and downstream cylinders when the beating phenomenon occurs during the time instants from e to h it is notably that the vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders are in anti phase with each other a sudden jump of the transverse vibration amplitude occurs for both the midstream and downstream cylinders resulting into the sufficient vertical separations for the occurrence of the deflected gap flows among the three cylinders the complex interactions among the gap flows and three cylinders may trigger the onset of the beating phenomenon different from the case of l d 2 the lift coefficient behaves regularly at v r 12 for large spacing ratio l d 4 and is in anti phase with the transverse vibration amplitude for each cylinder phase lag exists in both the lift coefficients and transverse amplitudes among the three cylinders it is interesting to note that the onset of the beating phenomenon for each cylinder is not at the same instant where a sudden jump of the lift coefficient occurs there is always a phase lag between the vibration amplitudes and lift coefficient for the case of three tandem cylinders on the other hand the increases of the vibration amplitudes for the midstream and downstream cylinders are always occurred at the instants when the positive vortices shed from the frontal cylinder roll up and impinge on the lower side of the rear cylinder for both two cases the transverse vibration amplitudes of the midstream and downstream cylinders are always in anti phase with each other 4 conclusions numerical simulations on two degree of freedom flow induced vibration of three elastically mounted cylinders in tandem configuration are performed at different spacing ratios and reduced velocities the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 compared with those of an isolated elastically mounted cylinders both the streamwise and transverse response amplitudes of the upstream cylinder are increased significantly in the lock in regime and reach to about twice those of the single cylinder at small spacing ratio l d 2 2 different from the upstream cylinder both the midstream and downstream cylinders have much larger response amplitudes than a single cylinder at all the examined spacing ratios response amplitudes remain high at high reduced velocities the gap flow mechanism and wake induced vibration mechanism are found to be contributed to the large response amplitudes in the proximity interference flow regime l d 2 and 3 and co shedding flow regime l d 4 and 5 respectively moreover periodic beating phenomena of the midstream and downstream cylinder occur at all the examined spacing ratios and the range for the occurrence of beating phenomenon is found to increase with l d 3 in the proximity interference flow regime four vortex shedding modes are identified with variations of reduced velocities including a single bluff body flow v r 3 alternating shear layer reattachment flow 4 v r 5 deflected gap flow 6 v r 9 and 2s wake flow 10 v r 14 in the co shedding flow regime vortex shedding is observed behind each cylinder two parallel rows of vortex streets are observed behind the downstream cylinder at 3 v r 5 the interactions among the shed vortices are enhanced with more chaotic and complicated wake behind the downstream cylinder at 6 v r 10 and 2s wake flow mode is observed at 11 v r 14 credit author statement yangyang gao conceptualization

21984,this paper reports the results of laboratory experiments on the coupling wave flow structure of an oblique internal solitary wave isw and the force it exerts on a submerged slender body in a large stratified fluid flume multiple experimental techniques were used to measure the wave flow field as well as the force on the slender body reasonable analysis reveals the effects of the propagation directions and amplitudes of the oblique isw on the dynamic characteristics of the slender body at different water depths the experimental results show that there is a significant shear effect from the horizontal velocity near the envelope of the isw and sinking upwelling current from the vertical velocity in front of behind the isw packet the direction of the horizontal velocity above below the envelope is consistent with opposite to the propagation velocity of the isw with the former having a larger magnitude the horizontal force depends on the velocity field induced by the oblique isw and the vertical force is determined by the coupling velocity and density field the horizontal and vertical wave forces are calculated using morison s formula corresponding to the respective component of velocity with the vertical dynamic pressure transformed into the reduced gravity keywords stratification fluid oblique internal solitary wave wave flow structure force slender body piv 1 introduction the uncertainty of the propagation direction of surface waves in the sea coupled with the variation of the moving direction of ships means that sailing ships commonly interact with oblique waves the hydrodynamic characteristics of these interactions can become extremely complex haddara 1980 roberts 1982 similarly in the stratified ocean the interactions between a submerged slender body and internal solitary waves isws propagating in the oblique direction are inevitable because of the uncertainty of the propagation direction of isws as well as other important characteristics such as the randomness of nonlinear isws large vertical motion of isopycnic surfaces and strong horizontal shear flow as a result the safety of marine structures and underwater vehicles must be considered according to the available data 61 of 203 submarine accidents reported worldwide may be related to ocean internal waves fang and du 2005 among which the most influential factors are characteristics such as the amplitude induced velocity and propagation direction of isws recently the generation and propagation mechanisms of isws and their interactions with marine structures have received considerable attention theories covering both lee waves lee and beardsley 1974 and internal tidal waves maxworthy 1979 are widely accepted as the mechanism of internal wave generation some studies have focused on the evolution characteristics and mechanism of isws in the real ocean bottom environment including background current steps ridges gentle slopes and porous trapezoidal obstacles cai et al 2008a zhu 2018 du et al 2013 carr et al 2010 cheng et al 2017 further applications to the interaction between internal waves and marine engineering structures have also been investigated chen 2017 wang et al 2018 haibin et al 2016 the theoretical models for the interaction of nonlinear internal waves with a slender body sturova 1994 khabakhpasheva and sturova 1998 have been improved through the development of internal solitary wave theories such as the kdv mkdv and mcc equations and the application of morison s formula segur and hammack 1982 choi and camassa 1996 helfrich and melville 2006 debsarma et al 2010 morison et al 1950 for instance cheng et al 2004 and cai et al 2003 2008b used morison s formula to analyze the characteristics of forces on slender rods due to the current induced by isws and clarified how the shear flow induced by these waves changes the force and torque on vertical piles the conclusion of larger internal wave forces than surface wave forces on small diameter piles was verified yin et al 2016 proposed a numerical method for determining the force in a two layer fluid whereby the vertical force and torque exerted on a slender cylinder located along the propagation direction of the interfacial wave can be efficiently calculated under varying buoyancy scenarios by measuring the force exerted on a slender submerged body by an evolving isw on a gentle slope in a stratified fluid flume du et al 2016 found that nonstationary isws caused by topographic effects can greatly increase the damage to submerged bodies oblique waves on the ocean surface can change the reciprocating motion characteristics of a hull as well as the height of the water surface on its two sides so that the excitation torque imposed by a roll force on the ship from the oblique wave will make its roll movement difficult to control zakaria 2009 thiébot et al 2012 similarly the coupling action of wave flow from nonlinear waves will complicate the hydrodynamic characteristics of slender submerged bodies interacting with oblique isws sundar et al 2005 little progress has been made in the interaction of oblique isws with slender submerged bodies the motivation for this study is to deepen our understanding of the coupling wave flow characteristics of the force on a slender body in the presence of oblique isws by means of multiple techniques including a conductivity probe array piv and a three component micro amplitude force sensor we measure the density fluctuations velocity distribution and force variations for different angles between the horizontal slender submerged body and the propagation direction of isws 2 experimental device and method experiments were conducted in a gravitationally stratified fluid flume as shown in fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system o x y z was defined with the origin set at the rest surface by the right end of the flume and the positive axes of x y z running leftward outward and upward respectively the flume is 1200 cm long 120 cm wide and 100 cm high and its bottom and side walls are made of transparent glass to facilitate observation and measurement the classical double tank method was applied to obtain a two layer fluid of thickness h i and density ρ i with a total depth of h in which i 1 2 represent the upper and lower layers respectively and h h 1 h 2 fang and du 2005 two typical curves of density with respect to water depth with the characteristics of oceanic pycnoclines are shown in fig 2 mixing between the upper fresh and lower salt water layers produces a continuous density distribution structure with a certain thickness at the interface which is called the density pycnocline a rotating shutter isw wave maker and a triangular wedge wave absorber were installed at the right and left ends of the flume respectively to generate high quality isws and efficiently absorb reflected waves wei et al 2014 the test model of a slender submerged body with a cylindrical shape length l 39 cm depth d 5 cm was made of plexiglass material in the following θ denotes the angle between the horizontal slender body and the propagation direction of the isw and z s is the depth of the submerged slender body the structure of the oblique isw encountering the slender submerged body was measured by the conductivity probe array wei et al 2014 firstly the conductivity was converted to an output voltage by an acquisition and amplification circuit and the voltage was converted to a digital signal by an analog to digital a d converter the fluid density to be measured was then determined using an experimental calibration formula finally the evolving structure of the isw was obtained from the conductivity probe array multiple groups of arrays were arranged at the following horizontal positions ι x 525 cm ι ι x 595 cm ι ι ι x 700 cm and iv x 750 cm two groups including one probe were arranged at positions i and iv respectively and the other two groups including seven probes with a vertical spacing of 3 cm were arranged at positions ι ι and ι ι ι respectively the submerged depth of the slender body can be determined by the vertical coordinate of z s the angle θ at which the isw propagates can be adjusted by rotating the model in the plane of o x y the resultant force exerted on the model was measured by the three component force measuring sensor which was connected to the center of symmetry of the model through a sword shaped rigid rod and its magnitude was output in the form of an electrical signal in addition the output signal of the force sensor was calibrated at the beginning of the experiments the flow field of the isw in the o x z plane was measured using two dimensional piv which is made up of laser devices image recording equipment and a data processing workstation for different propagation directions of the isw the velocity distribution at any x z sections of the slender body can be obtained by adjusting the y coordinate of the laser device on the bottom of the flume the image recorder pco2000 dual shutter array ccd with a resolution of 2048 2048 pixels and a rate of 20 frames per second was positioned on the side wall of the flume to record real time images of the flow the recorded images were processed in the workstation using the cross correlation function of a two dimensional fast fourier transform to obtain the distribution of velocity vectors the physical parameters of the system were converted to dimensionless form as follows α a h η z s h c x f x ρ g s h c z f z ρ g s h where a represents the relative amplitude of the isw f x and f z represent the horizontal and vertical forces n on the body respectively and ρ g and s represent the fluid density g cm 3 at the body s depth gravitational acceleration cm s 2 and maximum cross sectional area of the slender body respectively the test cases in table 1 were used to obtain the wave flow fields around the slender body and the associated forces for different angles of θ at position v x 650 cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical method the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the underwater object are mainly divided into three parts dynamic pressure force f p friction force f f and wave force f w li and teng 2002 considering the density stratification and the body s geometric structure in the o x z plane the horizontal and vertical components f x and f z of their resultant force f can be calculated the horizontal force f x in the x direction is composed of three components which are expressed as follows 1 f p x s p n d s x 2 f f x 1 2 c f s ρ v τ 2 τ d s 3 f w x l 1 4 c m ρ π d 2 u t 1 2 c d ρ d u u cos θ d x where n and τ are the unit normal and tangential vectors at the surface of the body respectively p ρ are the dynamic pressure and mean fluid density respectively v τ is the tangential velocity at the surface of the body u is the horizontal velocity induced by the isw c f c m and c d are the coefficients of the friction resistance inertia force and drag force respectively the horizontal velocity along the x axis induced by the oblique isw is always perpendicular to the projection of the slender body on the y axis according to which the wave force of f w x is equivalent to the action on vertical piles by surface waves therefore the projected part of the isw force on the y axis can be approximated by morison s formula which involves both horizontal inertia and horizontal velocity forces li and teng 2002 the vertical force f z in the z direction is also composed of three components 4 f p z δ ρ g δ v 5 f f z 0 6 f w z l 1 4 c m ρ π d 2 w t 1 2 c d ρ d w w d x where δ ρ and δ v represent the density and volume changes of the fluid displaced by the body respectively and w represents the vertical velocity induced by the isw the vertical dynamic pressure on the slender submerged body can be converted into the reduced gravity force because of the vertical change in fluid density the vertical friction force f f z can be ignored because the vertical velocity caused by the isw is much smaller than the horizontal velocity the vertical wave force f w z is still estimated by morison s formula which involves both vertical inertia and vertical velocity forces thus both the horizontal and vertical forces on the slender submerged body from encountering the oblique isw depend on the induced velocity and the varying density fields this analytical method lays a solid foundation for the real measurement and analysis of both the horizontal and vertical components of the resultant force exerted by oblique isws on slender bodies 3 2 flow field of isw the characteristics of the force on a slender submerged body depend on the structure of the isw wave flow field for the typical case of h 1 h 0 125 ρ 1 ρ 2 0 98 and α 0 114 the velocity distribution and wave pattern measured in the o x z plane are presented in fig 3 in this case the isw corresponding the experimental wavelength of 216 cm du et al 2019 was propagating at the density pycnocline of z 10 c m and the characteristics depicted in the velocity field by piv are in good agreement with the wave pattern produced by the conductivity probe array five experimental profiles including at the position of the trough and both 1 4 and 1 2 wavelength in front of and behind the trough of the isw are identified as a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and a 5 along the isw propagation direction respectively at each of these points the velocity vector will be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components so as to discuss the vertical distribution characteristics of the oblique isw profiles of the horizontal and vertical velocities as well as their shears are shown in fig 4 for the horizontal velocity u z there exists a significant shear effect near the envelope of the isw whereby the direction above below the envelope is consistent with opposite to the propagating isw velocity the magnitude of the velocity becomes small below the envelope and is close to zero near the envelope while the shear of d u d z becomes larger approach to the envelope and is close to its positive maximum at the trough of the isw for the vertical velocity v z there exists a sinking upwelling current in front of behind the isw and no flow at the trough and the magnitude of the sinking upwelling velocity reaches its maximum between 1 4 and 1 3 of a wavelength from the trough the shear of d v d x presents negative magnitude around the trough of the isw while it presents positive magnitude at about 1 2 wavelength in front of and behind the trough of the isw respectively 3 3 flow field of oblique isw around slender body the characteristics of the force on the slender body encountering an oblique isw typically depend on the structural difference between the velocity distribution at the front and the back of the body the variation in this difference is determined by the propagation direction θ of the oblique isw therefore the velocity distributions in the plane of o x z at y 15 cm and y 15 cm see fig 5 are chosen to examine the structural differences the flow characteristics around the slender submerged body encountering oblique isws with propagation directions of θ 0 45 and 90 can be visualized using the dyeing identification method as shown in fig 6 three typical isw flow patterns around the body at a depth of η 0 125 were recorded in pattern i half of the slender body is within the wave packet and the other half remains outside the packet in pattern ii the whole body is within the packet and in pattern iii half of the body is just out of the packet and the other half remains within the packet this can be visualized as a mixed flow accompanying small scale fluctuations around the body as well as the obvious increase in their intensity as the angle θ increases from θ 0 to θ 45 however the slender body has little influence on the overall profile of the isw pattern in addition it is interesting that a high density fluid mass emerges behind the slender body and gradually expands with the evolution of the oblique isw when the whole body is within the oblique isw it is completely surrounded by the low density fluid the above phenomenon becomes particularly obvious for the oblique isw with a transverse propagation of θ 90 the velocity vectors around the slender body encountering the oblique isw with θ 45 in the vertical plane of o x z were experimentally obtained for h 1 h 0 125 ρ 1 ρ 2 0 96 α 0 118 and η 0 125 the velocity distribution at y 15 cm and y 15 cm as measured by piv are shown in fig 7 as the isw passes through the slender body there exists a strong horizontal shear flow between the upper and lower fluids in which the upper velocity is greater than the lower one and moves in the opposite direction and the sinking and upwelling currents occur in front of and behind the isw respectively the velocity distribution of the oblique isw is significantly influenced by the slender body in which the mean sinking and upwelling currents in front of and behind the isw are enhanced in patterns i and iii a strong clockwise vortex forms and then gradually diffuses on the leeward side of the body in pattern ii changing the local velocity distribution the high density fluid mass derived from the back of the body in the visualization image can be qualitatively explained as the shedding of the vortex in the fluid this is a nonnegligible characteristic of the flow difference between the slender body placed parallel and at a certain angle to the isw further the vertical distributions of u z and v z in the plane of o x z along the propagation direction of the isw were obtained when the oblique isw passed through y 15 cm 15 cm as shown in fig 8 in comparison with the horizontal velocity distribution without the body see fig 4 u z has similar characteristics but its mean flow is enhanced and both the reverse flow and the shear flow at pycnoclines of y 15 cm and y 15 cm respectively are weakened moreover the distribution characteristics of v z with the body at y 15 cm and y 15 cm are quite different from those without the body with the positive and negative flows at y 15 cm being enhanced and weakened respectively and an oscillating change in the flow occurring at y 15 cm because the vortex around the slender body changes the vertical velocity profiles it is also an important feature in changing the force of the oblique isw on the slender body in the same way similar wave flow structures of the oblique isw with without the slender body can be obtained in the stratified circumstance of h 1 h 0 25 3 4 forces of oblique isw on slender body 1 effect of isw amplitude let us consider the typical experimental case of h 1 h 0 25 ρ 1 ρ 2 0 98 and η 0 25 which means the body is located at the density pycnocline the characteristic variations of the force on the slender body with respect to the amplitude of α were obtained for different oblique isw angles of θ 0 45 60 and 90 the measurement results of the forces on the slender body exerted by isws with different wave angles and amplitudes of α 0 021 0 042 0 075 0 114 are shown in fig 9 the horizontal force coefficients of c x are similar in the time series for all cases because the mean horizontal velocity u z has a similar profile structure i e c x changes from positive to negative which means that the body is first pushed along the wave propagation direction and then pulled back in the opposite direction the magnitude of the pushing force is obviously greater than the pulling force because the positive value of u z is greater than the negative one and the horizontal force increases with the isw amplitude and with the difference between the positive and negative forces similar variations can be observed for all vertical force coefficients of c z in the time series i e c z changes from negative to positive which means that the body is pressed downward and then gradually lifted upward the maximum value of the pressing force is on average greater than the lifting force and the former increases rapidly and then becomes stable as the incident isw amplitude increases comparing θ 0 with θ 45 60 90 a slow change or even decrease occurs in the vertical force coefficient c z because a change in the vertical density distribution increases the upward reduced gravity of f p z against the downward wave force of f w z moreover there exists an oscillating change in the vertical velocity profile when θ 0 producing a double trough in the coefficient c z the two troughs have approximately the same value when θ 45 although the second trough gradually exceeds the first one with increasing θ and reaches its maximum depth at θ 90 note that this kind of double trough occurs when a slender body encounters oblique isws in the ocean further the variation of the peak force coefficients with respect to the incident amplitude for different wave angles is analyzed in fig 10 the horizontal force of c x max increases with θ and its amplitude will also increase as the amplitude of the incident wave increases for instance the amplitude c x max of α 0 114 approximately doubles as θ increases from 45 to 90 comparing c z max with c x max it can be seen that c z max is distinctly larger than c x max for θ 0 when θ 45 c z max becomes smaller than c x max and becomes smaller than c x max until θ 90 thus for θ 45 the vertical action is more prominent than the horizontal motion whereas for θ 45 the opposite is true compared with fig 4 the horizontal and vertical velocity fields and their shear characteristics are the fundamental reasons for the variation of the peak forces 2 effect of body s submerged depth as the magnitude and direction of the velocity induced by the oblique isw change with the water depth the forces on the slender body vary with depth and the change of wave direction angle introduces significant additional complexity another typical case of h 1 h 0 25 ρ 1 ρ 2 0 98 α 0 13 is considered with submerged depths of η 0 0625 0 125 0 1875 0 3125 the characteristics of the force on the body are investigated for isws with wave angles of θ 0 30 45 60 and 90 the measured results for the horizontal force f x at various submerged depths are shown in fig 11 when η 0 1875 above the isw packet the horizontal force coefficient of c x is positive because of the positive direction of the induced horizontal velocity which means that the body is pushed along in the direction of wave propagation the increase in the cross sectional area of the slender body facing the incoming flow at higher values of θ means that the wave force f w x increases the value of the positive pushing force f x for θ 0 is several times larger than that for θ 90 the horizontal velocity in the negative x direction decreases rapidly below the wave surface at η 0 3125 which of this submerged depth is near the wave envelope with the strong horizontal velocity shear so the value of c x is considerably reduced in both the negative and positive directions this represents the restoring force and the dynamic behavior whereby the body is pulled along in the opposite direction to the wave propagation and then pushed along in the same direction the maximum value of the negative pulling force occurs when θ 90 and is up to 2 5 times greater than that for θ 0 although the positive pushing force remains unchanged the above analysis indicates that both the magnitude and direction of the horizontal force changes with the depth at which the slender body is located although the variation in the horizontal motion remains unchanged with respect to the wave angle above the isw packet its intensity is greatly enhanced consistent with the horizontal direction of induced velocity moreover the horizontal action rapidly weakens below the isw packet the measured results of the vertical force f z with respect to the body s submerged depth are shown in fig 12 the vertical force depends mostly on the wave force f w z calculated from the vertical velocity of w because the passing isw makes little contribution to the density change at η 0 0625 meaning that the body is pressed downward and then lifted upward on the windward and leeward of the wave packet respectively and both the pressing and lifting forces increase with increasing wave angle θ as the submerged depth of the body increases from η 0 125 to 0 1875 the influence of the passing isw on the density change inside the isw packet increases sharply so that the vertical force is determined by the combination of f p z and f w z the force coefficient c z is negative and this downward pressing force attains a larger magnitude and shorter duration as the depth of the body increases as the wave angle θ increases the total vertical force of f z decreases and a double peak appears in which the magnitude of the first peak changes from greater to less than the second peak at θ 45 when the submerged body is located below the isw packet of η 0 3125 its vertical force depends on the wave force of f w z which is determined by the induced vertical velocity of w the coefficient of c z changes from negative to positive meaning that the body is pressed downward and then lifted upward on the windward and leeward of the wave packet respectively the negative pressing force increases with the wave angle θ and the positive lifting force increases to a maximum near θ 45 and then gradually decreases in summary because both the density in the isw packet and the induced velocity change with the submerged depth the vertical forces on the slender body above the pycnocline in the wave packet and below the wave packet are affected by actions including the single velocity field superimposed field of velocity and density and the single velocity field respectively i e f w z f p z f w z and f w z the vertical action in the wave packet is the strongest together with the change of the double peak force for different wave angles θ the double peak characteristics of c x with respect to θ are compared at body depths of η 0 125 and 0 1875 in fig 13 the downward vertical force c z at the center of the wave packet for η 0 1875 is significantly higher than for η 0 125 the first peak changes from greater to less than the second peak as the angle θ increases the angles corresponding to the transformation point of this double peak vary according to the submerged depth for instance θ 36 at η 0 1875 and θ 45 at η 0 125 and the angle becomes progressively smaller as the body approaches the center of the wave packet 4 concluding remarks a series of experiments were conducted in a large gravitational stratification fluid flume these experiments investigated the coupling wave flow structure of the interaction between oblique isws and a submerged slender body using a multichannel conductivity probe array and piv and examined the characteristics of the force on the body using a three component micro amplitude force sensor the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 there exists a significant horizontal velocity shear in the flow near the edge of the isw packet with the horizontal velocity above below the envelope being consistent with opposite to the propagating wave direction a vertical sinking upwelling current is observed on the windward leeward of the wave packet and both attain maxima at between 1 4 and 1 3 of a wavelength from the trough during the interaction of the oblique isw with the slender body the shear distribution of horizontal velocity remains unchanged near the edge of the wave packet although its mean value increases and an oscillating distribution of vertical velocity appears around the front part of the slender body 2 the oblique isw force on the submerged slender body depends on both the stratified density and induced velocity field the dynamic pressure in the vertical direction is transformed into the reduced gravity and the wave force in the horizontal or vertical direction can be calculated using morison s formula for the corresponding component of velocity the slender body is horizontally pushed along the direction of propagation of the isw and then pulled in its opposite direction and the pushing force is always larger than the pulling one the body is vertically pressed downward and then gradually lifted upward and the maximum pressing force is on average larger than the lifting one there exists a double peak change in the vertical force as the wave angle θ increases in which the second peak gradually exceeds the first peak near θ 45 and reaches its maximum at θ 90 this is a noteworthy phenomenon that may cause secondary damage to an underwater vehicle in an area with internal waves 3 the characteristics of the force on the submerged slender body are significantly influenced by both the isw amplitude and the body s submerged depth typically an increase in the amplitude enlarges the horizontal and vertical isw forces and the oblique isw makes the vertical action more pronounced when θ 45 whereas the horizontal action is more prominent when θ 45 variations in the submerged depth of the body change the magnitude and direction of the horizontal force and maximize the vertical force in the wave packet an increase in the wave direction angle θ

21984,this paper reports the results of laboratory experiments on the coupling wave flow structure of an oblique internal solitary wave isw and the force it exerts on a submerged slender body in a large stratified fluid flume multiple experimental techniques were used to measure the wave flow field as well as the force on the slender body reasonable analysis reveals the effects of the propagation directions and amplitudes of the oblique isw on the dynamic characteristics of the slender body at different water depths the experimental results show that there is a significant shear effect from the horizontal velocity near the envelope of the isw and sinking upwelling current from the vertical velocity in front of behind the isw packet the direction of the horizontal velocity above below the envelope is consistent with opposite to the propagation velocity of the isw with the former having a larger magnitude the horizontal force depends on the velocity field induced by the oblique isw and the vertical force is determined by the coupling velocity and density field the horizontal and vertical wave forces are calculated using morison s formula corresponding to the respective component of velocity with the vertical dynamic pressure transformed into the reduced gravity keywords stratification fluid oblique internal solitary wave wave flow structure force slender body piv 1 introduction the uncertainty of the propagation direction of surface waves in the sea coupled with the variation of the moving direction of ships means that sailing ships commonly interact with oblique waves the hydrodynamic characteristics of these interactions can become extremely complex haddara 1980 roberts 1982 similarly in the stratified ocean the interactions between a submerged slender body and internal solitary waves isws propagating in the oblique direction are inevitable because of the uncertainty of the propagation direction of isws as well as other important characteristics such as the randomness of nonlinear isws large vertical motion of isopycnic surfaces and strong horizontal shear flow as a result the safety of marine structures and underwater vehicles must be considered according to the available data 61 of 203 submarine accidents reported worldwide may be related to ocean internal waves fang and du 2005 among which the most influential factors are characteristics such as the amplitude induced velocity and propagation direction of isws recently the generation and propagation mechanisms of isws and their interactions with marine structures have received considerable attention theories covering both lee waves lee and beardsley 1974 and internal tidal waves maxworthy 1979 are widely accepted as the mechanism of internal wave generation some studies have focused on the evolution characteristics and mechanism of isws in the real ocean bottom environment including background current steps ridges gentle slopes and porous trapezoidal obstacles cai et al 2008a zhu 2018 du et al 2013 carr et al 2010 cheng et al 2017 further applications to the interaction between internal waves and marine engineering structures have also been investigated chen 2017 wang et al 2018 haibin et al 2016 the theoretical models for the interaction of nonlinear internal waves with a slender body sturova 1994 khabakhpasheva and sturova 1998 have been improved through the development of internal solitary wave theories such as the kdv mkdv and mcc equations and the application of morison s formula segur and hammack 1982 choi and camassa 1996 helfrich and melville 2006 debsarma et al 2010 morison et al 1950 for instance cheng et al 2004 and cai et al 2003 2008b used morison s formula to analyze the characteristics of forces on slender rods due to the current induced by isws and clarified how the shear flow induced by these waves changes the force and torque on vertical piles the conclusion of larger internal wave forces than surface wave forces on small diameter piles was verified yin et al 2016 proposed a numerical method for determining the force in a two layer fluid whereby the vertical force and torque exerted on a slender cylinder located along the propagation direction of the interfacial wave can be efficiently calculated under varying buoyancy scenarios by measuring the force exerted on a slender submerged body by an evolving isw on a gentle slope in a stratified fluid flume du et al 2016 found that nonstationary isws caused by topographic effects can greatly increase the damage to submerged bodies oblique waves on the ocean surface can change the reciprocating motion characteristics of a hull as well as the height of the water surface on its two sides so that the excitation torque imposed by a roll force on the ship from the oblique wave will make its roll movement difficult to control zakaria 2009 thiébot et al 2012 similarly the coupling action of wave flow from nonlinear waves will complicate the hydrodynamic characteristics of slender submerged bodies interacting with oblique isws sundar et al 2005 little progress has been made in the interaction of oblique isws with slender submerged bodies the motivation for this study is to deepen our understanding of the coupling wave flow characteristics of the force on a slender body in the presence of oblique isws by means of multiple techniques including a conductivity probe array piv and a three component micro amplitude force sensor we measure the density fluctuations velocity distribution and force variations for different angles between the horizontal slender submerged body and the propagation direction of isws 2 experimental device and method experiments were conducted in a gravitationally stratified fluid flume as shown in fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system o x y z was defined with the origin set at the rest surface by the right end of the flume and the positive axes of x y z running leftward outward and upward respectively the flume is 1200 cm long 120 cm wide and 100 cm high and its bottom and side walls are made of transparent glass to facilitate observation and measurement the classical double tank method was applied to obtain a two layer fluid of thickness h i and density ρ i with a total depth of h in which i 1 2 represent the upper and lower layers respectively and h h 1 h 2 fang and du 2005 two typical curves of density with respect to water depth with the characteristics of oceanic pycnoclines are shown in fig 2 mixing between the upper fresh and lower salt water layers produces a continuous density distribution structure with a certain thickness at the interface which is called the density pycnocline a rotating shutter isw wave maker and a triangular wedge wave absorber were installed at the right and left ends of the flume respectively to generate high quality isws and efficiently absorb reflected waves wei et al 2014 the test model of a slender submerged body with a cylindrical shape length l 39 cm depth d 5 cm was made of plexiglass material in the following θ denotes the angle between the horizontal slender body and the propagation direction of the isw and z s is the depth of the submerged slender body the structure of the oblique isw encountering the slender submerged body was measured by the conductivity probe array wei et al 2014 firstly the conductivity was converted to an output voltage by an acquisition and amplification circuit and the voltage was converted to a digital signal by an analog to digital a d converter the fluid density to be measured was then determined using an experimental calibration formula finally the evolving structure of the isw was obtained from the conductivity probe array multiple groups of arrays were arranged at the following horizontal positions ι x 525 cm ι ι x 595 cm ι ι ι x 700 cm and iv x 750 cm two groups including one probe were arranged at positions i and iv respectively and the other two groups including seven probes with a vertical spacing of 3 cm were arranged at positions ι ι and ι ι ι respectively the submerged depth of the slender body can be determined by the vertical coordinate of z s the angle θ at which the isw propagates can be adjusted by rotating the model in the plane of o x y the resultant force exerted on the model was measured by the three component force measuring sensor which was connected to the center of symmetry of the model through a sword shaped rigid rod and its magnitude was output in the form of an electrical signal in addition the output signal of the force sensor was calibrated at the beginning of the experiments the flow field of the isw in the o x z plane was measured using two dimensional piv which is made up of laser devices image recording equipment and a data processing workstation for different propagation directions of the isw the velocity distribution at any x z sections of the slender body can be obtained by adjusting the y coordinate of the laser device on the bottom of the flume the image recorder pco2000 dual shutter array ccd with a resolution of 2048 2048 pixels and a rate of 20 frames per second was positioned on the side wall of the flume to record real time images of the flow the recorded images were processed in the workstation using the cross correlation function of a two dimensional fast fourier transform to obtain the distribution of velocity vectors the physical parameters of the system were converted to dimensionless form as follows α a h η z s h c x f x ρ g s h c z f z ρ g s h where a represents the relative amplitude of the isw f x and f z represent the horizontal and vertical forces n on the body respectively and ρ g and s represent the fluid density g cm 3 at the body s depth gravitational acceleration cm s 2 and maximum cross sectional area of the slender body respectively the test cases in table 1 were used to obtain the wave flow fields around the slender body and the associated forces for different angles of θ at position v x 650 cm 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical method the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the underwater object are mainly divided into three parts dynamic pressure force f p friction force f f and wave force f w li and teng 2002 considering the density stratification and the body s geometric structure in the o x z plane the horizontal and vertical components f x and f z of their resultant force f can be calculated the horizontal force f x in the x direction is composed of three components which are expressed as follows 1 f p x s p n d s x 2 f f x 1 2 c f s ρ v τ 2 τ d s 3 f w x l 1 4 c m ρ π d 2 u t 1 2 c d ρ d u u cos θ d x where n and τ are the unit normal and tangential vectors at the surface of the body respectively p ρ are the dynamic pressure and mean fluid density respectively v τ is the tangential velocity at the surface of the body u is the horizontal velocity induced by the isw c f c m and c d are the coefficients of the friction resistance inertia force and drag force respectively the horizontal velocity along the x axis induced by the oblique isw is always perpendicular to the projection of the slender body on the y axis according to which the wave force of f w x is equivalent to the action on vertical piles by surface waves therefore the projected part of the isw force on the y axis can be approximated by morison s formula which involves both horizontal inertia and horizontal velocity forces li and teng 2002 the vertical force f z in the z direction is also composed of three components 4 f p z δ ρ g δ v 5 f f z 0 6 f w z l 1 4 c m ρ π d 2 w t 1 2 c d ρ d w w d x where δ ρ and δ v represent the density and volume changes of the fluid displaced by the body respectively and w represents the vertical velocity induced by the isw the vertical dynamic pressure on the slender submerged body can be converted into the reduced gravity force because of the vertical change in fluid density the vertical friction force f f z can be ignored because the vertical velocity caused by the isw is much smaller than the horizontal velocity the vertical wave force f w z is still estimated by morison s formula which involves both vertical inertia and vertical velocity forces thus both the horizontal and vertical forces on the slender submerged body from encountering the oblique isw depend on the induced velocity and the varying density fields this analytical method lays a solid foundation for the real measurement and analysis of both the horizontal and vertical components of the resultant force exerted by oblique isws on slender bodies 3 2 flow field of isw the characteristics of the force on a slender submerged body depend on the structure of the isw wave flow field for the typical case of h 1 h 0 125 ρ 1 ρ 2 0 98 and α 0 114 the velocity distribution and wave pattern measured in the o x z plane are presented in fig 3 in this case the isw corresponding the experimental wavelength of 216 cm du et al 2019 was propagating at the density pycnocline of z 10 c m and the characteristics depicted in the velocity field by piv are in good agreement with the wave pattern produced by the conductivity probe array five experimental profiles including at the position of the trough and both 1 4 and 1 2 wavelength in front of and behind the trough of the isw are identified as a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 and a 5 along the isw propagation direction respectively at each of these points the velocity vector will be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components so as to discuss the vertical distribution characteristics of the oblique isw profiles of the horizontal and vertical velocities as well as their shears are shown in fig 4 for the horizontal velocity u z there exists a significant shear effect near the envelope of the isw whereby the direction above below the envelope is consistent with opposite to the propagating isw velocity the magnitude of the velocity becomes small below the envelope and is close to zero near the envelope while the shear of d u d z becomes larger approach to the envelope and is close to its positive maximum at the trough of the isw for the vertical velocity v z there exists a sinking upwelling current in front of behind the isw and no flow at the trough and the magnitude of the sinking upwelling velocity reaches its maximum between 1 4 and 1 3 of a wavelength from the trough the shear of d v d x presents negative magnitude around the trough of the isw while it presents positive magnitude at about 1 2 wavelength in front of and behind the trough of the isw respectively 3 3 flow field of oblique isw around slender body the characteristics of the force on the slender body encountering an oblique isw typically depend on the structural difference between the velocity distribution at the front and the back of the body the variation in this difference is determined by the propagation direction θ of the oblique isw therefore the velocity distributions in the plane of o x z at y 15 cm and y 15 cm see fig 5 are chosen to examine the structural differences the flow characteristics around the slender submerged body encountering oblique isws with propagation directions of θ 0 45 and 90 can be visualized using the dyeing identification method as shown in fig 6 three typical isw flow patterns around the body at a depth of η 0 125 were recorded in pattern i half of the slender body is within the wave packet and the other half remains outside the packet in pattern ii the whole body is within the packet and in pattern iii half of the body is just out of the packet and the other half remains within the packet this can be visualized as a mixed flow accompanying small scale fluctuations around the body as well as the obvious increase in their intensity as the angle θ increases from θ 0 to θ 45 however the slender body has little influence on the overall profile of the isw pattern in addition it is interesting that a high density fluid mass emerges behind the slender body and gradually expands with the evolution of the oblique isw when the whole body is within the oblique isw it is completely surrounded by the low density fluid the above phenomenon becomes particularly obvious for the oblique isw with a transverse propagation of θ 90 the velocity vectors around the slender body encountering the oblique isw with θ 45 in the vertical plane of o x z were experimentally obtained for h 1 h 0 125 ρ 1 ρ 2 0 96 α 0 118 and η 0 125 the velocity distribution at y 15 cm and y 15 cm as measured by piv are shown in fig 7 as the isw passes through the slender body there exists a strong horizontal shear flow between the upper and lower fluids in which the upper velocity is greater than the lower one and moves in the opposite direction and the sinking and upwelling currents occur in front of and behind the isw respectively the velocity distribution of the oblique isw is significantly influenced by the slender body in which the mean sinking and upwelling currents in front of and behind the isw are enhanced in patterns i and iii a strong clockwise vortex forms and then gradually diffuses on the leeward side of the body in pattern ii changing the local velocity distribution the high density fluid mass derived from the back of the body in the visualization image can be qualitatively explained as the shedding of the vortex in the fluid this is a nonnegligible characteristic of the flow difference between the slender body placed parallel and at a certain angle to the isw further the vertical distributions of u z and v z in the plane of o x z along the propagation direction of the isw were obtained when the oblique isw passed through y 15 cm 15 cm as shown in fig 8 in comparison with the horizontal velocity distribution without the body see fig 4 u z has similar characteristics but its mean flow is enhanced and both the reverse flow and the shear flow at pycnoclines of y 15 cm and y 15 cm respectively are weakened moreover the distribution characteristics of v z with the body at y 15 cm and y 15 cm are quite different from those without the body with the positive and negative flows at y 15 cm being enhanced and weakened respectively and an oscillating change in the flow occurring at y 15 cm because the vortex around the slender body changes the vertical velocity profiles it is also an important feature in changing the force of the oblique isw on the slender body in the same way similar wave flow structures of the oblique isw with without the slender body can be obtained in the stratified circumstance of h 1 h 0 25 3 4 forces of oblique isw on slender body 1 effect of isw amplitude let us consider the typical experimental case of h 1 h 0 25 ρ 1 ρ 2 0 98 and η 0 25 which means the body is located at the density pycnocline the characteristic variations of the force on the slender body with respect to the amplitude of α were obtained for different oblique isw angles of θ 0 45 60 and 90 the measurement results of the forces on the slender body exerted by isws with different wave angles and amplitudes of α 0 021 0 042 0 075 0 114 are shown in fig 9 the horizontal force coefficients of c x are similar in the time series for all cases because the mean horizontal velocity u z has a similar profile structure i e c x changes from positive to negative which means that the body is first pushed along the wave propagation direction and then pulled back in the opposite direction the magnitude of the pushing force is obviously greater than the pulling force because the positive value of u z is greater than the negative one and the horizontal force increases with the isw amplitude and with the difference between the positive and negative forces similar variations can be observed for all vertical force coefficients of c z in the time series i e c z changes from negative to positive which means that the body is pressed downward and then gradually lifted upward the maximum value of the pressing force is on average greater than the lifting force and the former increases rapidly and then becomes stable as the incident isw amplitude increases comparing θ 0 with θ 45 60 90 a slow change or even decrease occurs in the vertical force coefficient c z because a change in the vertical density distribution increases the upward reduced gravity of f p z against the downward wave force of f w z moreover there exists an oscillating change in the vertical velocity profile when θ 0 producing a double trough in the coefficient c z the two troughs have approximately the same value when θ 45 although the second trough gradually exceeds the first one with increasing θ and reaches its maximum depth at θ 90 note that this kind of double trough occurs when a slender body encounters oblique isws in the ocean further the variation of the peak force coefficients with respect to the incident amplitude for different wave angles is analyzed in fig 10 the horizontal force of c x max increases with θ and its amplitude will also increase as the amplitude of the incident wave increases for instance the amplitude c x max of α 0 114 approximately doubles as θ increases from 45 to 90 comparing c z max with c x max it can be seen that c z max is distinctly larger than c x max for θ 0 when θ 45 c z max becomes smaller than c x max and becomes smaller than c x max until θ 90 thus for θ 45 the vertical action is more prominent than the horizontal motion whereas for θ 45 the opposite is true compared with fig 4 the horizontal and vertical velocity fields and their shear characteristics are the fundamental reasons for the variation of the peak forces 2 effect of body s submerged depth as the magnitude and direction of the velocity induced by the oblique isw change with the water depth the forces on the slender body vary with depth and the change of wave direction angle introduces significant additional complexity another typical case of h 1 h 0 25 ρ 1 ρ 2 0 98 α 0 13 is considered with submerged depths of η 0 0625 0 125 0 1875 0 3125 the characteristics of the force on the body are investigated for isws with wave angles of θ 0 30 45 60 and 90 the measured results for the horizontal force f x at various submerged depths are shown in fig 11 when η 0 1875 above the isw packet the horizontal force coefficient of c x is positive because of the positive direction of the induced horizontal velocity which means that the body is pushed along in the direction of wave propagation the increase in the cross sectional area of the slender body facing the incoming flow at higher values of θ means that the wave force f w x increases the value of the positive pushing force f x for θ 0 is several times larger than that for θ 90 the horizontal velocity in the negative x direction decreases rapidly below the wave surface at η 0 3125 which of this submerged depth is near the wave envelope with the strong horizontal velocity shear so the value of c x is considerably reduced in both the negative and positive directions this represents the restoring force and the dynamic behavior whereby the body is pulled along in the opposite direction to the wave propagation and then pushed along in the same direction the maximum value of the negative pulling force occurs when θ 90 and is up to 2 5 times greater than that for θ 0 although the positive pushing force remains unchanged the above analysis indicates that both the magnitude and direction of the horizontal force changes with the depth at which the slender body is located although the variation in the horizontal motion remains unchanged with respect to the wave angle above the isw packet its intensity is greatly enhanced consistent with the horizontal direction of induced velocity moreover the horizontal action rapidly weakens below the isw packet the measured results of the vertical force f z with respect to the body s submerged depth are shown in fig 12 the vertical force depends mostly on the wave force f w z calculated from the vertical velocity of w because the passing isw makes little contribution to the density change at η 0 0625 meaning that the body is pressed downward and then lifted upward on the windward and leeward of the wave packet respectively and both the pressing and lifting forces increase with increasing wave angle θ as the submerged depth of the body increases from η 0 125 to 0 1875 the influence of the passing isw on the density change inside the isw packet increases sharply so that the vertical force is determined by the combination of f p z and f w z the force coefficient c z is negative and this downward pressing force attains a larger magnitude and shorter duration as the depth of the body increases as the wave angle θ increases the total vertical force of f z decreases and a double peak appears in which the magnitude of the first peak changes from greater to less than the second peak at θ 45 when the submerged body is located below the isw packet of η 0 3125 its vertical force depends on the wave force of f w z which is determined by the induced vertical velocity of w the coefficient of c z changes from negative to positive meaning that the body is pressed downward and then lifted upward on the windward and leeward of the wave packet respectively the negative pressing force increases with the wave angle θ and the positive lifting force increases to a maximum near θ 45 and then gradually decreases in summary because both the density in the isw packet and the induced velocity change with the submerged depth the vertical forces on the slender body above the pycnocline in the wave packet and below the wave packet are affected by actions including the single velocity field superimposed field of velocity and density and the single velocity field respectively i e f w z f p z f w z and f w z the vertical action in the wave packet is the strongest together with the change of the double peak force for different wave angles θ the double peak characteristics of c x with respect to θ are compared at body depths of η 0 125 and 0 1875 in fig 13 the downward vertical force c z at the center of the wave packet for η 0 1875 is significantly higher than for η 0 125 the first peak changes from greater to less than the second peak as the angle θ increases the angles corresponding to the transformation point of this double peak vary according to the submerged depth for instance θ 36 at η 0 1875 and θ 45 at η 0 125 and the angle becomes progressively smaller as the body approaches the center of the wave packet 4 concluding remarks a series of experiments were conducted in a large gravitational stratification fluid flume these experiments investigated the coupling wave flow structure of the interaction between oblique isws and a submerged slender body using a multichannel conductivity probe array and piv and examined the characteristics of the force on the body using a three component micro amplitude force sensor the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 there exists a significant horizontal velocity shear in the flow near the edge of the isw packet with the horizontal velocity above below the envelope being consistent with opposite to the propagating wave direction a vertical sinking upwelling current is observed on the windward leeward of the wave packet and both attain maxima at between 1 4 and 1 3 of a wavelength from the trough during the interaction of the oblique isw with the slender body the shear distribution of horizontal velocity remains unchanged near the edge of the wave packet although its mean value increases and an oscillating distribution of vertical velocity appears around the front part of the slender body 2 the oblique isw force on the submerged slender body depends on both the stratified density and induced velocity field the dynamic pressure in the vertical direction is transformed into the reduced gravity and the wave force in the horizontal or vertical direction can be calculated using morison s formula for the corresponding component of velocity the slender body is horizontally pushed along the direction of propagation of the isw and then pulled in its opposite direction and the pushing force is always larger than the pulling one the body is vertically pressed downward and then gradually lifted upward and the maximum pressing force is on average larger than the lifting one there exists a double peak change in the vertical force as the wave angle θ increases in which the second peak gradually exceeds the first peak near θ 45 and reaches its maximum at θ 90 this is a noteworthy phenomenon that may cause secondary damage to an underwater vehicle in an area with internal waves 3 the characteristics of the force on the submerged slender body are significantly influenced by both the isw amplitude and the body s submerged depth typically an increase in the amplitude enlarges the horizontal and vertical isw forces and the oblique isw makes the vertical action more pronounced when θ 45 whereas the horizontal action is more prominent when θ 45 variations in the submerged depth of the body change the magnitude and direction of the horizontal force and maximize the vertical force in the wave packet an increase in the wave direction angle θ significantly increases the horizontal force and changes the vertical force to a double peak form credit authorship contribution statement shao dong wang investigation methodology software writing
