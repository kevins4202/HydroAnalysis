16595,membrane fouling which is caused by the deposition of particles on the membrane surface or pores reduces system performance in membrane distillation md applications resulting in increased operational costs poor recovery and system failure optical coherence tomography enables in situ foulant monitoring in both 2d and 3d however the 2d images can only determine fouling layer thickness in severe fouling therefore in this study an advanced 3d imaging analysis technique using intensity range filters was proposed to quantify fouling layer formation during md through the use of a single 3d image this approach not only reduces computational power requirements but also successfully separated the fouling layer from the membrane at the microscale thus the thickness fouling index and fouling layer coverage can be evaluated in real time to test this approach polyvinylidene fluoride c pvdf and polytetrafluoroethylene c ptfe membranes were used to treat a feed consisting of industrial textile wastewater thin and disperse foulants was observed on the c ptfe with a 22 Âµm thick fouling layer which could not be observed using 2d images after 24 h moreover the c ptfe demonstrated better antifouling ability than the c pvdf as demonstrated by its lower fouling index which was also supported by surface energy characterization this work demonstrates the significant potential of 3d imagery in the long term monitoring of membrane fouling process to improve membrane antifouling performance in md applications which can lead to lowered operational costs and improved system stability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords optical coherence tomography oct membrane distillation membrane fouling in situ and non invasive visualization 1 introduction membrane fouling presents a major hurdle to the adoption of membrane distillation md in wastewater treatment applications due to its effect on membrane performance tijing et al 2015 wastewater treatment remains challenging as it contains a significant amount of foulants including particular matters and organic and inorganic substances such as oils and mineral participates during membrane based treatment processes concentration of the feed solution and the resulting concentration polarization of the substances increases the chance of their deposition on the membrane surface initiating the fouling process deposition of foulants is mainly affected by the direction of permeate flow and the free energy interaction between the membrane surface and foulant tijing et al 2015 the accumulation of foulants reduces the amount of free membrane channels available for vapor transport through the membrane reducing membrane flux and treatment efficiency in some cases studies have shown md performance can be reduced by as much as 40 after a 48 h experiment using commercial membranes as a result of growth in the fouling layer kharraz and an 2020 moreover this phenomenon reduces the hydrophobicity of the membrane which increases its susceptibility to membrane wetting in serious cases the membrane becomes fully covered by the fouling layer and no vapor can pass through the membrane in long term testing kharraz and an 2020 monitoring the growth of the foulant layer is a required to examine the cause of fouling layer formation and determine the optimal timing for membrane cleaning flux measurement overtime is typically used as a method to monitor growth in the foulant layer park et al 2019 ramezanianpour and sivakumar 2014 the specific resistance concept has also been applied to evaluate the effect of fouling based on permeate flux data as this approach can help to compare the antifouling ability of a membrane or the effect of wastewater quality on fouling growth although the approach is simple as no extra monitoring required it cannot identify the growth of the fouling layer or the effect of concentration polarization on membrane flux decline scanning electron microscopy can examine the fouling layer however it cannot be performed in situ zou et al 2018 therefore different signal detection methods have been proposed to monitor the foulant growth in real time optical methods include optical in situ fouling detection microscopy and optical coherence tomography oct optical in situ wetting detection is done via the application of a white led light panel placed behind the membrane on the permeate side jacob et al 2020 variations in led light intensity correspond to the growth of the fouling layer and therefore this approach is limited to membrane which light can penetrate traditional microscopy resolution is low and is insufficient to identify initial fouling and the depth of the fouling layer non optical methods include electrical impedance spectroscopy eis which monitors the current impedance resistance and reactance of the membrane during membrane treatment processes chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 the growth of the fouling layer alters the electrical conductivity of the membrane layer causing a decrease of reactance when fouling occurs optical coherence tomography oct has been adopted to monitor and analyze the fouling layer as it can capture the depth profile of the layer using near infrared light fortunato et al 2019 2018 kerdi et al 2019 similar to microscopy techniques it can be monitored in real time without affecting the experiment moreover oct resolution can be as low as the microscale which represents a significant improvement over the conventional microscopy technique through oct 2d and 3d images of the fouling layer can be observed gao et al 2014a and several quantitative analysis techniques have been developed in recent studies to study the fouling layer image analyzing software is commonly used to analyze oct images in which a 2d image is used to visualize the growth of the fouling layer on a single line across the membrane g guo et al 2020 j guo et al 2020 shang et al 2020 trinh et al 2019 however foulant growth may be masked by the uneven roughness of the membrane causing initial fouling to remain unobserved in recent studies 3d images were used to provide higher resolution data for analyzing the fouling layer gao et al 2014b kerdi et al 2019 image analyzing software was used to extract the fouling layer based on intensity differences between the membrane and fouling layer using a membrane image from a top view to estimate fouling layer coverage fortunato and leiknes 2017 programming software such as matlab was then used to identify the fouling layer using the subtraction method based on the membrane position at the initial stage liu et al 2017 however these results can be affected by unstable fluctuations of the membrane along its longitudinal axis with time reducing the accuracy and usability of the data resolving membrane fouling layer morphology was limited and imprecise as a result of this uncertainty to alleviate the membrane shifting problem statistical similarity has been employed to detect changes in the membrane layer by continuously comparing with a previous 3d image however this method requires capturing large volume of consecutive 3d images at short time intervals to accurately determine membrane shifting as a result high computational power and memory for data processing is required which reduces the applicability of oct for industrial purposes in this study an advanced oct based 3d image analyzing technique was developed using matlab to distinguish the membrane from the fouling layer from a single 3d image improving the accuracy of fouling layer characterization through the development of an algorithm involving intensity range filters industrial textile wastewater was used as the feed for the membrane distillation experiments to simulate a real world oct monitoring scenario and two commercial membranes a polyvinylidene fluoride c pvdf and a polytetrafluoroethylene c ptfe were used in the testing the proposed system not only demonstrated increased precision in identifying the fouling but also a significant reduction in the required amount of 3d image data for long term monitoring of the fouling layer without sacrificing precision through the application of the new analysis technique membrane fouling layer volume fouling layer thickness and fouling layer coverage can also be estimated enabling further analysis of fouling layer growth in this study dyeing wastewater was selected as the feed guo et al 2020 trovaslet et al 2008 varjani et al 2020 as it is one of the largest contributors to water pollution hydrophilic hydrophobic interactions between the dye and hydrophobic membranes can induce severe fouling in membrane distillation applications an et al 2017 2016 therefore textile wastewater containing hydrophilic dyes acid red 18 acid yellow 36 and crystal violet was used in this study to validate the performance of the proposed approach for fouling observation khan et al 2020 sarabadan et al 2019 yang et al 2010 in addition to fouling layer characteristics the interactions between fouling particles and the membrane surface are commonly assessed via the surface energy approach non dispersive acid base ab and dispersive van der waals lw interactions between the membrane and foulant are considered zamani et al 2016 surface energy of the membrane is commonly determined using the multiple liquid approach based on contact angle measurements between the membrane surface and liquids chang et al 2020 chen et al 2017 lin et al 2014 yim et al 2020 however this approach requires liquids with known surface tensions leading to limited choices with 3 liquids with known surface tension being commonly used for surface free energy estimation uncertainty in the liquid can have a significant impact on contact angle measurement and surface energy estimation and therefore liquid mixtures have been suggested to alleviate this issue burdzik et al 2018 surface tension properties of inert non volatile and non toxic binary mixtures can be determined based on the mixture composition zhang et al 2019 with water ethylene glycol having been confirmed to be one of the potential combinations with this approach extra contact angle measurements can be conducted to improve the accuracy of surface energy estimation through surface energy estimation the strength of the interaction between the membrane and foulant in this case a hydrophilic dye can be compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 commercial membrane fouling experiment a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd with in situ oct experimental setup is presented in fig 1 commercial pvdf c pvdf and commercial ptfe c ptfe membranes were used to treat the wastewater with the c pvdf membrane millipore usa having a 0 45 Âµm pore size hvhp and the c ptfe membrane tf 200 pall gelman usa having a 0 20 Âµm pore size feed temperature and permeate temperature were maintained at 60 c and 20 c respectively using a hotplate and chiller at a flow rate of 0 5 l min wastewater with a methylene blue concentration of 20 ppm used was collected from a jeans manufacturer in hui zhou china to better simulate real world conditions sample were mixed with three different dyes acid red 18 acid yellow 36 and crystal violet to achieve a concentration of 20 ppm for each dye thus a feed with a dye concentration of 80 ppm was prepared for the md performance flux was measured by measuring the rate of change in mass on the permeate side per unit of effective membrane area during the experiment oct monitoring was conducted in parallel using a dcmd module with a glass window which allowed the light source from the oct probe to reach the membrane surface to obtain the data the scanned region of membrane area measured 1 31 x 1 46 mm which represents 205 320 data points an oct system ganymede ii thorlabs gmbh dechau germany with an lsm03 scan lens was used in this experiment to capture the 2d and 3d imagery capturing of 2d images was accomplished by b scan or a series of a scan which is depth profile scanning in a straight line 3d images were capture by a scan in both the x and y direction to provide a 3d depth profile in the fouling experiment 3d images were captured at a rate of 1 image per hour for the first 4 h to observe the initial growth of foulant from 4 to 24 h the capturing rate was 1 image per 4 h to observe long term variations in the fouling layer for comparison a 2d image was also captured at initial time experiment time 0 h and at the end of the experiment experiment time 24 h scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss germany was also applied to 1 validate the findings from the oct and 2 study the clean and fouled membrane surface morphology 2 2 oct image data analysis 2 2 1 2d image 2d image data contained a 435 483 matrix created by the b scan all pixels in the dataset correspond to a point in the 1 31 x 1 46 mm scanned area a noise filter was applied to filter the 2d image and the thickness of foulant layer was estimated by processing the depth profile a scan dataset using matlab 2 2 2 3d image the obtained 3d scanned image consists of a 435 483 472 matrix overall voxels of the dataset correspond to an intensity in a volume of 1 31 x 1 46 x 1 40 mm in this study the foulant voxel was considered as a voxel in which the intensity is higher than the background noise level and not in the membrane region moreover the intensity value of the oct is based on the light scattering of the particle at the sampling location thus a higher intensity can be representative of the coagulation of the foulants forming the fouling voxels water which is easily penetrated by light does not provide a strong signal compared with the foulants the membrane scatters light more significantly providing a stronger intensity signal thus the membrane and foulant layer can be identified by analyzing the 3d image due to their different intensities in a previous study identification of fouling pixels or voxels was done using subtraction or statistical techniques for subtraction the datasets were subtracted by the intensity at the initial time in which fouling had not yet occurred gao et al 2014b however in the experiment the shifting position of the membrane may reduce the accuracy of fouling layer identification therefore the statistical technique was applied to compare the intensity matrix with earlier data to identifying the shifting of the membrane layer reducing the membrane shifting error in fouling identification li et al 2016a however as previously discussed the statistical technique requires a short time interval 5 min for data acquisition to accurately identify membrane shifting which requires large volume datasets this short time requirement makes the approach infeasible for long term fouling monitoring as a single image size can be as large as 300 mb for a single 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 5 mm area in a 3d image to overcome both the accuracy and data size problem an advanced analysis technique was introduced in this study as shown in figs 2 and 3 the proposed technique identifies the membrane layer and fouling layer in a single dataset based on the filtered data by applying intensity range filters filterlow and filterhigh which are a technique to filter signals which are outside of selected intensity boundary as the membrane layer intensity is significantly higher than the fouling layer intensity filterlow is set at a low tolerance to low intensity data to screen out noise and the fouling layer leaving only the membrane layer the vertical position of the top membrane layer is saved for each x and y coordinate filterhigh which has a relatively high tolerance to low intensity data was then used to screen out noise leaving only the fouling voxels and membrane layer remaining the fouling voxels are then screened out by setting the intensity value below the z position of the top membrane layer acquired from the filterlow to zero to reduce the effect of flowing foulant a tolerance level is set such that the signal will be filtered out if the height different between the surface foulant and flowing foulant is greater than 5 voxels in height thus the voxels which are not directly touching the membrane will not be counted as a foulant voxels in addition foulant voxels which are attached to the membrane can be identified at initial time t 0 the membrane is clean without any foulant present thus filterlow can be determined by averaging the top layer membrane intensity filterhigh is determined based on the image at completion t t end where 1 foulant voxels can be observed and 2 background noise is eliminated the filtering range for filterlow and filterhigh were set as 55 and 33 respectively in analyzing the 3d image data to compare the performance of the proposed strategy foulant estimation was conducted through membrane surface tracking using the cross correlation approach li et al 2016b membrane surface shifting was determined by comparing the image at time t to time t 1 by minimizing the cross correlation coefficient remaining foulant voxels were then considered as the foulant growth during the period all algorithms in this study were programmed with matlab to estimate the fouling voxels for the 3d image data obtained in the experiment oct images were captured at 1 h intervals for the first 4 and at 4 h intervals between 4 and 24 h 2 3 membrane surface energy characterization connors and wright suggested the correlation method for estimating the mixture surface tension Î³ m i x as shown in eq 1 in which x i is the molar fraction of the liquid component i e water and ethylene glycol in this study a and b are the combined partition coefficient parameters 1 Î³ m i x Î³ 1 1 b x 1 1 a x 1 x 2 Î³ 1 Î³ 2 dispersive surface tension of the mixture Î³ m i x l w can be determined using the berthelot mixing rule as shown as eq 2 where Î´ l 1 l 2 is binary interaction parameter 2 Î³ m i x l w x 1 2 Î³ 1 l w 2 x 1 x 2 1 Î´ 1 2 Î³ 1 l w Î³ 2 l w x 2 2 Î³ 2 l w as the total surface tension of a liquid Î³ m i x is the sum of dispersive Î³ m i x l w and non dispersive Î³ m i x a b components surface tension Î³ m i x a b can be estimated by eq 3 3 Î³ m i x a b Î³ m i x Î³ m i x l w in this experiment in addition to using different mixing ratios of water and ethylene glycol to manipulate surface tension of the liquid glycerol was also used surface tension of the water ethylene glycol mixture was estimated using eqs 1 3 with a 0 793 and b 0 825 zhang et al 2019 Î³ a b and Î³

liquid gas Î³ l g interfaces can be written as 4 Î³ s g Î³ s l Î³ l g c o s Î¸ the owens wendt method is a common methodology to separate the dispersive Î³ s l w and polar interaction Î³ s a b of interfacial surface tension zhang et al 2019 the subscripts s and l represent the membrane surface and the liquid respectively 5 Î³ s l Î³ s Î³ l 2 Î³ s l w Î³ l l w 2 Î³ s a b Î³ l a b therefore by substituting young s equation eq 5 can be rewritten as eq 6 6 Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³ l l w Î³ s l w Î³ l a b Î³ s a b in which the left hand and right hand side represent the cohesion free energy of the liquid and the adhesion free energy between the membrane surface and liquid respectively brant and childress 2002 7 Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³ l a b Î³ l l w Î³ s l w Î³ l a b Î³ s a b linear regression can be done based on eq 7 by considering Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³ l a b and Î³ l l w Î³ l a b as the dependent variables thus the square of the slope and y intercept are equivalent to Î³ s l w and Î³ s a b respectively as a result overall surface energy of the membrane can be estimated by combining Î³ s l w and Î³ s a b the contact angles between the membrane surface and the selected liquid were measured by a drop shape analyzer dsa25 kruss germany using the sessile drop measurement of a 2 Î¼ l liquid sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization of fouling layer via analyzed oct imaging by employing the algorithm described in section 2 2d and 3d images were obtained for both the c pvdf and c ptfe membranes during the experimental period for the 2d oct only the cross section of the c pvdf membrane fig 4 b clearly indicates changes in the membrane top layer morphology during the experimental period fouling particles were distributed on top of the membrane layer with a thickness of 98 Âµm over the course of the 24 h experiment in the case of the c ptfe there was no significant difference between the initial and end of experiment images as shown in fig 4 a in the case of 3d image analysis the membrane layer and fouling layer was successfully separated for both the c pvdf and c ptfe a thick and high packing density fouling layer was observed in the case of the c pvdf with a fouling layer thickness of 146 Âµm being observed after the 24 h experiment in contrast to the c pvdf a thin and disperse fouling layer with a thickness of 22 Âµm was found to have formed in the c ptfe case after 24 h the difference in fouling layers for both cases will be discussed in section 3 3 analyzing fouling behavior in comparison with the 2d oct 1 the fouling layer thickness of the c ptfe can be observed and 2 the fouling layer thickness was 48 Âµm smaller than in the 3d oct for the c pvdf indicating that the proposed 3d image analysis can have higher resolution in identifying fouling layer through the visualization the 3d image analysis method provided additional information such as fouling layer morphology fouling layer volume and fouling area coverage which was not contained in 2d image especially in the c ptfe case which exhibited thin and disperse fouling growth observations shown in fig s1 are supported by the sem images of the original and fouled membrane in the pvdf case foulant was closely packed on the surface and discovered inside the membrane channel for the ptfe the fouling layer was loosely packed and some pores could be observed from the surface 3 2 quantifying the fouling layer separation of the fouling layer from the membrane layer enables further characterization of the foulant four different aspects fouling layer volume fouling index fouling area proportion and fouling layer thickness were estimated from the analyzed data fouling layer volume was calculated by multiplying the total number of foulant voxels by the specific volume of each voxel fouling layer thickness was calculated by averaging the height of the foulant at each x y coordinate in which foulant voxels were detected in the analyzed image in addition the fouling area proportion was calculated by dividing the fouling area by the membrane area membrane area was obtained from the scanned area in the oct 3d data and fouling area was then estimated using an algorithm to count the total amount of pixels x y containing non zero data in its longitudinal axis multiplied by the specific area ratio which is the ratio between actual area and each pixel f o u l i n g a r e a p r o p o r t i o n f o u l i n g c o v e r a g e a r e a m e m b r a n e a r e a moreover the fouling index which is the ratio between the fouling layer volume and fouling area can be evaluated the fouling index value can provide a quantifying indicator which considers the effect of both fouling layer volume and area as it reflects the packing efficiency of fouling particles in the fouling layer f o u l i n g i n d e x f o u l i n g l a y e r v o l u m e f o u l i n g l a y e r c o v e r a g e a series of 3d oct images was collected during the 24 h membrane distillation experiment the evaluated fouling area proportion foulant volume fouling layer thickness and fouling index based on the proposed algorithm are plotted in fig 7 which identifies the possible trends of the parameters figs 5 and 6 illustrate the deposition morphology variation for both the c ptfe and c pvdf cases in the c ptfe case the tiny fouling particles attached on the membrane s top layer and formed a thin fouling layer the fouling layer remained stable at around 20 Âµm for the duration of the experiment after it was first observed at 4 h fouling layer coverage growth demonstrated a logarithmic relationship with time from 0 to 99 8 during the experimental period fouling layer volume also increased with time but at a faster rate than fouling and thus the fouling index increases with time over the time period between 4 and 24 h the fouling index increased by 54 this indicates that the foulant particles aggregate together and have sufficient time to form a more tightly packed fouling layer in the case of the c pvdf similarly with the c ptfe growth in the coverage of the fouling layer was logarithmic with time during the md experimental period thickness of the fouling layer was maintained at around 135 Âµm between 4 and 20 h and started to increase at 24 h fouling layer volume was also observed to increase with time however the effect was compensated for by the increasing rate in the growth of the fouling area moreover foulant particles were more greatly attracted more to the membrane layer but not the fouling layer interaction of foulant particles and the membrane layer will be discussed in section 3 3 analyzing fouling behavior as a result the fouling index remained stable at around 0 0675 Âµm 3 Âµm2 in the time period between 4 and 20 h at 24 h foulant covered the entire membrane surface and there were no free sites for foulant particles to attach to the membrane layer resulting in deposition on the fouling layer hence the top fouling layer began to thicken and increased in volume which thickness and fouling index significantly increasing from 130 62 to 146 09 Âµm and 0 068 to 0 076 Âµm 3 Âµm2 respectively between 20 and 24 h 3 3 analyzing fouling behavior overall the normalized flux decline in the c ptfe membrane was lower than in the c pvdf during the experiment period from fig 8 it can be observed that the c ptfe and c pvdf flux decreased by 18 and 30 respectively during the membrane distillation experiment normalized flux decreased at a higher initial rate c ptfe 0 425 per h and c pvdf 0 625 per h and became nearly stable after 10 h with normalized flux of the c ptfe and c pvdf equal to 0 82 and 0 68 respectively although the proportion of fouling layer area was similar for both cases at the end of the experiment fouling layer volume for the c pvdf 0 1409 Âµm 3 was more than 12 times larger when compared with the c ptfe 0 0114 Âµm 3 therefore it follows that the c pvdf fouling index 0 0763 Âµm 3 Âµm2 was larger than for the c ptfe 0 0068 Âµm 3 Âµm2 as normalized flux depends on the overall membrane resistance which is the combination of membrane resistance and foulant resistance significantly higher fouling index values would result in a surge of fouling resistance significantly decreasing normalized flux srisurichan et al 2006 moreover it should be noted that although the fouling index increased 10 fold the decline in normalized flux did not demonstrate a similar trend flux resistance caused by foulant was not proportional to the increase in fouling index indicating the effect of packing efficiency on fouling resistance is limited further wetting only occurred in the c pvdf case as indicated by the conductivity rise during the experiment when comparing the cross sectional images after the experiment for both membranes foulant was found to have entered into the pores resulting in wetting for the c pvdf fig s1c and f similar trends in foulant volume fouling index fouling area and fouling layer thickness were observed between the proposed approach m1 and the cross correlation approach m2 with both the c pvdf and c ptfe scenarios as shown in fig 7 however significant deviation was observed after 4 h monitoring especially in the c ptfe case for fouling area proportion and foulant volume when comparing the cross correlation approach to the suggested approach this can be attributed to the thin foulant layer and significant shifting of the c ptfe membrane after 4 h which caused the cross correlation approach to consider the thin foulant layer as a membrane layer resulting in an underestimate of the fouling layer coverage at the same time a certain position with a thicker fouling layer led to overestimation of the fouling volume because the cross correlation considered the membrane layer as foulant as a result the fouling index of the cross correlation approach m2 is larger than the proposed filtering approach m1 for the c pvdf case as the fouling layer was thick the effect of membrane shifting on the cross relation approach was significantly reduced thus deviations of value between the two approaches were less significant than in the c ptfe case the fouling index demonstrated a similar trend with the highest growing rate being at the initial time and only gradually increasing after 10 h according to fig 7d although the volume of the fouling layer increased rapidly with time growth in the coverage area compensated for the effect which resulted in only a small increase in the fouling index however after 5 h the fouling index became relatively stable indicating the growth of the fouling layer was limited by the fouling layer thickness eventually the rate of decline in the normalized flux reduced and became stable as shown in fig 7a the growth rate of the fouling layer decreased with time aggregation of the fouling particle induced the polarization and depolarization mechanisms limiting the growth of the fouling layer on top of the membrane surface during the experiment chen et al 1997 in md the system does not exert any external force other than vapor pressure which occurs due to the pressure difference from the fouling layer thickness relationship with time we observe that it did not significantly increase until nearly the entire membrane surface was covered by the membrane foulant moreover from the visualization of fouling layer foulant particles tended to occupy the non fouled area instead of continuing to grow on the existing fouling layer which provides additional evidence to support to argument these findings are in line with the literature which notes that fouling displays high heterogeneity in its early stage and becomes homogeneous in its later stage fortunato et al 2019 2017 the result indicates the polarization interaction between the foulant particles prohibit growth of the foulant layer increases of distillate flux reduce fouling layer depolarization which allows the formation of the fouling layer chen et al 1997 with the increase in the fouling layer distillate flux reduces increasing the depolarization process and reducing the fouling layer growth rate 3 4 effect of membrane surface energy on antifouling nevertheless the magnitude of adhesion which is correlated to surface energy between foulant and membrane surface also affects the growth of fouling layer thus membranes with low surface energy can achieve greater antifouling behavior determining the surface free energy assists with comparing the antifouling performance in fig 9 both c pvdf and c ptfe demonstrate a linear correlation between Î³ l l w Î³ l a b and Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³ l a b with r2 0 9645 and 0 9768 respectively indicating that the predicted water ethylene glycol surface tension approach can provide an accurate measurement of surface energy of the membrane the estimated Î³ s Î³ s a b and Î³ s l w of c pvdf and c ptfe are listed in table 1 c pvdf 10 84 mn m has a higher surface energy Î³ s than c ptfe 3 33 mn m comparing the polar interaction Î³ s a b of c pvdf 0 09 mn m and c ptfe 0 46 mn m were both smaller than 1 moreover the non dispersive surface energy Î³ s a b contributes 0 83 and 13 8 to overall surface energy respectively for the c pvdf and c ptfe as the adhesive interaction of the non dispersive interaction depends on 2 Î³ s a b Î³ l a b the relatively low Î³ s a b leads to an overall less significant interaction furthermore fouling particles usually have a lower non dispersive surface energy Î³ l a b than dispersive surface energy Î³ l l w with the ratio between Î³ l a b Î³ l from 0 08 to 0 25 and Î³ l l w Î³ l from 0 92 to 0 75 depending on the type of colloids brant and childress 2002 therefore the dispersive component of surface energy is the major parameter controlling the adhesion of the fouling particles onto the membrane surface c ptfe has a significantly lower dispersive surface energy Î³ s l w than the c pvdf resulting in a lower overall membrane surface energy a stronger van der waal s force was found in the c pvdf membrane than in the c ptfe as indicated by the Î³ s l w therefore the membrane interaction with cationic dye is more attractive an et al 2016 as the adhesion force caused by dispersive surface energy is dependent on 2 Î³ s l w Î³ l l w the smaller Î³ s l w reduces the adhesive interaction between fouling particles and the membrane surface compared with the 3d foulant growth in figs 5 and 6 the lower adhesive interaction between the fouling particles and c ptfe membrane caused a reduction in the thickness of the fouling layer thus a disperse and thin fouling layer was observed instead of thick fouling layer as for the c pvdf which has a lower anti foulant capacity due to its higher surface energy 4 conclusions in this study we reported on an advanced approach for characterizing different aspects of membrane fouling using a reduced amount of 3d images through the newly developed analysis technique the following findings were discovered fouling layer and membrane layer can be separated by the proposed approach which assists with the monitoring of fouling layer morphology during distillation experiments in comparison with traditional 2d imagery the 3d image analysis approach not only provided additional information regarding the disperse and thin fouling layer in the case of the c ptfe membrane but also allowed for analysis of fouling layer volume thickness coverage and determination of the fouling index to identify the effect of the foulant on flux decline this can be useful for enabling in situ monitoring of foulants in membrane distillation or other membrane water treatment methods moreover this method helped in the identification of fouling layers which are hidden or difficult to observe in 2d oct compared with the previous proposed cross correlation technique employed in other studies the application of intensity range filters to trace membrane shifting can largely reduce the volume of data required to identify the fouling layer from the results the accuracy of fouling layer identification can be maintained through both the membrane surface energy analysis and the analyzed data from 3d oct the strong antifouling performance observed from the analyzed c ptfe image could be explained by its relatively low surface energy when compared to the c pvdf hydrophilic hydrophobic interaction between dye molecules and the membrane surface caused the difference in fouling layer growth therefore oct based characterization is possible to be applied as long term real time

16595,membrane fouling which is caused by the deposition of particles on the membrane surface or pores reduces system performance in membrane distillation md applications resulting in increased operational costs poor recovery and system failure optical coherence tomography enables in situ foulant monitoring in both 2d and 3d however the 2d images can only determine fouling layer thickness in severe fouling therefore in this study an advanced 3d imaging analysis technique using intensity range filters was proposed to quantify fouling layer formation during md through the use of a single 3d

challenging as it contains a significant amount of foulants including particular matters and organic and inorganic substances such as oils and mineral participates during membrane based treatment processes concentration of the feed solution and the resulting concentration polarization of the substances increases the chance of their deposition on the membrane surface initiating the fouling process deposition of foulants is mainly affected by the direction of permeate flow and the free energy interaction between the membrane surface and foulant tijing et al 2015 the accumulation of foulants reduces the amount of free membrane channels available for vapor transport through the membrane reducing membrane flux and treatment efficiency in some cases studies have shown md performance can be reduced by as much as 40 after a 48 h experiment using commercial membranes as a result of growth in the fouling layer kharraz and an 2020 moreover this phenomenon reduces the hydrophobicity of the membrane which increases its susceptibility to membrane wetting in serious cases the membrane becomes fully covered by the fouling layer and no vapor can pass through the membrane in long term testing kharraz and an 2020 monitoring the growth of the foulant layer is a required to examine the cause of fouling layer formation and determine the optimal timing for membrane cleaning flux measurement overtime is typically used as a method to monitor growth in the foulant layer park et al 2019 ramezanianpour and sivakumar 2014 the specific resistance concept has also been applied to evaluate the effect of fouling based on permeate flux data as this approach can help to compare the antifouling ability of a membrane or the effect of wastewater quality on fouling growth although the approach is simple as no extra monitoring required it cannot identify the growth of the fouling layer or the effect of concentration polarization on membrane flux decline scanning electron microscopy can examine the fouling layer however it cannot be performed in situ zou et al 2018 therefore different signal detection methods have been proposed to monitor the foulant growth in real time optical methods include optical in situ fouling detection microscopy and optical coherence tomography oct optical in situ wetting detection is done via the application of a white led light panel placed behind the membrane on the permeate side jacob et al 2020 variations in led light intensity correspond to the growth of the fouling layer and therefore this approach is limited to membrane which light can penetrate traditional microscopy resolution is low and is insufficient to identify initial fouling and the depth of the fouling layer non optical methods include electrical impedance spectroscopy eis which monitors the current impedance resistance and reactance of the membrane during membrane treatment processes chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 the growth of the fouling layer alters the electrical conductivity of the membrane layer causing a decrease of reactance when fouling occurs optical coherence tomography oct has been adopted to monitor and analyze the fouling layer as it can capture the depth profile of the layer using near infrared light fortunato et al 2019 2018 kerdi et al 2019 similar to microscopy techniques it can be monitored in real time without affecting the experiment moreover oct resolution can be as low as the microscale which represents a significant improvement over the conventional microscopy technique through oct 2d and 3d images of the fouling layer can be observed gao et al 2014a and several quantitative analysis techniques have been developed in recent studies to study the fouling layer image analyzing software is commonly used to analyze oct images in which a 2d image is used to visualize the growth of the fouling layer on a single line across the membrane g guo et al 2020 j guo et al 2020 shang et al 2020 trinh et al 2019 however foulant growth may be masked by the uneven roughness of the membrane causing initial fouling to remain unobserved in recent studies 3d images were used to provide higher resolution data for analyzing the fouling layer gao et al 2014b kerdi et al 2019 image analyzing software was used to extract the fouling layer based on intensity differences between the membrane and fouling layer using a membrane image from a top view to estimate fouling layer coverage fortunato and leiknes 2017 programming software such as matlab was then used to identify the fouling layer using the subtraction method based on the membrane position at the initial stage liu et al 2017 however these results can be affected by unstable fluctuations of the membrane along its longitudinal axis with time reducing the accuracy and usability of the data resolving membrane fouling layer morphology was limited and imprecise as a result of this uncertainty to alleviate the membrane shifting problem statistical similarity has been employed to detect changes in the membrane layer by continuously comparing with a previous 3d image however this method requires capturing large volume of consecutive 3d images at short time intervals to accurately determine membrane shifting as a result high computational power and memory for data processing is required which reduces the applicability of oct for industrial purposes in this study an advanced oct based 3d image analyzing technique was developed using matlab to distinguish the membrane from the fouling layer from a single 3d image improving the accuracy of fouling layer characterization through the development of an algorithm involving intensity range filters industrial textile wastewater was used as the feed for the membrane distillation experiments to simulate a real world oct monitoring scenario and two commercial membranes a polyvinylidene fluoride c pvdf and a polytetrafluoroethylene c ptfe were used in the testing the proposed system not only demonstrated increased precision in identifying the fouling but also a significant reduction in the required amount of 3d image data for long term monitoring of the fouling layer without sacrificing precision through the application of the new analysis technique membrane fouling layer volume fouling layer thickness and fouling layer coverage can also be estimated enabling further analysis of fouling layer growth in this study dyeing wastewater was selected as the feed guo et al 2020 trovaslet et al 2008 varjani et al 2020 as it is one of the largest contributors to water pollution hydrophilic hydrophobic interactions between the dye and hydrophobic membranes can induce severe fouling in membrane distillation applications an et al 2017 2016 therefore textile wastewater containing hydrophilic dyes acid red 18 acid yellow 36 and crystal violet was used in this study to validate the performance of the proposed approach for fouling observation khan et al 2020 sarabadan et al 2019 yang et al 2010 in addition to fouling layer characteristics the interactions between fouling particles and the membrane surface are commonly assessed via the surface energy approach non dispersive acid base ab and dispersive van der waals lw interactions between the membrane and foulant are considered zamani et al 2016 surface energy of the membrane is commonly determined using the multiple liquid approach based on contact angle measurements between the membrane surface and liquids chang et al 2020 chen et al 2017 lin et al 2014 yim et al 2020 however this approach requires liquids with known surface tensions leading to limited choices with 3 liquids with known surface tension being commonly used for surface free energy estimation uncertainty in the liquid can have a significant impact on contact angle measurement and surface energy estimation and therefore liquid mixtures have been suggested to alleviate this issue burdzik et al 2018 surface tension properties of inert non volatile and non toxic binary mixtures can be determined based on the mixture composition zhang et al 2019 with water ethylene glycol having been confirmed to be one of the potential combinations with this approach extra contact angle measurements can be conducted to improve the accuracy of surface energy estimation through surface energy estimation the strength of the interaction between the membrane and foulant in this case a hydrophilic dye can be compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 commercial membrane fouling experiment a direct contact membrane distillation dcmd with in situ oct experimental setup is presented in fig 1 commercial pvdf c pvdf and commercial ptfe c ptfe membranes were used to treat the wastewater with the c pvdf membrane millipore usa having a 0 45 Âµm pore size hvhp and the c ptfe membrane tf 200 pall gelman usa having a 0 20 Âµm pore size feed temperature and permeate temperature were maintained at 60 c and 20 c respectively using a hotplate and chiller at a flow rate of 0 5 l min wastewater with a methylene blue concentration of 20 ppm used was collected from a jeans manufacturer in hui zhou china to better simulate real world conditions sample were mixed with three different dyes acid red 18 acid yellow 36 and crystal violet to achieve a concentration of 20 ppm for each dye thus a feed with a dye concentration of 80 ppm was prepared for the md performance flux was measured by measuring the rate of change in mass on the permeate side per unit of effective membrane area during the experiment oct monitoring was conducted in parallel using a dcmd module with a glass window which allowed the light source from the oct probe to reach the membrane surface to obtain the data the scanned region of membrane area measured 1 31 x 1 46 mm which represents 205 320 data points an oct system ganymede ii thorlabs gmbh dechau germany with an lsm03 scan lens was used in this experiment to capture the 2d and 3d imagery capturing of 2d images was accomplished by b scan or a series of a scan which is depth profile scanning in a straight line 3d images were capture by a scan in both the x and y direction to provide a 3d depth profile in the fouling experiment 3d images were captured at a rate of 1 image per hour for the first 4 h to observe the initial growth of foulant from 4 to 24 h the capturing rate was 1 image per 4 h to observe long term variations in the fouling layer for comparison a 2d image was also captured at initial time experiment time 0 h and at the end of the experiment experiment time 24 h scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss germany was also applied to 1 validate the findings from the oct and 2 study the clean and fouled membrane surface morphology 2 2 oct image data analysis 2 2 1 2d image 2d image data contained a 435 483 matrix created by the b scan all pixels in the dataset correspond to a point in the 1 31 x 1 46 mm scanned area a noise filter was applied to filter the 2d image and the thickness of foulant layer was estimated by processing the depth profile a scan dataset using matlab 2 2 2 3d image the obtained 3d scanned image consists of a 435 483 472 matrix overall voxels of the dataset correspond to an intensity in a volume of 1 31 x 1 46 x 1 40 mm in this study the foulant voxel was considered as a voxel in which the intensity is higher than the background noise level and not in the membrane region moreover the intensity value of the oct is based on the light scattering of the particle at the sampling location thus a higher intensity can be representative of the coagulation of the foulants forming the fouling voxels water which is easily penetrated by light does not provide a strong signal compared with the foulants the membrane scatters light more significantly providing a stronger intensity signal thus the membrane and foulant layer can be identified by analyzing the 3d image due to their different intensities in a previous study identification of fouling pixels or voxels was done using subtraction or statistical techniques for subtraction the datasets were subtracted by the intensity at the initial time in which fouling had not yet occurred gao et al 2014b however in the experiment the shifting position of the membrane may reduce the accuracy of fouling layer identification therefore the statistical technique was applied to compare the intensity matrix with earlier data to identifying the shifting of the membrane layer reducing the membrane shifting error in fouling identification li et al 2016a however as previously discussed the statistical technique requires a short time interval 5 min for data acquisition to accurately identify membrane shifting which requires large volume datasets this short time requirement makes the approach infeasible for long term fouling monitoring as a single image size can be as large as 300 mb for a single 1 0 x 1 0 x 1 5 mm area in a 3d image to overcome both the accuracy and data size problem an advanced analysis technique was introduced in this study as shown in figs 2 and 3 the proposed technique identifies the membrane layer and fouling layer in a single dataset based on the filtered data by applying intensity range filters filterlow and filterhigh which are a technique to filter signals which are outside of selected intensity boundary as the membrane layer intensity is significantly higher than the fouling layer intensity filterlow is set at a low tolerance to low intensity data to screen out noise and the fouling layer leaving only the membrane layer the vertical position of the top membrane layer is saved for each x and y coordinate filterhigh which has a relatively high tolerance to low intensity data was then used to screen out noise leaving only the fouling voxels and membrane layer remaining the fouling voxels are then screened out by setting the intensity value below the z position of the top membrane layer acquired from the filterlow to zero to reduce the effect of flowing foulant a tolerance level is set such that the signal will be filtered out if the height different between the surface foulant and flowing foulant is greater than 5 voxels in height thus the voxels which are not directly touching the membrane will not be counted as a foulant voxels in addition foulant voxels which are attached to the membrane can be identified at initial time t 0 the membrane is clean without any foulant present thus filterlow can be determined by averaging the top layer membrane intensity filterhigh is determined based on the image at completion t t end where 1 foulant voxels can be observed and 2 background noise is eliminated the filtering range for filterlow and filterhigh were set as 55 and 33 respectively in analyzing the 3d image data to compare the performance of the proposed strategy foulant estimation was conducted through membrane surface tracking using the cross correlation approach li et al 2016b membrane surface shifting was determined by comparing the image at time t to time t 1 by minimizing the cross correlation coefficient remaining foulant voxels were then considered as the foulant growth during the period all algorithms in this study were programmed with matlab to estimate the fouling voxels for the 3d image data obtained in the experiment oct images were captured at 1 h intervals for the first 4 and at 4 h intervals between 4 and 24 h 2 3 membrane surface energy characterization connors and wright suggested the correlation method for estimating the mixture surface tension Î³ m i x as shown in eq 1 in which x i is the molar fraction of the liquid component i e water and ethylene glycol in this study a and b are the combined partition coefficient parameters 1 Î³ m i x Î³ 1 1 b x 1 1 a x 1 x 2 Î³ 1 Î³ 2 dispersive surface tension of the mixture Î³ m i x l w can be determined using the berthelot mixing rule as shown as eq 2 where Î´ l 1 l 2 is binary interaction parameter 2 Î³ m i x l w x 1 2 Î³ 1 l w 2 x 1 x 2 1 Î´ 1 2 Î³ 1 l w Î³ 2 l w x 2 2 Î³ 2 l w as the total surface tension of a liquid Î³ m i x is the sum of dispersive Î³ m i x l w and non dispersive Î³ m i x a b components surface tension Î³ m i x a b can be estimated by eq 3 3 Î³ m i x a b Î³ m i x Î³ m i x l w in this experiment in addition to using different mixing ratios of water and ethylene glycol to manipulate surface tension of the liquid glycerol was also used surface tension of the water ethylene glycol mixture was estimated using eqs 1 3 with a 0 793 and b 0 825 zhang et al 2019 Î³ a b and Î³

liquid gas Î³ l g interfaces can be written as 4 Î³ s g Î³ s l Î³ l g c o s Î¸ the owens wendt method is a common methodology to separate the dispersive Î³ s l w and polar interaction Î³ s a b of interfacial surface tension zhang et al 2019 the subscripts s and l represent the membrane surface and the liquid respectively 5 Î³ s l Î³ s Î³ l 2 Î³ s l w Î³ l l w 2 Î³ s a b Î³ l a b therefore by substituting young s equation eq 5 can be rewritten as eq 6 6 Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³ l l w Î³ s l w Î³ l a b Î³ s a b in which the left hand and right hand side represent the cohesion free energy of the liquid and the adhesion free energy between the membrane surface and liquid respectively brant and childress 2002 7 Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³ l a b Î³ l l w Î³ s l w Î³ l a b Î³ s a b linear regression can be done based on eq 7 by considering Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³ l a b and Î³ l l w Î³ l a b as the dependent variables thus the square of the slope and y intercept are equivalent to Î³ s l w and Î³ s a b respectively as a result overall surface energy of the membrane can be estimated by combining Î³ s l w and Î³ s a b the contact angles between the membrane surface and the selected liquid were measured by a drop shape analyzer dsa25 kruss germany using the sessile drop measurement of a 2 Î¼ l liquid sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization of fouling layer via analyzed oct imaging by employing the algorithm described in section 2 2d and 3d images were obtained for both the c pvdf and c ptfe membranes during the experimental period for the 2d oct only the cross section of the c pvdf membrane fig 4 b clearly indicates changes in the membrane top layer morphology during the experimental period fouling particles were distributed on top of the membrane layer with a thickness of 98 Âµm over the course of the 24 h experiment in the case of the c ptfe there was no significant difference between the initial and end of experiment images as shown in fig 4 a in the case of 3d image analysis the membrane layer and fouling layer was successfully separated for both the c pvdf and c ptfe a thick and high packing density fouling layer was observed in the case of the c pvdf with a fouling layer thickness of 146 Âµm being observed after the 24 h experiment in contrast to the c pvdf a thin and disperse fouling layer with a thickness of 22 Âµm was found to have formed in the c ptfe case after 24 h the difference in fouling layers for both cases will be discussed in section 3 3 analyzing fouling behavior in comparison with the 2d oct 1 the fouling layer thickness of the c ptfe can be observed and 2 the fouling layer thickness was 48 Âµm smaller than in the 3d oct for the c pvdf indicating that the proposed 3d image analysis can have higher resolution in identifying fouling layer through the visualization the 3d image analysis method provided additional information such as fouling layer morphology fouling layer volume and fouling area coverage which was not contained in 2d image especially in the c ptfe case which exhibited thin and disperse fouling growth observations shown in fig s1 are supported by the sem images of the original and fouled membrane in the pvdf case foulant was closely packed on the surface and discovered inside the membrane channel for the ptfe the fouling layer was loosely packed and some pores could be observed from the surface 3 2 quantifying the fouling layer separation of the fouling layer from the membrane layer enables further characterization of the foulant four different aspects fouling layer volume fouling index fouling area proportion and fouling layer thickness were estimated from the analyzed data fouling layer volume was calculated by multiplying the total number of foulant voxels by the specific volume of each voxel fouling layer thickness was calculated by averaging the height of the foulant at each x y coordinate in which foulant voxels were detected in the analyzed image in addition the fouling area proportion was calculated by dividing the fouling area by the membrane area membrane area was obtained from the scanned area in the oct 3d data and fouling area was then estimated using an algorithm to count the total amount of pixels x y containing non zero data in its longitudinal axis multiplied by the specific area ratio which is the ratio between actual area and each pixel f o u l i n g a r e a p r o p o r t i o n f o u l i n g c o v e r a g e a r e a m e m b r a n e a r e a moreover the fouling index which is the ratio between the fouling layer volume and fouling area can be evaluated the fouling index value can provide a quantifying indicator which considers the effect of both fouling layer volume and area as it reflects the packing efficiency of fouling particles in the fouling layer f o u l i n g i n d e x f o u l i n g l a y e r v o l u m e f o u l i n g l a y e r c o v e r a g e a series of 3d oct images was collected during the 24 h membrane distillation experiment the evaluated fouling area proportion foulant volume fouling layer thickness and fouling index based on the proposed algorithm are plotted in fig 7 which identifies the possible trends of the parameters figs 5 and 6 illustrate the deposition morphology variation for both the c ptfe and c pvdf cases in the c ptfe case the tiny fouling particles attached on the membrane s top layer and formed a thin fouling layer the fouling layer remained stable at around 20 Âµm for the duration of the experiment after it was first observed at 4 h fouling layer coverage growth demonstrated a logarithmic relationship with time from 0 to 99 8 during the experimental period fouling layer volume also increased with time but at a faster rate than fouling and thus the fouling index increases with time over the time period between 4 and 24 h the fouling index increased by 54 this indicates that the foulant particles aggregate together and have sufficient time to form a more tightly packed fouling layer in the case of the c pvdf similarly with the c ptfe growth in the coverage of the fouling layer was logarithmic with time during the md experimental period thickness of the fouling layer was maintained at around 135 Âµm between 4 and 20 h and started to increase at 24 h fouling layer volume was also observed to increase with time however the effect was compensated for by the increasing rate in the growth of the fouling area moreover foulant particles were more greatly attracted more to the membrane layer but not the fouling layer interaction of foulant particles and the membrane layer will be discussed in section 3 3 analyzing fouling behavior as a result the fouling index remained stable at around 0 0675 Âµm 3 Âµm2 in the time period between 4 and 20 h at 24 h foulant covered the entire membrane surface and there were no free sites for foulant particles to attach to the membrane layer resulting in deposition on the fouling layer hence the top fouling layer began to thicken and increased in volume which thickness and fouling index significantly increasing from 130 62 to 146 09 Âµm and 0 068 to 0 076 Âµm 3 Âµm2 respectively between 20 and 24 h 3 3 analyzing fouling behavior overall the normalized flux decline in the c ptfe membrane was lower than in the c pvdf during the experiment period from fig 8 it can be observed that the c ptfe and c pvdf flux decreased by 18 and 30 respectively during the membrane distillation experiment normalized flux decreased at a higher initial rate c ptfe 0 425 per h and c pvdf 0 625 per h and became nearly stable after 10 h with normalized flux of the c ptfe and c pvdf equal to 0 82 and 0 68 respectively although the proportion of fouling layer area was similar for both cases at the end of the experiment fouling layer volume for the c pvdf 0 1409 Âµm 3 was more than 12 times larger when compared with the c ptfe 0 0114 Âµm 3 therefore it follows that the c pvdf fouling index 0 0763 Âµm 3 Âµm2 was larger than for the c ptfe 0 0068 Âµm 3 Âµm2 as normalized flux depends on the overall membrane resistance which is the combination of membrane resistance and foulant resistance significantly higher fouling index values would result in a surge of fouling resistance significantly decreasing normalized flux srisurichan et al 2006 moreover it should be noted that although the fouling index increased 10 fold the decline in normalized flux did not demonstrate a similar trend flux resistance caused by foulant was not proportional to the increase in fouling index indicating the effect of packing efficiency on fouling resistance is limited further wetting only occurred in the c pvdf case as indicated by the conductivity rise during the experiment when comparing the cross sectional images after the experiment for both membranes foulant was found to have entered into the pores resulting in wetting for the c pvdf fig s1c and f similar trends in foulant volume fouling index fouling area and fouling layer thickness were observed between the proposed approach m1 and the cross correlation approach m2 with both the c pvdf and c ptfe scenarios as shown in fig 7 however significant deviation was observed after 4 h monitoring especially in the c ptfe case for fouling area proportion and foulant volume when comparing the cross correlation approach to the suggested approach this can be attributed to the thin foulant layer and significant shifting of the c ptfe membrane after 4 h which caused the cross correlation approach to consider the thin foulant layer as a membrane layer resulting in an underestimate of the fouling layer coverage at the same time a certain position with a thicker fouling layer led to overestimation of the fouling volume because the cross correlation considered the membrane layer as foulant as a result the fouling index of the cross correlation approach m2 is larger than the proposed filtering approach m1 for the c pvdf case as the fouling layer was thick the effect of membrane shifting on the cross relation approach was significantly reduced thus deviations of value between the two approaches were less significant than in the c ptfe case the fouling index demonstrated a similar trend with the highest growing rate being at the initial time and only gradually increasing after 10 h according to fig 7d although the volume of the fouling layer increased rapidly with time growth in the coverage area compensated for the effect which resulted in only a small increase in the fouling index however after 5 h the fouling index became relatively stable indicating the growth of the fouling layer was limited by the fouling layer thickness eventually the rate of decline in the normalized flux reduced and became stable as shown in fig 7a the growth rate of the fouling layer decreased with time aggregation of the fouling particle induced the polarization and depolarization mechanisms limiting the growth of the fouling layer on top of the membrane surface during the experiment chen et al 1997 in md the system does not exert any external force other than vapor pressure which occurs due to the pressure difference from the fouling layer thickness relationship with time we observe that it did not significantly increase until nearly the entire membrane surface was covered by the membrane foulant moreover from the visualization of fouling layer foulant particles tended to occupy the non fouled area instead of continuing to grow on the existing fouling layer which provides additional evidence to support to argument these findings are in line with the literature which notes that fouling displays high heterogeneity in its early stage and becomes homogeneous in its later stage fortunato et al 2019 2017 the result indicates the polarization interaction between the foulant particles prohibit growth of the foulant layer increases of distillate flux reduce fouling layer depolarization which allows the formation of the fouling layer chen et al 1997 with the increase in the fouling layer distillate flux reduces increasing the depolarization process and reducing the fouling layer growth rate 3 4 effect of membrane surface energy on antifouling nevertheless the magnitude of adhesion which is correlated to surface energy between foulant and membrane surface also affects the growth of fouling layer thus membranes with low surface energy can achieve greater antifouling behavior determining the surface free energy assists with comparing the antifouling performance in fig 9 both c pvdf and c ptfe demonstrate a linear correlation between Î³ l l w Î³ l a b and Î³ l 1 c o s Î¸ 2 Î³ l a b with r2 0 9645 and 0 9768 respectively indicating that the predicted water ethylene glycol surface tension approach can provide an accurate measurement of surface energy of the membrane the estimated Î³ s Î³ s a b and Î³ s l w of c pvdf and c ptfe are listed in table 1 c pvdf 10 84 mn m has a higher surface energy Î³ s than c ptfe 3 33 mn m comparing the polar interaction Î³ s a b of c pvdf 0 09 mn m and c ptfe 0 46 mn m were both smaller than 1 moreover the non dispersive surface energy Î³ s a b contributes 0 83 and 13 8 to overall surface energy respectively for the c pvdf and c ptfe as the adhesive interaction of the non dispersive interaction depends on 2 Î³ s a b Î³ l a b the relatively low Î³ s a b leads to an overall less significant interaction furthermore fouling particles usually have a lower non dispersive surface energy Î³ l a b than dispersive surface energy Î³ l l w with the ratio between Î³ l a b Î³ l from 0 08 to 0 25 and Î³ l l w Î³ l from 0 92 to 0 75 depending on the type of colloids brant and childress 2002 therefore the dispersive component of surface energy is the major parameter controlling the adhesion of the fouling particles onto the membrane surface c ptfe has a significantly lower dispersive surface energy Î³ s l w than the c pvdf resulting in a lower overall membrane surface energy a stronger van der waal s force was found in the c pvdf membrane than in the c ptfe as indicated by the Î³ s l w therefore the membrane interaction with cationic dye is more attractive an et al 2016 as the adhesion force caused by dispersive surface energy is dependent on 2 Î³ s l w Î³ l l w the smaller Î³ s l w reduces the adhesive interaction between fouling particles and the membrane surface compared with the 3d foulant growth in figs 5 and 6 the lower adhesive interaction between the fouling particles and c ptfe membrane caused a reduction in the thickness of the fouling layer thus a disperse and thin fouling layer was observed instead of thick fouling layer as for the c pvdf which has a lower anti foulant capacity due to its higher surface energy 4 conclusions in this study we reported on an advanced approach for characterizing different aspects of membrane fouling using a reduced amount of 3d images through the newly developed analysis technique the following findings were discovered fouling layer and membrane layer can be separated by the proposed approach which assists with the monitoring of fouling layer morphology during distillation experiments in comparison with traditional 2d imagery the 3d image analysis approach not only provided additional information regarding the disperse and thin fouling layer in the case of the c ptfe membrane but also allowed for analysis of fouling layer volume thickness coverage and determination of the fouling index to identify the effect of the foulant on flux decline this can be useful for enabling in situ monitoring of foulants in membrane distillation or other membrane water treatment methods moreover this method helped in the identification of fouling layers which are hidden or difficult to observe in 2d oct compared with the previous proposed cross correlation technique employed in other studies the application of intensity range filters to trace membrane shifting can largely reduce the volume of data required to identify the fouling layer from the results the accuracy of fouling layer identification can be maintained through both the membrane surface energy analysis and the analyzed data from 3d oct the strong antifouling performance observed from the analyzed c ptfe image could be explained by its relatively low surface energy when compared to the c pvdf hydrophilic hydrophobic interaction between dye molecules and the membrane surface caused the difference in fouling layer growth therefore oct based characterization is possible to be applied as long term real time

indicated that reactive manganese species rmns i e mn iii and mn v rather than radicals from mn vii photolysis participated in the conversion of model compounds interestingly roles of rmns differed among three model compounds suggesting their selectivity toward micropollutants increasing mn vii dosage proved greater micropollutant degradation while impacts of ph on ss mn vii performance varied

degradation by ss mn vii were examined specifically hco3 positively influenced the 4 cp and p hba degradation whereas enr was not affected likely owing to the selectivity of rmns hco3 complexes ha was conducive to degrade p hba due to the production of rmns ha complexes but unfavorable for enr and 4 cp degradation because of the competitive light absorption and mn vii furthermore a number of

of storage low cost comparative stability effectiveness over a wide ph range and lack of undesirable byproducts sun et al 2013 moreover the ultimate product manganese dioxide mno2 can work as an adsorbent and a mild oxidant sun et al 2013 wei et al 2021 therefore mn vii is a promising environmentally friendly oxidant in water treatment despite of these advances mn vii is a selective oxidant which prefers to react with micropollutants containing electron rich organic moieties but exhibits low reactivity with some refractory micropollutants shi et al 2020 xu et al 2016 these defects might hinder the application of mn vii in water treatment in this sense bisulfite ligands e g humic acid ha pyrophosphate pp silicate and so forth have been employed in the activation of mn vii gao et al 2019 jiang et al 2009 yu et al 2020 however the additional reagents might give rise to secondary pollution or some toxic effects accordingly alternative techniques are in need to enhance mn vii oxidation capacity for micropollutant elimination to date irradiation received growing interests since it does not need to add additional chemicals in water recent research demonstrated that mn vii could be activated by ultraviolet uv irradiation guo et al 2018 however the commonly used uv irradiation required installation of uv lamps and exhibited low energy conversion which would result in relatively high investment cost and energy consumption instead solar irradiation is a renewable and economic source since it is present naturally and globally and the use of solar irradiation will save large amounts of energy sun et al 2019 consequently the environmental impacts on the nature will reduce compared to other irradiation sources based on uv lamps in the light of this fact solar irradiation has been investigated to activate oxidants for micropollutant elimination for instance solar chlorine solar peroxymonosulfate and solar peracetic acid processes were confirmed to effectively remove micropollutants rizzo et al 2019 solÃ­s et al 2020 yang et al 2016a these oxidants would produce highly reactive species under solar irradiation and thereby lead to rapid degradation of micropollutants note that mn vii has extended absorption spectrum above 290 nm and the mn vii absorbance spectrum overlaps with the solar spectrum Î» 290 nm guo et al 2018 it seems likely that mn vii can be activated by solar irradiation and thus facilitates micropollutant remediation in water however little attention has been paid to examine for the potential of mn vii activation by solar irradiation literatures demonstrated that the photolysis of mn vii would generate high valent oxo intermediates i e trivalent manganese mn iii and hypomanganate mn v under light irradiation lee et al 1987 comparatively guo et al suggested that mn v and ho might be induced in the uv mn vii process guo et al 2018 whereas mn iii and o2 might be generated in the visible light vl mn vii process zhang et al 2021 although a part of solar spectrum overlaps with those of uv and vl there is lack of knowledge with respect to the roles of reactive species under solar irradiation and may be different from those under uv and vl in all case it is of great importance to elucidate the mechanism in this system thus providing a novel and green way to degrade micropollutants in water treatment additionally it is necessary to assess the performance under practical conditions e g actual waters which is beneficial to optimize the operating conditions and accelerate the development of this technology the present work was therefore designed to 1 explore the possible ability of simulated solar mn vii ss mn vii for degrading eight micropollutants namely enrofloxacin enr 4 chlorophenol 4 cp p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba methylparaben mep ibuprofen ibu gemfibrozil gfrj bezafibrate bzf and benzoic acid ba 2 clarify the reactive species in this system to gain further insights 3 evaluate impacts of operating conditions and water matrices on the micropollutant degradation of ss mn vii 4 identify degradation products of selected micropollutants and propose degradation pathways 5 investigate the efficiency of ss mn vii in actual waters as well as evaluate the potential for micropollutant degradation applying different irradiation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were at least analytical grade detailed information is provided in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures enr 4 cp p hba mep ibu gfrj bzf and ba were selected to investigate the degradation performance of ss mn vii the experimental procedures are given in text s2 2 3 analytical methods details on high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis for residual concentration of micropollutants are given in text s4 degradation products of micropollutants were detected by an agilent 1260 hplc combined with absciex triple quad 5500 ms with esi source was applied for hplc esi qqq analysis detailed operation conditions are provided in text s5 the residual concentration of mn vii was determined by uv vis spectrometer uv 1900 shimadzu co japan at 525 nm the emission spectra of the ss and ns was determined by miniature spectrometer ocean optics usb2000 usa and given in fig s1 the uv vis absorbance spectrum of species and the reaction in this study was conducted by uv vis spectrometer uv 1900 shimadzu co japan in the range of 200 800 nm the presence of radicals was confirmed by electron spin resonance esr analysis and experimental conditions are provided in text s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of micropollutants by ss mn vii process the degradation of eight micropollutants was initially investigated during exposure to ss irradiation mn vii and ss mn vii conditions at ph 7 0 figs 1 and s2 experimental results illustrated that p hba and enr could be removed by ss irradiation while other six micropollutants were recalcitrant to ss irradiation the ready degradation of p hba and enr by ss irradiation was likely because their relatively high molar absorption coefficients at the investigated wavelength region in addition to 4 cp and p hba mn vii led to negligible degradation of other six micropollutants to note 54 7 of 4 cp was removed by mn vii after 3 min due to the susceptive structure attacked by mn vii he et al 2010 interestingly except ba the combination of ss and mn vii enhanced the degradation of selected micropollutants it can be seen that degradation efficiencies of micropollutants in the ss mn vii were increased by 18 4 89 8 and 16 1 82 2 in comparison with mn vii alone and ss irradiation respectively the degradation of these compounds followed the pseudo first order kinetics details in text s7 and the rate constants kobs in this process were 2 2 38 0 folds faster than those by ss irradiation and mn vii fig s3 indeed the degradation of enr and 4 cp was substantially faster than other compounds in this process likely owing to the ready attack of their structures by oxidants comparatively given the fact that ba can react with non selective hydroxyl radical ho the non degradation of ba by ss mn vii suggested the reactive species in this process were selective toward micropollutants additionally the residual concentration of mn vii was also determined in this process fig s4 shows that more than 60 of mn vii was decomposed after 30 min in all cases appreciable removal of micropollutants by ss mn vii could be presumably explained by the production of reactive species by mn vii photolysis under ss irradiation therefore it was significant to identify the reactive species responsible for enhanced micropollutant degradation thus elucidating the reaction mechanism in this system 3 2 identification of reactive species in the ss mn vii system 3 2 1 roles of radicals to elucidate the reaction mechanism in this system 4 cp p hba and enr served as model compounds for more refractory micropollutants in the aquatic environment previous studies drew the conclusion that reactive oxygen radicals including ho and o2 were involved in the mn vii oxidation under irradiation guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 hence efforts should be made to clarify the role of ho and o2 in this system the importance of ho and o2 was investigated by adding excess tert butanol tba and carbon tetrachloride ccl4 as scavengers of ho and o2 kho tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 k o2 ccl4 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2021 kong et al 2016 fig s5 illustrates that the effects of 10 mm tba and ccl4 on the degradation of three model compounds were neglected the corresponding kobs values were almost in the same magnitude with or without these scavengers furthermore degradation of methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso under the ss mn vii system was also studied fig 2 a experimental results display that 10 Î¼m pmso could be completely transformed into pmso2 above results indicated the absence of radicals in this system since radicals e g ho did not convert pmso into pmso2 via an oxygen atom transfer gao et al 2019 additionally esr experiments were conducted to confirm the existence of ho and o2 in this process where 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used to trap ho and o2 obviously there is no signal of dmpoho or dmpo o2 in the ss irradiation however a signal of 5 5 dimethyl pyrrolidone 2 oxyl 1 dmpox rather than dmpoho or dmpo o2 appeared in the mn vii alone and ss mn vii process fig s7 the presence of dmpox was likely ascribed to the rapid oxidation of dmpo by mn vii wang et al 2019 xu et al 2017 the occurrence of dmpox also indicated the direct dmpo oxidation without radical formation xu et al 2017 hence above results proved the insignificant roles of ho and o2 in this system overall these phenomena implied reactive manganese species rmns were the reasons for the degradation of micropollutants 3 2 2 roles of rmns it has been reported that rmns such as mno2 manganate mn vi mn iii and mn v were possibly involved in the mn vii oxidation jiang et al 2009 2010 sun et al 2016 thus efforts should be made to systematically clarify the roles of rmns in the ss mn vii system to probe the possible formation of mno2 in this system uv vis spectra of the ss mn vii system at 200 800 nm was conducted and results are given in fig 3 a it can be seen that an absorbance peak appeared at around 375 nm corresponding to mno2 fig s8 considering that mno2 might work as a catalyst or an oxidant jiang et al 2015 2009 preformed mno2 via ss irradiation was utilized to examine the effect of mno2 on the degradation of model compounds fig 4 shows that mno2 hardly reacted with three model compounds under ss irradiation ruling out the oxidative role of mno2 besides the degradation of model compounds by ss mn vii was comparable to the case where preformed mno2 was present thus the catalytic role of mno2 was excluded in the ss mn vii system research showed that mn vi might be involved in micropollutant degradation chen et al 2020 however the role of mn vi was still unclear in this system in this regard to explore the possible occurrence of mn vi uv vis spectra of ss mn vii at ph 13 0 was investigated based on the method reported by simandi et al 1984 who found that mn vi could be stabilized at alkaline compared with the scan of this system at ph 7 0 the band with maximum at around 610 nm at ph 13 0 was the spectroscopic evidence of mn vi fig s6a carrington and symons 1956 the non observation of mn vi at ph 7 0 might be explained by the fact that mn vi would undergo rapid disproportionation at this ph simandi et al 1984 meanwhile through online scanning mn vi rather than mn iii pp was found in the ss mn vii system with pp at alkaline whereas only mn iii pp was found in this system at ph 7 0 fig s6b this was because mn iii from mn vii photolysis would react with mn vii under basic conditions thus generating mn vi lee et al 1987 thereby the attribution of mn vi could be omitted in this system moreover the reaction between mn vi and model compounds were also investigated mn vi prepared based on the method reported by zÃ¡honyi budÃ³ and simÃ¡ndi 1996 exhibited no reactivities with model compounds under ss irradiation fig 4d proving the insignificant role of mn vi in this system above results revealed that mno2 and mn vi were not the factors in the micropollutant degradation given the fact that mn iii mn v might be the products of mn vii photodecomposition lee et al 1987 it was speculated that mn iii mn v were responsible for the enhanced degradation in this system to further authenticate the above inference roles of mn iii and mn v were explored herein to explore the role of mn v pmso was utilized as a probe and results are given in fig 2 importantly pmso could be oxidized by ss mn vii owing to the contribution of mn v and mn vii rao et al 2021 compared with the mn vii alone the oxidation of pmso performed better by ss mn vii this demonstrated that the reaction of mn v toward pmso was faster than that of mn vii note that pmso was resistant to ss irradiation fig 2c and mn iii gao et al 2019 above results proved the role of mn v in the ss mn vii system the possible occurrence of mn iii was first examined through the uv vis spectra of the ss mn vii system with pp at 200 800 nm fig 3b displays that the absorbance gradually increased at 258 nm attributed to the characteristic absorbance of mn iii pp complex fig s8 this result demonstrated that mn iii was generated from mn vii photolysis and the level of mn iii increased as the reaction progressed then to reveal the role of mn iii the degradation of model compounds under ss mn vii conditions was studied by adding different dose of pp fig 5 displays that pp exerted various impacts on the micropollutant degradation which inferred the mechanism might differ among these micropollutants as for 4 cp increasing pp concentration had a dramatic inhibitory effect on 4 cp degradation fig 5a suggesting a strong complexation ability of pp note that the produced mn iii pp complex probably served as a catalyst or an oxidant hu et al 2017 additional experiments were carried out to further confirm the role of mn iii pp fig s9a shows that mn iii pp did not react with 4 cp ruling out the oxidative role of mn iii pp besides additional mn iii pp in the mn vii oxidation was comparable to the case where mn iii pp was absent this excluded the catalytic role of mn iii pp more importantly the inhibitory effect in the case where mn iii pp was present in the ss mn vii system was comparable to the case of 10 mm pp fig s9b this result demonstrated the insignificant role of mn iii pp in this system thus the inhibitory effect of pp was due to that increase of pp concentration decreased the reactivity of mn iii and the formed mn iii pp was inactive and stable in agreement with prior research wang et al 2018 it was rational that mn iii might mainly contribute to 4 cp degradation in the ss mn vii system as for p hba increasing pp concentration barely influenced p hba degradation in this sense efforts should be made to investigate the role of mn iii mn v in p hba degradation fig s9c depicts that mn iii pp neither worked as a catalyst nor an oxidant which ruled out the role of formed mn iii pp complex in p hba degradation furthermore the additional mn iii pp and 10 mm pp showed almost the same performance as the control group fig s9d which proved the ignorable role of mn iii pp in this system given the fact that pp would decrease the reactivity of mn iii if only mn iii participated in the degradation the degradation would be retarded hence the negligible influence of pp inferred mn iii and mn v were the reasons of this phenomenon because the presence of strong ligands e g pp might result in the contribution of mn v to p hba degradation gao et al 2019 at lower pp concentration pp primarily stabilized mn v at lower concentration and thereby increased mn v exposure as well as mitigated the retarded effect higher concentration mainly affected the mn v reactivity and increase of pp concentration induced the formation of mn v pp complex the mn v pp complex was less stable than mn iii pp in other words mn v pp complex was probably more reactive than mn iii pp complex thus mitigating the decreased reactivity of mn iii hence both mn iii and mn v likely contributed to p hba degradation by ss mn vii likewise with an increase in the concentration of pp from 0 to 10 mm enr degradation was hardly affected fig s9e illustrates that the additional mn iii pp in the enr oxidation by mn vii was comparable to the case where mn iii pp was absent note that mn iii pp did not react with enr this result excluded the catalytic role of mn iii pp as well as the oxidative role in the enr degradation this suggested that mn iii pp complex was not the reason for the effect of pp on enr degradation specifically additional experiments were performed by comparing the changes between the presence of mn iii pp and 10 mm pp obviously the additional mn iii pp showed similar effects as the case of 10 mm pp fig s9f which proved that the role of mn iii pp was neglected in enr degradation in this system note that the reactivity of mn iii was inhibited in the presence of pp the ignorable effect of pp was likely due to the contribution of mn v as mentioned in p hba degradation therefore mn iii and mn v might be involved in enr degradation in this system overall different roles of mn iii and mn v in micropollutant degradation implied the selectivity of these mn intermediates based on the above discussion the photochemistry of mn vii in this process was proposed and the evolution of mn v and mn iii was well elucidated as depicted in scheme 1 during the target compounds tcs degradation mn vii experienced photodecomposition under ss irradiation and became photoexcited route 1 haggag et al 2020 the photoexcited form mn vii could convert back to mn vii in route 2 lee et al 1987 hereafter mn vii decomposed into mn v as an intermediate in route 3 lee et al 1987 furthermore mn iii could be directly formed from mn vii in route 4 nakai et al 1995 in route 5 mn v might convert into mn iii via photolysis gutsev et al 1999 additionally route 6 shows that mn v could transform back to mn vii nakai et al 1995 note that mn v and mn iii were more active than mn vii gao et al 2019 sun et al 2015 it was proposed that mn v and or mn iii rapidly reacted with tcs it can be seen that mn v oxidized tcs and formed mn iii or mno2 while mn iii reacted with tcs and produced mn ii as an intermediate that was then oxidized into mno2 3 3 effect of mn vii dosage and solution ph on micropollutant degradation the effect of different mn vii dosage on the degradation of micropollutants in this system was examined figs 6 and s10 obviously micropollutant degradation was dependent on mn vii initial dosage as mn vii increased from 50 to 400 Î¼m the degradation of micropollutants was increased for instance kobs of 4 cp p hba and enr increased from 0 205 to 1 812 min 1 0 0671 to 0 150 min 1 and 0 483 to 1 284 min 1 with an increase in the mn vii concentration from 50 to 400 Î¼m respectively these phenomena might be due to the increased level of rmns induced by photolysis of mn vii under ss irradiation as mn vii dosage increased above results suggested that higher mn vii dosage caused greater degradation of micropollutants in this system in brief these findings provided guidance for choosing optimal operating conditions in real practice it is widely known that ph would affect the oxidation capacity of mn vii and rmns when treating micropollutants chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 thereby it is important to study the effect of ph on degradation of micropollutants in the ss mn vii system figs 6 and s11 firstly the effect of ph 4 0 9 0 on 4 cp degradation was investigated it can be seen that the degradation efficiency of 4 cp at alkaline and neutral conditions were found more remarkable than that at acidic for example 37 1 of 4 cp was removed at ph 4 0 while 95 8 of 4 cp was removed at ph 9 0 at rates that were about 6 fold lower than ph 9 0 did note that the oxidative ability of mn iii and mn vii was lower at alkaline yang et al 2018a this unusual phenomenon was likely because the deprotonated form from the dissociation of 4 cp pka 9 41 gradually dominated as ph increased and posed high electron density yang et al 2018b furthermore the chlorine substituent in the ortho position of 4 cp could also increase the electron density du et al 2012 which led to a ready attack by mn iii and mn vii at alkaline this finding was consistent with previous research on phenol oxidation by mn vii du et al 2012 on the contrary the degradation of p hba and enr performed better at acidity than alkaline did on the one hand the speciation of p hba pka1 4 75 pka2 9 2 varied at different ph values li et al 2019 the deprotonated form of p hba which exposed strong electron donating strength was more reactive than the protonated form li et al 2019 meanwhile the redox potential of mn vii mn iii and mn v at acidity was higher than that at alkaline leading to favorable degradation below alkalinity although the fraction of deprotonated form increased as ph further increased an electrostatic repulsion might occur between deprotonated p hba and mn species zhang et al 2013 on the other hand as for enr the cationic form of enr dominated at acidity was more reactive than the anionic one which dominated at alkaline xu et al 2016 meanwhile the oxidative ability of mn iii and mn v was higher at acidity thus it is reasonable that acidity was conducive to the degradation of enr interestingly the decomposition of mn vii was almost the same at the investigated ph range fig s4 which implied that the reactivities of rmns varied toward different micropollutants at investigated ph values in all three model compounds were found ph dependent in this system and showed great degradation performance at environmental conditions suggesting a promising technology for micropollutant remediation in water treatment 3 4 apparent quantum yields of mn vii at different ph the photodecomposition rates and quantum yields of mn vii were determined at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 accordingly as shown in text s9 the photodecomposition rate k of mn vii was equal to the k of mno4 since the speciation form of mn vii pka 2 25 was mno4 at investigated ph hu et al 2010 it was found that the photodecomposition rates were similar 0 0305 min 1 0 0353 min 1 furthermore fig s12 shows that the light absorption rate of mn vii i e the integrated area was determined to be 18 3 s 1 then the quantum yields of mn vii at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were determined details in text s9 obviously the quantum yields of mn vii at the investigated ph were similar with 6 83 0 02 x 10 6 mol einstein 1 8 36 0 03 x 10 6 mol einstein 1 and 7 45 0 02 x 10 6 mol einstein 1 at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively the quantum yield of mn vii was independent on ph in agreement with previous literature zimmerman 1955 these results further confirmed the ph primarily affected the reactivities of rmns toward micropollutants 3 5 effect of water matrices on micropollutant degradation the effect of water matrices such as inorganic ions and natural organic matter nom on micropollutant degradation was studied figs 7 s13 and s14 apparently cl led to negligible degradation of micropollutants in this system fig s13 with an increase in hco3 dosage from 0 to 10 mm the 4 cp and p hba degradation was gradually enhanced the rate laws for 4 cp and p hba increased from 0 779 to 1 373 min 1 and 0 109 to 0 178 min 1 respectively fig 7 similar enhancement was also observed in phenol oxidation by mn vii zhang et al 2013 the possible explanation for the enhanced effect was that hco3 might serve as a ligand to complex with mn iii and or mn v during the degradation of p hba previous research suggested that the presence of hco3 could enhance the micropollutant degradation by ferrate fe vi this was mainly because hco3 stabilized the intermediates of fe vi through complexation and thus prevented the rapid disproportionation of these highly reactive intermediates luo et al 2019 therefore rmns hco3 complexes were likely generated and thus prolonged the mn iii and or mn v exposure as mentioned in previous sections pp suppressed 4 cp degradation because of the strong binding capacity on mn iii hence it was speculated that the mn iii hco3 was less stable but more reactive than mn iii pp leading to the enhancement degradation by contrast the presence of increasing hco3 dosage did not exhibit an influence on enr degradation considering no enhancement for enr the rmns hco3 complexes were selective toward micropollutants overall hco3 in this system presumably acted as a ligand and led to a promotion on micropollutant degradation the effect of nom on the micropollutant degradation by ss mn vii was tested using ha in this study fig s14 illustrates that ha displayed a negative impact on 4 cp and enr degradation in the concentration of 0 10 mg l the kobs values dropped from 0 779 min 1 to 0 455 min 1 and 0 817 min 1 to 0 500 min 1 respectively fig 7a b the reason was that ha would consume mn vii in the reaction thus reducing the available concentration of mn vii he et al 2009 besides the competitive absorption of ss irradiation between ha and mn vii could also weaken the photolysis of mn vii which reduced the amount of rmns on the other hand ha would also inhibit the direct photolysis of enr through competitive absorption of ss irradiation zhang et al 2019 since enr could be removed by direct photolysis as mentioned above similar observations were also reported in chlorophene oxidation by mn vii xu et al 2018 comparatively an enhancement on p hba degradation was found in the presence of ha values for kobs increased from 0 109 to 0 204 min 1 fig 7b this might be due to that ha could complex with rmns and the formed rmns ha complexes that were potentially strong oxidants shi et al 2020 on the other hand the Ï Ï interaction between the aromatic ring of p hba and aromatic components of ha would enhance the electron density of p hba thus causing ready attack of p hba by mn species he et al 2010 this result suggested degradation of p hba by ss mn vii was possible in water containing nom more significantly the influence of ha on model compounds implied the selectivity of rmns ha complexes toward micropollutants regarding to the elucidated reason of enhancing effect by hco3 and ha deep investigation was warranted 3 6 identification of degradation products and proposed pathways it is important to identify the degradation products to elucidate the degradation pathways in ss mn vii system therefore intermediates of three model compounds were determined during this process and details are listed in table s2 4 based on five degradation products and related findings two main pathways were proposed fig s15 in pathway i 4 cp underwent dechlorination and yielded c1 m z 93 after that c1 could be transformed into c2 m z 97 via hydrogenation in pathway ii 4 cp experienced hydroxylation on the ortho position of ho group and resulted in c3 m z 143 the occurrence of c3 was also concluded in 4 cp oxidation by mn vii hu et al 2017 further c3 underwent oxidation leading to the ring opening of 4 cp and thus c4 m z 177 formation c4 was probably converted into c5 m z 151 via addition reaction to sum up 4 cp degradation mainly involved hydrogenation hydroxylation oxidation ring cleavage and addition reactions in terms of p hba five products were detected in this process and three pathways were proposed fig s16 pathway i included decarboxylation and dehydrogenation reaction yielding the phenol product p1 m z 93 then p1 would be converted into p5 m z 97 via hydrogenation in pathway ii the ho group of p hba was substituted by the carboxyl group leading to the product p2 m z 165 in pathway iii p hba experienced ring opening and subsequent carboxylation thus resulting in the formation of p3 m z 133 then p3 was converted into p4 m z 103 through decarboxylation overall the p hba degradation included decarboxylation dehydrogenation substitution ring cleavage and carboxylation reactions as for enr six products were identified and three degradation pathways were proposed as shown in fig s17 the oxidation of piperazine ring led to a dealkylation of enr pathway i in pathway i the dealkylation of enr resulted in the formation of e1 m z 334 then e1 experienced a loss of amine on the piperazine substituent and stepwise carbonylation leading to the production of e2 m z 291 further e2 might occur the loss of a formaldehyde generating e6 m z 263 similar products were also reported in previous findings shao et al 2020 yang et al 2016b in pathway ii the partial dealkylation of enr induced the product e3 m z 332 it is widely known that e3 was ciprofloxacin which was commonly detected in the enr oxidation guo et al 2017 xu et al 2016 after that e3 was converted into e6 via dealkylation and subsequent piperazine ring cleavage in pathway iii enr underwent decarboxylation on the quinolone structure yielding e4 m z 316 in pathway iv enr occurred defluorination followed by oxidation and ring cleavage on piperazine ring leading to the product e5 m z 344 further occurrence of e4 and e5 was also proved in previous research baena nogueras et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 overall enr degradation in ss mn vii was mainly through dealkylation carbonylation piperazine ring cleavage and defluorination 3 7 removal of micropollutants by ss mn vii in real water the degradation of 4 cp p hba and enr by ss mn vii in different types of real water was further studied figs 8 and s18 groundwater surface water and secondary effluent of wastewater were employed as the three real waters to investigate the micropollutant degradation in this study milli q water samples were also used to compare with the above three real water samples detailed characteristics of three real water samples are given in text s6 the ss irradiation in real waters displayed comparable performance to the case of milli q water in the ss mn vii system as for 4 cp and enr the degradation was inhibited to different extents in three real waters the lowest degradation efficiency was found in secondary effluent followed by groundwater and surface water the retarded removal in real waters by ss mn vii was consistent with the inhibitory effect of ha as discussed in previous sections however note that the presence of hco3 facilitated the 4 cp degradation in milli q water this suggested that the occurrence of various water background components might also influence the removal of micropollutants in this system similar conclusion has been made by yang et al 2018a comparatively the removal of 4 cp by mn vii was promoted in real waters especially in secondary effluent mn vii was inefficient for enr removal in all water samples notably p hba degradation by the ss mn vii system in real waters exhibited greater performance than milli q water did corresponding to the enhanced effect of nom in milli q water similarly p hba oxidation by mn vii was also promoted in real waters secondary effluent in particular overall above results also revealed that the dissolved organic carbon values in groundwater surface water and secondary effluent did not exhibit correlated behaviors with degradation efficiencies this suggested that other constituents in these water samples might have a greater or less extent on the degradation in brief the ss mn vii process still performed well when treating micropollutants in real waters 3 8 removal of micropollutants by mn vii in natural sunlight ns uv and vl irradiation considering abundant solar energy globally it is worth evaluating the degradation of micropollutants by ss mn vii with the replacement of ns fig 8 illustrates that 4 cp was resistant to two types of solar irradiation whereas the direct photolysis of p hba and enr was observed more remarkable in ss irradiation this could be attributed to the lower intensity of ns compared to ss as shown in fig s1 furthermore 4 cp p hba and enr oxidation by mn vii under ns irradiation was less effective than ss did this could be ascribed to the lower intensity of ns thus the photolysis of mn vii would be weakened in the presence of ns and reduced the amount of rmns worth mentioning was that the micropollutant degradation was found more efficient in the synergistic effect of ns and mn vii than by ns irradiation and mn vii alone in summary the ns mn vii system also hold great promise to remove micropollutants further removal of micropollutants was evaluated in uv 290 Î» 400 nm and vl 400 Î» 800 nm irradiation via light filtration in the xenon lamp details in text s2 fig s19 illustrates that enr 4 cp and p hba were recalcitrant to uv and vl irradiation except enr 4 cp and p hba could be degraded by mn vii alone to some extent comparatively the introduction of uv or vl could enhance enr 4 cp and p hba degradation the degradation rates of three micropollutants by uv mn vii and vl mn vii were higher than those by mn vii and irradiation notably uv mn vii exhibited a stronger enhancement than vl mn vii did nevertheless vl irradiation was still promising for mn vii activation it was obvious that uv and vl irradiation were less efficient than ss for mn vii activation figs 1 and s19 likely due to the synergistic effect of uv and vl involved in the ss emission overall uv and vl can efficiently activate mn vii for micropollutant degradation 4 conclusion this study systematically examined the capability of applying ss irradiation to activate mn vii for micropollutant degradation generally except ba ss mn vii could achieve remarkable degradation of micropollutants proving a broad spectrum process for micropollutant degradation the marked removal of micropollutants in this system was due to the enhanced level of rmns i e mn iii and mn v rather than radicals under ss irradiation significantly through elucidating reaction mechanism of three model compounds 4 cp p hba and enr rmns might serve different roles during the reaction thus suggesting the selectivity of rmns toward micropollutants furthermore it was found that higher dose of mn vii increased the percentage of micropollutants removed by ss mn vii in addition degradation of model compounds was ph dependent it was found that the quantum yield of mn vii was not ph dependent water matrices including cl hco3 and ha displayed different impacts on micropollutant degradation in the ss mn vii process which should be taken into consideration in the real application hereafter based on the identified transformation products of 4 cp p hba and enr primary pathways were involved namely finally ss mn vii in real waters ns mn vii uv mn vii and vl mn vii also proved appreciable removal of micropollutants highlighting the applicability of this promising process in water treatment considering the inevitable conditions e g night and changeable weather in the real application it is proposed that xenon lamps can be equipped with solar panels above the solar

16596,herein permanganate mn vii was activated by simulated solar ss ss mn vii resulting in rapid degradation of micropollutants in several minutes with rates of target micropollutants outnumbered those in the mn vii alone and ss to explore the mechanism in this process 4 cholorphenol 4 cp p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba and enrofloxacin enr were selected as model compounds lines of evidence indicated that reactive manganese species rmns i e mn iii and mn v rather than radicals from mn vii photolysis participated in the conversion of model compounds interestingly roles of rmns differed among three model compounds suggesting their selectivity toward micropollutants increasing mn vii dosage proved greater micropollutant degradation while impacts of ph on ss mn vii performance varied among model compounds p hba and enr showed the lowest degradation efficiency at alkaline whereas 4 cp demonstrated the best performance at alkaline indicating the reactivity of rmns varied toward micropollutants at different ph values the quantum yield of mn vii was 8 36 0 03 x 10 6 mol einstein 1 at ph 7 0 effects of common co existing constituents cl hco3 and humic acid ha on micropollutant degradation by ss mn vii were examined specifically hco3 positively influenced the 4 cp and p hba degradation whereas enr was not affected likely owing to the selectivity of rmns hco3 complexes ha was conducive to degrade p hba due to the production of rmns ha complexes but unfavorable for enr and 4 cp degradation because of the competitive light absorption and mn vii furthermore a number of degradation products of 4 cp p hba and enr were identified and possible pathways were proposed accordingly the effectiveness of this process for micropollutant degradation in real waters natural sunlight ultraviolet and visible light via cut off filtering ss emission was confirmed this work revealed a great potential of applying ss mn vii for the marked degradation of micropollutants and facilitated the understandings of mn iii mn v behaviors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords permanganate solar irradiation manganese species degradation 1 introduction the widespread presence of micropollutants in the aquatic environment has raised concerns globally at concentrations ranging from ng l Î¼g l michael et al 2010 current water treatments such as filtration sedimentation and coagulation hardly degrade micropollutants nam et al 2014 therefore many of these micropollutants would pass through the treatments and lead to continuous introduction to aquatic environments the persistence of micropollutants in the aquatic environment would cause long term threats to ecosystems and human beings luo et al 2014 in this regard efficient techniques are required to address the occurrence of micropollutants in water until now many techniques have been employed for degrading micropollutants including chemical oxidation biodegradation and adsorption guan et al 2010 kanaujiya et al 2019 luo et al 2014 among these treatments chemical oxidant permanganate mn vii is gaining more attention for micropollutant remediation in water treatment it was due to the ease of storage low cost comparative stability effectiveness over a wide ph range and lack of undesirable byproducts sun et al 2013 moreover the ultimate product manganese dioxide mno2 can work as an adsorbent and a mild oxidant sun et al 2013 wei et al 2021 therefore mn vii is a promising environmentally friendly oxidant in water treatment despite of these advances mn vii is a selective oxidant which prefers to react with micropollutants containing electron rich organic moieties but exhibits low reactivity with some refractory micropollutants shi et al 2020 xu et al 2016 these defects might hinder the application of mn vii in water treatment in this sense bisulfite ligands e g humic acid ha pyrophosphate pp silicate and so forth have been employed in the activation of mn vii gao et al 2019 jiang et al 2009 yu et al 2020 however the additional reagents might give rise to secondary pollution or some toxic effects accordingly alternative techniques are in need to enhance mn vii oxidation capacity for micropollutant elimination to date irradiation received growing interests since it does not need to add additional chemicals in water recent research demonstrated that mn vii could be activated by ultraviolet uv irradiation guo et al 2018 however the commonly used uv irradiation required installation of uv lamps and exhibited low energy conversion which would result in relatively high investment cost and energy consumption instead solar irradiation is a renewable and economic source since it is present naturally and globally and the use of solar irradiation will save large amounts of energy sun et al 2019 consequently the environmental impacts on the nature will reduce compared to other irradiation sources based on uv lamps in the light of this fact solar irradiation has been investigated to activate oxidants for micropollutant elimination for instance solar chlorine solar peroxymonosulfate and solar peracetic acid processes were confirmed to effectively remove micropollutants rizzo et al 2019 solÃ­s et al 2020 yang et al 2016a these oxidants would produce highly reactive species under solar irradiation and thereby lead to rapid degradation of micropollutants note that mn vii has extended absorption spectrum above 290 nm and the mn vii absorbance spectrum overlaps with the solar spectrum Î» 290 nm guo et al 2018 it seems likely that mn vii can be activated by solar irradiation and thus facilitates micropollutant remediation in water however little attention has been paid to examine for the potential of mn vii activation by solar irradiation literatures demonstrated that the photolysis of mn vii would generate high valent oxo intermediates i e trivalent manganese mn iii and hypomanganate mn v under light irradiation lee et al 1987 comparatively guo et al suggested that mn v and ho might be induced in the uv mn vii process guo et al 2018 whereas mn iii and o2 might be generated in the visible light vl mn vii process zhang et al 2021 although a part of solar spectrum overlaps with those of uv and vl there is lack of knowledge with respect to the roles of reactive species under solar irradiation and may be different from those under uv and vl in all case it is of great importance to elucidate the mechanism in this system thus providing a novel and green way to degrade micropollutants in water treatment additionally it is necessary to assess the performance under practical conditions e g actual waters which is beneficial to optimize the operating conditions and accelerate the development of this technology the present work was therefore designed to 1 explore the possible ability of simulated solar mn vii ss mn vii for degrading eight micropollutants namely enrofloxacin enr 4 chlorophenol 4 cp p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba methylparaben mep ibuprofen ibu gemfibrozil gfrj bezafibrate bzf and benzoic acid ba 2 clarify the reactive species in this system to gain further insights 3 evaluate impacts of operating conditions and water matrices on the micropollutant degradation of ss mn vii 4 identify degradation products of selected micropollutants and propose degradation pathways 5 investigate the efficiency of ss mn vii in actual waters as well as evaluate the potential for micropollutant degradation applying different irradiation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were at least analytical grade detailed information is provided in text s1 2 2 experimental procedures enr 4 cp p hba mep ibu gfrj bzf and ba were selected to investigate the degradation performance of ss mn vii the experimental procedures are given in text s2 2 3 analytical methods details on high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis for residual concentration of micropollutants are given in text s4 degradation products of micropollutants were detected by an agilent 1260 hplc combined with absciex triple quad 5500 ms with esi source was applied for hplc esi qqq analysis detailed operation conditions are provided in text s5 the residual concentration of mn vii was determined by uv vis spectrometer uv 1900 shimadzu co japan at 525 nm the emission spectra of the ss and ns was determined by miniature spectrometer ocean optics usb2000 usa and given in fig s1 the uv vis absorbance spectrum of species and the reaction in this study was conducted by uv vis spectrometer uv 1900 shimadzu co japan in the range of 200 800 nm the presence of radicals was confirmed by electron spin resonance esr analysis and experimental conditions are provided in text s8 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of micropollutants by ss mn vii process the degradation of eight micropollutants was initially investigated during exposure to ss irradiation mn vii and ss mn vii conditions at ph 7 0 figs 1 and s2 experimental results illustrated that p hba and enr could be removed by ss irradiation while other six micropollutants were recalcitrant to ss irradiation the ready degradation of p hba and enr by ss irradiation was likely because their relatively high molar absorption coefficients at the investigated wavelength region in addition to 4 cp and p hba mn vii led to negligible degradation of other six micropollutants to note 54 7 of 4 cp was removed by mn vii after 3 min due to the susceptive structure attacked by mn vii he et al 2010 interestingly except ba the combination of ss and mn vii enhanced the degradation of selected micropollutants it can be seen that degradation efficiencies of micropollutants in the ss mn vii were increased by 18 4 89 8 and 16 1 82 2 in comparison with mn vii alone and ss irradiation respectively the degradation of these compounds followed the pseudo first order kinetics details in text s7 and the rate constants kobs in this process were 2 2 38 0 folds faster than those by ss irradiation and mn vii fig s3 indeed the degradation of enr and 4 cp was substantially faster than other compounds in this process likely owing to the ready attack of their structures by oxidants comparatively given the fact that ba can react with non selective hydroxyl radical ho the non degradation of ba by ss mn vii suggested the reactive species in this process were selective toward micropollutants additionally the residual concentration of mn vii was also determined in this process fig s4 shows that more than 60 of mn vii was decomposed after 30 min in all cases appreciable removal of micropollutants by ss mn vii could be presumably explained by the production of reactive species by mn vii photolysis under ss irradiation therefore it was significant to identify the reactive species responsible for enhanced micropollutant degradation thus elucidating the reaction mechanism in this system 3 2 identification of reactive species in the ss mn vii system 3 2 1 roles of radicals to elucidate the reaction mechanism in this system 4 cp p hba and enr served as model compounds for more refractory micropollutants in the aquatic environment previous studies drew the conclusion that reactive oxygen radicals including ho and o2 were involved in the mn vii oxidation under irradiation guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 hence efforts should be made to clarify the role of ho and o2 in this system the importance of ho and o2 was investigated by adding excess tert butanol tba and carbon tetrachloride ccl4 as scavengers of ho and o2 kho tba 6 108 m 1 s 1 k o2 ccl4 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2021 kong et al 2016 fig s5 illustrates that the effects of 10 mm tba and ccl4 on the degradation of three model compounds were neglected the corresponding kobs values were almost in the same magnitude with or without these scavengers furthermore degradation of methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso under the ss mn vii system was also studied fig 2 a experimental results display that 10 Î¼m pmso could be completely transformed into pmso2 above results indicated the absence of radicals in this system since radicals e g ho did not convert pmso into pmso2 via an oxygen atom transfer gao et al 2019 additionally esr experiments were conducted to confirm the existence of ho and o2 in this process where 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used to trap ho and o2 obviously there is no signal of dmpoho or dmpo o2 in the ss irradiation however a signal of 5 5 dimethyl pyrrolidone 2 oxyl 1 dmpox rather than dmpoho or dmpo o2 appeared in the mn vii alone and ss mn vii process fig s7 the presence of dmpox was likely ascribed to the rapid oxidation of dmpo by mn vii wang et al 2019 xu et al 2017 the occurrence of dmpox also indicated the direct dmpo oxidation without radical formation xu et al 2017 hence above results proved the insignificant roles of ho and o2 in this system overall these phenomena implied reactive manganese species rmns were the reasons for the degradation of micropollutants 3 2 2 roles of rmns it has been reported that rmns such as mno2 manganate mn vi mn iii and mn v were possibly involved in the mn vii oxidation jiang et al 2009 2010 sun et al 2016 thus efforts should be made to systematically clarify the roles of rmns in the ss mn vii system to probe the possible formation of mno2 in this system uv vis spectra of the ss mn vii system at 200 800 nm was conducted and results are given in fig 3 a it can be seen that an absorbance peak appeared at around 375 nm corresponding to mno2 fig s8 considering that mno2 might work as a catalyst or an oxidant jiang et al 2015 2009 preformed mno2 via ss irradiation was utilized to examine the effect of mno2 on the degradation of model compounds fig 4 shows that mno2 hardly reacted with three model compounds under ss irradiation ruling out the oxidative role of mno2 besides the degradation of model compounds by ss mn vii was comparable to the case where preformed mno2 was present thus the catalytic role of mno2 was excluded in the ss mn vii system research showed that mn vi might be involved in micropollutant degradation chen et al 2020 however the role of mn vi was still unclear in this system in this regard to explore the possible occurrence of mn vi uv vis spectra of ss mn vii at ph 13 0 was investigated based on the method reported by simandi et al 1984 who found that mn vi could be stabilized at alkaline compared with the scan of this system at ph 7 0 the band with maximum at around 610 nm at ph 13 0 was the spectroscopic evidence of mn vi fig s6a carrington and symons 1956 the non observation of mn vi at ph 7 0 might be explained by the fact that mn vi would undergo rapid disproportionation at this ph simandi et al 1984 meanwhile through online scanning mn vi rather than mn iii pp was found in the ss mn vii system with pp at alkaline whereas only mn iii pp was found in this system at ph 7 0 fig s6b this was because mn iii from mn vii photolysis would react with mn vii under basic conditions thus generating mn vi lee et al 1987 thereby the attribution of mn vi could be omitted in this system moreover the reaction between mn vi and model compounds were also investigated mn vi prepared based on the method reported by zÃ¡honyi budÃ³ and simÃ¡ndi 1996 exhibited no reactivities with model compounds under ss irradiation fig 4d proving the insignificant role of mn vi in this system above results revealed that mno2 and mn vi were not the factors in the micropollutant degradation given the fact that mn iii mn v might be the products of mn vii photodecomposition lee et al 1987 it was speculated that mn iii mn v were responsible for the enhanced degradation in this system to further authenticate the above inference roles of mn iii and mn v were explored herein to explore the role of mn v pmso was utilized as a probe and results are given in fig 2 importantly pmso could be oxidized by ss mn vii owing to the contribution of mn v and mn vii rao et al 2021 compared with the mn vii alone the oxidation of pmso performed better by ss mn vii this demonstrated that the reaction of mn v toward pmso was faster than that of mn vii note that pmso was resistant to ss irradiation fig 2c and mn iii gao et al 2019 above results proved the role of mn v in the ss mn vii system the possible occurrence of mn iii was first examined through the uv vis spectra of the ss mn vii system with pp at 200 800 nm fig 3b displays that the absorbance gradually increased at 258 nm attributed to the characteristic absorbance of mn iii pp complex fig s8 this result demonstrated that mn iii was generated from mn vii photolysis and the level of mn iii increased as the reaction progressed then to reveal the role of mn iii the degradation of model compounds under ss mn vii conditions was studied by adding different dose of pp fig 5 displays that pp exerted various impacts on the micropollutant degradation which inferred the mechanism might differ among these micropollutants as for 4 cp increasing pp concentration had a dramatic inhibitory effect on 4 cp degradation fig 5a suggesting a strong complexation ability of pp note that the produced mn iii pp complex probably served as a catalyst or an oxidant hu et al 2017 additional experiments were carried out to further confirm the role of mn iii pp fig s9a shows that mn iii pp did not react with 4 cp ruling out the oxidative role of mn iii pp besides additional mn iii pp in the mn vii oxidation was comparable to the case where mn iii pp was absent this excluded the catalytic role of mn iii pp more importantly the inhibitory effect in the case where mn iii pp was present in the ss mn vii system was comparable to the case of 10 mm pp fig s9b this result demonstrated the insignificant role of mn iii pp in this system thus the inhibitory effect of pp was due to that increase of pp concentration decreased the reactivity of mn iii and the formed mn iii pp was inactive and stable in agreement with prior research wang et al 2018 it was rational that mn iii might mainly contribute to 4 cp degradation in the ss mn vii system as for p hba increasing pp concentration barely influenced p hba degradation in this sense efforts should be made to investigate the role of mn iii mn v in p hba degradation fig s9c depicts that mn iii pp neither worked as a catalyst nor an oxidant which ruled out the role of formed mn iii pp complex in p hba degradation furthermore the additional mn iii pp and 10 mm pp showed almost the same performance as the control group fig s9d which proved the ignorable role of mn iii pp in this system given the fact that pp would decrease the reactivity of mn iii if only mn iii participated in the degradation the degradation would be retarded hence the negligible influence of pp inferred mn iii and mn v were the reasons of this phenomenon because the presence of strong ligands e g pp might result in the contribution of mn v to p hba degradation gao et al 2019 at lower pp concentration pp primarily stabilized mn v at lower concentration and thereby increased mn v exposure as well as mitigated the retarded effect higher concentration mainly affected the mn v reactivity and increase of pp concentration induced the formation of mn v pp complex the mn v pp complex was less stable than mn iii pp in other words mn v pp complex was probably more reactive than mn iii pp complex thus mitigating the decreased reactivity of mn iii hence both mn iii and mn v likely contributed to p hba degradation by ss mn vii likewise with an increase in the concentration of pp from 0 to 10 mm enr degradation was hardly affected fig s9e illustrates that the additional mn iii pp in the enr oxidation by mn vii was comparable to the case where mn iii pp was absent note that mn iii pp did not react with enr this result excluded the catalytic role of mn iii pp as well as the oxidative role in the enr degradation this suggested that mn iii pp complex was not the reason for the effect of pp on enr degradation specifically additional experiments were performed by comparing the changes between the presence of mn iii pp and 10 mm pp obviously the additional mn iii pp showed similar effects as the case of 10 mm pp fig s9f which proved that the role of mn iii pp was neglected in enr degradation in this system note that the reactivity of mn iii was inhibited in the presence of pp the ignorable effect of pp was likely due to the contribution of mn v as mentioned in p hba degradation therefore mn iii and mn v might be involved in enr degradation in this system overall different roles of mn iii and mn v in micropollutant degradation implied the selectivity of these mn intermediates based on the above discussion the photochemistry of mn vii in this process was proposed and the evolution of mn v and mn iii was well elucidated as depicted in scheme 1 during the target compounds tcs degradation mn vii experienced photodecomposition under ss irradiation and became photoexcited route 1 haggag et al 2020 the photoexcited form mn vii could convert back to mn vii in route 2 lee et al 1987 hereafter mn vii decomposed into mn v as an intermediate in route 3 lee et al 1987 furthermore mn iii could be directly formed from mn vii in route 4 nakai et al 1995 in route 5 mn v might convert into mn iii via photolysis gutsev et al 1999 additionally route 6 shows that mn v could transform back to mn vii nakai et al 1995 note that mn v and mn iii were more active than mn vii gao et al 2019 sun et al 2015 it was proposed that mn v and or mn iii rapidly reacted with tcs it can be seen that mn v oxidized tcs and formed mn iii or mno2 while mn iii reacted with tcs and produced mn ii as an intermediate that was then oxidized into mno2 3 3 effect of mn vii dosage and solution ph on micropollutant degradation the effect of different mn vii dosage on the degradation of micropollutants in this system was examined figs 6 and s10 obviously micropollutant degradation was dependent on mn vii initial dosage as mn vii increased from 50 to 400 Î¼m the degradation of micropollutants was increased for instance kobs of 4 cp p hba and enr increased from 0 205 to 1 812 min 1 0 0671 to 0 150 min 1 and 0 483 to 1 284 min 1 with an increase in the mn vii concentration from 50 to 400 Î¼m respectively these phenomena might be due to the increased level of rmns induced by photolysis of mn vii under ss irradiation as mn vii dosage increased above results suggested that higher mn vii dosage caused greater degradation of micropollutants in this system in brief these findings provided guidance for choosing optimal operating conditions in real practice it is widely known that ph would affect the oxidation capacity of mn vii and rmns when treating micropollutants chen et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 thereby it is important to study the effect of ph on degradation of micropollutants in the ss mn vii system figs 6 and s11 firstly the effect of ph 4 0 9 0 on 4 cp degradation was investigated it can be seen that the degradation efficiency of 4 cp at alkaline and neutral conditions were found more remarkable than that at acidic for example 37 1 of 4 cp was removed at ph 4 0 while 95 8 of 4 cp was removed at ph 9 0 at rates that were about 6 fold lower than ph 9 0 did note that the oxidative ability of mn iii and mn vii was lower at alkaline yang et al 2018a this unusual phenomenon was likely because the deprotonated form from the dissociation of 4 cp pka 9 41 gradually dominated as ph increased and posed high electron density yang et al 2018b furthermore the chlorine substituent in the ortho position of 4 cp could also increase the electron density du et al 2012 which led to a ready attack by mn iii and mn vii at alkaline this finding was consistent with previous research on phenol oxidation by mn vii du et al 2012 on the contrary the degradation of p hba and enr performed better at acidity than alkaline did on the one hand the speciation of p hba pka1 4 75 pka2 9 2 varied at different ph values li et al 2019 the deprotonated form of p hba which exposed strong electron donating strength was more reactive than the protonated form li et al 2019 meanwhile the redox potential of mn vii mn iii and mn v at acidity was higher than that at alkaline leading to favorable degradation below alkalinity although the fraction of deprotonated form increased as ph further increased an electrostatic repulsion might occur between deprotonated p hba and mn species zhang et al 2013 on the other hand as for enr the cationic form of enr dominated at acidity was more reactive than the anionic one which dominated at alkaline xu et al 2016 meanwhile the oxidative ability of mn iii and mn v was higher at acidity thus it is reasonable that acidity was conducive to the degradation of enr interestingly the decomposition of mn vii was almost the same at the investigated ph range fig s4 which implied that the reactivities of rmns varied toward different micropollutants at investigated ph values in all three model compounds were found ph dependent in this system and showed great degradation performance at environmental conditions suggesting a promising technology for micropollutant remediation in water treatment 3 4 apparent quantum yields of mn vii at different ph the photodecomposition rates and quantum yields of mn vii were determined at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 accordingly as shown in text s9 the photodecomposition rate k of mn vii was equal to the k of mno4 since the speciation form of mn vii pka 2 25 was mno4 at investigated ph hu et al 2010 it was found that the photodecomposition rates were similar 0 0305 min 1 0 0353 min 1 furthermore fig s12 shows that the light absorption rate of mn vii i e the integrated area was determined to be 18 3 s 1 then the quantum yields of mn vii at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were determined details in text s9 obviously the quantum yields of mn vii at the investigated ph were similar with 6 83 0 02 x 10 6 mol einstein 1 8 36 0 03 x 10 6 mol einstein 1 and 7 45 0 02 x 10 6 mol einstein 1 at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively the quantum yield of mn vii was independent on ph in agreement with previous literature zimmerman 1955 these results further confirmed the ph primarily affected the reactivities of rmns toward micropollutants 3 5 effect of water matrices on micropollutant degradation the effect of water matrices such as inorganic ions and natural organic matter nom on micropollutant degradation was studied figs 7 s13 and s14 apparently cl led to negligible degradation of micropollutants in this system fig s13 with an increase in hco3 dosage from 0 to 10 mm the 4 cp and p hba degradation was gradually enhanced the rate laws for 4 cp and p hba increased from 0 779 to 1 373 min 1 and 0 109 to 0 178 min 1 respectively fig 7 similar enhancement was also observed in phenol oxidation by mn vii zhang et al 2013 the possible explanation for the enhanced effect was that hco3 might serve as a ligand to complex with mn iii and or mn v during the degradation of p hba previous research suggested that the presence of hco3 could enhance the micropollutant degradation by ferrate fe vi this was mainly because hco3 stabilized the intermediates of fe vi through complexation and thus prevented the rapid disproportionation of these highly reactive intermediates luo et al 2019 therefore rmns hco3 complexes were likely generated and thus prolonged the mn iii and or mn v exposure as mentioned in previous sections pp suppressed 4 cp degradation because of the strong binding capacity on mn iii hence it was speculated that the mn iii hco3 was less stable but more reactive than mn iii pp leading to the enhancement degradation by contrast the presence of increasing hco3 dosage did not exhibit an influence on enr degradation considering no enhancement for enr the rmns hco3 complexes were selective toward micropollutants overall hco3 in this system presumably acted as a ligand and led to a promotion on micropollutant degradation the effect of nom on the micropollutant degradation by ss mn vii was tested using ha in this study fig s14 illustrates that ha displayed a negative impact on 4 cp and enr degradation in the concentration of 0 10 mg l the kobs values dropped from 0 779 min 1 to 0 455 min 1 and 0 817 min 1 to 0 500 min 1 respectively fig 7a b the reason was that ha would consume mn vii in the reaction thus reducing the available concentration of mn vii he et al 2009 besides the competitive absorption of ss irradiation between ha and mn vii could also weaken the photolysis of mn vii which reduced the amount of rmns on the other hand ha would also inhibit the direct photolysis of enr through competitive absorption of ss irradiation zhang et al 2019 since enr could be removed by direct photolysis as mentioned above similar observations were also reported in chlorophene oxidation by mn vii xu et al 2018 comparatively an enhancement on p hba degradation was found in the presence of ha values for kobs increased from 0 109 to 0 204 min 1 fig 7b this might be due to that ha could complex with rmns and the formed rmns ha complexes that were potentially strong oxidants shi et al 2020 on the other hand the Ï Ï interaction between the aromatic ring of p hba and aromatic components of ha would enhance the electron density of p hba thus causing ready attack of p hba by mn species he et al 2010 this result suggested degradation of p hba by ss mn vii was possible in water containing nom more significantly the influence of ha on model compounds implied the selectivity of rmns ha complexes toward micropollutants regarding to the elucidated reason of enhancing effect by hco3 and ha deep investigation was warranted 3 6 identification of degradation products and proposed pathways it is important to identify the degradation products to elucidate the degradation pathways in ss mn vii system therefore intermediates of three model compounds were determined during this process and details are listed in table s2 4 based on five degradation products and related findings two main pathways were proposed fig s15 in pathway i 4 cp underwent dechlorination and yielded c1 m z 93 after that c1 could be transformed into c2 m z 97 via hydrogenation in pathway ii 4 cp experienced hydroxylation on the ortho position of ho group and resulted in c3 m z 143 the occurrence of c3 was also concluded in 4 cp oxidation by mn vii hu et al 2017 further c3 underwent oxidation leading to the ring opening of 4 cp and thus c4 m z 177 formation c4 was probably converted into c5 m z 151 via addition reaction to sum up 4 cp degradation mainly involved hydrogenation hydroxylation oxidation ring cleavage and addition reactions in terms of p hba five products were detected in this process and three pathways were proposed fig s16 pathway i included decarboxylation and dehydrogenation reaction yielding the phenol product p1 m z 93 then p1 would be converted into p5 m z 97 via hydrogenation in pathway ii the ho group of p hba was substituted by the carboxyl group leading to the product p2 m z 165 in pathway iii p hba experienced ring opening and subsequent carboxylation thus resulting in the formation of p3 m z 133 then p3 was converted into p4 m z 103 through decarboxylation overall the p hba degradation included decarboxylation dehydrogenation substitution ring cleavage and carboxylation reactions as for enr six products were identified and three degradation pathways were proposed as shown in fig s17 the oxidation of piperazine ring led to a dealkylation of enr pathway i in pathway i the dealkylation of enr resulted in the formation of e1 m z 334 then e1 experienced a loss of amine on the piperazine substituent and stepwise carbonylation leading to the production of e2 m z 291 further e2 might occur the loss of a formaldehyde generating e6 m z 263 similar products were also reported in previous findings shao et al 2020 yang et al 2016b in pathway ii the partial dealkylation of enr induced the product e3 m z 332 it is widely known that e3 was ciprofloxacin which was commonly detected in the enr oxidation guo et al 2017 xu et al 2016 after that e3 was converted into e6 via dealkylation and subsequent piperazine ring cleavage in pathway iii enr underwent decarboxylation on the quinolone structure yielding e4 m z 316 in pathway iv enr occurred defluorination followed by oxidation and ring cleavage on piperazine ring leading to the product e5 m z 344 further occurrence of e4 and e5 was also proved in previous research baena nogueras et al 2017 qiu et al 2019 overall enr degradation in ss mn vii was mainly through dealkylation carbonylation piperazine ring cleavage and defluorination 3 7 removal of micropollutants by ss mn vii in real water the degradation of 4 cp p hba and enr by ss mn vii in different types of real water was further studied figs 8 and s18 groundwater surface water and secondary effluent of wastewater were employed as the three real waters to investigate the micropollutant degradation in this study milli q water samples were also used to compare with the above three real water samples detailed characteristics of three real water samples are given in text s6 the ss irradiation in real waters displayed comparable performance to the case of milli q water in the ss mn vii system as for 4 cp and enr the degradation was inhibited to different extents in three real waters the lowest degradation efficiency was found in secondary effluent followed by groundwater and surface water the retarded removal in real waters by ss mn vii was consistent with the inhibitory effect of ha as discussed in previous sections however note that the presence of hco3 facilitated the 4 cp degradation in milli q water this suggested that the occurrence of various water background components might also influence the removal of micropollutants in this system similar conclusion has been made by yang et al 2018a comparatively the removal of 4 cp by mn vii was promoted in real waters especially in secondary effluent mn vii was inefficient for enr removal in all water samples notably p hba degradation by the ss mn vii system in real waters exhibited greater performance than milli q water did corresponding to the enhanced effect of nom in milli q water similarly p hba oxidation by mn vii was also promoted in real waters secondary effluent in particular overall above results also revealed that the dissolved organic carbon values in groundwater surface water and secondary effluent did not exhibit correlated behaviors with degradation efficiencies this suggested that other constituents in these water samples might have a greater or less extent on the degradation in brief the ss mn vii process still performed well when treating micropollutants in real waters 3 8 removal of micropollutants by mn vii in natural sunlight ns uv and vl irradiation considering abundant solar energy globally it is worth evaluating the degradation of micropollutants by ss mn vii with the replacement of ns fig 8 illustrates that 4 cp was resistant to two types of solar irradiation whereas the direct photolysis of p hba and enr was observed more remarkable in ss irradiation this could be attributed to the lower intensity of ns compared to ss as shown in fig s1 furthermore 4 cp p hba and enr oxidation by mn vii under ns irradiation was less effective than ss did this could be ascribed to the lower intensity of ns thus the photolysis of mn vii would be weakened in the presence of ns and reduced the amount of rmns worth mentioning was that the micropollutant degradation was found more efficient in the synergistic effect of ns and mn vii than by ns irradiation and mn vii alone in summary the ns mn vii system also hold great promise to remove micropollutants further removal of micropollutants was evaluated in uv 290 Î» 400 nm and vl 400 Î» 800 nm irradiation via light filtration in the xenon lamp details in text s2 fig s19 illustrates that enr 4 cp and p hba were recalcitrant to uv and vl irradiation except enr 4 cp and p hba could be degraded by mn vii alone to some extent comparatively the introduction of uv or vl could enhance enr 4 cp and p hba degradation the degradation rates of three micropollutants by uv mn vii and vl mn vii were higher than those by mn vii and irradiation notably uv mn vii exhibited a stronger enhancement than vl mn vii did nevertheless vl irradiation was still promising for mn vii activation it was obvious that uv and vl irradiation were less efficient than ss for mn vii activation figs 1 and s19 likely due to the synergistic effect of uv and vl involved in the ss emission overall uv and vl can efficiently activate mn vii for micropollutant degradation 4 conclusion this study systematically examined the capability of applying ss irradiation to activate mn vii for micropollutant degradation generally except ba ss mn vii could achieve remarkable degradation of micropollutants proving a broad spectrum process for micropollutant degradation the marked removal of micropollutants in this system was due to the enhanced level of rmns i e mn iii and mn v rather than radicals under ss irradiation significantly through elucidating reaction mechanism of three model compounds 4 cp p hba and enr rmns might serve different roles during the reaction thus suggesting the selectivity of rmns toward micropollutants furthermore it was found that higher dose of mn vii increased the percentage of micropollutants removed by ss mn vii in addition degradation of model compounds was ph dependent it was found that the quantum yield of mn vii was not ph dependent water matrices including cl hco3 and ha displayed different impacts on micropollutant degradation in the ss mn vii process which should be taken into consideration in the real application hereafter based on the identified transformation products of 4 cp p hba and enr primary pathways were involved namely finally ss mn vii in real waters ns mn vii uv mn vii and vl mn vii also proved appreciable removal of micropollutants highlighting the applicability of this promising process in water treatment considering the inevitable conditions e g night and changeable weather in the real application it is proposed that xenon lamps can be equipped with solar panels above the solar collector reactor to ensure continuous solar emission and the solar collector reactor can be applied to fully accumulate sunlight for effectively treating micropollutants in this regard the reactor can be changed into natural or simulated solar modes to ensure the continuous operation in water treatments in sum insights gained from the present study open a new avenue to degrade micropollutants

16597,elevated atmospheric co2 may have consequences for methane ch4 emissions from wetlands yet the magnitude and direction remain unpredictable because the associated mechanisms have not been fully investigated here we established an in situ macrocosm experiment to compare the effects of elevated co2 700 ppm on the ch4 emissions from two wetlands an intermittently inundated calamagrostis angustifolia marsh and a permanently inundated carex lasiocarpa marsh the elevated co2 increased ch4 emissions by 27 6 57 6 in the c angustifolia marsh compared to a reduction of 18 7 23 5 in the c lasiocarpa marsh the co2 induced increase in ch4 emissions from the c angustifolia marsh was paralleled with 1 increased dissolved organic carbon doc released from plant photosynthesis and 2 reduced rate of ch4 oxidation due to a putative shift in methanotrophic community composition in contrast the co2 induced decrease in ch4 emissions from the c lasiocarpa marsh was associated with the increases in soil redox potential and pmoa gene abundance we synthesized data from worldwide wetland ecosystems and found that the responses of ch4 emissions to elevated co2 was determined by the wetland water table levels and associated plant oxygen secretion capacity in conditions with elevated co2 plants with a high oxygen secretion capacity suppress ch4 emissions while plants with low oxygen secretion capacity stimulate ch4 emissions both effects are mediated via a feedback loop involving shifts in activities of methanogens and methanotrophs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elevated atmospheric co2 ch4 emission freshwater marsh pmoa gene methanotrophic community plant oxygen secretion capacity 1 introduction the global atmospheric co2 recently exceeded 400 ppm and is predicted to surpass 700 ppm by the end of the 21st century ipcc 2013 elevated atmospheric co2 is known to stimulate leaf co2 assimilation nowak et al 2004 and promote plant growth derner et al 2003 long et al 2004 and this process could enhance soil carbon sequestration hill et al 2007 and in turn mitigate the rising atmospheric co2 however increased atmospheric co2 is considered an influential factor on wetland methane ch4 emissions ellis et al 2009 van groenigen et al 2011 a far more potent greenhouse gas than co2 however the effects of elevated co2 on wetland ch4 emissions remain ambiguous and the subject of intense scientific debate previous studies have reported positive effects xu et al 2004 negative effects schrope et al 1999 or even an absence of effects kang et al 2001 in response to elevated co2 methanogens and methanotrophs are the pivotal drivers of ch4 emissions as their activities ultimately determine ch4 production and oxidation rates in wetlands bridgham et al 2013 conrad 2007 jiang et al 2017 however the responses of ch4 producing and oxidizing microorganisms to elevated co2 remain understudied which is further complicated by the complex interactions between plants and microorganisms angel et al 2012 two mechanisms have been proposed to explain co2 induced changes in ch4 emissions elevated co2 induced increase in ch4 emissions because of the increased methanogenic substrate abundance inubushi et al 2003 megonigal and schlesinger 1997 while decline in ch4 emissions can be explained by the enhanced ch4 oxidation due to more oxygen supplied by plant roots under elevated co2 cheng et al 2000 qian et al 2020 both mechanisms are founded on sound principles but lack adequate experimental evidence of specific microbial and plant physiological mechanisms or a unifying theory for why both types of response are possible hydrological properties have long been considered as pivotal factors governing the structure of wetland plant communities lin et al 2016 wilcox 2004 which have profound effects on wetland carbon transformation processes heinemeyer and swindles 2018 kao kniffin and zhu 2013 for example plants with higher biomass and stem density release more methanogenic substrates and favor substrate versatile methanogens like methanosarcinaceae consequently enhancing ch4 emissions yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 while rice cultivars with larger and more porous root systems favor methanotrophs via releasing oxygen chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 elevated co2 can increase plant photosynthetic rate and root biomass reduce stomatal conductance pregitzer et al 2008 teng et al 2006 and profoundly influence microbial communities in plant rhizosphere through additional carbon supply drigo et al 2008 however the response of plants with differing traits to elevated co2 varies among plant species nie et al 2013 creating further uncertainty regarding the influence of elevated co2 on ch4 emissions from wetlands with differing vegetation and hydrology any definitive response to these uncertainties would likely involve ecosystem subclass specific explanations here we investigated the responses of ch4 emissions to elevated atmospheric co2 700 ppm using samples from the sanjiang plain in heilongjiang province china representing the largest tract of wetlands in east asia outside of siberia zhou and liu 2005 the sanjiang plain marshes release 0 96 tg ch4 annually cui 1997 a rate 13 times greater than that of siberia highlighting this ecosystem as a significant global hotspot of ch4 emissions and an ideal location to study globally significant ch4 dynamics bohn et al 2015 ding and cai 2007 calamagrostis angustifolia and carex lasiocarpa are the dominant marsh plants in this region but differ in their location and oxygen secretion capacities c angustifolia has a relatively low oxygen secretion capacity and tends to dominate in marshes with short summer inundation periods and shallow water depths c lasiocarpa has a higher oxygen secretion capacity and tends to dominate within hydric environments with deeper water depths we conducted an in situ open top chamber experiment within two wetlands dominated by either c angustifolia or c lasiocarpa and analyzed our data in conjunction with those of previous studies in order to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the responses of wetland ch4 emissions to elevated co2 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the study site was located at the sanjiang plain 47 35 n 133 31 e 56 m a s l china with a mean annual precipitation of 600 mm and an annual temperature of 1 9 c the dominant vegetation in the freshwater marsh shifts from c angustifolia to carex meyeruana and to c lasiocarpa along with increasing standing water depth ding et al 2002 a persistently inundated c lasiocarpa marsh and an intermittently inundated c angustifolia marsh were selected for the microcosm experiment the macrocosm experiment was conducted during two growth seasons from 19 may to 1 october 2014 and from 31 may to 1 october 2015 on 4 may 2014 and 10 may 2015 sixteen intact soil columns with corresponding plants 25 cm diameter and 30 cm depth were collected from each plant growth marsh and immediately transferred into specially designed pvc macrocosms 40 cm height and 25 cm inner diameter during the experimental period the standing water depth was maintained at 8 cm and 2 cm for the c lasiocarpa and c angustifolia marshes respectively sixteen macrocosms with similar initial ch4 fluxes for each plant marsh were divided into two groups and transferred to two open top chambers otcs in situ eight for each chamber four replicates of each plant marsh in each otc were used for flux measurement another four replicates were used for plant and soil sampling for laboratory incubation and dna extraction the otc chambers were constructed from a stainless steel frame and clear infrared transmissive aclar film walls to allow natural light exposure the main body of the otc chambers is 3 5 m tall in octagon shape with a side length of 1 5 m one chamber was used as a control and supplied with ambient air only while the other one was maintained with elevated co2 at 700 20 Î¼l l 1 by continuous injection of pure co2 using an automated system connected with a gas cylinder the co2 concentration in the otc was monitored using an infrared gas analyzer li 7000 licor lincoln ne usa 2 2 measurement of ch4 fluxes methane fluxes were measured using a static closed chamber technique briefly a chamber height 100 cm diameter 30 cm was inserted into the trough at the upper end of the macrocosm at 0 8 16 24 and 32 min after chamber closure the chamber air was collected with 50 ml syringes and injected into pre evacuated vials 20 ml fitted with butyl rubber stoppers gas samples were collected twice weekly in july and august and once weekly in may june and september sampling was done between 08 00 11 00 hrs local time to minimize diurnal variation in flux patterns ch4 concentrations were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 santa clara ca usa the rate of ch4 increase was determined by a linear regression of concentration versus time the regression coefficients from linear regressions were rejected unless r 2 was more than 0 90 the ch4 emission rate e ch4 kg ch4 ha 1 was calculated using the fluxes between two consecutive days of the measurements by the following equation e ch 4 Ï f i f i 1 2 t i 1 t i 24 100 where f is ch4 flux mg ch4 m 2 h 1 i is the i th measurement and the term t i 1 t i denotes the number of days between measurements 2 3 measurement of soil variables the redox potential eh in marshes was measured using platinum electrodes at a depth of 10 cm the reference electrode 244 mv was added to the measured value to relate the results to the standard hydrogen electrode soil temperature was measured using a portable digital thermometer jm624 jinming instrument tianjin china at the 10 cm depth a rhizon mom porewater sampler rhizosphere research products wageningen the netherlands was used to collect samples of porewater in marshes the samplers were permanently installed at 5 cm and 10 cm depth and porewater was sampled immediately after ch4 measurements prior to collecting samples approximately 5 ml of porewater was extracted and discarded subsequently 10 and 20 ml of porewater was collected and injected into a 20 ml pre evacuated vial filled with 10 ml pure n2 gas for determining ch4 concentration and another 20 ml pre evacuated vial for determining dissolved organic carbon doc concentration respectively porewater doc was analyzed using a shimadzu c analyzer toc vcph shimadzu kyoto japan dissolved porewater ch4 concentration was determined by shaking the vial vigorously for 5 min and the vial headspace gas was used for analysis dissolved ch4 concentration c Î¼mol l 1 was calculated as previously described by ding et al 2010 2 4 measurement of Î´ 13ch4 and calculation of fraction of ch4 oxidized to measure fraction of ch4 oxidized in freshwater marshes additional porewater samples were collected as described above during the growth season we assume that 13ch4 in porewater represents the isotope signature of ch4 after oxidation and that plant ventilation is not a major contribution of this isotopic difference between soil root producing ch4 and the porewater ch4 after vigorous shaking by hand gas in the headspace of the vial was sampled for analysis of ch4 concentration and Î´ 13ch4 soil samples were also collected from the surface layer 0 15 cm and incubated anaerobically in 125 ml flasks at 1 h and 50 h of incubation the headspace gas of the flask was sampled for analysis of ch4 concentration and Î´ 13ch4 the Î´ 13ch4 value was measured on a finnigan mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo finnigan bremen germany the fraction of the ch4 oxidized f ox in freshwater marshes is calculated as follows conrad and klose 2005 krÃ¼ger et al 2002 f ox Î´ 13 c h 4 original Î´ 13 c h 4 oxidized 1 Î± ox 1 Î´ 13 c h 4 oxidized 1000 where Î´ 13ch4 original is Î´ 13ch4 produced in soil under anaerobic incubation Î´ 13ch4 oxidized is Î´ 13ch4 in porewater and Î± ox is the isotope fractionation factor associated with ch4 oxidation 2 5 laboratory incubation soil ch4 production potentials were measured as follows 10 g of fresh soil sample or 2 g of fresh root sample on an oven dried basis were added in a 125 ml glass jar the ratio of soil to water was adjusted to 1 2 with distilled water and mixed thoroughly the jars were evacuated prior to injection with pure nitrogen gas n2 using an atmospheric pressure balance and this process was repeated three times to obtain a more anoxic condition incubation temperature was set at 20 c which was close to the mean summer soil temperature of the studied freshwater marshes during the incubation the ch4 concentration in the jar headspace was measured daily until the ch4 accumulation rate decreased linear regression of ch4 concentration with incubation time was used to calculate ch4 production rates ch4 oxidation potentials were measured in a procedure similar to ch4 production potential measurement but with an air instead of n2 in the flask headspace and with high concentration of ch4 supplemented pure ch4 was injected into each flask to achieve a concentration of 10 000 ppm the flasks were incubated in the dark at 20 c with a shaking velocity of 100 g the headspace gas in the flask after vigorous shaking was sampled and measured for ch4 concentration daily within two weeks ch4 oxidation potentials were calculated by linear regression of ch4 depletion with incubation time 2 6 dna extraction and real time quantitative pcr four replicate macrocosms of each treatment were destructively sampled on 8 august 2015 when plants had the highest photosynthesis the dna from bulk soils rhizosphere soils and roots was extracted as described previously bao et al 2014 lin et al 2017 the copy numbers of mcra and pmoa genes were quantified using a cfx96 optical real time detection system bio rad laboratories inc hercules ca usa the primer pairs mlf mlr juottonen et al 2006 and a189f mb661r costello and lidstrom 1999 were used to quantify mcra and pmoa genes

place of a dna sample as a negative control standard curves were created using a 10 fold dilution series of plasmid dna from one representative clone containing the mcra or pmoa genes dna template was serially diluted to assess the pcr inhibition a single peak was achieved during the amplification with amplification efficiencies of 97 3 108 7 and r 2 values of 0 990 0 999 2 7 high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis for methanotrophs the primer pair a189f mb661r costello and lidstrom 1999 was used to amplify the pmoa gene the pcr amplification and sequencing library construction were conducted by personalbio technology co ltd shanghai china and the amplicon pyrosequencing was conducted on a 454 life science genome sequencer flx titanium instrument roche nj usa raw sequences were processed using uparse edgar 2013 and qiime caporaso et al 2010 reads with quality score lower than 20 ambiguous bases and improper primers were discarded the resultant high quality

bork 2019 all sequences have been deposited in the dna data bank of japan under the accession number dra005608 2 8 literature synthesis we compiled a dataset using the available global data on elevated co2 effects on wetland ch4 emissions reported in peer reviewed journal articles a survey of publications was conducted within web of science using search terms of elevated co2 or co2 enrichment and ch4 emissions and wetland potential papers of interests were further searched from the reference lists of the relevant articles and google scholar data collection was restricted to studies of natural wetlands water table levels and environmental factor information were collected from the published papers when data were presented solely via graphs digitization using a getdata graph digitizer version 2 24 http getdata graph digitizer com and unit conversion was carried out to obtain the data the final database consisted of 39 paired measurements derived from 13 publications and 5 measurements from our own unpublished data table s1 for each paired measurement the response ratio was used as effect size in the analysis response ratio lnr ln xt x c where x t and x c are the means of ch4 emissions under elevated co2 and ambient co2 conditions respectively the variance v of response ratios was estimated as follows v s t 2 n t x t 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where n t and n c are the sample sizes for the elevated co2 and ambient co2 groups respectively s t and s c are the standard deviations of ch4 emissions for the elevated co2 and ambient co2 groups respectively metawin 2 1 software sinauer associate inc sunderland ma was used to calculate the weighted response ratio lnr and 95 confidential interval ci by bootstrapping 9999 iterations using a categorical random effect model the percentage changes of elevated co2 on ch4 emissions were estimated as follows change e ln r 1 100 according to the principle of maximum adjusted r 2 binomial correlations were conducted to examine the relationships between lnr and water table level 2 9 statistical analysis spss 18 0 software package for windows spss inc chicago il usa was used for statistical analyses the normality and homogeneity of variance levene s test of data were checked before analysis of variance urbanovÃ¡ et al 2011 and subsequently ln transformed to meet the requirements of anova analyses where necessary one way anova based on least significant difference lsd was used for the statistically significance test a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plot was constructed based on the bray curtis distances and was processed with the vegan package in the r software version 3 4 1 3 results 3 1 effect of elevated co2 on ch4 emissions from natural wetlands in the c angustifolia marsh elevated co2 significantly increased ch4 emissions by 27 6 57 6 during the two years fig 1 in contrast in the c lasiocarpa marsh elevated co2 significantly decreased ch4 emissions by 18 7 23 5 on compiling global data from 39 paired natural wetland ch4 emissions under ambient and elevated co2 we found that elevated co2 stimulated ch4 emissions by an average of 21 8 fig 2 the response ratios of ch4 emissions to elevated co2 correlated more significantly with water table levels than with any other variables such as doc concentration and plant biomass and exhibited a downward parabolic relationship positive response ratios were found predominantly in natural wetlands with water tables ranging from 11 to 6 cm response ratios reached the maximum value in wetlands with a water table depth around 0 cm negative responses in ch4 emissions were associated with water tables below 11 cm or above 6 cm 3 2 effect of elevated co2 on soil physiochemical properties in the c angustifolia marsh elevated co2 significantly enriched mean doc concentration in porewater from 45 mg l 1 under ambient co2 to 65 mg l 1 figs 3 and s1 however elevated co2 had no significant effect on mean porewater doc concentration in the c lasiocarpa marsh elevated co2 significantly p 0 05 increased redox potential in the c lasiocarpa marsh by 21 but did not affect redox potential in the c angustifolia marsh figs 3 and s2 the ch4 flux was positively correlated with mean doc concentration in porewater p 0 01 and negatively associated with redox potential p 0 05 but had no relationship with dissolved ch4 in soil pore water at 5 cm and 10 cm depth fig 4 3 3 effect of elevated co2 on methanogens and methanotrophs the abundance of methanogens and ch4 production potential were significantly higher in the c lasiocarpa marsh than those in the c angustifolia marsh figs s3 and s4 however elevated co2 did not affect the abundance of methanogens and ch4 production potential in either c lasiocarpa or c angustifolia marsh likewise the abundance of methanotrophs and ch4 oxidation potential were significantly higher in the c lasiocarpa marsh than those in the c angustifolia marsh figs s3 and s5 elevated co2 had no effect on the abundance of methanotrophs and ch4 oxidation potential in the c angustifolia marsh but enhanced them in the c lasiocarpa marsh the fraction of oxidized ch4 from in situ porewater under elevated co2 was significantly higher 73 3 p 0 05 than under ambient co2 65 1 table 1 in the c lasiocarpa marsh conversely elevated co2 decreased the fraction of oxidized ch4 by 13 in the c angustifolia marsh the nmds analysis showed that methanotrophic community structure was substantially different between the c lasiocarpa and c angustifolia marsh while the influence of elevated co2 on methanotrophic community structure was much weaker fig s6 regardless the relative abundance of otu379 methylocystis significantly increased from 11 8 to 18 7 in the c lasiocarpa rhizosphere soil under elevated co2 fig s7 in contrast elevated co2 markedly reduced the relative abundance of methylocystis but enhanced that of usc Î± in the c angustifolia marsh the overall effects of elevated co2 on ch4 emissions and related influential factors from natural wetlands are summarized as a conceptual diagram fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 responses of ch4 emissions to elevated co2 in the persistently inundated c lasiocarpa marsh schrope et al 1999 attributed decreased ch4 emissions under elevated co2 to suppression of ch4 production by oxygen delivery to the rhizosphere of rice plants in our study elevated co2 significantly reduced ch4 emissions in the c lasiocarpa marsh though ch4 production potential and the abundance of methanogens remained unchanged lin et al 2017 a similar response of methanogens to elevated co2 has been observed in periodically waterlogged grasslands and rice fields angel et al 2012 liu et al 2016 although elevated co2 increased photosynthesis in the c lasiocarpa marsh doc concentration in porewater remained unaltered this suggests that increased photosynthetic carbon exudates under elevated co2 were rapidly consumed by non methanogenic heterotrophic microbes due to increased rhizospheric oxygenation jiang et al 2017 moreover ch4 emission from the c lasiocarpa marsh is known to be primarily produced via the hydrogenotrophic pathway lin et al 2015 and thus any increase in photosynthetic c exudates low molecular weight organic acids might have limited effect on methanogenesis conversely elevated co2 substantially enhanced the fraction of oxidized ch4 in porewater and the abundance of pmoa genes in roots and rhizospheric soil methanotrophs have been reported as primary regulators of ch4 emissions chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 qian et al 2021 and thus an increase in their abundance under elevated co2 may have contributed to lower ch4 emissions elevated co2 also significantly increased the relative abundance of otu379 methylocystis in the c lasiocarpa marsh fig 5 methylocystis are often reported to be predominant chen et al 2008 cui et al 2020 dedysh et al 2001 and metabolically active methanotrophs with remarkably higher ch4 oxidation potential than other types of methanotrophs in wetlands deng et al 2016 esson et al 2016 our findings thus indicate that the increased plant photosynthesis and belowground biomass under elevated co2 enhanced oxygen release into the rhizosphere and triggered proliferation of methanotrophs especially methylocystis in c lasiocarpa marsh wei et al 2016 thereby accelerating ch4 oxidation chen et al 2019 4 2 responses of ch4 emissions to elevated co2 in the intermittently inundated c angustifolia marsh in the c angustifolia marsh elevated co2 significantly enriched mean doc concentration in porewater which was significantly correlated with ch4 fluxes indicating that increased ch4 emission was associated with an increased input of photosynthates previous studies have shown that ch4 production rates in c angustifolia marshes are primarily dependent on the magnitude of substrates derived from living plants rather than plant litter lin et al 2015 our results are consistent with saarnio et al 1998 and inubushi et al 2003 who attributed a 2 fold increase in ch4 production potential in sedge and sphagnum wetlands and 38 51 increase in ch4 emissions in japanese rice paddies to augmentation of root exudates under elevated co2 we found that elevated co2 decreased the fraction of in situ oxidized ch4 in porewater of the c angustifolia marsh although redox potential remained stable which is consistent with previous findings within a swiss face system ineson et al 1998 we also found that elevated co2 shifted methanotrophic community from methylocystis toward usc Î± in the c angustifolia marsh the ch4 oxidation capacity of usc Î± was much lower than that of methylocystis and thus the shift of methanotrophic community in c angustifolia marsh might decrease ch4 oxidation usc Î± tend to be ubiquitous in upland soils lÃ¼ke et al 2014 menyailo et al 2010 and periodically water saturated gleyic soils knief et al 2006 the c angustifolia marsh provides a suitable habitat for usc Î± due to the infrequent inundation periods in summer and a long period of water table drawdown in winter in general ch4 oxidation rates of at least 40 10 12 Î¼mol ch4 cell 1 h 1 are required to maintain metabolism of methanotrophs kolb et al 2005 however cell specific ch4 oxidation rates of usc Î± can be as low as 1 14 10 12 Î¼mol ch4 cell 1 h 1 and hence usc Î± require additional carbon sources for adequate growth degelmann et al 2010 it seems likely that usc Î± would be less competitive than other heterotrophic organisms for organic carbon other than ch4 and c angustifolia provides more carbon sources for their growth under elevated co2 the mechanisms underpinning the response of methylocystis and usc Î± to elevated co2 warrant further investigation our results suggest that the increased methanogenic substrates and reduced ch4 oxidation induced by elevated co2 promote an increase in ch4 emissions in the c angustifolia marsh 4 3 overall responses in the natural freshwater wetlands consideration of water table levels radically improves our ability to predict the response of wetland ch4 emissions to elevated co2 evans et al 2021 some uncertainties remain however firstly global experimental data on co2 effects within wetland ecosystems are limited covering a narrow range of water table levels and lacking for wetlands with standing water table depths 5 cm table s1 secondly the sampling frequency of ch4 flux measurements is suboptimal for some studies limiting our ability to extrapolate from their findings to other scenarios kang et al 2001 thirdly the apparatus used to simulate elevated atmospheric co2 differs greatly between studies and it is feasible that this too could influence ch4 responses our current estimations could be further improved by conducting more long term multifactorial manipulation experiments in different regions despite these constraints however it is clear that our global data synthesis indicates that the wetland water levels directly influence ch4 emission responses under elevated co2 fig 2 our experiment and previous findings suggest the mechanisms involving specific wetland plants and their gas transport capacity adjusted to the water table conditions of the wetlands radial oxygen loss from wetland plants varies widely between species chabbi et al 2000 while species distribution in wetlands is largely determined by hydrology lin et al 2016 wilcox 2004 wetlands with deeper standing water usually contain plants with a greater gas transport capacity waddington et al 1996 and may deliver more oxygen to the rhizosphere under elevated co2 moreover the area of aerenchyma of the same plant species also increased with increasing standing water depths pincam et al 2017 vann and megonigal 2003 showed that the positive effect of increased plant photosynthesis on flooded soil ch4 flux was markedly reduced when plants exhibited higher gas transport capacity owing to greater excretion of oxygen to the rhizosphere plants such as c lasiocarpa which dominate freshwater marshes with deep standing water exhibit significantly higher gas transport capacity and deliver more oxygen to belowground environments resulting in a higher redox potential and ch4 oxidation compared with c angustifolia under elevated co2 plant photosynthesis significantly increases ainsworth and rogers 2007 bohn et al 2015 while stomatal conductance decreases lai et al 2012 medlyn et al 2001 causing an increase in oxygen release into rhizosphere during photosynthesis lai et al 2012 and consequent higher abundance of methanotrophs especially methylocystis therefore methane oxidation rather than input of photosynthates is the predominant regulator of ch4 emission rates in wetlands with deep standing water in contrast c angustifolia which dominates freshwater marshes with shallow summer standing water has a poor gas transport capacity suggesting that there would be a marginal increase in oxygen delivery to the rhizosphere under elevated co2 ding et al 2004 but a substantial increase in delivery of photosynthetic carbon and doc for methanogens these changes would completely offset potential effects of any marginal increase in oxygen supply under the elevated co2 condition on ch4 oxidation thereby creating net stimulation of ch4 production 4 4 implications for models of future ch4 emissions conventional models generally assume that elevated co2 would increase ch4 emissions through increased primary production and the consequently greater carbon supply to belowground microorganisms these models have predicted a 70 increase in ch4 emissions from wetlands under elevated co2 by 2100 while the effects of temperature rise 4 5 and precipitation change 4 6 are predicted to remain minimal melton et al 2013 our results indicate that these models may grossly overestimate future ch4 emissions and therefore a refinement of model parameterization seems warranted and incorporation of microbial data into ch4 modeling is also desirable further study of the interactions between vegetational dynamics and distinct methane related microbial functional groups methanogens vs methanotrophs could improve our understanding of the global significance of ch4 fluxes from wetlands 5 conclusion our results reveal that elevated co2 elicits divergent effects on wetland ch4 emissions dependent entirely upon the hydrological and the associated vegetational characteristics of the studied wetlands in marshes dominated with c angustifolia which thrives in intermittently inundated wetlands elevated co2 increased ch4 emissions in contrast in marshes with c lasiocarpa which prefer to inhabit in permanently inundated wetlands elevated co2 reduced ch4 emissions our meta analysis results further confirm that co2 effects on ch4 emissions diverge according to water table and suggest that previous projections of ch4 emissions from wetlands under elevated co2 may have

16597,elevated atmospheric co2 may have consequences for methane ch4 emissions from wetlands yet the magnitude and direction remain unpredictable because the associated mechanisms have not been fully investigated here we established an in situ macrocosm experiment to compare the effects of elevated co2 700 ppm on the ch4 emissions from two wetlands an intermittently inundated calamagrostis angustifolia marsh and a permanently inundated carex lasiocarpa marsh the elevated co2 increased ch4 emissions by 27 6 57 6 in the c angustifolia marsh compared to a reduction of 18 7 23 5 in the c lasiocarpa marsh the co2 induced increase in ch4 emissions from the c angustifolia marsh was paralleled with 1 increased dissolved organic carbon doc released from plant photosynthesis and 2 reduced rate of ch4 oxidation due to a putative shift in methanotrophic community composition in contrast the co2 induced decrease in ch4 emissions from the c lasiocarpa marsh was associated with the increases in soil redox potential and pmoa gene abundance we synthesized data from worldwide wetland ecosystems and found that the responses of ch4 emissions to elevated co2 was determined by the wetland water table levels and associated plant oxygen secretion capacity in conditions with elevated co2 plants with a high oxygen secretion capacity suppress ch4 emissions while plants with low oxygen secretion capacity stimulate ch4 emissions both effects are mediated via a feedback loop involving shifts in activities of methanogens and methanotrophs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elevated atmospheric co2 ch4 emission freshwater marsh pmoa gene methanotrophic community plant oxygen secretion capacity 1 introduction the global atmospheric co2 recently exceeded 400 ppm and is predicted to surpass 700 ppm by the end of the 21st century ipcc 2013 elevated atmospheric co2 is known to stimulate leaf co2 assimilation nowak et al 2004 and promote plant growth derner et al 2003 long et al 2004 and this process could enhance soil carbon sequestration hill et al 2007 and in turn mitigate the rising atmospheric co2 however increased atmospheric co2 is considered an influential factor on wetland methane ch4 emissions ellis et al 2009 van groenigen et al 2011 a far more potent greenhouse gas than co2 however the effects of elevated co2 on wetland ch4 emissions remain ambiguous and the subject of intense scientific debate previous studies have reported positive effects xu et al 2004 negative effects schrope et al 1999 or even an absence of effects kang et al 2001 in response to elevated co2 methanogens and methanotrophs are the pivotal drivers of ch4 emissions as their activities ultimately determine ch4 production and oxidation rates in wetlands bridgham et al 2013 conrad 2007 jiang et al 2017 however the responses of ch4 producing and oxidizing microorganisms to elevated co2 remain understudied which is further complicated by the complex interactions between plants and microorganisms angel et al 2012 two mechanisms have been proposed to explain co2 induced changes in ch4 emissions elevated co2 induced increase in ch4 emissions because of the increased methanogenic substrate abundance inubushi et al 2003 megonigal and schlesinger 1997 while decline in ch4 emissions can be explained by the enhanced ch4 oxidation due to more oxygen supplied by plant roots under elevated co2 cheng et al 2000 qian et al 2020 both mechanisms are founded on sound principles but lack adequate experimental evidence of specific microbial and plant physiological mechanisms or a unifying theory for why both types of response are possible hydrological properties have long been considered as pivotal factors governing the structure of wetland plant communities lin et al 2016 wilcox 2004 which have profound effects on wetland carbon transformation processes heinemeyer and swindles 2018 kao kniffin and zhu 2013 for example plants with higher biomass and stem density release more methanogenic substrates and favor substrate versatile methanogens like methanosarcinaceae consequently enhancing ch4 emissions yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 while rice cultivars with larger and more porous root systems favor methanotrophs via releasing oxygen chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 elevated co2 can increase plant photosynthetic rate and root biomass reduce stomatal conductance pregitzer et al 2008 teng et al 2006 and profoundly influence microbial communities in plant rhizosphere through additional carbon supply drigo et al 2008 however the response of plants with differing traits to elevated co2 varies among plant species nie et al 2013 creating further uncertainty regarding the influence of elevated co2 on ch4 emissions from wetlands with differing vegetation and hydrology any definitive response to these uncertainties would likely involve ecosystem subclass specific explanations here we investigated the responses of ch4 emissions to elevated atmospheric co2 700 ppm using samples from the sanjiang plain in heilongjiang province china representing the largest tract of wetlands in east asia outside of siberia zhou and liu 2005 the sanjiang plain marshes release 0 96 tg ch4 annually cui 1997 a rate 13 times greater than that of siberia highlighting this ecosystem as a significant global hotspot of ch4 emissions and an ideal location to study globally significant ch4 dynamics bohn et al 2015 ding and cai 2007 calamagrostis angustifolia and carex lasiocarpa are the dominant marsh plants in this region but differ in their location and oxygen secretion capacities c angustifolia has a relatively low oxygen secretion capacity and tends to dominate in marshes with short summer inundation periods and shallow water depths c lasiocarpa has a higher oxygen secretion capacity and tends to dominate within hydric environments with deeper water depths we conducted an in situ open top chamber experiment within two wetlands dominated by either c angustifolia or c lasiocarpa and analyzed our data in conjunction with those of previous studies in order to investigate potential mechanisms underlying the responses of wetland ch4 emissions to elevated co2 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the study site was located at the sanjiang plain 47 35 n 133 31 e 56 m a s l china with a mean annual precipitation of 600 mm and an annual temperature of 1 9 c the dominant vegetation in the freshwater marsh shifts from c angustifolia to carex meyeruana and to c lasiocarpa along with increasing standing water depth ding et al 2002 a persistently inundated c lasiocarpa marsh and an intermittently inundated c angustifolia marsh were selected for the microcosm experiment the macrocosm experiment was conducted during two growth seasons from 19 may to 1 october 2014 and from 31 may to 1 october 2015 on 4 may 2014 and 10 may 2015 sixteen intact soil columns with corresponding plants 25 cm diameter and 30 cm depth were collected from each plant growth marsh and immediately transferred into specially designed pvc macrocosms 40 cm height and 25 cm inner diameter during the experimental period the standing water depth was maintained at 8 cm and 2 cm for the c lasiocarpa and c angustifolia marshes respectively sixteen macrocosms with similar initial ch4 fluxes for each plant marsh were divided into two groups and transferred to two open top chambers otcs in situ eight for each chamber four replicates of each plant marsh in each otc were used for flux measurement another four replicates were used for plant and soil sampling for laboratory incubation and dna extraction the otc chambers were constructed from a stainless steel frame and clear infrared transmissive aclar film walls to allow natural light exposure the main body of the otc chambers is 3 5 m tall in octagon shape with a side length of 1 5 m one chamber was used as a control and supplied with ambient air only while the other one was maintained with elevated co2 at 700 20 Î¼l l 1 by continuous injection of pure co2 using an automated system connected with a gas cylinder the co2 concentration in the otc was monitored using an infrared gas analyzer li 7000 licor lincoln ne usa 2 2 measurement of ch4 fluxes methane fluxes were measured using a static closed chamber technique briefly a chamber height 100 cm diameter 30 cm was inserted into the trough at the upper end of the macrocosm at 0 8 16 24 and 32 min after chamber closure the chamber air was collected with 50 ml syringes and injected into pre evacuated vials 20 ml fitted with butyl rubber stoppers gas samples were collected twice weekly in july and august and once weekly in may june and september sampling was done between 08 00 11 00 hrs local time to minimize diurnal variation in flux patterns ch4 concentrations were determined using a gas chromatograph agilent 7890 santa clara ca usa the rate of ch4 increase was determined by a linear regression of concentration versus time the regression coefficients from linear regressions were rejected unless r 2 was more than 0 90 the ch4 emission rate e ch4 kg ch4 ha 1 was calculated using the fluxes between two consecutive days of the measurements by the following equation e ch 4 Ï f i f i 1 2 t i 1 t i 24 100 where f is ch4 flux mg ch4 m 2 h 1 i is the i th measurement and the term t i 1 t i denotes the number of days between measurements 2 3 measurement of soil variables the redox potential eh in marshes was measured using platinum electrodes at a depth of 10 cm the reference electrode 244 mv was added to the measured value to relate the results to the standard hydrogen electrode soil temperature was measured using a portable digital thermometer jm624 jinming instrument tianjin china at the 10 cm depth a rhizon mom porewater sampler rhizosphere research products wageningen the netherlands was used to collect samples of porewater in marshes the samplers were permanently installed at 5 cm and 10 cm depth and porewater was sampled immediately after ch4 measurements prior to collecting samples approximately 5 ml of porewater was extracted and discarded subsequently 10 and 20 ml of porewater was collected and injected into a 20 ml pre evacuated vial filled with 10 ml pure n2 gas for determining ch4 concentration and another 20 ml pre evacuated vial for determining dissolved organic carbon doc concentration respectively porewater doc was analyzed using a shimadzu c analyzer toc vcph shimadzu kyoto japan dissolved porewater ch4 concentration was determined by shaking the vial vigorously for 5 min and the vial headspace gas was used for analysis dissolved ch4 concentration c Î¼mol l 1 was calculated as previously described by ding et al 2010 2 4 measurement of Î´ 13ch4 and calculation of fraction of ch4 oxidized to measure fraction of ch4 oxidized in freshwater marshes additional porewater samples were collected as described above during the growth season we assume that 13ch4 in porewater represents the isotope signature of ch4 after oxidation and that plant ventilation is not a major contribution of this isotopic difference between soil root producing ch4 and the porewater ch4 after vigorous shaking by hand gas in the headspace of the vial was sampled for analysis of ch4 concentration and Î´ 13ch4 soil samples were also collected from the surface layer 0 15 cm and incubated anaerobically in 125 ml flasks at 1 h and 50 h of incubation the headspace gas of the flask was sampled for analysis of ch4 concentration and Î´ 13ch4 the Î´ 13ch4 value was measured on a finnigan mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo finnigan bremen germany the fraction of the ch4 oxidized f ox in freshwater marshes is calculated as follows conrad and klose 2005 krÃ¼ger et al 2002 f ox Î´ 13 c h 4 original Î´ 13 c h 4 oxidized 1 Î± ox 1 Î´ 13 c h 4 oxidized 1000 where Î´ 13ch4 original is Î´ 13ch4 produced in soil under anaerobic incubation Î´ 13ch4 oxidized is Î´ 13ch4 in porewater and Î± ox is the isotope fractionation factor associated with ch4 oxidation 2 5 laboratory incubation soil ch4 production potentials were measured as follows 10 g of fresh soil sample or 2 g of fresh root sample on an oven dried basis were added in a 125 ml glass jar the ratio of soil to water was adjusted to 1 2 with distilled water and mixed thoroughly the jars were evacuated prior to injection with pure nitrogen gas n2 using an atmospheric pressure balance and this process was repeated three times to obtain a more anoxic condition incubation temperature was set at 20 c which was close to the mean summer soil temperature of the studied freshwater marshes during the incubation the ch4 concentration in the jar headspace was measured daily until the ch4 accumulation rate decreased linear regression of ch4 concentration with incubation time was used to calculate ch4 production rates ch4 oxidation potentials were measured in a procedure similar to ch4 production potential measurement but with an air instead of n2 in the flask headspace and with high concentration of ch4 supplemented pure ch4 was injected into each flask to achieve a concentration of 10 000 ppm the flasks were incubated in the dark at 20 c with a shaking velocity of 100 g the headspace gas in the flask after vigorous shaking was sampled and measured for ch4 concentration daily within two weeks ch4 oxidation potentials were calculated by linear regression of ch4 depletion with incubation time 2 6 dna extraction and real time quantitative pcr four replicate macrocosms of each treatment were destructively sampled on 8 august 2015 when plants had the highest photosynthesis the dna from bulk soils rhizosphere soils and roots was extracted as described previously bao et al 2014 lin et al 2017 the copy numbers of mcra and pmoa genes were quantified using a cfx96 optical real time

sequencing and bioinformatics analysis for methanotrophs the primer pair a189f mb661r costello and lidstrom 1999 was used to amplify the pmoa gene the pcr amplification and sequencing library construction were conducted by personalbio technology co ltd shanghai china and the amplicon pyrosequencing was conducted on a 454 life science genome sequencer flx titanium instrument roche nj usa raw sequences were processed using uparse edgar 2013 and qiime caporaso et al 2010 reads with quality score lower than 20 ambiguous bases and improper primers were discarded the resultant high quality

bork 2019 all sequences have been deposited in the dna data bank of japan under the accession number dra005608 2 8 literature synthesis we compiled a dataset using the available global data on elevated co2 effects on wetland ch4 emissions reported in peer reviewed journal articles a survey of publications was conducted within web of science using search terms of elevated co2 or co2 enrichment and ch4 emissions and wetland potential papers of interests were further searched from the reference lists of the relevant articles and google scholar data collection was restricted to studies of natural wetlands water table levels and environmental factor information were collected from the published papers when data were presented solely via graphs digitization using a getdata graph digitizer version 2 24 http getdata graph digitizer com and unit conversion was carried out to obtain the data the final database consisted of 39 paired measurements derived from 13 publications and 5 measurements from our own unpublished data table s1 for each paired measurement the response ratio was used as effect size in the analysis response ratio lnr ln xt x c where x t and x c are the means of ch4 emissions under elevated co2 and ambient co2 conditions respectively the variance v of response ratios was estimated as follows v s t 2 n t x t 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where n t and n c are the sample sizes for the elevated co2 and ambient co2 groups respectively s t and s c are the standard deviations of ch4 emissions for the elevated co2 and ambient co2 groups respectively metawin 2 1 software sinauer associate inc sunderland ma was used to calculate the weighted response ratio lnr and 95 confidential interval ci by bootstrapping 9999 iterations using a categorical random effect model the percentage changes of elevated co2 on ch4 emissions were estimated as follows change e ln r 1 100 according to the principle of maximum adjusted r 2 binomial correlations were conducted to

one way anova based on least significant difference lsd was used for the statistically significance test a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds plot was constructed based on the bray curtis distances and was processed with the vegan package in the r software version 3 4 1 3 results 3 1 effect of elevated co2 on ch4 emissions from natural wetlands in the c angustifolia marsh elevated co2 significantly increased ch4 emissions by 27 6 57 6 during the two years fig 1 in contrast in the c lasiocarpa marsh elevated co2 significantly decreased ch4 emissions by 18 7 23 5 on compiling global data from 39 paired natural wetland ch4 emissions under ambient and elevated co2 we found that elevated co2 stimulated ch4 emissions by an average of 21 8 fig 2 the response ratios of ch4 emissions to elevated co2 correlated more significantly with water table levels than with any other variables such as doc concentration and plant biomass and exhibited a downward parabolic relationship positive response ratios were found predominantly in natural wetlands with water tables ranging from 11 to 6 cm response ratios reached the maximum value in wetlands with a water table depth around 0 cm negative responses in ch4 emissions were associated with water tables below 11 cm or above 6 cm 3 2 effect of elevated co2 on soil physiochemical properties in the c angustifolia marsh elevated co2 significantly enriched mean doc concentration in porewater from 45 mg l 1 under ambient co2 to 65 mg l 1 figs 3 and s1 however elevated co2 had no significant effect on mean porewater doc concentration in the c lasiocarpa marsh elevated co2 significantly p 0 05 increased redox potential in the c lasiocarpa marsh by 21 but did not affect redox potential in the c angustifolia marsh figs 3 and s2 the ch4 flux was positively correlated with mean doc concentration in porewater p 0 01 and negatively associated with redox potential p 0 05 but had no relationship with dissolved ch4 in soil pore water at 5 cm and 10 cm depth fig 4 3 3 effect of elevated co2 on methanogens and methanotrophs the abundance of methanogens and ch4 production potential were significantly higher in the c lasiocarpa marsh than those in the c angustifolia marsh figs s3 and s4 however elevated co2 did not affect the abundance of methanogens and ch4 production potential in either c lasiocarpa or c angustifolia marsh likewise the abundance of methanotrophs and ch4 oxidation potential were significantly higher in the c lasiocarpa marsh than those in the c angustifolia marsh figs s3 and s5 elevated co2 had no effect on the abundance of methanotrophs and ch4 oxidation potential in the c angustifolia marsh but enhanced them in the c lasiocarpa marsh the fraction of oxidized ch4 from in situ porewater under elevated co2 was significantly higher 73 3 p 0 05 than under ambient co2 65 1 table 1 in the c lasiocarpa marsh conversely elevated co2 decreased the fraction of oxidized ch4 by 13 in the c angustifolia marsh the nmds analysis showed that methanotrophic community structure was substantially different between the c lasiocarpa and c angustifolia marsh while the influence of elevated co2 on methanotrophic community structure was much weaker fig s6 regardless the relative abundance of otu379 methylocystis significantly increased from 11 8 to 18 7 in the c lasiocarpa rhizosphere soil under elevated co2 fig s7 in contrast elevated co2 markedly reduced the relative abundance of methylocystis but enhanced that of usc Î± in the c angustifolia marsh the overall effects of elevated co2 on ch4 emissions and related influential factors from natural wetlands are summarized as a conceptual diagram fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 responses of ch4 emissions to elevated co2 in the persistently inundated c lasiocarpa marsh schrope et al 1999 attributed decreased ch4 emissions under elevated co2 to suppression of ch4 production by oxygen delivery to the rhizosphere of rice plants in our study elevated co2 significantly reduced ch4 emissions in the c lasiocarpa marsh though ch4 production potential and the abundance of methanogens remained unchanged lin et al 2017 a similar response of methanogens to elevated co2 has been observed in periodically waterlogged grasslands and rice fields angel et al 2012 liu et al 2016 although elevated co2 increased photosynthesis in the c lasiocarpa marsh doc concentration in porewater remained unaltered this suggests that increased photosynthetic carbon exudates under elevated co2 were rapidly consumed by non methanogenic heterotrophic microbes due to increased rhizospheric oxygenation jiang et al 2017 moreover ch4 emission from the c lasiocarpa marsh is known to be primarily produced via the hydrogenotrophic pathway lin et al 2015 and thus any increase in photosynthetic c exudates low molecular weight organic acids might have limited effect on methanogenesis conversely elevated co2 substantially enhanced the fraction of oxidized ch4 in porewater and the abundance of pmoa genes in roots and rhizospheric soil methanotrophs have been reported as primary regulators of ch4 emissions chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 qian et al 2021 and thus an increase in their abundance under elevated co2 may have contributed to lower ch4 emissions elevated co2 also significantly increased the relative abundance of otu379 methylocystis in the c lasiocarpa marsh fig 5 methylocystis are often reported to be predominant chen et al 2008 cui et al 2020 dedysh et al 2001 and metabolically active methanotrophs with remarkably higher ch4 oxidation potential than other types of methanotrophs in wetlands deng et al 2016 esson et al 2016 our findings thus indicate that the increased plant photosynthesis and belowground biomass under elevated co2 enhanced oxygen release into the rhizosphere and triggered proliferation of methanotrophs especially methylocystis in c lasiocarpa marsh wei et al 2016 thereby accelerating ch4 oxidation chen et al 2019 4 2 responses of ch4 emissions to elevated co2 in the intermittently inundated c angustifolia marsh in the c angustifolia marsh elevated co2 significantly enriched mean doc concentration in porewater which was significantly correlated with ch4 fluxes indicating that increased ch4 emission was associated with an increased input of photosynthates previous studies have shown that ch4 production rates in c angustifolia marshes are primarily dependent on the magnitude of substrates derived from living plants rather than plant litter lin et al 2015 our results are consistent with saarnio et al 1998 and inubushi et al 2003 who attributed a 2 fold increase in ch4 production potential in sedge and sphagnum wetlands and 38 51 increase in ch4 emissions in japanese rice paddies to augmentation of root exudates under elevated co2 we found that elevated co2 decreased the fraction of in situ oxidized ch4 in porewater of the c angustifolia marsh although redox potential remained stable which is consistent with previous findings within a swiss face system ineson et al 1998 we also found that elevated co2 shifted methanotrophic community from methylocystis toward usc Î± in the c angustifolia marsh the ch4 oxidation capacity of usc Î± was much lower than that of methylocystis and thus the shift of methanotrophic community in c angustifolia marsh might decrease ch4 oxidation usc Î± tend to be ubiquitous in upland soils lÃ¼ke et al 2014 menyailo et al 2010 and periodically water saturated gleyic soils knief et al 2006 the c angustifolia marsh provides a suitable habitat for usc Î± due to the infrequent inundation periods in summer and a long period of water table drawdown in winter in general ch4 oxidation rates of at least 40 10 12 Î¼mol ch4 cell 1 h 1 are required to maintain metabolism of methanotrophs kolb et al 2005 however cell specific ch4 oxidation rates of usc Î± can be as low as 1 14 10 12 Î¼mol ch4 cell 1 h 1 and hence usc Î± require additional carbon sources for adequate growth degelmann et al 2010 it seems likely that usc Î± would be less competitive than other heterotrophic organisms for organic carbon other than ch4 and c angustifolia provides more carbon sources for their growth under elevated co2 the mechanisms underpinning the response of methylocystis and usc Î± to elevated co2 warrant further investigation our results suggest that the increased methanogenic substrates and reduced ch4 oxidation induced by elevated co2 promote an increase in ch4 emissions in the c angustifolia marsh 4 3 overall responses in the natural freshwater wetlands consideration of water table levels radically improves our ability to predict the response of wetland ch4 emissions to elevated co2 evans et al 2021 some uncertainties remain however firstly global experimental data on co2 effects within wetland ecosystems are limited covering a narrow range of water table levels and lacking for wetlands with standing water table depths 5 cm table s1 secondly the sampling frequency of ch4 flux measurements is suboptimal for some studies limiting our ability to extrapolate from their findings to other scenarios kang et al 2001 thirdly the apparatus used to simulate elevated atmospheric co2 differs greatly between studies and it is feasible that this too could influence ch4 responses our current estimations could be further improved by conducting more long term multifactorial manipulation experiments in different regions despite these constraints however it is clear that our global data synthesis indicates that the wetland water levels directly influence ch4 emission responses under elevated co2 fig 2 our experiment and previous findings suggest the mechanisms involving specific wetland plants and their gas transport capacity adjusted to the water table conditions of the wetlands radial oxygen loss from wetland plants varies widely between species chabbi et al 2000 while species distribution in wetlands is largely determined by hydrology lin et al 2016 wilcox 2004 wetlands with deeper standing water usually contain plants with a greater gas transport capacity waddington et al 1996 and may deliver more oxygen to the rhizosphere under elevated co2 moreover the area of aerenchyma of the same plant species also increased with increasing standing water depths pincam et al 2017 vann and megonigal 2003 showed that the positive effect of increased plant photosynthesis on flooded soil ch4 flux was markedly reduced when plants exhibited higher gas transport capacity owing to greater excretion of oxygen to the rhizosphere plants such as c lasiocarpa which dominate freshwater marshes with deep standing water exhibit significantly higher gas transport capacity and deliver more oxygen to belowground environments resulting in a higher redox potential and ch4 oxidation compared with c angustifolia under elevated co2 plant photosynthesis significantly increases ainsworth and rogers 2007 bohn et al 2015 while stomatal conductance decreases lai et al 2012 medlyn et al 2001 causing an increase in oxygen release into rhizosphere during photosynthesis lai et al 2012 and consequent higher abundance of methanotrophs especially methylocystis therefore methane oxidation rather than input of photosynthates is the predominant regulator of ch4 emission rates in wetlands with deep standing water in contrast c angustifolia which dominates freshwater marshes with shallow summer standing water has a poor gas transport capacity suggesting that there would be a marginal increase in oxygen delivery to the rhizosphere under elevated co2 ding et al 2004 but a substantial increase in delivery of photosynthetic carbon and doc for methanogens these changes would completely offset potential effects of any marginal increase in oxygen supply under the elevated co2 condition on ch4 oxidation thereby creating net stimulation of ch4 production 4 4 implications for models of future ch4 emissions conventional models generally assume that elevated co2 would increase ch4 emissions through increased primary production and the consequently greater carbon supply to belowground microorganisms these models have predicted a 70 increase in ch4 emissions from wetlands under elevated co2 by 2100 while the effects of temperature rise 4 5 and precipitation change 4 6 are predicted to remain minimal melton et al 2013 our results indicate that these models may grossly overestimate future ch4 emissions and therefore a refinement of model parameterization seems warranted and incorporation of microbial data into ch4 modeling is also desirable further study of the interactions between vegetational dynamics and distinct methane related microbial functional groups methanogens vs methanotrophs could improve our understanding of the global significance of ch4 fluxes from wetlands 5 conclusion our results reveal that elevated co2 elicits divergent effects on wetland ch4 emissions dependent entirely upon the hydrological and the associated vegetational characteristics of the studied wetlands in marshes dominated with c angustifolia which thrives in intermittently inundated wetlands elevated co2 increased ch4 emissions in contrast in marshes with c lasiocarpa which prefer to inhabit in permanently inundated wetlands elevated co2 reduced ch4 emissions our meta analysis results further confirm that co2 effects on ch4 emissions diverge according to water table and suggest that previous projections of ch4 emissions from wetlands under elevated co2 may have

16598,phragmites reeds are widely used in constructed wetlands cws for treating wastewater the enrichment of microorganisms and fe mn plaque in phragmites rhizospheres largely contributes to pollutant removal however their interactions and potential synergistic roles in water purification are poorly understood to address the issue we first compared the microbial community traits in the phragmites rhizosphere and adjacent bulk soil in six long term operated cws results showed that enriched microbes and functional genes in the phragmites rhizosphere were largely involved in mn oxidation resulting in a two to three times enrichment of mn oxides in the rhizosphere in turn the enriched mn oxides played significant roles in driving microbial community composition and function to further understand the biological manganese oxidation in the rhizosphere we identified mn oxidizing bacteria using genome centric analysis and found that 92 of identified mn oxidizing bacteria potentially

oxidation 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are engineered systems that have developed rapidly in recent decades as a natural alternative to technical wastewater treatment cws exhibit strong pollution remediation via the combined roles of plants microorganisms and soil stottmeister et al 2003 increasing evidence has demonstrated that plant rhizosphere microbiomes play a vital role in pollutant transformation jiang et al 2020 saravanan et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 reeds phragmites are one of the most commonly applied plants in cws taxonomically proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidetes are abundant at the phylum level in the phragmites rhizosphere borruso et al 2014 the phragmites rhizosphere microbiome can biodegrade technical nonylphenol toyama et

composition and function of the rhizosphere microbiome besides microbiome iron fe and manganese mn plaque is a common component of the plant rhizosphere environment liu et al 2006 which contributes to the transformation and stabilization of pollutants such as arsenic as wang et al 2019 and phosphate warrinnier et al 2020 mn oxides derived from biological processes i e biogenic mn oxides are one of the main components of fe mn plaque learman et al 2011 moreover mn oxidizing microbes are common in plants rhizosphere and mostly aerobic maisch et al 2019 weiss et al 2003 due to their high oxidizing ability mn oxides can further transform and degrade pollutants absorbed by fe mn plaque in natural environments fe mn plaque accumulation can account for up to 10 of phragmites root dry weight and extends as much as 15 17 Âµm into the rhizosphere hansel et al 2001 thus providing an ecological foundation for its application in wastewater treatment therefore we inferred that mn oxides should be enriched in the rhizosphere environment however to what extent mn oxides are enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere environment and how they influence the performance of cws requires further exploration the average concentration of mn in wetlands is 100 mg kg ppm vymazal and Å¡vehla 2013 therefore mn amending methods i e mn ore yang et al 2019 mn coated biochar guo et al 2020 and birnessite coated sand substrates xie et al 2018 have been applied in cws to promote pollutant removal mn amending cws can promote nitrogen transformation phosphate removal and emerging organic micropollutant removal at mg l or ng l levels li et al 2019 of note nitrogen removal efficiency is closely related to the microbial community influenced by mn oxides and the application of mn oxides can improve total nitrogen removal efficiency zhao et al 2020 furthermore some mn oxidizing bacteria possess the ability to denitrify which can improve the removal efficiency of nitrate in underground water where mn ii and nitrate are found at high concentrations bai et al 2020 su et al 2020 however previous advances about improved nitrogen removal in cws led by amending mn oxides constrained into lab scale reactors the pilot scale applications and related gene level mechanisms have yet to be explored the nitrogen transformation and fixation in cws are complexed jahangir et al 2020 and varied with environmental factors for example temperature wang et al 2021 therefore two key questions were proposed which process is most significantly influenced by mn oxides in cws and what are the underlying mechanisms of the influence overall information is still lacking on mn oxides in plant rhizospheres e g phragmites and their interactions with attached microorganisms hindering the application of mn amending cws in wastewater treatment here we chose six cws that have been in operation for at least five years as study sites and applied metagenomic sequencing to profile the phragmites rhizosphere microbiome and mn oxidizing bacteria we also investigated the relationships among mn oxides mn oxidizing genes and the rhizosphere microbiome based on the finding from metagenomic analysis we performed a one year pilot scale experiment on mn amending cws to investigate the causal relationship between mn amendment and augmented biological processes 2 materials and

either contained or did not contain magnetic separation magnetic separation was performed by local retailors to recycle iron which induced a low concentration of fe and mn in the cws detailed information on the cws is shown in table s1 all six cws were planted with phragmites at each cw two sampling sites were chosen near the influent and effluent respectively for each sampling site at least five phragmites plants were dug out with an alcohol treated shovel loosely attached soil was removed by gently shaking the plant roots with firmly attached soil defined as rhizosphere soil

previous research hu et al 2020 of note the amoa database not only included amoa sequences from ncycdb tu et al 2018 but also manually curated complete ammonia oxidizing comammox amoa sequences the phylogenic tree based on mn oxidizing mags was constructed using 11 published genomes of mn oxidizing bacteria downloaded from ncbi table s3 as a reference briefly we first searched and aligned all orthologs of all genomes including reference genomes and mags in orthofinder v2 4 0 emms and kelly 2019 then reconstructed a species tree in iq tree v2 0 3 chernomor et al 2016 and finally visualized the tree in itol letunic and bork 2019 2 5 mn amending cws we constructed four pilot scale cws each 115 125 m2 and 1 2 m deep and added 0 control 100 mn100 200 mn200 and 400 mn400 kg of natural mn

structure was the same as the above six cws daily treatment capacity varied with the season table s4 we carried out 12 sampling campaigns table s4 during which time we collected influent and effluent water samples from each cw for water quality analysis in each cw three sampling sites were randomly selected to obtain rhizosphere bulk soil samples all water and soil samples were transported to the laboratory on ice the physicochemical parameters of 120 water samples nh4 n no3 n tn tp and doc and the content of fe mn oxides in 288 soil samples were measured as described above pollutant removal capacities per day per area of the four pilot cws were calculated to compare their treatment effects as performance differences among the four cws were already established after the first 10 sampling times total dna was extracted from 100 bulk soil and 100 rhizosphere soil samples using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen gmbh germany real time polymerase chain reaction pcr was performed to quantify the copy numbers of archaeal and bacterial amoa genes details are discussed in the supplementary methods 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed in r v3 6 2 in all experiments

composition function and environmental factors partial mantel correlations were computed 9999 permutations using the ggcor package in r spearman correlations were calculated between 1 the abundance of amoa and mn oxidizing genes 2 relative abundance of mags containing amoa and content of mn oxides and 3 relative abundance of mags containing amoa and content of mn oxidizing genes i two group test the nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to compare differences between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples in regard to the content of fe mn oxides the abundance of mn oxidizing genes and the content of amoa in cws with and without amended mn oxides 3 results 3 1 enriched mn oxidizing bacteria and fe mn oxides in phragmites rhizosphere we first compared the microbial community and functional composition of the phragmites rhizosphere and bulk soil in the six operated cws figs 1 a and s1 the most enriched microbes of rhizosphere soil were hydrogenophaga rhodobacter pseudoxanthomonas microbacterium and methylibium while desulfurispirillum was highly enriched in bulk soil as expected most enriched microbes were aerobic bacteria due to the aerobic rhizosphere environment of the phragmites root system yang et al 2014 surprisingly 10 out of 22 rhizosphere enriched microbes were identified as mn oxidizing bacteria details in table s5 in addition seven of the 10 mn oxidizing bacteria were documented as plant growth promoting bacteria which can promote the transformation of nitrogen or phosphate in contrast four of the 12 microbes enriched in the bulk environment were related to mn reduction and were anaerobic weiss et al 2004 in addition two bulk enriched bacteria were identified as both mn oxidizing bacteria and plant growth promoting bacteria of the functional genes retrieved from the metagenomic sequences 65 6 of sequences were assigned to a known function table s6 lefse analysis fig 1b identified 18 different functional genes between the phragmites rhizosphere and bulk soil of note genes encoding the iron complex receptor protein were significantly enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere suggesting that extensive iron cycling processes occur in the rhizosphere moreover low molecular weight organic carbon transport system related proteins were also enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere possibly because the rhizosphere microbiome utilized root exudates composed of low molecular weight organic compounds sasse et al 2018 shi et al 2011 to maintain their growth based on the above findings we compared the content of fe mn oxides in the rhizosphere and bulk soil as expected the contents of fe and mn oxides were both enriched in the rhizosphere soil the average contents of mn oxides fig 1c in bulk soil with and without magnetic selection were 10 19 7 45 and 110 78 21 16 mg kg respectively and in rhizosphere soil with and without magnetic selection were 27 11 22 22 and 244 13 89 10 mg kg respectively averagely the mn oxides were enriched two to three times in the rhizosphere the average contents of fe oxides figure s2 in rhizosphere soil 1 804 65 590 63 and 5 710 93 1 947 75 mg kg were 2 3 times higher than those in bulk soil 1 235 02 258 00 and 3 328 30 256 40 mg kg 3 2 mn oxides potentially drive phragmites rhizosphere microbiome to determine which environmental factors drive compositional differences in the phragmites rhizosphere microbiome the distance corrected dissimilarities of taxonomic and functional community composition were correlated with wastewater properties i e conductivity orp ph water temperature do no3 n nh4 n tn tp and toc and soil properties fe mn oxides in both bulk and rhizosphere soil as shown in fig 2 the contents of soil fe mn oxides were highly correlated with both taxonomic and functional composition mantle r 0 5 besides water temperature and do are significantly related to both functional and taxonomic composition of the rhizosphere microbiome suggesting rhizosphere microbes varied with seasonal temperature and diurnal do change of rhizosphere environment in cws in addition mn oxides in bulk and rhizosphere soil were positively correlated with water temperature nh4 n and tp with pairwise correlations between environmental factors all 0 5 it is reasonable that temperature and oxygen are sensitive factors for the growth of mn oxidizing microbes which eventually influence the formation of mn oxides tebo et al 2004 highly correlation between phosphate and mn oxides was probably due to the strong adsorption of phosphate to mn oxides wu et al 2014 a strong positive correlation between ammonium and mn oxides r 0 66 p 0 001 suggested the association between ammonium oxidation and mn oxidation 3 3 biological mn oxidation associated with ammonia oxidation to understand biological mn oxidation in the phragmites rhizosphere microbiome we recovered 2 552 metagenomic assembled genomes mags completeness 50 contamination 10 details in supplementary excel file and 101 bacterial mags completeness 75 contamination 5 containing at least one mn oxidizing genes including three peroxidase genes mopa and nine multicopper oxidase genes boxa cota cueo mofa moxa mcoa and three types of mnxg which were identified as putative mn oxidizing bacteria see fig 3 a phylogenetic tree based on the 101 putative mn oxidizing bacteria and 11 published mn oxidizing bacteria complete genomes table s3 was then constructed detailed information on the 101 putative mn oxidizing bacteria is listed in the supplementary excel file nitrosomonas rhodoferax hydrogenophaga and pseudorhodobacter have been previously identified as mn oxidizing bacteria tebo et al 2005 here hydrogenophaga methylibium and pseudorhodobacter were enriched in the rhizosphere environment with relatively large genome sizes suggesting that these mags may have more potential functions to adapt to the rhizosphere environment levy et al 2018 in addition we found that most mn oxidizing bacteria contained mopa or moxa or both based on the short read alignment results mopa and moxa accounted for 59 81 6 62 of the total mn oxidizing genes supplementary excel file therefore mopa and moxa were the dominant mn oxidizing genes in the phragmites rhizosphere in the cw environments then we explored the associations between mn oxidation and ammonia oxidation by hypothesizing that mn oxidizing microbes could oxidize ammonia by possessing amoa genes therefore ammonia oxidation and other nitrogen cycling genes from mn oxidizing bacteria were selected against ncycdb tu et al 2018 to determine which mn oxidizing bacteria are involved in ammonia oxidation and the other nitrogen cycling processes in total 93 of the 101 putative mn oxidizing bacteria were related to at least one nitrogen cycling process most of which were involved in denitrification and or nitrate reduction fig 3 of note eight mags were classified into the genus nitrosomonas which contains ammonia oxidizing bacteria suzuki et al 1974 the genome alignment results showed that three contained the functional ammonia oxidizing gene amoa further confirming their ammonia oxidation ability thus these results suggest that mn oxidizing bacteria potentially participate in nitrogen cycling and some of them contribute to ammonia oxidation moreover we correlated the abundance of all types of functional genes related to nitrogen cycling with mn oxidizing genes figs 4 and s3 in the phragmites rhizosphere from the short read alignments fig 4a a significant linear relationship appeared between the content of mn oxidizing genes and amoa r 0 65 p 0 001 whereas other nitrogen cycling genes such as norz and nirk did not establish linear relationships with mn oxidizing genes figure s6 further correlation analysis confirmed that both mopa and moxa showed significant linear relationships with amoa r 0 62 and 0 64 respectively figs 4b and c based on the above results we proposed that the relationships between mn oxidation and ammonia oxidation could be directed by the co existing of these two types of functional microbes therefore we selected mags against the custom amoa database containing archaeal bacterial and comammox amoa sequences and identified 17 mags containing amoa which we then classified using the genome taxonomy database supplementary excel file among them five were affiliated with nitrosomonas seven with comammox amoa were affiliated with nitrospira two were classified as ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and three were unassigned based on the correlation analysis of the abundance of mn oxidizing genes and each type of ammonia oxidizer nitrosomonas was negatively correlated with mn oxidizing genes while comammox nitrospira was positively correlated with mn oxidizing genes fig 5 a these results suggest that mn oxidizing processes may coexist with comammox nitrospira in cws daims et al 2015 furthermore comammox nitrospira abundance was significantly higher than that of nitrosomonas fig 5b indicating that comammox processes significantly contribute to ammonia removal in cw environments in addition based on abundance comammox nitrospira accounted for 39 11 of the total ammonia oxidizers supplementary excel file while nitrosomonas accounted for 19 86 suggesting that comammox nitrospira is the dominant ammonia oxidizer in the phragmites rhizosphere 3 4 amending mn oxides in cws enhanced ammonia oxidation in pilot study for practical application we added mn oxides into pilot scale cws to strengthen their ammonia removal capacity during the one year sampling campaigns 12 sampling time points the cws amended with mn oxides increased ammonia removal capacity by 24 34 35 50 compared to the non amended cw fig 6 a in addition the concentration of nitrate in the effluent of mn amending cws was obviously higher than non amended cw which suggested enhanced ammonia oxidation was established by mn amending cws figure s4 the removal capacities of toc tn and tp only showed slight differences between cws with and without amended mn oxides figure s4 we further quantified the contents of ammonia oxidizing genes amoa in bacteria in the four cws the control group contained 21 694 71 26 754 59 copies g in bulk soil and 13 990 32 11 999 12 copies g in rhizosphere soil the other three mn amending cws contained significantly more amoa genes than the control p 0 001 suggesting that the addition of mn oxides may stimulate the production of amoa genes the same trend also appeared for the abundance of amoa in archaea figure s5 among the three mn amending cws those with more mn oxides did not show significantly higher ammonia removal capacity this may be related to two reasons firstly low influent concentration figure s4 may have led to small differences among them which were influenced by other environmental factors such as temperature secondly among the three mn amending cws the abundance of amoa did not show significant differences corresponding to subtle differences in ammonia removal capacity collectively these results demonstrate that mn oxide amendment may result in a greater abundance of ammonia oxidizing genes in cws consistent with our field sampling results 4 discussion 4 1 associations between mn oxides and microbial community we profiled the microbial community and functional composition of the phragmites root inhabiting microbiome in cws compared to bulk soil more microbes were enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere with mn oxidizing bacteria found to be widely distributed figs 1 and s2 these enriched mn oxidizing bacteria likely contributed to the enrichment of mn oxides fig 1c furthermore the enriched fe oxides induced enriched mn oxides the enriched fe oxides in the rhizosphere could absorb and constrain reduced mn ii in the rhizosphere environment and further re oxidized by mn oxidizing bacteria figure s7 besides the presence of mn oxides is regarded as a likely indicator of biological activity tebo et al 2005 the biomass was highly enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere environment figure s8 indicating the hotspots of the biological reactions in our research the functional iron complex transport gene fig 1b which is closely related to the concentration of surrounding metal ions e g fe and mn also suggested active metal bioconversion and circulation around the phragmites roots lau et al 2015 as a potential environmental driver we found that mn oxides influenced the microbial community in cws fig 2 on the one hand enriched mn oxides can protect the rhizosphere microbes by sequestrating and oxidizing harmful metal ions such as as and cd huang et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 and recalcitrant micropollutants such as norfloxacin yan et al 2017 on the other hand mn oxide enriched in the rhizosphere and amended mn oxides both act as electron acceptors while the reduced mn ii were electron providers for the nearby microbiome reduced mn ii was later re oxidized to biogenic mn oxide by mn oxidizing bacteria therefore in our mn amending cws effluent mn ii was undetectable data not shown in addition mn oxides can degrade refractory organic compounds into labile forms with high reactivity which may support higher bacterial growth and lead to a more diverse microbiome marcus et al 2017 therefore amending mn oxides in cws may form highly diverse microbial communities which contribute to pollution remediation ability chen et al 2020 lennon and jones 2011 the same phenomenon has also been reported by zhao et al 2019 who found that the co occurrence network analysis of microbiome in mn amending rapid sand filters contained more nodes and edges which manifested more complex correlations than the control implying that mn circulation substantially shapes the microbial community and eventually contributed to pollution remediation 4 2 enhanced ammonia oxidation by mn oxides nitrogen is a major concern during wastewater treatment processes especially in cws tondera et al 2021 therefore the impact of mn oxides on nitrogen cycling was explored in this study our results showed that enhanced ammonia oxidizing ability was correlated with biological mn oxidation fig 4 we also observed higher ammonia removal capacity and more amoa with the addition of mn oxides in the cws figs 5 and s6 despite that the temperature had a significant impact on the diversity abundance and activity of microorganisms fig 2 the correlations between ammonia oxidizing and mn oxidizing genes in phragmites rhizosphere firmly existed in all the six cws in our experiment previous researchers have also found the same effects for ammonia removal zhang et al 2021 our results revealed that ammonia oxidizing genes were significantly enriched with amended mn oxides indicating that mn oxides not only directly oxidize ammonia but more importantly stimulate ammonia oxidizers in cws among the three mn amending cws those with more mn oxides did not show significantly higher ammonia removal capacity fig 6c in addition more mn oxides did not induce a significant increase in the removal capacity of ammonia therefore from the standpoint of engineering we proposed that 100 kg natural mn sands in cws could enhance the ammonia oxidation similarly network correlation analysis has revealed that ammonia oxidizing bacterium nitrosospira multiformis is positively correlated with mn ii oxidation in rapid sand filters zhao et al 2020 collectively we determined that ammonia oxidizing bacteria may co exist with mn oxidizing bacteria further we identified which type s of ammonia oxidizers were correlated with mn oxidation with comammox nitrospira found to be positively correlated with mn oxidizing genes fig 5 this complete nitrifier has high affinity for ammonia and a high yield biomass daims et al 2015 therefore we proposed that the amended mn oxides enhanced ammonia oxidation by promoting the abundance of amoa which was at large provided by comammox nitrospira since most of the mn oxidizing bacteria did not possess amoa the underlying metabolic co exist of mn oxidizing and ammonia oxidizing bacteria require further exploration in pure culture or synthetic communities the enhanced ammonia oxidation in mn amended cws led to the excessive production of nitrate figure s4d however the concentration of nitrate in mn amending cws was still under the limit 10 mg l of the level iv china environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 therefore we believed that mn amended cws have great potential for complete nitrogen removal 5 conclusions we applied metagenome sequencing to profile the community composition as well as the functional traits of the cw microbiomes especially the root inhabiting microbiome of phragmites which is considered a strong pollution remediator results demonstrated that phragmites roots significantly enriched mn oxidizing microbes and biomass contributed to the enrichment of mn oxides in the rhizosphere environment further mn oxides was one of the environmental drivers of phragmites rhizosphere microbiome in cws specifically the content of mn oxides was significantly correlated with the concentration of ammonia and the abundance of mn oxidizing genes was positively correlated with that of amoa correlation analysis also revealed that comammox nitrospira the dominant ammonia oxidizer in the rhizosphere likely coexists with mn oxidizing bacteria extrapolation from cw field sampling was further tested using one year pilot scale mn amending cws ammonia removal capacity was significantly promoted 23 34 on average with the amended mn oxides in addition the mn oxides lead to more abundant amoa genes in both the bulk and rhizosphere soils

16598,phragmites reeds are widely used in constructed wetlands cws for treating wastewater the enrichment of microorganisms and fe mn plaque in phragmites rhizospheres largely contributes to pollutant removal however their interactions and potential synergistic roles in water purification are poorly understood to address the issue we first compared the microbial community traits in the phragmites rhizosphere and adjacent bulk soil in six long term operated cws results showed that enriched microbes and functional genes in the phragmites rhizosphere were largely involved in mn oxidation resulting in a two to three times enrichment of mn oxides in the rhizosphere in turn the enriched mn oxides played significant roles in driving microbial community composition and function to further understand the biological manganese oxidation in the rhizosphere we identified mn oxidizing bacteria using genome centric analysis and found that 92 of identified mn oxidizing bacteria potentially participated in nitrogen cycling we then conducted relationships between mn oxidizing genes and different nitrogen cycling genes and found mn oxidizing gene abundance was significantly correlated with ammonia oxidation gene amoa r 0 65 remarkably complete ammonia oxidation comammox nitrospira accounting for 39 11 of ammonia oxidizers also positively correlated with mn oxidizing microbes based on the above observations we inferred that the use of mn oxides as a substrate in cws may enhance ammonia oxidation to apply this to actual engineering we explored treatment performance in a pilot scale

exploration the average concentration of mn in wetlands is 100 mg kg ppm vymazal and Å¡vehla 2013 therefore mn amending methods i e mn ore yang et al 2019 mn coated biochar guo et al 2020 and birnessite coated sand substrates xie et al 2018 have been applied in cws to promote pollutant removal mn amending cws can promote nitrogen transformation phosphate removal and emerging organic micropollutant removal at mg l or ng l levels li et al 2019 of note nitrogen removal efficiency is closely related to the microbial community influenced by mn oxides and the application of mn oxides can improve total nitrogen removal efficiency zhao et al 2020 furthermore some mn oxidizing bacteria possess the ability to denitrify which can improve the removal efficiency of nitrate in underground water where mn ii and nitrate are found at high concentrations bai et al 2020 su et al 2020 however previous advances about improved nitrogen removal in cws led by amending mn oxides constrained into lab scale reactors the pilot scale applications and related gene level mechanisms have yet to be explored the nitrogen transformation and fixation in cws are complexed jahangir et al 2020 and varied with environmental factors for example temperature wang et al 2021 therefore two key questions were proposed which process is most significantly influenced by mn oxides in cws and what are the underlying mechanisms of the influence overall information is still lacking on mn oxides in plant rhizospheres e g phragmites and their interactions with attached microorganisms hindering the application of mn amending cws in wastewater treatment here we chose six cws that have been in operation for at least five years as study sites and applied metagenomic sequencing to profile the phragmites rhizosphere microbiome and mn oxidizing bacteria we also investigated the relationships among mn oxides mn oxidizing genes and the rhizosphere microbiome based on the finding from metagenomic analysis we performed a one year pilot scale experiment on mn amending cws to investigate the causal relationship between mn amendment and augmented biological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling the six chosen cws are of all horizontal subsurface flow type table s1 they had the same hydraulic retention time 1d and same structure except for the filter sands which either contained or did not contain magnetic separation magnetic separation was performed by local retailors to recycle iron which induced a low concentration of fe and mn in the cws detailed information on the cws is shown in table s1 all six cws were planted with phragmites at each cw two sampling sites were chosen near the influent and effluent respectively for each sampling site at least five phragmites plants were dug out with an alcohol treated shovel loosely attached soil was removed by gently shaking the plant roots with firmly attached soil defined as rhizosphere soil bulgarelli et al 2012 were cut and loaded into a 50 ml sterile dna free falcon tube with lifeguard preservation solution mobio laboratories inc carlsbad ca usa to prevent nucleic acid degradation nearby soil without phragmites plants defined as bulk soil was also collected to the same depth as the roots 20 cm and then loaded into tubes with preservation solution we also collected 1 l of cw influent and effluent water for in situ measurements approximately 250 ml of water was transferred to glass bottles with screw caps for laboratory analysis all water and soil samples were transported to the laboratory on ice water samples were stored at 4 c prior to physiochemical analyses and soil samples were stored at 80 c prior to molecular analyses 2 2 physicochemical parameter measurement of

sampling cws were listed in table s2 effluent water quality currently meets the level iv china environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 the contents of fe mn oxides in the phragmites rhizosphere and bulk soil samples were measured using a modified dithionite citrate bicarbonate technique dcb taylor and crowder 1983 as described in the supplementary methods 2 3 dna extraction of soil samples dna extraction of rhizosphere soil followed previous studies bulgarelli et al 2012 edwards et al 2015 lundberg et al 2012 briefly 10 ml of silwet l 77 amended phosphate buffered saline buffer pbs s 130 mm nacl 7 mm na2hpo4 3 mm nah2po4 ph 7 0 0 02 silwet l 77 was added to the falcon tubes containing rhizosphere soil followed by washing on a shaking platform hzq f160 harbin donglian electronic technology development co ltd china for 20 min at 180 rpm at room temperature the falcon tubes were then subjected to centrifugation 5 000 rpm 20 min room temperature and the resulting pellet was immediately used for dna extraction dna was extracted from both bulk soil and rhizosphere soil samples using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen gmbh germany according to the manufacturer s instructions 2 4 metagenomic sequencing the extracted dna samples n 43 were sent to the beijing genomics institute for 150 bp paired end shotgun metagenomic sequencing on the bgiseq500

metagenomic read to the non redundant gene library and to normalize read counts per kilobase per million mapped reads rpkm functional annotation was performed using eggnog mapper v1 0 3 huerta cepas et al 2018 linear discrimination analysis lda segata et al 2011 was used to identify differentially abundant features otus and functional genes between the rhizosphere and bulk soil samples features fulfilling the following criteria were considered enriched 1 logarithmic lda score for discriminative features was larger than two and 2 alpha value for the factorial kruskal wallis test between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples was less than 0 05 in addition an all against all multi class analyzing strategy was applied i abundance of amoa and mn ii oxidizing genes the abundances of amoa and mn ii oxidizing genes were obtained by aligning the reads of each sample to our previously constructed reference databases hu et al 2020 using the ublast command in usearch with the parameters evalue 1e 10 accel 0 8 maxaccepts 1 for each reference sequence in each database the obtained average copy number of the reference sequence was normalized by the 16s gene copy number which was obtained from read alignment to the greengenes database 16s rrna of gg 13 5 fasta desantis et al 2006 i genome centric analysis genomic binning was conducted according to the metawrap pipeline uritskiy et al 2018 to recover metagenomic assembled genomes mags completeness 50 contamination 10 the mags obtained were de replicated using drep olm et al 2017 to generate a non redundant mags dataset to quantify the relative abundance of the mags in each sample bbmap v38 43 was used with a custom script the mags were also classified using gtdb tk v0 2 2 chaumeil et al 2019 the mags containing amoa or mn ii oxidizing genes were identified via the following procedures the orfs in each mag were predicted using prodigal with default parameters and then aligned to the amoa or mn ii oxidizing gene databases using blast altschul et al 1990 to identity mags containing amoa or mn ii oxidizing genes identity 0 7 coverage 70 the custom amoa and mn oxidizing gene databases have been described in detail in our previous research hu et al 2020 of note the amoa database not only included amoa sequences from ncycdb tu et al 2018 but also manually curated complete ammonia oxidizing comammox amoa sequences the phylogenic tree based on mn oxidizing mags was constructed using 11 published genomes of mn oxidizing bacteria downloaded from ncbi table s3 as a reference briefly we first searched and aligned all orthologs of all genomes including reference genomes and mags in orthofinder v2 4 0 emms and kelly 2019 then reconstructed a species tree in iq tree v2 0 3 chernomor et al 2016 and finally visualized the tree in itol letunic and bork 2019 2 5 mn amending cws we constructed four pilot scale cws each 115 125 m2 and 1 2 m deep and added 0 control 100 mn100 200 mn200 and 400 mn400 kg of natural mn sand 35 mno2 mixed with quartz sand in shijiazhuang hebei province china 38 03 19 6 n 115 03 22 3 e the approximately proportion of mn oxides in four cws were 0 0 04 0 08 and 0 16 respectively their structure was the same as the above six cws daily treatment capacity varied with the season table s4 we carried out 12 sampling campaigns table s4 during which time we collected influent and effluent water samples from each cw for water quality analysis in each cw three sampling sites were randomly selected to obtain rhizosphere bulk soil samples all water and soil samples were transported to the laboratory on ice the physicochemical parameters of 120 water samples nh4 n no3 n tn tp and doc and the content of fe mn oxides in 288 soil samples were measured as described above pollutant removal capacities per day per area of the four pilot cws were calculated to compare their treatment effects as performance differences among the four cws were already established after the first 10 sampling times total dna was extracted from 100 bulk soil and 100 rhizosphere soil samples using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen gmbh germany real time polymerase chain reaction pcr was performed to quantify the copy numbers of archaeal and bacterial amoa genes details are discussed in the supplementary methods 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed in r v3 6 2 in all experiments differences and correlations were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 i correlation analysis we computed pairwise distances between each environmental factor including orp ph water temperature do nitrate ammonia tn tp toc and the content of fe mn oxides in the rhizosphere and bulk soil using the ggcor package in r to identify the relationship between microbial community composition function and environmental factors partial mantel correlations were computed 9999 permutations using the ggcor package in r spearman correlations were calculated between 1 the abundance of amoa and mn oxidizing genes 2 relative abundance of mags containing amoa and content of mn oxides and 3 relative abundance of mags containing amoa and content of mn oxidizing genes i two group test the nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to compare differences between rhizosphere and bulk soil samples in regard to the content of fe mn oxides the abundance of mn oxidizing genes and the content of amoa in cws with and without amended mn oxides 3 results 3 1 enriched mn oxidizing bacteria and fe mn oxides in phragmites rhizosphere we first compared the microbial community and functional composition of the phragmites rhizosphere and bulk soil in the six operated cws figs 1 a and s1 the most enriched microbes of rhizosphere soil were hydrogenophaga rhodobacter pseudoxanthomonas microbacterium and methylibium while desulfurispirillum was highly enriched in bulk soil as expected most enriched microbes were aerobic bacteria due to the aerobic rhizosphere environment of the phragmites root system yang et al 2014 surprisingly 10 out of 22 rhizosphere enriched microbes were identified as mn oxidizing bacteria details in table s5 in addition seven of the 10 mn oxidizing bacteria were documented as plant growth promoting bacteria which can promote the transformation of nitrogen or phosphate in contrast four of the 12 microbes enriched in the bulk environment were related to mn reduction and were anaerobic weiss et al 2004 in addition two bulk enriched bacteria were identified as both mn oxidizing bacteria and plant growth promoting bacteria of the functional genes retrieved from the metagenomic sequences 65 6 of sequences were assigned to a known function table s6 lefse analysis fig 1b identified 18 different functional genes between the phragmites rhizosphere and bulk soil of note genes encoding the iron complex receptor protein were significantly enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere suggesting that extensive iron cycling processes occur in the rhizosphere moreover low molecular weight organic carbon transport system related proteins were also enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere possibly because the rhizosphere microbiome utilized root exudates composed of low molecular weight organic compounds sasse et al 2018 shi et al 2011 to maintain their growth based on the above findings we compared the content of fe mn oxides in the rhizosphere and bulk soil as expected the contents of fe and mn oxides were both enriched in the rhizosphere soil the average contents of mn oxides fig 1c in bulk soil with and without magnetic selection were 10 19 7 45 and 110 78 21 16 mg kg respectively and in rhizosphere soil with and without magnetic selection were 27 11 22 22 and 244 13 89 10 mg kg respectively averagely the mn oxides were enriched two to three times in the rhizosphere the average contents of fe oxides figure s2 in rhizosphere soil 1 804 65 590 63 and 5 710 93 1 947 75 mg kg were 2 3 times higher than those in bulk soil 1 235 02 258 00 and 3 328 30 256 40 mg kg 3 2 mn oxides potentially drive phragmites rhizosphere microbiome to determine which environmental factors drive compositional differences in the phragmites rhizosphere microbiome the distance corrected dissimilarities of taxonomic and functional community composition were correlated with wastewater properties i e conductivity orp ph water temperature do no3 n nh4 n tn tp and toc and soil properties fe mn oxides in both bulk and rhizosphere soil as shown in fig 2 the contents of soil fe mn oxides were highly correlated with both taxonomic and functional composition mantle r 0 5 besides water temperature and do are significantly related to both functional and taxonomic composition of the rhizosphere microbiome suggesting rhizosphere microbes varied with seasonal temperature and diurnal do change of rhizosphere environment in cws in addition mn oxides in bulk and rhizosphere soil were positively correlated with water temperature nh4 n and tp with pairwise correlations between environmental factors all 0 5 it is reasonable that temperature and oxygen are sensitive factors for the growth of mn oxidizing microbes which eventually influence the formation of mn oxides tebo et al 2004 highly correlation between phosphate and mn oxides was probably due to the strong adsorption of phosphate to mn oxides wu et al 2014 a strong positive correlation between ammonium and mn oxides r 0 66 p 0 001 suggested the association between ammonium oxidation and mn oxidation 3 3 biological mn oxidation associated with ammonia oxidation to understand biological mn oxidation in the phragmites rhizosphere microbiome we recovered 2 552 metagenomic assembled genomes mags completeness 50 contamination 10 details in supplementary excel file and 101 bacterial mags completeness 75 contamination 5 containing at least one mn oxidizing genes including three peroxidase genes mopa and nine multicopper oxidase genes boxa cota cueo mofa moxa mcoa and three types of mnxg which were identified as putative mn oxidizing bacteria see fig 3 a phylogenetic tree based on the 101 putative mn oxidizing bacteria and 11 published mn oxidizing bacteria complete genomes table s3 was then constructed detailed information on the 101 putative mn oxidizing bacteria is listed in the supplementary excel file nitrosomonas rhodoferax hydrogenophaga and pseudorhodobacter have been previously identified as mn oxidizing bacteria tebo et al 2005 here hydrogenophaga methylibium and pseudorhodobacter were enriched in the rhizosphere environment with relatively large genome sizes suggesting that these mags may have more potential functions to adapt to the rhizosphere environment levy et al 2018 in addition we found that most mn oxidizing bacteria contained mopa or moxa or both based on the short read alignment results mopa and moxa accounted for 59 81 6 62 of the total mn oxidizing genes supplementary excel file therefore mopa and moxa were the dominant mn oxidizing genes in the phragmites rhizosphere in the cw environments then we explored the associations between mn oxidation and ammonia oxidation by hypothesizing that mn oxidizing microbes could oxidize ammonia by possessing amoa genes therefore ammonia oxidation and other nitrogen cycling genes from mn oxidizing bacteria were selected against ncycdb tu et al 2018 to determine which mn oxidizing bacteria are involved in ammonia oxidation and the other nitrogen cycling processes in total 93 of the 101 putative mn oxidizing bacteria were related to at least one nitrogen cycling process most of which were involved in denitrification and or nitrate reduction fig 3 of note eight mags were classified into the genus nitrosomonas which contains ammonia oxidizing bacteria suzuki et al 1974 the genome alignment results showed that three contained the functional ammonia oxidizing gene amoa further confirming their ammonia oxidation ability thus these results suggest that mn oxidizing bacteria potentially participate in nitrogen cycling and some of them contribute to ammonia oxidation moreover we correlated the abundance of all types of functional genes related to nitrogen cycling with mn oxidizing genes figs 4 and s3 in the phragmites rhizosphere from the short read alignments fig 4a a significant linear relationship appeared between the content of mn oxidizing genes and amoa r 0 65 p 0 001 whereas other nitrogen cycling genes such as norz and nirk did not establish linear relationships with mn oxidizing genes figure s6 further correlation analysis confirmed that both mopa and moxa showed significant linear relationships with amoa r 0 62 and 0 64 respectively figs 4b and c based on the above results we proposed that the relationships between mn oxidation and ammonia oxidation could be directed by the co existing of these two types of functional microbes therefore we selected mags against the custom amoa database containing archaeal bacterial and comammox amoa sequences and identified 17 mags containing amoa which we then classified using the genome taxonomy database supplementary excel file among them five were affiliated with nitrosomonas seven with comammox amoa were affiliated with nitrospira two were classified as ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and three were unassigned based on the correlation analysis of the abundance of mn oxidizing genes and each type of ammonia oxidizer nitrosomonas was negatively correlated with mn oxidizing genes while comammox nitrospira was positively correlated with mn oxidizing genes fig 5 a these results suggest that mn oxidizing processes may coexist with comammox nitrospira in cws daims et al 2015 furthermore comammox nitrospira abundance was significantly higher than that of nitrosomonas fig 5b indicating that comammox processes significantly contribute to ammonia removal in cw environments in addition based on abundance comammox nitrospira accounted for 39 11 of the total ammonia oxidizers supplementary excel file while nitrosomonas accounted for 19 86 suggesting that comammox nitrospira is the dominant ammonia oxidizer in the phragmites rhizosphere 3 4 amending mn oxides in cws enhanced ammonia oxidation in pilot study for practical application we added mn oxides into pilot scale cws to strengthen their ammonia removal capacity during the one year sampling campaigns 12 sampling time points the cws amended with mn oxides increased ammonia removal capacity by 24 34 35 50 compared to the non amended cw fig 6 a in addition the concentration of nitrate in the effluent of mn amending cws was obviously higher than non amended cw which suggested enhanced ammonia oxidation was established by mn amending cws figure s4 the removal capacities of toc tn and tp only showed slight differences between cws with and without amended mn oxides figure s4 we further quantified the contents of ammonia oxidizing genes amoa in bacteria in the four cws the control group contained 21 694 71 26 754 59 copies g in bulk soil and 13 990 32 11 999 12 copies g in rhizosphere soil the other three mn amending cws contained significantly more amoa genes than the control p 0 001 suggesting that the addition of mn oxides may stimulate the production of amoa genes the same trend also appeared for the abundance of amoa in archaea figure s5 among the three mn amending cws those with more mn oxides did not show significantly higher ammonia removal capacity this may be related to two reasons firstly low influent concentration figure s4 may have led to small differences among them which were influenced by other environmental factors such as temperature secondly among the three mn amending cws the abundance of amoa did not show significant differences corresponding to subtle differences in ammonia removal capacity collectively these results demonstrate that mn oxide amendment may result in a greater abundance of ammonia oxidizing genes in cws consistent with our field sampling results 4 discussion 4 1 associations between mn oxides and microbial community we profiled the microbial community and functional composition of the phragmites root inhabiting microbiome in cws compared to bulk soil more microbes were enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere with mn oxidizing bacteria found to be widely distributed figs 1 and s2 these enriched mn oxidizing bacteria likely contributed to the enrichment of mn oxides fig 1c furthermore the enriched fe oxides induced enriched mn oxides the enriched fe oxides in the rhizosphere could absorb and constrain reduced mn ii in the rhizosphere environment and further re oxidized by mn oxidizing bacteria figure s7 besides the presence of mn oxides is regarded as a likely indicator of biological activity tebo et al 2005 the biomass was highly enriched in the phragmites rhizosphere environment figure s8 indicating the hotspots of the biological reactions in our research the functional iron complex transport gene fig 1b which is closely related to the concentration of surrounding metal ions e g fe and mn also suggested active metal bioconversion and circulation around the phragmites roots lau et al 2015 as a potential environmental driver we found that mn oxides influenced the microbial community in cws fig 2 on the one hand enriched mn oxides can protect the rhizosphere microbes by sequestrating and oxidizing harmful metal ions such as as and cd huang et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 and recalcitrant micropollutants such as norfloxacin yan et al 2017 on the other hand mn oxide enriched in the rhizosphere and amended mn oxides both act as electron acceptors while the reduced mn ii were electron providers for the nearby microbiome reduced mn ii was later re oxidized to biogenic mn oxide by mn oxidizing bacteria therefore in our mn amending cws effluent mn ii was undetectable data not shown in addition mn oxides can degrade refractory organic compounds into labile forms with high reactivity which may support higher bacterial growth and lead to a more diverse microbiome marcus et al 2017 therefore amending mn oxides in cws may form highly diverse microbial communities which contribute to pollution remediation ability chen et al 2020 lennon and jones 2011 the same phenomenon has also been reported by zhao et al 2019 who found that the co occurrence network analysis of microbiome in mn amending rapid sand filters contained more nodes and edges which manifested more complex correlations than the control implying that mn circulation substantially shapes the microbial community and eventually contributed to pollution remediation 4 2 enhanced ammonia oxidation by mn oxides nitrogen is a major concern during wastewater treatment processes especially in cws tondera et al 2021 therefore the impact of mn oxides on nitrogen cycling was explored in this study our results showed that enhanced ammonia oxidizing ability was correlated with biological mn oxidation fig 4 we also observed higher ammonia removal capacity and more amoa with the addition of mn oxides in the cws figs 5 and s6 despite that the temperature had a significant impact on the diversity abundance and activity of microorganisms fig 2 the correlations between ammonia oxidizing and mn oxidizing genes in phragmites rhizosphere firmly existed in all the six cws in our experiment previous researchers have also found the same effects for ammonia removal zhang et al 2021 our results revealed that ammonia oxidizing genes were significantly enriched with amended mn oxides indicating that mn oxides not only directly oxidize ammonia but more importantly stimulate ammonia oxidizers in cws among the three mn amending cws those with more mn oxides did not show significantly higher ammonia removal capacity fig 6c in addition more mn oxides did not induce a significant increase in the removal capacity of ammonia therefore from the standpoint of engineering we proposed that 100 kg natural mn sands in cws could enhance the ammonia oxidation similarly network correlation analysis has revealed that ammonia oxidizing bacterium nitrosospira multiformis is positively correlated with mn ii oxidation in rapid sand filters zhao et al 2020 collectively we determined that ammonia oxidizing bacteria may co exist with mn oxidizing bacteria further we identified which type s of ammonia oxidizers were correlated with mn oxidation with comammox nitrospira found to be positively correlated with mn oxidizing genes fig 5 this complete nitrifier has high affinity for ammonia and a high yield biomass daims et al 2015 therefore we proposed that the amended mn oxides enhanced ammonia oxidation by promoting the abundance of amoa which was at large provided by comammox nitrospira since most of the mn oxidizing bacteria did not possess amoa the underlying metabolic co exist of mn oxidizing and ammonia oxidizing bacteria require further exploration in pure culture or synthetic communities the enhanced ammonia oxidation in mn amended cws led to the excessive production of nitrate figure s4d however the concentration of nitrate in mn amending cws was still under the limit 10 mg l of the level iv china environmental quality standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 therefore we believed that mn amended cws have great potential for complete nitrogen removal 5 conclusions we applied metagenome sequencing to profile the community composition as well as the functional traits of the cw microbiomes especially the root inhabiting microbiome of phragmites which is considered a strong pollution remediator results demonstrated that phragmites roots significantly enriched mn oxidizing microbes and biomass contributed to the enrichment of mn oxides in the rhizosphere environment further mn oxides was one of the environmental drivers of phragmites rhizosphere microbiome in cws specifically the content of mn oxides was significantly correlated with the concentration of ammonia and the abundance of mn oxidizing genes was positively correlated with that of amoa correlation analysis also revealed that comammox nitrospira the dominant ammonia oxidizer in the rhizosphere likely coexists with mn oxidizing bacteria extrapolation from cw field sampling was further tested using one year pilot scale mn amending cws ammonia removal capacity was significantly promoted 23 34 on average with the amended mn oxides in addition the mn oxides lead to more abundant amoa genes in both the bulk and rhizosphere soils

16599,we studied the connections between lake water quality and the density of artificial ditching in lake catchments water color and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and iron fe in lake water increased with increasing ditch density additionally the water color doc ratio increased along a ditch density gradient because ditching had a stronger effect on color than on doc this was mainly due to the positive effect of ditching on the fe concentration in lakes color doc ratio was strongly dependent on fe up to fe concentrations of 1 1 5 mg l 1 thus the water color of lakes with fe concentrations 1 mg l 1 will respond especially strongly to the effects of catchment ditching the effects of ditching were strongest in catchments with high peatland coverage due to their high ditch density and high storage of organic carbon and fe the long lasting effects of ditching should be taken into account when studying the factors governing lake brownification graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lake catchments ditching water color dissolved organic carbon iron 1 introduction water color is an important indicator of the water quality and ecosystem function of lakes water color affects domestic water use and regulates the functioning of lake ecosystems via its effects on the physicochemical environment and biological communities steinberg et al 2006 prairie 2008 karlsson et al 2009 estlander et al 2010 kritzberg et al 2020 water color is mainly caused by dissolved organic matter dom which is often measured as the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc pace and cole 2002 arvola et al 2016 another important regulator of water color is iron fe which is positively associated with dom kritzberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 finstad et al 2016 xiao et al 2015 the fluxes of doc and fe to lakes and thus the water color of lakes may be affected by human activities such as agriculture forestry drainage and peat mining heikkinen 1994 evans et al 2005 stanley et al 2012 nieminen et al 2015 asmala et al 2019 however the role of land use as a regulator of water color has been overlooked kritzberg et al 2020 and more information on the magnitude of land use effects is needed to facilitate better land use management practices artificial ditching is a land use form that is especially poorly understood in the context of water color nieminen et al 2021 however ditching is a global land use form and is conducted for various purposes in australia asia europe and north and south america ecke 2009 for example in finland over half of the peatlands have been ditched mostly to increase forest growth with drained forest peatlands covering 20 of the land area kortelainen et al 1997 nieminen et al 2021 ditching activity in finland was highest during 1960 s and 1970 s and ceased in the 1980 s but 60 000 70 000 ha are nowadays annually treated with maintenance ditching for instance due to collapse of ditch banks and vegetation blockage hÃ¶kkÃ¤ et al 2000 2017 nieminen et al 2021 a ditch network usually includes individual ditches that are 30 50 m apart and open to a main ditch that collects the water and leads it away from the area to recipient waters joensuu et al 1999 the depth of the ditches is usually c 0 5 1 m and especially in areas with a shallow peat layer the ditches may extend to the mineral soil layer hÃ¶kkÃ¤ et al 2017 nieminen et al 2018a settling ponds and buffer zones are nowadays recommended to reduce water quality effects of ditching but during the original ditch excavations water protection efforts were not on the same level vast amounts of peatlands have also been drained in the netherlands united kingdom and ireland holden et al 2006 recent studies have suggested that the legacy effect of artificial ditching is strong and that ditching may affect lake water quality for decades after the latest excavation activities asmala et al 2019 finÃ©r et al 2021 nieminen et al 2018b 2021 therefore our study aims to find out if artificial ditching is affecting water color of lakes and if peatland coverage in the catchment alters the response of water color to ditching the study thus clarifies if ditching can accelerate lake brownification which is defined as the darkening of water increase of water color e g klante et al 2021 brownification has been observed in a large number of lakes in the northern hemisphere and the factors behind the phenomenon are being intensively discussed evans et al 2005 roulet and moore 2006 weyhenmeyer et al 2016 sepp et al 2018 additionally we examine if ditching influences the water color doc ratio of lakes such effect of ditching has been rarely explored however together with doc concentration water color is regulated also by other factors possibly affected by ditching with consequences for water color doc ratio such factors include iron fe and quality of dom worrall et al 2007 krizberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 as stated by weyhenmeyer et al 2014 studies on the role of these factors in brownification are needed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study lakes and their catchments data were collected from 102 lakes situated in southern and central finland fig 1 the surface area of the lakes varied between 0 2 2117 4 ha table 1 the catchment areas of the study lakes and the land use in their catchments were determined with the value tool provided by the finnish environment institute http paikkatieto ymparisto fi value horppila et al 2019 ekholm et al 2000 the tool derives land use variables and lake percentages from coordination of information on the environment corine 2012 land cover data the national corine 2012 database for finland has a 20 20 m spatial resolution and uses the d8 flow direction algorithm www avoindata fi data fi dataset corine

statistical analyses the relationships between various water quality parameters e g doc vs color and the overall effect of catchment ditching on water quality were firstly studied with simple linear

test showed that the maximum value of the condition index was 2 12 for catchments with low peatland coverage 2 51 for catchments with medium peatland coverage and 2 21 for catchments with high peatland coverage the condition index values were thus clearly below 30 which is considered a threshold for significant collinearity e g mason and perreault 1991 additionally the multiple regression analyses were also conducted by excluding the possible additional effects of peat mining on the studied water quality parameters in 17 out of the 102 catchments the percentual coverage of peat mining in the catchment exceeded 2 because almost all these lakes 16 were included in lakes with high peatland coverage in their catchments these complementary regression analyses were conducted for this lake group prior to all statistical analyses the data were ln x 1 transformed to improve normality and normality of the model residuals was confirmed with kolmogorov smirnov tests the only considerable deviations from normality were found in fe doc ratio therefore tests concerning fe doc ratio were performed with asin transformed data which fulfilled the normality assumption 3 results 3

catchment characteristics land use and water quality ditching alone had a significant effect on most of the studied water quality parameters fig 4 the effect was steeper for water color than for doc for instance when ditch density increased from 0 to 10 km km 2 the average water color increased from 56 abs410 to above 200 abs410 fig 4 with a similar increase in ditch density the average doc concentration increased from 9 6 to 20 2 mg l 1 fig 4 for fe the effect of ditching was also strong with a ditch density increase from 0 to 10 km km 2 fe concentration increased from below 0 1 mg l 1 to 1 3 mg l 1 fig 4 due to the stronger effect of ditching on color and fe than on doc ditching had a highly significant positive effect on water color doc ratio and fe doc ratio fig 4 water color fe ratio did not respond significantly to ditch density variations fig 4 when background catchment characteristics were included into the analyses and the whole data were used peatland coverage had a strong positive effect on all the water quality parameters except color fe ratio which was affected negatively table 2 for water color and doc concentration ditching and catchment lake coverage had however higher standardized beta coefficients than peatland coverage table 2 catchment lake coverage had a significant negative effect on water color doc and fe concentrations and on water color doc ratio table 2 the impact of ditch density on water quality was affected by catchment characteristics a ditch density increase from 0 to 10 km km 2 resulted in a 7 8 mg l 1 increase in doc from 8 1 mg l 1 to 15 9 mg l 1 when peatland coverage was 0 fig 5 with 60 peatland coverage a similar change in ditch density caused a 10 2 mg l 1 increase in doc from 11 0 mg l 1 to 21 2 mg l 1 for water color the influence of peatland coverage on ditching effects was even more pronounced when ditch density increased from 0 to 10 km km 2 water color increased by 64 3abs410 units with 0 peatland coverage and by 159 4 abs410 units with 60 peatland coverage fig 5 accordingly when lakes were divided into the peatland coverage groups significant effects of ditching on water color doc and color doc ratio were found only in lakes with the highest peatland coverages in their catchments table 2 in this lake group the effect of ditch density was significant and positive also for fe concentration and fe doc ratio while in the other two lake groups these parameters were not affected by ditching table 2 color fe ratio was not affected by ditching in any of the lake groups fig 5 table 2 in lakes with low and medium catchment peatland coverage lake coverage in the catchment was the main regulator of water quality having a significant negative effect and highest standardized beta coefficients for water color doc fe and color doc ratio table 2 the exclusion of lakes with peat mining in the catchment area had no effects on the test results 4 discussion generally the connections between catchment characteristics and water quality parameters and between different water quality parameters were in line with previous studies corroborating the present results organic carbon fluxes from the catchments and organic carbon concentrations in lakes usually increase with increasing peatland coverage and a decreasing lake area catchment area ratio kortelainen 1993 dillon and molot 1997 rantakari et al 2004 mattsson et al 2005 lake coverage in the catchment usually has a negative effect on doc concentrations and water color kortelainen et al 2004 rantakari et al 2004 a phenomenon that was also clear in the present data our results also demonstrated the frequently reported fact that organic carbon is the main determinant of water color while other factors such as fe also contribute kortelainen 1993 worrall et al 2007 kritzberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 supporting recent studies asmala et al 2019 finÃ©r et al 2021 nieminen et al 2021 our results provided strong evidence that artificial ditching is a factor affecting lake water color and doc concentration additionally the study included novel findings on the interactive effects of ditch density and peatland coverage on lake water quality and on the consequences of ditching for the water color doc ratio of lake waters connections between catchment land use and lake water quality are complicated because both land use and the natural background water quality of lakes depend on catchment characteristics ditching has been targeted especially to peatlands which has led to a high ditch density especially in catchments where peatland coverage and consequently the natural background doc concentrations are high e g arvola et al 2016 our results demonstrated that the effect of ditching on water quality was strongest at high peatland coverage values the differential effects of ditching in the different catchments could not be explained by between group differences in lake area catchment area ratios lake coverage in the catchments or catchment slopes peat mining could also not explain the phenomenon because the difference between the groups remained even when catchments with peat mining were excluded catchment peatland coverage obviously affects the response of doc concentration and water color of lakes to increasing ditch density in their catchments this means that ditching has been concentrated especially to catchments where lakes are vulnerable to its effects due to high storages of organic carbon and fe when interpreting the results we note that the data did not include lakes with very low peatland coverage and high ditch density in their catchments this is because ditching has been targeted at peatlands however the data reflect the circumstances as they are and thus provide a realistic view of the factors governing lake water quality lakes with high peatland coverage and very low ditch density in their catchment were also scarce in the data because such lakes are rare in southern and central finland however some lakes matching these criteria situated in seitseminen national park were included and can be used as reference lakes when exploring the effects of ditching for example lake kirkas soljanen with 30 5 peatland coverage and 0 km km 2 ditch density in its catchment had a doc concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 and a water color of 17 7 abs410 lake iso sÃ¤rkijÃ¤rvi which had a lower peatland coverage 21 1 but a ditch density of 7 3 km km 2 showed a doc concentration of 13 5 mg l 1 and a water color of 115 7 abs410 lake saari soljanen with 38 6 peatland coverage and 0 km km 2 ditch density had a doc concentration of 6 7 mg l 1 and a water color of 41 3 abs410 lake vÃ¤hÃ¤ madesjÃ¤rvi with 29 1 peatland coverage and 7 6 km km 2 ditch density had a doc concentration of 14 4 mg l 1 and a water color of 118 5 abs410 the data thus provided strong evidence that ditching elevates water color and doc concentration especially in lakes with high natural background color the development of the color doc ratio along a doc gradient was notable in the study lakes studies have previously shown that the color doc ratio can vary among lakes and can increase with increasing doc concentration molot and dillon 1997 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 many previous explanations for varying color doc ratios have been connected to drivers affected by the climate change for example the changing intensity of precipitation may affect the color doc ratios because very intensive rain can lead to increased leaching of highly colored compounds from the forest floor hongve et al 2004 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 changing redox conditions in the soil can also play a role because a wetter climate may increase anoxia in the soil and thereby affect fe mobility through increasing concentrations of fe ii and thus affecting the fe doc ratio in surface waters heikkinen 1994 kritzberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 barcellos et al 2018 the present study showed that ditching can also affect the color doc ratio of lake waters the result is novel but could be expected because previous studies have shown that increased terrestrial load often increases the carbon specific absorbance of recipient waters williamson et al 2014 massicotte et al 2017 such effect of ditching on color doc relationship could be due to different factors the deeper soil layers disturbed by ditching are of the rich in of fe weyhenmeyer et al 2014 ditching could thus increase the flux of fe in relation to doc and thus increase the color doc ratio in oxic conditions the interaction of fe and organic matter can keep fe in solution and an important route of fe from catchments to surface waters is leaching in complex with organic matter kritzberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 artificial ditching can also affect the quality doc leaching from the terrestrial system to waters soil disturbance can lead for instance to lower aromaticity and molecular weight of doc which is attributed to altered terrestrial sources stanley et al 2012 soil disturbance can increase the leaching of low color doc and decrease the color doc ratio because in deeper soil layers doc is more extensively processed compared with shallower layers worrall et al 2006 kaiser and kalbitz 2012 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 our results suggested that the effect of ditching on color doc ratio was mediated mostly through fe this conclusion was supported by the fact that ditch density had a positive effect on fe doc ratio and no effect on color fe ratio if ditching considerably altered the quality of leaching doc color fe ratio should respond to ditch density additionally peatland coverage had negative effects on color fe ratio indicating that the export of high color doc in relation to fe increases with peatland coverage if ditching intensity is low weyhenmeyer et al 2014 showed that the color doc ratio in swedish and canadian lakes increased steeply with increasing fe up to an fe concentration of 1 mg l 1 and formed a plateau at high fe concentrations they concluded that at low fe concentrations water color increases with increasing fe due to complexation of fe and doc but a plateau in the color doc ratio may be formed at high fe concentrations when organic matter becomes saturated with fe they suggested that a fe concentration of ca 1 mg l 1 is the upper threshold for boreal waters for substantial additive effects of fe on water color our findings supported these conclusions color doc ratio was strongly dependent on fe up to fe concentrations of 1 1 5 mgl 1 hence the especially water color of lakes with fe concentrations 1 mg l 1 is likely to respond strongly to the effects of catchment ditching 5 conclusion climate change and decreasing sulphur deposition are factors behind the increasing load of dom to lakes and thus behind lake brownification roulet and moore 2006 vuorenmaa et al 2006 de wit et al 2016 weyhenmeyer et al 2016 there is also growing evidence that human land use can accelerate brownification evans et al 2005 stanley et al 2012 nieminen et al 2021 our results demonstrated that doc concentration and water color were strongly increased with increasing density of artificial ditches in lake catchments the effects of ditching were strongest in catchments with high peatland coverage which was both due to the aggregation of ditches in peatlands and the vulnerability of such catchments to ditching because of their high storages of organic carbon and fe additionally artificial ditching had a strong positive effect on color doc ratio of lake waters which was attributed to the strong effect of ditching on fe concentrations in all connections between water quality and ditching were strong supporting recent conclusions on the long lasting legacy effects of ditching on the concentration of organic carbon in recipient waters asmala et al 2019 nieminen et al 2021 the effect depends on catchment characteristics because humic substances and fe have their own specific processes in the catchments and also their own sources and pathways to the lakes arvola et al 2010 when studying the factors governing lake water color the described effects of land use should be taken into account declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

16599,we studied the connections between lake water quality and the density of artificial ditching in lake catchments water color and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc and iron fe in lake water increased with increasing ditch density additionally the water color doc ratio increased along a ditch density gradient because ditching had a stronger effect on color than on doc this was mainly due to the positive effect of ditching on the fe concentration in lakes color doc ratio was strongly dependent on fe up to fe concentrations of 1 1 5 mg l 1 thus the water color of lakes with fe concentrations 1 mg l 1 will respond especially strongly to the effects of catchment ditching the effects of ditching were strongest in catchments with high peatland coverage due to their high ditch density and high storage of organic carbon and fe the long lasting effects of ditching should be taken into account when studying the factors governing lake brownification graphical abstract

the fluxes of doc and fe to lakes and thus the water color of lakes may be affected by human activities such as agriculture forestry drainage and peat mining heikkinen 1994 evans et al 2005 stanley et al 2012 nieminen et al 2015 asmala et al 2019 however the role of land use as a regulator of water color has been overlooked kritzberg et al 2020 and more information on the magnitude of land use effects is needed to facilitate better land use management practices artificial ditching is a land use form that is especially poorly understood in the context of water color nieminen et al 2021 however ditching is a global land use form and is conducted for various purposes in australia asia europe and north and south america ecke 2009 for example in finland over half of the peatlands have been ditched mostly to increase forest growth with drained forest peatlands covering 20 of the land area kortelainen et al 1997 nieminen et al 2021 ditching activity in finland was highest during 1960 s and 1970 s and ceased in the 1980 s but 60 000 70 000 ha are nowadays annually treated with maintenance ditching for instance due to collapse of ditch banks and vegetation blockage hÃ¶kkÃ¤ et al 2000 2017 nieminen et al 2021 a ditch network usually includes individual ditches that are 30 50 m apart and open to a main ditch that collects the water and leads it away from the area to recipient waters joensuu et al 1999 the depth of the ditches is usually c 0 5 1 m and especially in areas with a shallow peat layer the ditches may extend to the mineral soil layer hÃ¶kkÃ¤ et al 2017 nieminen et al 2018a settling ponds and buffer zones are nowadays recommended to reduce water quality effects of ditching but during the original ditch excavations water protection efforts were not on the same level vast amounts of peatlands have also been drained in the netherlands united kingdom and ireland holden et al 2006 recent studies have suggested that the legacy effect of artificial ditching is strong and that ditching may affect lake water quality for decades after the latest excavation activities asmala et al 2019 finÃ©r et al 2021 nieminen et al 2018b 2021 therefore our study aims to find out if artificial ditching is affecting water color of lakes and if peatland coverage in the catchment alters the response of water color to ditching the study thus clarifies if ditching can accelerate lake brownification which is defined as the darkening of water increase of water color e g klante et al 2021 brownification has been observed in a large number of lakes in the northern hemisphere and the factors behind the phenomenon are being intensively discussed evans et al 2005 roulet and moore 2006 weyhenmeyer et al 2016 sepp et al 2018 additionally we examine if ditching influences the water color doc ratio of lakes such effect of ditching has been rarely explored however together with doc concentration water color is regulated also by other factors possibly affected by ditching with consequences for water color doc ratio such factors include iron fe and quality of dom worrall et al 2007 krizberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 as stated by weyhenmeyer et al 2014 studies on the role of these factors in brownification are needed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study lakes and their catchments data were collected from 102 lakes situated in southern and central finland fig 1 the

color doc fe and color doc ratio table 2 the exclusion of lakes with peat mining in the catchment area had no effects on the test results 4 discussion generally the connections between catchment characteristics and water quality parameters and between different water quality parameters were in line with previous studies corroborating the present results organic carbon fluxes from the catchments and organic carbon concentrations in lakes usually increase with increasing peatland coverage and a decreasing lake area catchment area ratio kortelainen 1993 dillon and molot 1997 rantakari et al 2004 mattsson et al 2005 lake coverage in the catchment usually has a negative effect on doc concentrations and water color kortelainen et al 2004 rantakari et al 2004 a phenomenon that was also clear in the present data our results also demonstrated the frequently reported fact that organic carbon is the main determinant of water color while other factors such as fe also contribute kortelainen 1993 worrall et al 2007 kritzberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 supporting recent studies asmala et al 2019 finÃ©r et al 2021 nieminen et al 2021 our results provided strong evidence that artificial ditching is a factor affecting lake water color and doc concentration additionally the study included novel findings on the interactive effects of ditch density and peatland coverage on lake water quality and on the consequences of ditching for the water color doc ratio of lake waters connections between catchment land use and lake water quality are complicated because both land use and the natural background water quality of lakes depend on catchment characteristics ditching has been targeted especially to peatlands which has led to a high ditch density especially in catchments where peatland coverage and consequently the natural background doc concentrations are high e g arvola et al 2016 our results demonstrated that the effect of ditching on water quality was strongest at high peatland coverage values the differential effects of ditching in the different catchments could not be explained by between group differences in lake area catchment area ratios lake coverage in the catchments or catchment slopes peat mining could also not explain the phenomenon because the difference between the groups remained even when catchments with peat mining were excluded catchment peatland coverage obviously affects the response of doc concentration and water color of lakes to increasing ditch density in their catchments this means that ditching has been concentrated especially to catchments where lakes are vulnerable to its effects due to high storages of organic carbon and fe when interpreting the results we note that the data did not include lakes with very low peatland coverage and high ditch density in their catchments this is because ditching has been targeted at peatlands however the data reflect the circumstances as they are and thus provide a realistic view of the factors governing lake water quality lakes with high peatland coverage and very low ditch density in their catchment were also scarce in the data because such lakes are rare in southern and central finland however some lakes matching these criteria situated in seitseminen national park were included and can be used as reference lakes when exploring the effects of ditching for example lake kirkas soljanen with 30 5 peatland coverage and 0 km km 2 ditch density in its catchment had a doc concentration of 5 0 mg l 1 and a water color of 17 7 abs410 lake iso sÃ¤rkijÃ¤rvi which had a lower peatland coverage 21 1 but a ditch density of 7 3 km km 2 showed a doc concentration of 13 5 mg l 1 and a water color of 115 7 abs410 lake saari soljanen with 38 6 peatland coverage and 0 km km 2 ditch density had a doc concentration of 6 7 mg l 1 and a water color of 41 3 abs410 lake vÃ¤hÃ¤ madesjÃ¤rvi with 29 1 peatland coverage and 7 6 km km 2 ditch density had a doc concentration of 14 4 mg l 1 and a water color of 118 5 abs410 the data thus provided strong evidence that ditching elevates water color and doc concentration especially in lakes with high natural background color the development of the color doc ratio along a doc gradient was notable in the study lakes studies have previously shown that the color doc ratio can vary among lakes and can increase with increasing doc concentration molot and dillon 1997 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 many previous explanations for varying color doc ratios have been connected to drivers affected by the climate change for example the changing intensity of precipitation may affect the color doc ratios because very intensive rain can lead to increased leaching of highly colored compounds from the forest floor hongve et al 2004 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 changing redox conditions in the soil can also play a role because a wetter climate may increase anoxia in the soil and thereby affect fe mobility through increasing concentrations of fe ii and thus affecting the fe doc ratio in surface waters heikkinen 1994 kritzberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 barcellos et al 2018 the present study showed that ditching can also affect the color doc ratio of lake waters the result is novel but could be expected because previous studies have shown that increased terrestrial load often increases the carbon specific absorbance of recipient waters williamson et al 2014 massicotte et al 2017 such effect of ditching on color doc relationship could be due to different factors the deeper soil layers disturbed by ditching are of the rich in of fe weyhenmeyer et al 2014 ditching could thus increase the flux of fe in relation to doc and thus increase the color doc ratio in oxic conditions the interaction of fe and organic matter can keep fe in solution and an important route of fe from catchments to surface waters is leaching in complex with organic matter kritzberg and ekstrÃ¶m 2012 artificial ditching can also affect the quality doc leaching from the terrestrial system to waters soil disturbance can lead for instance to lower aromaticity and molecular weight of doc which is attributed to altered terrestrial sources stanley et al 2012 soil disturbance can increase the leaching of low color doc and decrease the color doc ratio because in deeper soil layers doc is more extensively processed compared with shallower layers worrall et al 2006 kaiser and kalbitz 2012 weyhenmeyer et al 2014 our results suggested that the effect of ditching on color doc ratio was mediated mostly through fe this conclusion was supported by the fact that ditch density had a positive effect on fe doc ratio and no effect on color fe ratio if ditching considerably altered the quality of leaching doc color fe ratio should respond to ditch density additionally peatland coverage had negative effects on color fe ratio indicating that the export of high color doc in relation to fe increases with peatland coverage if ditching intensity is low weyhenmeyer et al 2014 showed that the color doc ratio in swedish and canadian lakes increased steeply with increasing fe up to an fe concentration of 1 mg l 1 and formed a plateau at high fe concentrations they concluded that at low fe concentrations water color increases with increasing fe due to complexation of fe and doc but a plateau in the color doc ratio may be formed at high fe concentrations when organic matter becomes saturated with fe they suggested that a fe concentration of ca 1 mg l 1 is the upper threshold for boreal waters for substantial additive effects of fe on water color our findings supported these conclusions color doc ratio was strongly dependent on fe up to fe concentrations of 1 1 5 mgl 1 hence the especially water color of lakes with fe concentrations 1 mg l 1 is likely to respond strongly to the effects of catchment ditching 5 conclusion climate change and decreasing sulphur deposition are factors behind the increasing load of dom to lakes and thus behind lake brownification roulet and moore 2006 vuorenmaa et al 2006 de wit et al 2016 weyhenmeyer et al 2016 there is also growing evidence that human land use can accelerate brownification evans et al 2005 stanley et al 2012 nieminen et al 2021 our results demonstrated that doc concentration and water color were strongly increased with increasing density of artificial ditches in lake catchments the effects of ditching were strongest in catchments with high peatland coverage which was both due to the aggregation of ditches in peatlands and the vulnerability of such catchments to ditching because of their high storages of organic carbon and fe additionally artificial ditching had a strong positive effect on color doc ratio of lake waters which was attributed to the strong effect of ditching on fe concentrations in all connections between water quality and ditching were strong supporting recent conclusions on the long lasting legacy effects of ditching on the concentration of organic carbon in recipient waters asmala et al 2019 nieminen et al 2021 the effect depends on catchment characteristics because humic substances and fe have their own specific processes in the catchments and also their own sources and pathways to the lakes arvola et al 2010 when studying the factors governing lake water color the described effects of land use should be
