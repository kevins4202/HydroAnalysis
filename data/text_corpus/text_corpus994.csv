of the tank coordinate system x y 0 0 mm water distributing plates were set at 3 cm on both sides of the tank to uniformly distribute water an injection well of 500 mm long and 13 mm in diameter was set at 300 250 mm and its useful injecting scope was from 300 250 mm to 300 700 mm five piezometric tubes were set along the line x 450 mm to monitor the change in permeability in the aquifer thirty sampling points were set throughout the tank and the location was shown in fig 1 about 900 kg sand was compacted and filled into the tank layer by layer to 720 mm to simulate a homogeneous aquifer and the bulk density and porosity was 1 6 g cm3 and 0 37 respectively sixty millimeters of clay was placed on the aquifer to simulate aeration zone while reducing nitrobenzene volatilization loss in the

liters of emulsified vegetable oil was injected into the simulated aquifer through the injection well at a constant flow in 6 h and this day was denoted as zone day the second stage on the 29th days

nitrobenzene and aniline in the filtered samples were determined samples of outlet groundwater were also collected at designated volumes to determine nitrobenzene and aniline after the study ended sand samples were collected from the tank and extracted with methanol to determine the nitrobenzene and aniline adsorption on the medium 2 3 analytical methods ch3coo so4 2 and nitrate were analyzed using a dionex ics 2100 ion chromatograph with a dionex as19 ag19 column 250 mm 4 mm at 30 c the eluent was a solution of 20 mmol l koh at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and the injection volume was 25 µl

thiocyanate colorimetric assay method dong et al 2017a ph and orp were measured with a sension mm374 laboratory meter hach us do was measured with a sension mm150 portable meter hach us 3 results and discussion 3 1 migration of emulsified vegetable oil and formation of reactive zone in the process of emulsified vegetable oil injection the water levels of the inlet and the piezometric tubes all rose with increasing flow rate and 5 h after injection the water levels at both the inlet and the piezometric tubes returned to the heights before injection this observation indicates that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil did not change the permeability in the aquifer after 29 days of emulsified vegetable oil injection a significant active zone was observed downstream of the injection well the distributions of toc ch3coo ph orp do so4 2 fe ii and hco3 in the tank were detected and are shown in fig 2 toc was measured to represent the emulsified vegetable oil and its decomposition products in the tank as shown in fig 2 a within an approximately 20 cm radius from the injection well the concentration of toc was higher than that in other regions of the tank and the concentration of toc at the injection well was the highest 7500 mg l the toc concentrations in the other regions of the tank were relatively low and evenly distributed at approximately 4000 mg l this result indicates that a large scale reactive zone was formed in the aquifer and that emulsified vegetable oil trapped in the reactive zone could continuously generate dissolved organic matter large amounts of water soluble organic matter were released during the 29 days after the injection of emulsified vegetable oil and transported to every corner of the tank which is in accordance with the finding by yong jung jung 2003 ch3coo as the main product of emulsified vegetable oil decomposition can offer nutrients and energy to microorganisms and enhance contaminant remediation chi et al 2018 in this study ch3coo was measured to indirectly reflect the intensity of the microbial reaction as shown in fig 2 b ch3coo presents an obvious zonal distribution along the x axis the center of the reactive zone was located at the injection well and the concentration here was as high as 4204 mg l along the flow direction the concentration of ch3coo distinctly decreased and the concentration in the downstream region x 50 200 cm was approximately 1000 mg l this result indicates that a wide reactive zone formed after emulsified vegetable oil injection and that the microbial reaction was strong the distribution of ph values in the tank was basically the same as that of ch3coo fig 2 c the ph values in the tank ranged from 5 1 to 7 5 and the minimum value was located at the injection well this result proved that the declining ph was due to the abundant ch3coo generated from the emulsified vegetable oil zhang et al 2015 microorganisms when using emulsified vegetable oil to grow can transfer electrons to potential electron receptors in aquifers such as o2 no3 so4 2 and fe iii and change the redox environment in aquifers fan et al 2013 the distribution of orp in the tank is shown in fig 2 d the orp values near the inlet and the bottom of the tank were over 100 mv while all values were less than zero in the reactive zone and even below 150 mv near the injection well the results show that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil can quickly deplete the oxidizing substances in aquifers and benefit the anaerobic degradation of pollutants chi et al 2018 the do on day 29 in the tank was less than the initial 8 mg l as shown in fig 2 e do was relatively high near the inlet of the tank approximately 6 7 mg l and ranged from 3 to 5 mg l downstream of the injection well it can be seen that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil will not reduce the ph sharply in contrast with the addition of dissolved organic matter ellis et al 2000 the distribution of so4 2 in the tank is shown in fig 2 f so4 2 was detected only at the inlet bottom and other individual locations in the tank as the concentration of so4 2 in the initial groundwater was 36 54 mg l violent sulfate reduction was performed in the reactive zone but sulfide was not detected in the groundwater suggesting the formation of iron sulfide precipitates which is consistent with our previous study chi et al 2018 a large amount of fe ii was produced in the reactive zone on the 29th day and the distribution of fe ii in the tank was the same as that of ch3coo fig 2 g this result indicated that ch3coo produced from emulsified vegetable oil can effectively stimulate the growth of indigenous fe iii reducing microorganisms to construct an in situ bioreactive zone zhang et al 2015 there was no nitrate detected in the tank during the experiment which mainly because that nitrate is one kind of electron acceptor and is easier utilized than fe iii and nitrate in groundwater was reduced rapidly emulsified vegetable oil can be mineralized into co2 and h2o by aerobic microbes and co2 can also be generated through methanogenesis reactions when most oxidizing substances have been consumed tang et al 2013a therefore the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 in the tank were measured to characterize the generation of co2 the distribution of hco3 in the tank is shown in fig 2 h a high concentration of hco3 was detected in the reactive zone especially near the outlet of the tank which indicates the generation of large amounts of co2 however no co3 2 was detected in the tank on day 29 because the existing forms of co2 in the water changed with ph and co3 2 was the dominant existing form only in strong alkaline conditions at ph values in the tank ranging from 5 1 to 7 5 co2 in the water was likely to exist in the form of h2co3 and hco3 instead of co3 2 kemp 1971 3 2 evolution of the reactive zone after the formation of the in situ reactive zone 100 mg l nitrobenzene contaminated groundwater was continuously flooded into the tank as shown in fig 3 a nitrobenzene migrated from the inlet to the outlet and was transported slowly in the reactive zone it migrated out of the tank at 69th day and the concentration of nitrobenzene in the outflow groundwater was less than 10 mg l at 79th day the nitrobenzene plume migrated further in the bottom of the tank and high nitrobenzene concentrations over 0 1200 mm of the tank while only a small amount of low nitrobenzene concentrations exist in the reactive zone at 164th day a high concentration of nitrobenzene filled the whole bottom of the tank and there was no nitrobenzene detected in the reactive zone until the end of the experiment aniline was the main product from nitrobenzene degradation and accumulated in the tank with the reduction of nitrobenzene fig 3 b aniline mainly accumulated downstream of the reactive zone x 50 200 cm while the concentration of aniline was relatively low in the center of the reactive zone consequently the in situ bioreactive zone could effectively intercept and remediate the 100 mg l nitrobenzene plume throughout the experiment however the remediation efficiency of this method was severely affected by the depth of the injection well nitrobenzene in the non reactive zone below the injection well cannot effectively be remediated fig 4 a shows the distribution of ch3coo on days 44 59 79 114 and 164 in the tank as nitrobenzene polluted groundwater continuously flowed the concentration of ch3coo downstream of the reactive zone x 50 200 cm was continuously reduced while the concentration in the center of the reactive zone remained stable at approximately 1500 mg l in addition the high ch3coo concentration region near the injection well x 10 50 cm was stable throughout the test this is because the produced ch3coo is a kind of water soluble organic matter and has a short residence time in the tank this property combined with consumption by indigenous microorganisms meant that the concentration of ch3coo was reduced downstream while emulsified vegetable oil retained on aquifer media upstream has good sustained release performance it can continuously generate ch3coo to maintain the operation of the reactive zone zhang et al 2015 there was no obvious change in ph value after nitrobenzene flow fig 4 b and the lowest ph value was at the injection well and was stable at approximately 5 2 it can be seen that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil will not reduce the ph sharply in contrast with the effect on dissolved organic matter ellis et al 2000 and can maintain a suitable ph level for indigenous microorganisms in the aquifer fig 4 c shows the orp variation with time in the tank after nitrobenzene flow it can be seen that as the reactive zone matured the orp in the tank further decreased in particular in the downstream region orp significantly decreased to 200 mv while the orp in the inlet region was always above 0 mv therefore the continuous flooding of nitrobenzene did not affect the redox environment in the tank and the injection of emulsified vegetable oil maintained a reducing environment in the reactive zone over the long term and provided favorable conditions for the anaerobic reduction of nitrobenzene chi et al 2018 the distribution of do in the simulated tank after nitrobenzene flow is shown in fig 4 d with the continuous flow of nitrobenzene contaminated groundwater the initial do was 8 mg l the concentration of do in the tank declined sharply and finally became stable at approximately 2 mg l throughout the reactive zone while the do at the inlet of the tank was still as high as 3 5 mg l this is because oxygen has the strongest ability to compete for electrons among the potential electron receptors in the underground environment which makes microorganisms utilize oxygen preferentially and leads to a significant decrease in do fan et al 2013 however a low concentration of do is a prerequisite for the processes of dissimilatory iron reduction and nitrobenzene reduction chi et al 2018 lovley et al 1987 as one of the components in the initial groundwater the distribution of so4 2 in the tank was consistent with that of nitrobenzene fig 4 e according to the discussion in part 3 1 there was no so4 2 detected in the reactive zone before nitrobenzene flow and a certain concentration of so4 2 was detected in the nitrobenzene polluted region in the reactive zone while so4 2 accumulated in the nonreactive zone it was speculated that nitrobenzene had an inhibitory effect on sulfate reducing bacteria and the process of biological sulfate reduction in the nitrobenzene polluted region slowed or even stopped after the nitrobenzene in the polluted region was degraded the so4 2 in this region was subsequently reduced the results show that the reactive zone formed by emulsified vegetable oil could effectively remediate so4 2 which is also a common pollutant in groundwater fig 5 f shows the distribution of hco3 in the simulated tank as the final product of emulsified vegetable oil decomposition in aquifers hco3 decreased after nitrobenzene flow and then gradually stabilized finally the concentration of hco3 at the center of the reactive zone stabilized at approximately 700 mg l and the values in the other regions in the reactive zone stabilized at approximately 300 mg l there was no co3 2 detected throughout the experiment this result indicated that a large amount of emulsified vegetable oil was rapidly decomposed in the early stage and the reaction rate gradually stabilized in the later stage this result is consistent with previous studies showing that emulsified vegetable oil can provide a long lasting carbon source and electron donor for bioremediation in the underground environment zhang et al 2015 fig 5 shows the distribution of fe ii in the tank over time after nitrobenzene was flooded into the tank the concentration of fe ii in the central region of the reactive zone x 10 50 cm decreased while the concentration of fe ii downstream of the reactive zone x 50 200 cm increased on 79th day the region of high fe ii concentration in the center of the reactive zone expanded continuously and the highest concentration of fe ii in the reactive zone raised again and exceeded that before nitrobenzene flow it can be concluded that the flooding of nitrobenzene had a certain inhibitory effect on iron reducing bacteria in the aquifer but the inhibition was reversible and disappeared after a short adaptation period in conclusion after the injection of the remediation reagent a large part of the emulsified vegetable oil was trapped within a 200 mm radius from the injection well and acetate as the main decomposition product formed a large scale reactive zone in the downstream of the injection well the microbial metabolism of emulsified vegetable oil can cause a small decrease in ph and at the same time consume the potential electron acceptors in aquifer such as oxygen nitrate sulfate and other oxidizing substances causing a sharp decrease in dissolved oxygen nitrate sulfate and orp nitrate and sulfate were not detected in the reactive zone hence in situ bioreactive zone technology has the latent capability to remediate multiple pollutants in groundwater simultaneously the continuous flooding of nitrobenzene did not affect the stability of the reactive zone and dissolved oxygen and orp in the reactive zone became lower as 2 mg l and 200 mv respectively while ph had no significant change the good anaerobic reducing environment in the reactive zone provides favorable conditions for the anaerobic reduction of nitrobenzene the in situ bioreactive zone technology stimulated by emulsified vegetable oil can be used for the long term continuous remediation of nitrobenzene plume and when remediating an actual site the most effective method is to establish a reactive zone downstream of the pollutant source to repair the contaminant plume and the injection well must guarantee enough depth and ensure throughout the entire polluted region 3 3 evaluation of the in situ reactive zone 3 3 1 assessment of permeability the permeability coefficient is one of the key hydrogeological parameters of aquifers and represents the flowing ability of groundwater an excellent in situ remediation technology cannot seriously reduce the permeability coefficient otherwise it will cause a blockage in the aquifer therefore the permeability coefficient in the tank during the experiment was calculated according to darcy s law and is shown in fig 6 after the injection of emulsified vegetable oil the permeability coefficient in the simulated tank decreased to 3 2 10 4 m s from the initial 5 8 10 4 m s within 4 days and then returned to the initial value from the 9th day indicating that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil did not impact the permeability coefficient in the aquifer and the decrease in the permeability coefficient in the early stage was reversible after nitrobenzene flow the permeability coefficient in the tank decreased rapidly and fell to 1 02 10 4 m s on the 134th day and then remained stable the flooding of nitrobenzene caused an obvious decrease in the permeability coefficient the possible reasons are as follows 1 the existence of nitrobenzene promotes the process of dissimilatory iron reduction and in this way abundant secondary fe ii relevant minerals precipitate and reduce the porosity in the aquifer chi et al 2018 and 2 produced gases such as co2 and ch4 accumulate in the tank and decrease the permeability coefficient in the later stage of the experiment gas samples were collected for analysis and the main component was methane although there was an obvious decrease in the permeability coefficient the differences were on the same order of magnitude and there was no visible effect on the groundwater flow in the stimulated tank 3 3 2 assessment of nitrobenzene remediation efficiency in this study all of the nitrobenzene came from the polluted groundwater and aniline came from the reduction of nitrobenzene and was calculated based on the highest nitrobenzene reduction rate 79 31 detected in the simulated tank nitrobenzene and aniline in the tank had three possible fates 1 migration out of the tank along with the groundwater 2 adsorption on the surface of the aquifer medium or 3 reduction to aniline or direct degradation for nitrobenzene degradation only for aniline the amounts of the analytes that underwent 3 were obtained by subtracting the values associated with 1 and 2 from the total amount the amounts of nitrobenzene and aniline in the outlet groundwater were calculated from the volume of effluent and the concentrations of nitrobenzene and aniline in the outlet groundwater the nitrobenzene and aniline adsorbed on the medium were calculated from the unit adsorption amount and the amount of sand in the tank during the experiment a total of 178 400 mg of nitrobenzene flowed into the simulated tank of which 3 57 flowed out of the tank with groundwater 3 39 was adsorbed on the surface of the aquifer medium 79 31 was reduced to aniline and 13 73 was directly degraded by microorganisms the amount of aniline produced by the reduction of nitrobenzene was 1 41489 mg of which 6 12 flowed out of the tank 3 67 was adsorbed on the surface of the aquifer medium and 90 21 was directly degraded by microorganisms the material balance during the experiment is shown in table 1 4 conclusion the one time injection of emulsified vegetable oil formed an in situ bioreactive zone with low orp and high fe ii and the emulsified vegetable oil retained near the injection well was continuously and slowly decomposed to ch3coo to maintain the growth of microorganisms downstream the in situ bioreactive zone effectively intercepted and remediated a 100 mg l nitrobenzene plume throughout the experiment during the experiment a total of 178 400 mg of nitrobenzene flowed into the simulated tank of which 93 04 was degraded and the main product was aniline in the later stage of the experiment the reactive zone only existed within the depth of the injection well so it is suggested that when remediating an actual contaminated site the injection well should be set downstream of the pollutant source and run through the polluted region in depth to ensure remediation efficiency this work will help us to design effective in situ remediation strategies for nitrobenzene contaminated sites and to improve actual engineering design parameters credit

rose with increasing flow rate and 5 h after injection the water levels at both the inlet and the piezometric tubes returned to the heights before injection this observation indicates that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil did not change the permeability in the aquifer after 29 days of emulsified vegetable oil injection a significant active zone was observed downstream of the injection well the distributions of toc ch3coo ph orp do so4 2 fe ii and hco3 in the tank were detected and are shown in fig 2 toc was measured to represent the emulsified vegetable oil and its decomposition products in the tank as shown in fig 2 a within an approximately 20 cm radius from the injection well the concentration of toc was higher than that in other regions of the tank and the concentration of toc at the injection well was the highest 7500 mg l the toc concentrations in the other regions of the tank were relatively low and evenly distributed at approximately 4000 mg l this result indicates that a large scale reactive zone was formed in the aquifer and that emulsified vegetable oil trapped in the reactive zone could continuously generate dissolved organic matter large amounts of water soluble organic matter were released during the 29 days after the injection of emulsified vegetable oil and transported to every corner of the tank which is in accordance with the finding by yong jung jung 2003 ch3coo as the main product of emulsified vegetable oil decomposition can offer nutrients and energy to microorganisms and enhance contaminant remediation chi et al 2018 in this study ch3coo was measured to indirectly reflect the intensity of the microbial reaction as shown in fig 2 b ch3coo presents an obvious zonal distribution along the x axis the center of the reactive zone was located at the injection well and the concentration here was as high as 4204 mg l along the flow direction the concentration of ch3coo distinctly decreased and the concentration in the downstream region x 50 200 cm was approximately 1000 mg l this result indicates that a wide reactive zone formed after emulsified vegetable oil injection and that the microbial reaction was strong the distribution of ph values in the tank was basically the same as that of ch3coo fig 2 c the ph values in the tank ranged from 5 1 to 7 5 and the minimum value was located at the injection well this result proved that the declining ph was due to the abundant ch3coo generated from the emulsified vegetable oil zhang et al 2015 microorganisms when using emulsified vegetable oil to grow can transfer electrons to potential electron receptors in aquifers such as o2 no3 so4 2 and fe iii and change the redox environment in aquifers fan et al 2013 the distribution of orp in the tank is shown in fig 2 d the orp values near the inlet and the bottom of the tank were over 100 mv while all values were less than zero in the reactive zone and even below 150 mv near the injection well the results show that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil can quickly deplete the oxidizing substances in aquifers and benefit the anaerobic degradation of pollutants chi et al 2018 the do on day 29 in the tank was less than the initial 8 mg l as shown in fig 2 e do was relatively high near the inlet of the tank approximately 6 7 mg l and ranged from 3 to 5 mg l downstream of the injection well it can be seen that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil will not reduce the ph sharply in contrast with the addition of dissolved organic matter ellis et al 2000 the distribution of so4 2 in the tank is shown in fig 2 f so4 2 was detected only at the inlet bottom and other individual locations in the tank as the concentration of so4 2 in the initial groundwater was 36 54 mg l violent sulfate reduction was performed in the reactive zone but sulfide was not detected in the groundwater suggesting the formation of iron sulfide precipitates which is consistent with our previous study chi et al 2018 a large amount of fe ii was produced in the reactive zone on the 29th day and the distribution of fe ii in the tank was the same as that of ch3coo fig 2 g this result indicated that ch3coo produced from emulsified vegetable oil can effectively stimulate the growth of indigenous fe iii reducing microorganisms to construct an in situ bioreactive zone zhang et al 2015 there was no nitrate detected in the tank during the experiment which mainly because that nitrate is one kind of electron acceptor and is easier utilized than fe iii and nitrate in groundwater was reduced rapidly emulsified vegetable oil can be mineralized into co2 and h2o by aerobic microbes and co2 can also be generated through methanogenesis reactions when most oxidizing substances have been consumed tang et al 2013a therefore the concentrations of co3 2 and hco3 in the tank were measured to characterize the generation of co2 the distribution of hco3 in the tank is shown in fig 2 h a high concentration of hco3 was detected in the reactive zone especially near the outlet of the tank which indicates the generation of large amounts of co2 however no co3 2 was detected in the tank on day 29 because the existing forms of co2 in the water changed with ph and co3 2 was the dominant existing form only in strong alkaline conditions at ph values in the tank ranging from 5 1 to 7 5 co2 in the water was likely to exist in the form of h2co3 and hco3 instead of co3 2 kemp 1971 3 2 evolution of the reactive zone after the formation of the in situ reactive zone 100 mg l nitrobenzene contaminated groundwater was continuously flooded into the tank as shown in fig 3 a nitrobenzene migrated from the inlet to the outlet and was transported slowly in the reactive zone it migrated out of the tank at 69th day and the concentration of nitrobenzene in the outflow groundwater was less than 10 mg l at 79th day the nitrobenzene plume migrated further in the bottom of the tank and high nitrobenzene concentrations over 0 1200 mm of the tank while only a small amount of low nitrobenzene concentrations exist in the reactive zone at 164th day a high concentration of nitrobenzene filled the whole bottom of the tank and there was no nitrobenzene detected in the reactive zone until the end of the experiment aniline was the main product from nitrobenzene degradation and accumulated in the tank with the reduction of nitrobenzene fig 3 b aniline mainly accumulated downstream of the reactive zone x 50 200 cm while the concentration of aniline was relatively low in the center of the reactive zone consequently the in situ bioreactive zone could effectively intercept and remediate the 100 mg l nitrobenzene plume throughout the experiment however the remediation efficiency of this method was severely affected by the depth of the injection well nitrobenzene in the non reactive zone below the injection well cannot effectively be remediated fig 4 a shows the distribution of ch3coo on days 44 59 79 114 and 164 in the tank as nitrobenzene polluted groundwater continuously flowed the concentration of ch3coo downstream of the reactive zone x 50 200 cm was continuously reduced while the concentration in the center of the reactive zone remained stable at approximately 1500 mg l in addition the high ch3coo concentration region near the injection well x 10 50 cm was stable throughout the test this is because the produced ch3coo is a kind of water soluble organic matter and has a short residence time in the tank this property combined with consumption by indigenous microorganisms meant that the concentration of ch3coo was reduced downstream while emulsified vegetable oil retained on aquifer media upstream has good sustained release performance it can continuously generate ch3coo to maintain the operation of the reactive zone zhang et al 2015 there was no obvious change in ph value after nitrobenzene flow fig 4 b and the lowest ph value was at the injection well and was stable at approximately 5 2 it can be seen that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil will not reduce the ph sharply in contrast with the effect on dissolved organic matter ellis et al 2000 and can maintain a suitable ph level for indigenous microorganisms in the aquifer fig 4 c shows the orp variation with time in the tank after nitrobenzene flow it can be seen that as the reactive zone matured the orp in the tank further decreased in particular in the downstream region orp significantly decreased to 200 mv while the orp in the inlet region was always above 0 mv therefore the continuous flooding of nitrobenzene did not affect the redox environment in the tank and the injection of emulsified vegetable oil maintained a reducing environment in the reactive zone over the long term and provided favorable conditions for the anaerobic reduction of nitrobenzene chi et al 2018 the distribution of do in the simulated tank after nitrobenzene flow is shown in fig 4 d with the continuous flow of nitrobenzene contaminated groundwater the initial do was 8 mg l the concentration of do in the tank declined sharply and finally became stable at approximately 2 mg l throughout the reactive zone while the do at the inlet of the tank was still as high as 3 5 mg l this is because oxygen has the strongest ability to compete for electrons among the potential electron receptors in the underground environment which makes microorganisms utilize oxygen preferentially and leads to a significant decrease in do fan et al 2013 however a low concentration of do is a prerequisite for the processes of dissimilatory iron reduction and nitrobenzene reduction chi et al 2018 lovley et al 1987 as one of the components in the initial groundwater the distribution of so4 2 in the tank was consistent with that of nitrobenzene fig 4 e according to the discussion in part 3 1 there was no so4 2 detected in the reactive zone before nitrobenzene flow and a certain concentration of so4 2 was detected in the nitrobenzene polluted region in the reactive zone while so4 2 accumulated in the nonreactive zone it was speculated that nitrobenzene had an inhibitory effect on sulfate reducing bacteria and the process of biological sulfate reduction in the nitrobenzene polluted region slowed or even stopped after the nitrobenzene in the polluted region was degraded the so4 2 in this region was subsequently reduced the results show that the reactive zone formed by emulsified vegetable oil could effectively remediate so4 2 which is also a common pollutant in groundwater fig 5 f shows the distribution of hco3 in the simulated tank as the final product of emulsified vegetable oil decomposition in aquifers hco3 decreased after nitrobenzene flow and then gradually stabilized finally the concentration of hco3 at the center of the reactive zone stabilized at approximately 700 mg l and the values in the other regions in the reactive zone stabilized at approximately 300 mg l there was no co3 2 detected throughout the experiment this result indicated that a large amount of emulsified vegetable oil was rapidly decomposed in the early stage and the reaction rate gradually stabilized in the later stage this result is consistent with previous studies showing that emulsified vegetable oil can provide a long lasting carbon source and electron donor for bioremediation in the underground environment zhang et al 2015 fig 5 shows the distribution of fe ii in the tank over time after nitrobenzene was flooded into the tank the concentration of fe ii in the central region of the reactive zone x 10 50 cm decreased while the concentration of fe ii downstream of the reactive zone x 50 200 cm increased on 79th day the region of high fe ii concentration in the center of the reactive zone expanded continuously and the highest concentration of fe ii in the reactive zone raised again and exceeded that before nitrobenzene flow it can be concluded that the flooding of nitrobenzene had a certain inhibitory effect on iron reducing bacteria in the aquifer but the inhibition was reversible and disappeared after a short adaptation period in conclusion after the injection of the remediation reagent a large part of the emulsified vegetable oil was trapped within a 200 mm radius from the injection well and acetate as the main decomposition product formed a large scale reactive zone in the downstream of the injection well the microbial metabolism of emulsified vegetable oil can cause a small decrease in ph and at the same time consume the potential electron acceptors in aquifer such as oxygen nitrate sulfate and other oxidizing substances causing a sharp decrease in dissolved oxygen nitrate sulfate and orp nitrate and sulfate were not detected in the reactive zone hence in situ bioreactive zone technology has the latent capability to remediate multiple pollutants in groundwater simultaneously the continuous flooding of nitrobenzene did not affect the stability of the reactive zone and dissolved oxygen and orp in the reactive zone became lower as 2 mg l and 200 mv respectively while ph had no significant change the good anaerobic reducing environment in the reactive zone provides favorable conditions for the anaerobic reduction of nitrobenzene the in situ bioreactive zone technology stimulated by emulsified vegetable oil can be used for the long term continuous remediation of nitrobenzene plume and when remediating an actual site the most effective method is to establish a reactive zone downstream of the pollutant source to repair the contaminant plume and the injection well must guarantee enough depth and ensure throughout the entire polluted region 3 3 evaluation of the in situ reactive zone 3 3 1 assessment of permeability the permeability coefficient is one of the key hydrogeological parameters of aquifers and represents the flowing ability of groundwater an excellent in situ remediation technology cannot seriously reduce the permeability coefficient otherwise it will cause a blockage in the aquifer therefore the permeability coefficient in the tank during the experiment was calculated according to darcy s law and is shown in fig 6 after the injection of emulsified vegetable oil the permeability coefficient in the simulated tank decreased to 3 2 10 4 m s from the initial 5 8 10 4 m s within 4 days and then returned to the initial value from the 9th day indicating that the injection of emulsified vegetable oil did not impact the permeability coefficient in the aquifer and the decrease in the permeability coefficient in the early stage was reversible after nitrobenzene flow the permeability coefficient in the tank decreased rapidly and fell to 1 02 10 4 m s on the 134th day and then remained stable the flooding of nitrobenzene caused an obvious decrease in the permeability coefficient the possible reasons are as follows 1 the existence of nitrobenzene promotes the process of dissimilatory iron reduction and in this way abundant secondary fe ii relevant minerals precipitate and reduce the porosity in the aquifer chi et al 2018 and 2 produced gases such as co2 and ch4 accumulate in the tank and decrease the permeability coefficient in the later stage of the experiment gas samples were collected for analysis and the main component was methane although there was an obvious decrease in the permeability coefficient the differences were on the same order of magnitude and there was no visible effect on the groundwater flow in the stimulated tank 3 3 2 assessment of nitrobenzene remediation efficiency in this study all of the nitrobenzene came from the polluted groundwater and aniline came from the reduction of nitrobenzene and was calculated based on the highest nitrobenzene reduction rate 79 31 detected in the simulated tank nitrobenzene and aniline in the tank had three possible fates 1 migration out of the tank along with the groundwater 2 adsorption on the surface of the aquifer medium or 3 reduction to aniline or direct degradation for nitrobenzene degradation only for aniline the amounts of the analytes that underwent 3 were obtained by subtracting the values associated with 1 and 2 from the total amount the amounts of nitrobenzene and aniline in the outlet groundwater were calculated from the volume of effluent and the concentrations of nitrobenzene and aniline in the outlet groundwater the nitrobenzene and aniline adsorbed on the medium were calculated from the unit adsorption amount and the amount of sand in the tank during the experiment a total of 178 400 mg of nitrobenzene flowed into the simulated tank of which 3 57 flowed out of the tank with groundwater 3 39 was adsorbed on the surface of the aquifer medium 79 31 was reduced to aniline and 13 73 was directly degraded by microorganisms the amount of aniline produced by the reduction of nitrobenzene was 1 41489 mg of which 6 12 flowed out of the tank 3 67 was adsorbed on the surface of the aquifer medium and 90 21 was directly degraded by microorganisms the material balance during the experiment is shown in table 1 4 conclusion the one time injection of emulsified vegetable oil formed an in situ bioreactive zone with low orp and high fe ii and the emulsified vegetable oil retained near the injection well was continuously and slowly decomposed to ch3coo to maintain the growth of microorganisms downstream the in situ bioreactive zone effectively intercepted and remediated a 100 mg l nitrobenzene plume throughout the experiment during the experiment a total of 178 400 mg of nitrobenzene flowed into the simulated tank of which 93 04 was degraded and the main product was aniline in the later stage of the experiment the reactive zone only existed within the depth of the injection well so it is suggested that when remediating an actual contaminated site the injection well should be set downstream of the pollutant source and run through the polluted region in depth to ensure remediation efficiency this work will help us to design effective in situ remediation strategies for nitrobenzene contaminated sites and to improve actual engineering design parameters credit

4971,quantitative analysis of flow in fractures is an important issue for hydrogeological and geological engineering in this study forchheimer models involving viscous permeability kv and inertial permeability ki were developed for groundwater flow in different single fractures or fractured media based on experiments and numerical simulation the relationship between viscous permeability and inertial permeability in a single fracture was disclosed and an important parameter ω the scaling coefficient ω ω ki kv 3 2 was characterized the results showed 1 the forchheimer model fit the non linear fluid flow in almost all types of artificial single fractures that investigated in this study 2 inertial permeability could be predicted by viscous permeability based on the empirical quantitative model k i ω k v 3 2 mergeformat ω 108 m 2 3 the fluctuation range of ω was related to the number of medium types more medium types would induce a larger fluctuation range artificial single fractures produced a smaller ω than that in natural rock fractures ω was inversely proportional to the magnitude of the inertial effect roughness and average aperture the roughness element shape that caused greater turbulence effects led to larger ω and single fractures placed vertically produced larger ω than fractures placed horizontally in addition the ratio of viscous permeability to inertial permeability kv ki in fractures could be used as the characteristic length of forchheimer number fo by characterizing scaling factor ω the accuracy of the quantitative model could be improved and basis for further quantification of non darcy flow was established keywords viscous permeability inertial permeability scaling coefficient single fracture non linear flow forchheimer model 1 introduction fractures and fracture networks are ubiquitous throughout the crust and have been studied in many geological engineering chen et al 2015 2017 qian et al 2011a 2011b ranjith and viete 2011 zimmerman et al 2004 however quantitative analysis of flow in fractures and fracture networks remains one of the most challenging problems in hydrogeology and engineering geology traditionally fluid flow in fractured media is described based on darcy s law in the average sense in darcy s law j v k j hydraulic gradient v average velocity of fluid k hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity k depends on the properties of the medium and characteristics of the fluid and it has been generally regarded to be a constant in a geological medium by applying darcy s law to parallel plate model a widely used equation that is the cubic law cl was obtained qian et al 2011a brush and thomson 2011 because of the strong heterogeneity of fractures it has been shown that darcy s law is not always suitable forchheimer 1901 nakayama 1992 qian et al 2015 wang et al 2017 and lcl also overestimated flow rate in real fractures wang and cardenas 2017 therefore to characterize the flow that darcy s law cannot describe nonlinear equations had been proposed i e the izbash equation izbash 1931 watanabe 1982 wen et al 2013 and forchheimer equation forchheimer 1901 among these nonlinear equations whether for an actual fluid production process or a laboratory experiment the forchheimer equation j av bv 2 a viscosity coefficient b inertial coefficient j hydraulic gradient v average velocity of fluid has aroused great interest of scholars mathias and wen 2015 wang et al 2017 since the forchheimer equation was proposed much research on its validation and theoretical background had been carried out chen et al 2015 irmay 1958 ruth and ma 1992 to quantify non linear flow by the forchheimer equation determination of the coefficients a and b is necessary in many practical applications however it is difficult to determine these two coefficients through experiments chen et al 2015 thus scholars have derived many parameter expressions to predict these forchheimer coefficients cornell and katz 1953 li et al 2017 zimmerman et al 2004 as a parameter reflecting the characteristics of fractured media viscous permeability has also been used in parameter expression of hydraulic conductivity k and the forchheimer coefficient a albert and henny 1991 cherubini et al 2012 however due to the complexity of inertial force and technical limitations after the wide use of viscosity permeability the concept of inertial permeability was firstly proposed by ergun 1952 ergun 1952 also incorporated the concept of inertial permeability into the parameter expressions of forchheimer coefficients b after that researchers began to use forchheimer equation with inertial permeability that is the ergun form of forchheimer equation to study the fluid flow in volcanic magma and other porous media with a complex pore structure degruyter et al 2010 shahin et al 2017 however studies on the expression of the inertia coefficient b by using inertial permeability in a single fracture have rarely been reported although permeability has been incorporated into fluid equations the measurement of permeability became a new problem scholars have developed some high tech methods to accurately predict viscous permeability mueller et al 2005 sukop et al 2013 sun et al 2014 however it has been noted that no method can directly measure inertial permeability to solve this problem some scholars have developed more refined parameter expressions of inertial permeability based on extensive laboratory methods for example the controlled column tracer test ctt experiments wang et al 2019 for example degruyter et al 2012 used the throat vesicle ratio ftb vesicle radius rb tortuosity index m and friction coefficient fo to express the inertial permeability ki of silicic magmas bai et al 2010 used bubble diameter d to describe non darcy permeability of vesicular stromboli basaltic glass and the efficient porosity p and average pore diameter d were used to calculate inertial permeability of granular material in packed columns and ceramic foams albert and henny 1991 ergun 1952 it should be noted that these empirical expressions of inertial permeability are based on porous media experiments thus it is still unclear whether these parameters describing porous media structure can be used in fractures moreover studies on the parameter expression of the inertial permeability in a single fracture are insufficient thus the unpredictability of inertial permeability in fractures has hindered the quantitative analysis of flow in fractures to solve the unpredictability of inertial permeability zhou et al 2019 obtained a universal relationship between viscous permeability and inertial permeability ki ωkv α where ω is scaling factor and α is the exponent of viscous permeability by sorting and analyzing more than 4000 data points from other scholars and laboratory experimental data although this empirical relationship was considered suitable for all geological media including fractured media fracture network and single fracture the scaling factor ω showed large fluctuations the maximum fluctuation was 6 orders of magnitude which had a negative impact on the accurate prediction of inertial permeability simultaneously due to the versatility of this empirical relationship it is still unclear whether the properties of different media such as the porosity of porous media will affect ω these problems may induce significant errors when using this quantitative model to predict inertial permeability of other media especially the inertial permeability of single fractures however a quantitative model only suitable for predicting inertial permeability of a single medium has not been proposed yet and revealing the influencing factors and corresponding varying characteristics of ω is important for more accurate prediction of inertial permeability although it has already mentioned that the scaling factor ω can be determined by local surface roughness and void distribution pattern zhou et al 2019 the exact influencing factors and corresponding varying characteristics are still unclear the purpose of this study is to 1 analyze the non linear relationship between the hydraulic gradient and average velocity in different forms of single fractures by incorporating viscous permeability kv and inertial permeability ki 2 obtain an empirical quantitative model of relationship between viscous and inertial permeability in single fracture and 3 disclose the varying characteristics of scaling coefficient ω between viscous and inertial permeabilities under different influencing factors 2 theoretical background 2 1 fluid equation in a single fracture the description of flow in fractures was based on darcy s law darcy 1856 which was initially suitable for describing fluids in porous media 1 j 1 k v where k m d is the hydraulic conductivity and j is the hydraulic gradient v m s is the average velocity of fluid hubbert 1940 defined permeability and found a relationship between permeability and hydraulic conductivity 2 k k ρ g μ where k m2 is the permeability intrinsic permeability viscous permeability darcy permeability depending on the characteristics of the media ρ kg m3 is the fluid density g m s2 is the acceleration induced by gravity μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity of fluid kinematic viscosity coefficient υ defaults to 1 2028 10 6 m2 s dynamic viscosity μ can be obtained by μ υρ substituting eq 2 into 1 gives 3 j μ ρ g k v since then the concept of viscous permeability has been introduced into hydrodynamic equations forchheimer 1901 considered the influence of viscous force and inertial force when studying fluid motion and obtained the classic non linear equation 4 j a v b v 2 j v j i where a s m is the coefficient of the viscosity term b s2 m2 is the coefficient of inertia term jv represents the pressure drop induced by viscous force ji represents pressure drop induced by inertial force the concepts of inertial permeability which was defined by ergun 1952 was used to express inertia coefficient b in forchheimer equation 5 dp dx μ k v v ρ k i v 2 where dp dx pa m is the pressure drop along the x direction kv m2 is viscous permeability darcy permeability and ki m is inertial permeability non darcy permeability eq 6 was developed by zhou et al 2019 to show the relationship between viscous and inertial permeabilities 6 k i ω k v α 2 where ω is the scaling coefficient in m 1 α ω 1010 m 2 with lower and upper bounds of 107 m 2 and 1013 m 2 respectively and α is the dimensionless exponent with α 3 calculation of permeability data and ω 7 dp dx ρ g j μ k v v ρ k i v 2 8 j μ ρ g k v v 1 g k i v 2 eqs 4 and 7 can be combined to obtain 9 k v μ a ρ g 10 k i 1 bg ω can be obtained by combining eqs 6 and 10 11 ω 1 bg k v α 2 to reduce the complexity of data visualization figures in this study used a double logarithmic coordinate system correspondingly logarithmic processing of universal relationship eq 6 was necessary due to the usage of a dual logarithmic coordinate system 12 log k i l o g ω α 2 l o g k v the value of ω can be directly determined by the intercept of the linear equation since ω is the main object and α is stable at 3 with no fluctuation zhou et al 2019 exponent α is defaults to 3 therefore eq 12 can be turned into eq 13 13 log k i l o g ω 3 2 l o g k v after using double logarithmic coordinates the power law form eq 6 can be transformed into a linear equation this method facilitates the analysis of subsequent experimental phenomena 2 2 indicator of non darcy flow traditionally reynolds number was used to describe the magnitude of inertial force in fluid flow albert and henny 1991 macini et al 2008 qian et al 2011a zeng and grigg 2006 14 re ρ v d μ vd υ where d m is the characteristic length however determination of whether the flow is darcy or non darcy according to the size of reynolds number is not very accurate zhou et al 2015 the critical reynolds number rec in this study is corresponding reynolds number when flow regime begins to change from laminar flow to turbulent flow qian et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 noted that in this study hydraulic diameter of a single fracture that is two times of aperture was taken as the characteristic length d quinn et al 2020 another dimensionless parameter fo forchheimer number can be used as a more accurate indicator of non darcy flow chen et al 2015 ghane et al 2014 ma and ruth 1993 zeng and grigg 2006 the forchheimer number fo was defined as the ratio of the nonlinear pressure drop to linear pressure drop in forchheimer s law 15 f o b v 2 av substituting eq 8 into eq 15 16 f o ρ v μ k v k i kv ki in eq 16 can be regarded as the characteristic length d bai et al 2010 generally kv ki is considered to be the onset of flow nonlinearity when the pressure drop caused by inertial force accounts for 10 of the total pressure drop javadi et al 2014 zeng and grigg 2006 zhou et al 2015 17 α b v 2 av b v 2 f o 1 f 0 where α is the non darcy effect factor and α 0 1 fo 0 11 represents the onset of flow nonlinearity it should be noted that the critical forchheimer number and critical reynolds number mentioned in this study are the onset of turbulent flow not the onset of flow nonlinearity non darcy flow scholars generally believed that fo 1 is the beginning of turbulent flow bai et al 2010 cherubini et al 2012 ruth and ma 1992 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental setup 3 1 1 artificial single fracture the schematic setup of the artificial single fractures is shown in fig 1 the main body of a single fracture was composed of two parallel plates made of plexiglass this study involved horizontal and vertical fractures please refer to supplementary material s1 for the detailed structures of the vertical and horizontal fractures rough and smooth fractures laboratory artificial fractures and fractures generated by numerical simulation please refer to tables 1 and table 2 for detailed information of these fractures as a special case the method of generating different roughness in artificial horizontal fractures is introduced here to simulate different roughness different convexities height of a small glass block of roughness elements small plexiglass blocks with different shapes and a well controlled fracture aperture were set finally four kinds of different relative roughness were generated relative roughness e convexity δ average aperture b four different relative roughness e 0 8 0 6 0 4 and 0 2 the cylinder and timer were used to calculate the flow rate q m3 s a centimeter ruler was used to measure the hydraulic head difference δh m between the stable water surface in inlet tank and outlet tank then δh was divided by the flow length l m to obtain the hydraulic gradient j j δh l δh and l are shown in fig 1 it should be noted that some physical models and corresponding experimental data have been published please refer to these references for the construction of these models chen et al 2011 qian et al 2007 2011a 2011b 2015 3 1 2 numerical simulation of single fracture the physical model fluid physical parameters setting of boundary conditions and governing equation of numerical experiment have been explained in detail zhang et al 2019 only some simple descriptions are introduced here physical model three roughness element shapes and densities were mainly set the roughness element shapes were a triangle rectangle and sine the roughness element density of each shape was a 4 5 and 6 respectively the convexity δ was set to 1 mm a structure diagram of the different roughness element densities is shown in fig 2 rectangular roughness elements with roughness elements densities of a 6 5 and 4 are shown as examples solver selection in the numerical experiment simulation software was fluent ansys inc the single precision two dimensional solver 2d was selected segregated solver was used to study incompressible flow model selection the k ε mergeformat model was selected and enhanced wall treatment was set boundary conditions four boundary conditions can be selected namely in out symmetry and wall the first two conditions were used in this study and the latter two conditions were default values the inlet fluid velocity was set according to different velocities and out was set as 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 non linear relationship between the hydraulic gradient and the average velocity experimental data in the form of hydraulic gradient j and velocity v were fitted by forchheimer equation eq 4 the fitting results presented in table 2 showed that whether for numerically simulated fractures or artificial fractures the j v curves fitted by forchheimer equation all behaved at a high regression coefficient r2 1 after using the calculation method described in section 2 2 the viscous and inertial permeabilities were obtained and displayed in the ergun form of forchheimer equation for subsequent analysis and discussion using the viscous permeability and inertial permeability as the parameters of viscous and inertial terms could intuitively reflect the hydraulic conductivity of a single fracture the fitting result proved that forchheimer model was suitable for describing the nonlinear flow in various fractured samples 4 2 quantitative model between viscous and inertial permeability in single fractures according to table 2 the viscous permeability and inertial permeability data of each single fracture were obtained for convenient calculation logarithm processing was performed on all the permeability data then these logarithmically processed data were fitted by eq 13 the fitting result is shown in fig 3 the linear relationship between the logarithms shown in fig 3 was restored an empirical quantitative model that can predict inertial permeability based on viscous permeability in a single fracture was obtained 17 k i ω k v 3 2 where ω is a scaling factor with unit m 2 ω 108 m 2 the lower limit is 106m 2 and upper limit is 1010 m 2 the quantitative model used in this study is similar to the universal relationship zhou et al 2019 however this empirical quantitative model is only applicable to single fractures 4 3 characterizing the scaling coefficient ω in the quantitative model 4 3 1 effect of media types on the fluctuation range of ω fluctuation of ω will directly affect the prediction results of inertial permeability thus determination of the accurate fluctuation range of ω is important for improving the accuracy and applicability of quantitative model to facilitate comparison the value of ω and its upper and lower boundaries in the universal relationship are shown in fig 3 it is clear that a certain difference exists between empirical model and universal relationship in the universal relationship ω 1010 m 2 has lower and upper limits of 107 m 2 and 1013 m 2 respectively for empirical model obtained in this study scaling factor ω 108 m 2 upper and lower limits were 1010 m 2 and 106 m 2 respectively the fluctuation range of ω in quantitative model 104 m 2 is generally smaller than that of the universal relationship 106 m 2 the universal relationship was obtained using a large number of data based on various geological porous media such as fracture network porous media fractured porous media and single fractures the scaling factor ω in the universal relationship was determined by the void space distribution pattern and local roughness therefore due to the large number of different types of a media for porous media alone there are many types and various natural effects such as weathering the combined effect of these factors might greatly affect the void space and local roughness and lead to large fluctuations of ω in universal relationship the quantitative model in this study was generated by artificial single fractures and a numerical simulation compared with other geological media there were fewer factors in artificial single fractures under stable laboratory conditions that could cause diversification of void space and local roughness thus it was speculated that media types may be the key factor controlling fluctuation range of ω to verify this speculation a logarithmic process was performed on more than 4000 sets of data collected by zhou et al 2019 these data were distinguished according to different types of media finally fig 4 was obtained as shown in fig 4 consistent with our speculation different types of media produced different fluctuation ranges of ω such as fracture networks 103 m 2 and porous media 106 m 2 in other words different types of media showed different fluctuation ranges of ω values this phenomenon proved the dependence of fluctuation range of ω on the type of medium the medium dependence of ω further proved the importance of proposing a quantitative model for a specific medium that can reduce the influence of other media characteristics on ω and improve the accuracy of inertial permeability prediction model therefore the reason for the smaller fluctuation range of ω in the quantitative model in this study is that a single type of medium was used 4 3 2 varying characteristics of the scaling coefficient ω zhou et al 2019 had mentioned that scaling factor ω in quantitative model was determined by the local surface roughness and void distribution pattern various uncertain factors in single fractures could lead to variability of these two physical foundations of ω thus leading to regular irregular changes of ω determination of influencing factors of scaling factor ω is of great significance for improving application of quantitative model therefore according to the physical basis of ω in the following sections factors that might affect the scaling factor ω are analyzed and disclosed corresponding to the varying characteristics within the whole fluctuation range of ω 4 3 2 1 effect of single fracture types on the varying characteristics of ω the fitting results of experimental data in fig 3 indicated that scaling factor was ω 107 964 m 2 significantly lower than ω 1010 m 2 in the universal relationship to explain this phenomenon a detailed analysis of various corresponding conditions of the data was conducted inspired by the data compiled by zhou et al 2019 it was found that all the single fracture experiments conducted in this study were based on artificial single fracture physical models including single fracture physical models generated by numerical simulations however it was found that most of single fracture data in the universal relationship were obtained through fractures generated by natural rocks generally the ultimate purpose of various artificial single fracture physical models built in laboratory is to simulate real fractures in nature at first for the convenience of calculation two smooth parallel plates were used to simulate single fractures bear 1972 brush and thomson 2011 although the smooth parallel plate fracture was the simplest and most ideal physical model it is difficult to form or exist in nature méheust and schmittbuhl 2001 later to consider the important effect of roughness some methods were used to make parallel plate rougher and make laboratory experiments closer to natural single fractures chen et al 2011 2017 brush and thomson 2011 qian et al 2011a 2011b 2011c although many high tech roughness characterization methods had been developed in recent years tatone 2010 due to the complexity of natural real fractures and various natural geological phenomena a physical model of artificial single fractures could not fully characterize the characteristics of natural real fractures such as real roughness tortuosity and void space as a result compared with real fractures no matter how complex the artificial single fracture was it was still considered to be an ideal model therefore it can be speculated that the reason why ω in fig 3 was smaller than that in the universal relationship was the limitation of artificial single fracture physical model to verify our speculation the natural rock fracture data and artificial fracture data in zhou et al 2019 were categorized and these data were rearranged according to the data visualization method described in section 2 2 finally fig 5 was assembled as shown in fig 5 ω of natural rock fracture data was 1010 819 m 2 and ω of artificial fractures was 108 129 m 2 the scaling factor ω of artificial fractures in zhou et al 2019 was also similar to experimental data fitting results in this study pattern 1 8 ω 108 m 2 this phenomenon coincided with our speculation the difference in ω between natural rock single fractures and artificial laboratory single fracture was very obvious up to 2 5 orders of magnitude it was considered that the factors that cause ω to change by more than two orders of magnitude were the main influencing factors of ω additionally the difference also proved that the difference between artificial laboratory single fracture model and real natural rock fractures still cannot be eliminated therefore above analysis showed that the physical limitations of artificial single fracture model indeed caused a smaller scaling factor ω in the quantitative model than that produced by natural fractures this conclusion is very important for practical application of the quantitative model between viscous permeability and inertial permeability 4 3 2 2 effect of roughness on the varying characteristics of ω as mentioned above relative roughness was one of the physical foundations for determining ω for smooth fractures fracture wall surface was smooth and flat which was the most ideal single fracture model in laboratory experiments on the contrary rough fractures that had uneven fracture surface was the most common pattern of naturally formed fractures and different asperity heights on the fracture surface had large impact on the real area of surface contact tortuosity and void geometries brown 1987 liu et al 2016 thus it was reasonable to speculate that the presence of roughness would affect ω to verify whether the above speculation was reasonable and to disclose the corresponding varying characteristics of ω data from typical artificial fracture experiments conducted by other scholars were also collected al yaarubi et al 2013 ji et al 2008 lee et al 2010 2013 roy and singh 2016 wang et al 2010 qin et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 for smooth fractures ω obtained by the quantitative model was 108 222 m 2 and for rough fractures ω 107 549 m 2 which was lower than that for smooth fractures compared with smooth fractures the roughness of fractures led to reduction of ω however the effect of roughness on ω was less than 0 6 orders of magnitude which was not very significant therefore roughness was not the main influencing factor of ω the relative roughness e which was used in this study to quantify roughness could not be used to consider the influence of the geometry of roughness element on ω therefore in the following subsections the influences of different size of roughness are discussed 4 3 2 3 effect of different roughness element shapes on the varying characteristics of ω in the previous section it was proved that roughness affected ω some high tech methods to characterize and quantify the roughness of single fractures have been proposed including jrc profiles statistical methods etc berkowitz 2002 tatone 2010 to date there is no uniform standard for the quantification of different roughness therefore characterization of roughness is a very subjective issue to further study the influence of roughness on ω quantification of roughness is performed in this section using fluent software the roughness in pattern 6 7 and 8 were quantified by characterizing different roughness element shapes roughness element densities and convexities theoretically different roughness element shapes are directly related to the different void geometries of fractures which are also a physical basis for determining ω thus it was necessary to explore whether different shapes of roughness elements affected the scaling factor ω numerical simulation data with different roughness element shapes were processed into fig 7 it should be noted that due to the precise computer control the flow regime and inertial effect in each computed fracture could be controlled at the same magnitude so the numerical simulation data were very beneficial for revealing the varying characteristics of ω under a single factor as shown in fig 7 ω generated by rectangular roughness elements data ω 107 564 m 2 was larger than that generated by triangular ω 107 057 m 2 and sinusoidal ω 107 218 m 2 roughness element data to analyze this phenomenon previous studies are referenced combined with previous studies on the influence of roughness element shape chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 it was found that different shapes of roughness elements had different effect on fluid flow furthermore the greater the angle between tangent direction at the beginning of roughness element and streamline direction induced larger turbulence effect according to the fitting results shown in fig 6 there was a positive correlation between the angle or turbulence effect and ω the size of the included angle was a re c a sin a tri mergeformat the corresponding turbulence effect was t re c t sin t tri mergeformat and the corresponding magnitude of scaling factor ω was ω re c ω sin ω tri mergeformat where arec represents the angle between the tangent direction at the beginning of rectangular roughness element and streamline direction trec represents turbulence effect induced by rectangular roughness element ω rec represents the scaling factor obtained by using the quantitative model to fit permeability data of rectangular roughness element fractures recursively in other words a roughness element that formed a larger angle with the streamline and induced a greater turbulence effect on fluid flow would produce a larger value of ω the influence of different roughness element shapes on ω was approximately 0 5 orders of magnitude which showed that different roughness element shapes were a minor influencing factor of ω it should be noted that in the numerical simulation experiment a higher distribution density a of roughness elements induced a smaller average aperture and lager relative roughness although the same roughness element shape data with different rough element densities in fig 7 were not emphasized it was clear that different size of roughness had a relatively small effect on ω 100 3 m 2 some previous studies have mentioned that inertial permeability non darcy permeability for a given medium is considered to be a parameter constant that only depends on the characteristics of medium and it is similar to viscous permeability which is independent of fluid tek et al 1962 innocentini et al 1999 rust and cashman 2004 bai et al 2010 ranjith and viete 2011 however our conclusion indicated that different magnitude of turbulence effect induced by different roughness element shapes causes ω to vary indicating that the fluctuating ω might further affect inertial permeability this phenomenon might be important evidence for the relationship between inertial permeability and fluid properties 4 3 2 4 effect of fracture aperture on the varying characteristics of ω it is clear that the aperture of fractures directly reflects the void space detwiler et al 2003 zhou et al 2015 and relative roughness of a rough single fracture zhang et al 2019 theoretically as the average aperture increased decreased the relative roughness and void space of single fractures changed simultaneously which might contribute to the varying ω therefore as an influencing factor that might have a strong impact on ω the influence of aperture on ω and its varying characteristics should be studied according to numerical simulation results of different apertures pattern 6 8 fig 8 was obtained three sets of fracture data with different fracture apertures and different roughness element shapes showed that ω obviously decreased with the increasing average aperture when the fracture aperture increased from 1 mm to 6 mm the magnitude of ω decreased by 0 5 1 25 orders of magnitude which proved that average aperture indeed had an impact on the scaling factor ω and that the aperture was inversely proportional to ω compared to roughness and different roughness elements shapes the effect of fracture aperture on ω was obvious 4 3 2 5 effect of the inertial effect on the varying characteristics of ω based on the results described in section 4 3 2 3 it has been proved that different roughness element shapes would affect varying characteristics of ω by generating different turbulence effects since the numerical simulation method could strictly control the magnitude of inertial force the effects of different flow regimes and the inertial effect were neglected the inertial effects have an important influence on fluid flow in a single fracture and the phenomena induced by different inertial effects had always been a hot issue studied by scholars lacey 2016 zhou et al 2015 nowamooz et al 2009 thus in this section whether different magnitudes of inertial effects affect ω and its varying characteristics is analyzed based on laboratory experiment data pattern 1 4 first different inertial force caused different flow regimes to quantify inertial force two dimensionless parameters were used here due to the limitations of reynolds number mentioned in section 2 3 using critical reynolds number to judge inertial effect of flow might be not accurate in fractures thus to quantify inertial effect while taking the limitations of reynolds number into account the forchheimer number fo was also used to avoid the limitations of reynolds number in describing inertial effects non darcy effect factor α in eq 17 at maximum flow velocity was used to identify the magnitude of inertial effect in fractures that without varying flow regimes then it was necessary to accurately describe flow regimes based on classic forchheimer equation eq 2 different flow regime in fractures could be easily identified when jv ji the viscous force was dominant and the flow regime was laminar flow when ji jv flow regime was the transition zone from laminar to turbulent and flow was non darcy flow when ji jv the inertial force was completely dominant and flow was turbulent to facilitate calculation jv ji was normalized by jv j ji j above method refers to qian et al 2011c zhang et al 2019 based on calculation method described in section 2 2 kv ki could be obtained thus the distribution of jv and ji under different fo values could be obtained through the experimentally measured v finally figs 9 12 was obtained for all the fractures in pattern1 4 when fo 1 there was almost no inertial effect ji had a small proportion in j when fo gradually increased to 1 the contribution of inertial effect to total pressure drop gradually increased when fo was greater than 1 ji jv non darcy flow occurred and a larger inertial effect would lead to a transition of the flow regime from table 3 it is clear that critical forchheimer number when ji jv the corresponding fo is the critical forchheimer number calculated from permeability could also be considered to be 1 including the predicted fo the prediction curves are only shown in fig 9b and fig 9c which is consistent with previous studies cherubini et al 2012 ruth and ma 1992 this result also proved that kv ki could be used as the characteristic length to identify flow regime in a single fracture however it was shown in table 3 that for critical reynolds number in a horizontal rough single fracture there was no definite value since rec is proportional to the aperture eq 14 a larger aperture would induce a larger rec therefore it can be speculated from the prediction curves that under same aperture the rec of rough fractures should be smaller than that of smooth fractures this phenomenon shows that the tortuosity and roughness of a single fracture would make fluid flow in a rough fracture more prone to flow regime transitions than that in a smooth fracture the most important phenomenon shown in figs 9 12 is that for fractures with transition behaviour from laminar flow to transition zone a larger inertia effect the corresponding ω is significantly lower than that for fractures with laminar flow compared with the ω in fractures with laminar flow ω in fractures with a transitional zone is reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude at most as the flow regime was directly related to the magnitude of inertial effect it could also be considered that ω decreased significantly with the increasing inertial effect in previous studies it has been proved that ω in numerical simulation fractures decreases with the fracture aperture when the flow regimes and inertial effect are identical however the evidence provided in table 3 is sufficient to prove that a fracture with a larger aperture produces a larger ω value under the same flow regime which seems contrary to the conclusion presented in section 4 3 2 4 for numerical simulation results pattern 6 8 magnitudes of inertial effect were basically same while for artificial fracture pattern1 4 in spite of having the same flow regimes the inertial effect could not be precisely controlled thus it was speculated that the reason why the effect of aperture in a numerically simulated fracture on ω was different from that in an artificial fracture was the different inertial effects to explain this contradiction non darcy effect factor α which represents the magnitude of inertial effect in each artificial fracture actually α ji j was carefully analyzed and obtained as shown in fig 13 it was found that ω was inversely proportional to the inertial effect and when the influence of aperture and inertia effect simultaneously occurred in a single fracture the following phenomena occured a fracture with larger aperture should have a smaller ω according to the conclusion presented in section 4 3 2 4 but due to the small inertial effect it produced a larger ω value therefore based on the above analysis it was considered that when the aperture and inertial effect change simultaneously the impact of fracture could be ignored section 4 3 2 2 showed that roughness affected ω in fractures as well however compared with the significant impacts of flow regime and aperture on ω the slight impact of roughness did not contradict the conclusion drawn in this section it should also be noted that the conclusions presented in section 4 3 2 3 were not contradictory to the conclusions drawn in this section since the inertial effects and turbulence effects were not consistent larger inertial effects did not necessarily lead to the occurrence of turbulence effects in summary the influence of aperture and roughness on ω did not contradict the conclusion drawn in this section when considering the combined effects of varying inertial effect aperture and roughness the inertial effect was the dominant factor therefore as a main factor inertial effect would produce a significant impact on the scaling factor ω and the inertia effect was inversely proportional to ω it should be noted that a varying ω caused by different inertial effects also indicated that the predicted value of inertial permeability would change with inertial effect similar to the influence of different roughness element shape although these two conclusions are different it is indicated that a relationship may be existed between inertial permeability and fluid characteristics which is different from previous study bai et al 2010 rust and cashman 2004 ranjith and viete 2011 4 3 2 6 effect of horizontal fracture and vertical fracture on the varying characteristics of ω during the data collection process it was also found that the distribution of data points generated by vertical fractures and horizontal fractures showed different trends the data points of vertical fractures were mostly greater than the data points of horizontal fractures as the intercept in eq 12 could directly represent ω it was reasonably speculated that different direction of fractures might affect ω therefore experimental data from different sources were separated according to different fracture direction horizontal and vertical as shown in fig 14 the ω of vertical fracture data ω in this study is 108 606 m 2 ω of the reference data is 1011 022 m 2 was obviously larger than that of horizontal fracture data ω in this study ω 107 491 m 2 ω of the reference data is ω 1010 204 m 2 undoubtedly the effects of horizontal fractures and vertical fractures on ω were different and the experiment data from two different sources showed same trend it should be noted that difference between the ω values of the same horizontal fractures or vertical fractures in this study and reference could be explained by the conclusion presented in section 4 3 2 1 although specific conditions such as roughness inertia effect aperture etc of each data were not considered here these data were sufficient to prove that the influence on ω generated by horizontal and vertical fractures was different consequently the fitting results proved that horizontal fracture direction would lead to a reduction of ω compared with vertical fractures the influence of horizontal fractures caused a reduction of ω of 0 8 to 1 1 orders of magnitude in previous studies the influence of different fracture directions horizontal and vertical fractures were the two extreme inclinations of the fracture direction shown in supplementary material s1 on the water flow is rarely mentioned and in most case this influence on fluid flow is basically ignored for example by using the dupuit assumption the vertical velocity induced by gravity could be ignored qian et al 2015 theoretically due to the presence of gravity the flow in a vertical fracture should be different from that in a horizontal fracture regarding the effect of gravity some scholars have considered the effect of gravity on fluid flow in porous media celik et al 2016 nakayama 1992 but gravity is always ignored when linear or nonlinear equations are used to describe flow in single fractures chen et al 2011 qian et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 however the above statistical analysis indicated that the scaling factor ω would be affected by horizontal or vertical fractures considering that ω was determined by the void space distribution pattern and relative roughness a varying void space distribution pattern and relative roughness the varying ω might further affect fluid flow thus it was necessary to consider the possible influence of the fracture direction when conducting laboratory experiments in summary the fracture types and inertia effect were the main factors affecting the scaling factor ω in empirical quantitative model under the influence of these factors ω varied at most more than 2 orders of magnitude other minor factors were the average aperture roughness roughness element shape and difference between horizontal and vertical fractures 5 conclusions in this study fluid flow in different single fractures was investigated and an empirical quantitative model of the relationship between viscous and inertial permeabilities in single fractures was obtained this study might be the first to propose factors that affect the scaling coefficient ω in the empirical power law quantitative model and to disclose the varying characteristics of ω under influencing factors the main conclusions of this study as followings 1 the forchheimer model could effectively describe the nonlinear flow in almost all types of single fractures in this study such as smooth rough horizontal or vertical artificial single fractures and fractures generated by a numerical simulation 2 an empirical quantitative model for predicting inertial permeability based on the viscous permeability in single fracture was obtained k i ω k v 3 2 mergeformat where ω 108 m 2 the lower limit is 106 m 2 and upper limit is 1010 m 2 3 the fluctuation degree of ω is related to the number of media types and more types of media lead to a larger ω fluctuation range different factors affected the value of ω the main factors were fracture type and inertia effect ω produced by artificial single fractures was lower than that in natural rock fractures ω was inversely proportional to the magnitude of inertial effect and under the effects of roughness aperture and inertia the inertial effect played the dominant role other minor factors were roughness average aperture roughness element shape and fracture direction the presence of roughness caused ω to decrease roughness element shapes that induced a greater turbulence effect on fluid flow produced a larger ω the average aperture was inversely proportional to ω and ω produced by horizontal fractures was smaller than that produced by vertical fractures although the applicability of inertial permeability prediction model proposed in this study will be limited due to the inconsistency of the roughness quantification method and the fracture aperture range it is undeniable that this study also has a certain practical applicability based on the quantitative models and characterization of the influencing factors the degree of non darcy effect which had a significant impact on the production rate of petroleum gas was quantified additionally the model proposed in this study further verified the applicability of the forchheimer model in single fractured media and improved the accuracy of the flow rate prediction in groundwater engineering credit authorship

4971,quantitative analysis of flow in fractures is an important issue for hydrogeological and geological engineering in this study forchheimer models involving viscous permeability kv and inertial permeability ki were developed for groundwater flow in different single fractures or fractured media based on experiments and numerical simulation the relationship between viscous permeability and inertial permeability in a single fracture was disclosed and an important parameter ω the scaling coefficient ω ω ki kv 3 2 was characterized the results showed 1 the forchheimer model fit the non linear fluid flow in almost all types of artificial single fractures that investigated in this study 2 inertial permeability could be predicted by viscous permeability based on the empirical quantitative model k i ω k v 3 2 mergeformat ω 108 m 2 3 the fluctuation range of ω was related to the number of medium types more medium types would induce a larger fluctuation range artificial single fractures produced a smaller ω than that in natural rock fractures ω was inversely proportional to the magnitude of the inertial effect roughness and average aperture the roughness element shape that caused greater turbulence effects led to larger ω and single fractures placed vertically produced larger ω than fractures placed horizontally in addition the ratio of viscous permeability to inertial permeability kv ki in fractures could be used as the characteristic length of forchheimer number fo by characterizing scaling factor ω the accuracy of the quantitative model could be improved and basis for further quantification of non darcy flow was established keywords viscous permeability inertial permeability scaling coefficient single fracture non linear flow forchheimer model 1 introduction fractures and fracture networks are ubiquitous throughout the crust and have been studied in many geological engineering chen et al 2015 2017 qian et al 2011a 2011b ranjith and viete 2011 zimmerman et al 2004 however quantitative analysis of flow in fractures and fracture networks remains one of the most challenging problems in hydrogeology and engineering geology traditionally fluid flow in fractured media is described based on darcy s law in the average sense in darcy s law j v k j hydraulic gradient v average velocity of fluid k hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity k depends on the properties of the medium and characteristics of the fluid and it has been generally regarded to be a constant in a geological medium by applying darcy s law to parallel plate model a widely used equation that is the cubic law cl was obtained qian et al 2011a brush and thomson 2011 because of the strong heterogeneity of fractures it has been shown that darcy s law is not always suitable forchheimer 1901 nakayama 1992 qian et al 2015 wang et al 2017 and lcl also overestimated flow rate in real fractures wang and cardenas 2017 therefore to characterize the flow that darcy s law cannot describe nonlinear equations had been proposed i e the izbash equation izbash 1931 watanabe 1982 wen et al 2013 and forchheimer equation forchheimer 1901 among these nonlinear equations whether for an actual fluid production process or a laboratory experiment the forchheimer equation j av bv 2 a viscosity coefficient b inertial coefficient j hydraulic gradient v average velocity of fluid has aroused great interest of scholars mathias and wen 2015 wang et al 2017 since the forchheimer equation was proposed much research on its validation and theoretical background had been carried out chen et al 2015 irmay 1958 ruth and ma 1992 to quantify non linear flow by the forchheimer equation determination of the coefficients a and b is necessary in many practical applications however it is difficult to determine these two coefficients through experiments chen et al 2015 thus scholars have derived many parameter expressions to predict these forchheimer coefficients cornell and katz 1953 li et al 2017 zimmerman et al 2004 as a parameter reflecting the characteristics of fractured media viscous permeability has also been used in parameter expression of hydraulic conductivity k and the forchheimer coefficient a albert and henny 1991 cherubini et al 2012 however due to the complexity of inertial force and technical limitations after the wide use of viscosity permeability the concept of inertial permeability was firstly proposed by ergun 1952 ergun 1952 also incorporated the concept of inertial permeability into the parameter expressions of forchheimer coefficients b after that researchers began to use forchheimer equation with inertial permeability that is the ergun form of forchheimer equation to study the fluid flow in volcanic magma and other porous media with a complex pore structure degruyter et al 2010 shahin et al 2017 however studies on the expression of the inertia coefficient b by using inertial permeability in a single fracture have rarely been reported although permeability has been incorporated into fluid equations the measurement of permeability became a new problem scholars have developed some high tech methods to accurately predict viscous permeability mueller et al 2005 sukop et al 2013 sun et al 2014 however it has been noted that no method can directly measure inertial permeability to solve this problem some scholars have developed more refined parameter expressions of inertial permeability based on extensive laboratory methods for example the controlled column tracer test ctt experiments wang et al 2019 for example degruyter et al 2012 used the throat vesicle ratio ftb vesicle radius rb tortuosity index m and friction coefficient fo to express the inertial permeability ki of silicic magmas bai et al 2010 used bubble diameter d to describe non darcy permeability of vesicular stromboli basaltic glass and the efficient porosity p and average pore diameter d were used to calculate inertial permeability of granular material in packed columns and ceramic foams albert and henny 1991 ergun 1952 it should be noted that these empirical expressions of inertial permeability are based on porous media experiments thus it is still unclear whether these parameters describing porous media structure can be used in fractures moreover studies on the parameter expression of the inertial permeability in a single fracture are insufficient thus the unpredictability of inertial permeability in fractures has hindered the quantitative analysis of flow in fractures to solve the unpredictability of inertial permeability zhou et al 2019 obtained a universal relationship between viscous permeability and inertial permeability ki ωkv α where ω is scaling factor and α is the exponent of viscous permeability by sorting and analyzing more than 4000 data points from other scholars and laboratory experimental data although this empirical relationship was considered suitable for all geological media including fractured media fracture network and single fracture the scaling factor ω showed large fluctuations the maximum fluctuation was 6 orders of magnitude which had a negative impact on the accurate prediction of inertial permeability simultaneously due to the versatility of this empirical relationship it is still unclear whether the properties of different media such as the porosity of porous media will affect ω these problems may induce significant errors when using this quantitative model to predict inertial permeability of other media especially the inertial permeability of single fractures however a quantitative model only suitable for predicting inertial permeability of a single medium has not been proposed yet and revealing the influencing factors and corresponding varying characteristics of ω is important for more accurate prediction of inertial permeability although it has already mentioned that the scaling factor ω can be determined by local surface roughness and void distribution pattern zhou et al 2019 the exact influencing factors and corresponding varying characteristics are still unclear the purpose of this study is to 1 analyze the non linear relationship between the hydraulic gradient and average velocity in different forms of single fractures by incorporating viscous permeability kv and inertial permeability ki 2 obtain an empirical quantitative model of relationship between viscous and inertial permeability in single fracture and 3 disclose the varying characteristics of scaling coefficient ω between viscous and inertial permeabilities under different influencing factors 2 theoretical background 2 1 fluid equation in a single fracture the description of flow in fractures was based on darcy s law darcy 1856 which was initially suitable for describing fluids in porous media 1 j 1 k v where k m d is the hydraulic conductivity and j is the hydraulic gradient v m s is the average velocity of fluid hubbert 1940 defined permeability and found a relationship between permeability and hydraulic conductivity 2 k k ρ g μ where k m2 is the permeability intrinsic permeability viscous permeability darcy permeability depending on the characteristics of the media ρ kg m3 is the fluid density g m s2 is the acceleration induced by gravity μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity of fluid kinematic viscosity coefficient υ defaults to 1 2028 10 6 m2 s dynamic viscosity μ can be obtained by μ υρ substituting eq 2 into 1 gives 3 j μ ρ g k v since then the concept of viscous permeability has been introduced into hydrodynamic equations forchheimer 1901 considered the influence of viscous force and inertial force when studying fluid motion and obtained the classic non linear equation 4 j a v b v 2 j v j i where a s m is the coefficient of the viscosity term b s2 m2 is the coefficient of inertia term jv represents the pressure drop induced by viscous force ji represents pressure drop induced by inertial force the concepts of inertial permeability which was defined by ergun 1952 was used to express inertia coefficient b in forchheimer equation 5 dp dx μ k v v ρ k i v 2 where dp dx pa m is the pressure drop along the x direction kv m2 is viscous permeability darcy permeability and ki m is inertial permeability non darcy permeability eq 6 was developed by zhou et al 2019 to show the relationship between viscous and inertial permeabilities 6 k i ω k v α 2 where ω is the scaling coefficient in m 1 α ω 1010 m 2 with lower and upper bounds of 107 m 2 and 1013 m 2 respectively and α is the dimensionless exponent with α 3 calculation of permeability data and ω 7 dp dx ρ g j μ k v v ρ k i v 2 8 j μ ρ g k v v 1 g k i v 2 eqs 4 and 7 can be combined to obtain 9 k v μ a ρ g 10 k i 1 bg ω can be obtained by combining eqs 6 and 10 11 ω 1 bg k v α 2 to reduce the complexity of data visualization figures in this study used a double logarithmic coordinate system correspondingly logarithmic processing of universal relationship eq 6 was necessary due to the usage of a dual logarithmic coordinate system 12 log k i l o g ω α 2 l o g k v the value of ω can be directly determined by the intercept of the linear equation since ω is the main object and α is stable at 3 with no fluctuation zhou et al 2019 exponent α is defaults to 3 therefore eq 12 can be turned into eq 13 13 log k i l o g ω 3 2 l o g k v after using double logarithmic coordinates the power law form eq 6 can be transformed into a linear equation this method facilitates the analysis of subsequent experimental phenomena 2 2 indicator of non darcy flow traditionally reynolds number was used to describe the magnitude of inertial force in fluid flow albert and henny 1991 macini et al 2008 qian et al 2011a zeng and grigg 2006 14 re ρ v d μ vd υ where d m is the characteristic length however determination of whether the flow is darcy or non darcy according to the size of reynolds number is not very accurate zhou et al 2015 the critical reynolds number rec in this study is corresponding reynolds number when flow regime begins to change from laminar flow to turbulent flow qian et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 noted that in this study hydraulic diameter of a single fracture that is two times of aperture was taken as the characteristic length d quinn et al 2020 another dimensionless parameter fo forchheimer number can be used as a more accurate indicator of non darcy flow chen et al 2015 ghane et al 2014 ma and ruth 1993 zeng and grigg 2006 the forchheimer number fo was defined as the ratio of the nonlinear pressure drop to linear pressure drop in forchheimer s law 15 f o b v 2 av substituting eq 8 into eq 15 16 f o ρ v μ k v k i kv ki in eq 16 can be regarded as the characteristic length d bai et al 2010 generally kv ki is considered to be the onset of flow nonlinearity when the pressure drop caused by inertial force accounts for 10 of the total pressure drop javadi et al 2014 zeng and grigg 2006

and critical reynolds number mentioned in this study are the onset of turbulent flow not the onset of flow nonlinearity non darcy flow scholars generally believed that fo 1 is the beginning of turbulent flow bai et al 2010 cherubini et al 2012 ruth and ma 1992 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental setup 3 1 1 artificial single fracture the schematic setup of the artificial single

been published please refer to these references for the construction of these models chen et al 2011 qian et al 2007 2011a 2011b 2015 3 1 2 numerical simulation of single fracture the physical model fluid physical parameters setting of boundary conditions and governing equation of numerical experiment have been explained in detail zhang et al 2019 only some simple descriptions are introduced here physical model three roughness element shapes and densities were mainly set the roughness element shapes were a triangle rectangle and sine the roughness element density of each shape was a 4 5 and 6 respectively the convexity δ was set to 1 mm a structure diagram of the different roughness element densities is shown in fig 2 rectangular roughness elements with roughness elements densities of a 6 5 and 4 are shown as examples solver selection in the numerical experiment simulation software was fluent ansys inc the single precision two dimensional solver 2d was selected segregated solver was used to study incompressible flow model selection the k ε mergeformat model was selected and enhanced wall treatment was set boundary conditions four boundary conditions can be selected namely in out symmetry and wall the first two conditions were used in this study and the latter two conditions were default values the inlet fluid velocity was set according to different velocities and out was set as 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 non linear relationship between the hydraulic gradient and the average velocity experimental data in the form of hydraulic gradient j and velocity v were fitted by forchheimer equation eq 4 the fitting results presented in table 2 showed that whether for numerically simulated fractures or artificial fractures the j v curves fitted by forchheimer equation all behaved at a high regression coefficient r2 1 after using the calculation method described in section 2 2 the viscous and inertial permeabilities were obtained and displayed in the ergun form of forchheimer equation for subsequent analysis and discussion using the viscous permeability and inertial permeability as the parameters of viscous and inertial terms could intuitively reflect the hydraulic conductivity of a single fracture the fitting result proved that forchheimer model was suitable for describing the nonlinear flow in various fractured samples 4 2 quantitative model between viscous and inertial permeability in single fractures according to table 2 the viscous permeability and inertial permeability data of each single fracture were obtained for convenient calculation logarithm processing was performed on all the permeability data then these logarithmically processed data were fitted by eq 13 the fitting result is shown in fig 3 the linear relationship between the logarithms shown in fig 3 was restored an empirical quantitative model that can predict inertial permeability based on viscous permeability in a single fracture was obtained 17 k i ω k v 3 2 where ω is a scaling factor with unit m 2 ω 108 m 2 the lower limit is 106m 2 and upper limit is 1010 m 2 the quantitative model used in this study is similar to the universal relationship zhou et al 2019 however this empirical quantitative model is only applicable to single fractures 4 3 characterizing the scaling coefficient ω in the quantitative model 4 3 1 effect of media types on the fluctuation range of ω fluctuation of ω will directly affect the prediction results of inertial permeability thus determination of the accurate fluctuation range of ω is important for improving the accuracy and applicability of quantitative model to facilitate comparison the value of ω and its upper and lower boundaries in the universal relationship are shown in fig 3 it is clear that a certain difference exists between empirical model and universal relationship in the universal relationship ω 1010 m 2 has lower and upper limits of 107 m 2 and 1013 m 2 respectively for empirical model obtained in this study scaling factor ω 108 m 2 upper and lower limits were 1010 m 2 and 106 m 2 respectively the fluctuation range of ω in quantitative model 104 m 2 is generally smaller than that of the universal relationship 106 m 2 the universal relationship was obtained using a large number of data based on various geological porous media such as fracture network porous media fractured porous media and single fractures the scaling factor ω in the universal relationship was determined by the void space distribution pattern and local roughness therefore due to the large number of different types of a media for porous media alone there are many types and various natural effects such as weathering the combined effect of these factors might greatly affect the void space and local roughness and lead to large fluctuations of ω in universal relationship the quantitative model in this study was generated by artificial single fractures and a numerical simulation compared with other geological media there were fewer factors in artificial single fractures under stable laboratory conditions that could cause diversification of void space and local roughness thus it was speculated that media types may be the key factor controlling fluctuation range of ω to verify this speculation a logarithmic process was performed on more than 4000 sets of data collected by zhou et al 2019 these data were distinguished according to different types of media finally fig 4 was obtained as shown in fig 4 consistent with our speculation different types of media produced different fluctuation ranges of ω such as fracture networks 103 m 2 and porous media 106 m 2 in other words different types of media showed different fluctuation ranges of ω values this phenomenon proved the dependence of fluctuation range of ω on the type of medium the medium dependence of ω further proved the importance of proposing a quantitative model for a specific medium that can reduce the influence of other media characteristics on ω and improve the accuracy of inertial permeability prediction model therefore the reason for the smaller fluctuation range of ω in the quantitative model in this study is that a single type of medium was used 4 3 2 varying characteristics of the scaling coefficient ω zhou et al 2019 had mentioned that scaling factor ω in quantitative model was determined by the local surface roughness and void distribution pattern various uncertain factors in single fractures could lead to variability of these two physical foundations of ω thus leading to regular irregular changes of ω determination of influencing factors of scaling factor ω is of great significance for improving application of quantitative model therefore according to the physical basis of ω in the following sections factors that might affect the scaling factor ω are analyzed and disclosed corresponding to the varying characteristics within the whole fluctuation range of ω 4 3 2 1 effect of single fracture types on the varying characteristics of ω the fitting results of experimental data in fig 3 indicated that scaling factor was ω 107 964 m 2 significantly lower than ω 1010 m 2 in the universal relationship to explain this phenomenon a detailed analysis of various corresponding conditions of the data was conducted inspired by the data compiled by zhou et al 2019 it was found that all the single fracture experiments conducted in this study were based on artificial single fracture physical models including single fracture physical models generated by numerical simulations however it was found that most of single fracture data in the universal relationship were obtained through fractures generated by natural rocks generally the ultimate purpose of various artificial single fracture physical models built in laboratory is to simulate real fractures in nature at first for the convenience of calculation two smooth parallel plates were used to simulate single fractures bear 1972 brush and thomson 2011 although the smooth parallel plate fracture was the simplest and most ideal physical model it is difficult to form or exist in nature méheust and schmittbuhl 2001 later to consider the important effect of roughness some methods were used to make parallel plate rougher and make laboratory experiments closer to natural single fractures chen et al 2011 2017 brush and thomson 2011 qian et al 2011a 2011b 2011c although many high tech roughness characterization methods had been developed in recent years tatone 2010 due to the complexity of natural real fractures and various natural geological phenomena a physical model of artificial single fractures could not fully characterize the characteristics of natural real fractures such as real roughness tortuosity and void space as a result compared with real fractures no matter how complex the artificial single fracture was it was still considered to be an ideal model therefore it can be speculated that the reason why ω in fig 3 was smaller than that in the universal relationship was the limitation of artificial single fracture physical model to verify our speculation the natural rock fracture data and artificial fracture data in zhou et al 2019 were categorized and these data were rearranged according to the data visualization method described in section 2 2 finally fig 5 was assembled as shown in fig 5 ω of natural rock fracture data was 1010 819 m 2 and ω of artificial fractures was 108 129 m 2 the scaling factor ω of artificial fractures in zhou et al 2019 was also similar to experimental data fitting results in this study pattern 1 8 ω 108 m 2 this phenomenon coincided with our speculation the difference in ω between natural rock single fractures and artificial laboratory single fracture was very obvious up to 2 5 orders of magnitude it was considered that the factors that cause ω to change by more than two orders of magnitude were the main influencing factors of ω additionally the difference also proved that the difference between artificial laboratory single fracture model and real natural rock fractures still cannot be eliminated therefore above analysis showed that the physical limitations of artificial single fracture model indeed caused a smaller scaling factor ω in the quantitative model than that produced by natural fractures this conclusion is very important for practical application of the quantitative model between viscous permeability and inertial permeability 4 3 2 2 effect of roughness on the varying characteristics of ω as mentioned above relative roughness was one of the physical foundations for determining ω for smooth fractures fracture wall surface was smooth and flat which was the most ideal single fracture model in laboratory experiments on the contrary rough fractures that had uneven fracture surface was the most common pattern of naturally formed fractures and different asperity heights on the fracture surface had large impact on the real area of surface contact tortuosity and void geometries brown 1987 liu et al 2016 thus it was reasonable to speculate that the presence of roughness would affect ω to verify whether the above speculation was reasonable and to disclose the corresponding varying characteristics of ω data from typical artificial fracture experiments conducted by other scholars were also collected al yaarubi et al 2013 ji et al 2008 lee et al 2010 2013 roy and singh 2016 wang et al 2010 qin et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 for smooth fractures ω obtained by the quantitative model was 108 222 m 2 and for rough fractures ω 107 549 m 2 which was lower than that for smooth fractures compared with smooth fractures the roughness of fractures led to reduction of ω however the effect of roughness on ω was less than 0 6 orders of magnitude which was not very significant therefore roughness was not the main influencing factor of ω the relative roughness e which was used in this study to quantify roughness could not be used to consider the influence of the geometry of roughness element on ω therefore in the following subsections the influences of different size of roughness are discussed 4 3 2 3 effect of different roughness element shapes on the varying characteristics of ω in the previous section it was proved that roughness affected ω some high tech methods to characterize and quantify the roughness of single fractures have been proposed including jrc profiles statistical methods etc berkowitz 2002 tatone 2010 to date there is no uniform standard for the quantification of different roughness therefore characterization of roughness is a very subjective issue to further study the influence of roughness on ω quantification of roughness is performed in this section using fluent software the roughness in pattern 6 7 and 8 were quantified by characterizing different roughness element shapes roughness element densities and convexities theoretically different roughness element shapes are directly related to the different void geometries of fractures which are also a physical basis for determining ω thus it was necessary to explore whether different shapes of roughness elements affected the scaling factor ω numerical simulation data with different roughness element shapes were processed into fig 7 it should be noted that due to the precise computer control the flow regime and inertial effect in each computed fracture could be controlled at the same magnitude so the numerical simulation data were very beneficial for revealing the varying characteristics of ω under a single factor as shown in fig 7 ω generated by rectangular roughness elements data ω 107 564 m 2 was larger than that generated by triangular ω 107 057 m 2 and sinusoidal ω 107 218 m 2 roughness element data to analyze this phenomenon previous studies are referenced combined with previous studies on the influence of roughness element shape chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 it was found that different shapes of roughness elements had different effect on fluid flow furthermore the greater the angle between tangent direction at the beginning of roughness element and streamline direction induced larger turbulence effect according to the fitting results shown in fig 6 there was a positive correlation between the angle or turbulence effect and ω the size of the included angle was a re c a sin a tri mergeformat the corresponding turbulence effect was t re c t sin t tri mergeformat and the corresponding magnitude of scaling factor ω was ω re c ω sin ω tri mergeformat where arec represents the angle between the tangent direction at the beginning of rectangular roughness element and streamline direction trec represents turbulence effect induced by rectangular roughness element ω rec represents the scaling factor obtained by using the quantitative model to fit permeability data of rectangular roughness element fractures recursively in other words a roughness element that formed a larger angle with the streamline and induced a greater turbulence effect on fluid flow would produce a larger value of ω the influence of different roughness element shapes on ω was approximately 0 5 orders of magnitude which showed that different roughness element shapes were a minor influencing factor of ω it should be noted that in the numerical simulation experiment a higher distribution density a of roughness elements induced a smaller average aperture and lager relative roughness although the same roughness element shape data with different rough element densities in fig 7 were not emphasized it was clear that different size of roughness had a relatively small effect on ω 100 3 m 2 some previous studies have mentioned that inertial permeability non darcy permeability for a given medium is considered to be a parameter constant that only depends on the characteristics of medium and it is similar to viscous permeability which is independent of fluid tek et al 1962 innocentini et al 1999 rust and cashman 2004 bai et al 2010 ranjith and viete 2011 however our conclusion indicated that different magnitude of turbulence effect induced by different roughness element shapes causes ω to vary indicating that the fluctuating ω might further affect inertial permeability this phenomenon might be important evidence for the relationship between inertial permeability and fluid properties 4 3 2 4 effect of fracture aperture on the varying characteristics of ω it is clear that the aperture of fractures directly reflects the void space detwiler et al 2003 zhou et al 2015 and relative roughness of a rough single fracture zhang et al 2019 theoretically as the average aperture increased decreased the relative roughness and void space of single fractures changed simultaneously which might contribute to the varying ω therefore as an influencing factor that might have a strong impact on ω the influence of aperture on ω and its varying characteristics should be studied according to numerical simulation results of different apertures pattern 6 8 fig 8 was obtained three sets of fracture data with different fracture apertures and different roughness element shapes showed that ω obviously decreased with the increasing average aperture when the fracture aperture increased from 1 mm to 6 mm the magnitude of ω decreased by 0 5 1 25 orders of magnitude which proved that average aperture indeed had an impact on the scaling factor ω and that the aperture was inversely proportional to ω compared to roughness and different roughness elements shapes the effect of fracture aperture on ω was obvious 4 3 2 5 effect of the inertial effect on the varying characteristics of ω based on the results described in section 4 3 2 3 it has been proved that different roughness element shapes would affect varying characteristics of ω by generating different turbulence effects since the numerical simulation method could strictly control the magnitude of inertial force the effects of different flow regimes and the inertial effect were neglected the inertial effects have an important influence on fluid flow in a single fracture and the phenomena induced by different inertial effects had always been a hot issue studied by scholars lacey 2016 zhou et al 2015 nowamooz et al 2009 thus in this section whether different magnitudes of inertial effects affect ω and its varying characteristics is analyzed based on laboratory experiment data pattern 1 4 first different inertial force caused different flow regimes to quantify inertial force two dimensionless parameters were used here due to the limitations of reynolds number mentioned in section 2 3 using critical reynolds number to judge inertial effect of flow might be not accurate in fractures thus to quantify inertial effect while taking the limitations of reynolds number into account the forchheimer number fo was also used to avoid the limitations of reynolds number in describing inertial effects non darcy effect factor α in eq 17 at maximum flow velocity was used to identify the magnitude of inertial effect in fractures that without varying flow regimes then it was necessary to accurately describe flow regimes based on classic forchheimer equation eq 2 different flow regime in fractures could be easily identified when jv ji the viscous force was dominant and the flow regime was laminar flow when ji jv flow regime was the transition zone from laminar to turbulent and flow was non darcy flow when ji jv the inertial force was completely dominant and flow was turbulent to facilitate calculation jv ji was normalized by jv j ji j above method refers to qian et al 2011c zhang et al 2019 based on calculation method described in section 2 2 kv ki could be obtained thus the distribution of jv and ji under different fo values could be obtained through the experimentally measured v finally figs 9 12 was obtained for all the fractures in pattern1 4 when fo 1 there was almost no inertial effect ji had a small proportion in j when fo gradually increased to 1 the contribution of inertial effect to total pressure drop gradually increased when fo was greater than 1 ji jv non darcy flow occurred and a larger inertial effect would lead to a transition of the flow regime from table 3 it is clear that critical forchheimer number when ji jv the corresponding fo is the critical forchheimer number calculated from permeability could also be considered to be 1 including the predicted fo the prediction curves are only shown in fig 9b and fig 9c which is consistent with previous studies cherubini et al 2012 ruth and ma 1992 this result also proved that kv ki could be used as the characteristic length to identify flow regime in a single fracture however it was shown in table 3 that for critical reynolds number in a horizontal rough single fracture there was no definite value since rec is proportional to the aperture eq 14 a larger aperture would induce a larger rec therefore it can be speculated from the prediction curves that under same aperture the rec of rough fractures should be smaller than that of smooth fractures this phenomenon shows that the tortuosity and roughness of a single fracture would make fluid flow in a rough fracture more prone to flow regime transitions than that in a smooth fracture the most important phenomenon shown in figs 9 12 is that for fractures with transition behaviour from laminar flow to transition zone a larger inertia effect the corresponding ω is significantly lower than that for fractures with laminar flow compared with the ω in fractures with laminar flow ω in fractures with a transitional zone is reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude at most as the flow regime was directly related to the magnitude of inertial effect it could also be considered that ω decreased significantly with the increasing inertial effect in previous studies it has been proved that ω in numerical simulation fractures decreases with the fracture aperture when the flow regimes and inertial effect are identical however the evidence provided in table 3 is sufficient to prove that a fracture with a larger aperture produces a larger ω value under the same flow regime which seems contrary to the conclusion presented in section 4 3 2 4 for numerical simulation results pattern 6 8 magnitudes of inertial effect were basically same while for artificial fracture pattern1 4 in spite of having the same flow regimes the inertial effect could not be precisely controlled thus it was speculated that the reason why the effect of aperture in a numerically simulated fracture on ω was different from that in an artificial fracture was the different inertial effects to explain this contradiction non darcy effect factor α which represents the magnitude of inertial effect in each artificial fracture actually α ji j was carefully analyzed and obtained as shown in fig 13 it was found that ω was inversely proportional to the inertial effect and when the influence of aperture and inertia effect simultaneously occurred in a single fracture the following phenomena occured a fracture with larger aperture should have a smaller ω according to the conclusion presented in section 4 3 2 4 but due to the small inertial effect it produced a larger ω value therefore based on the above analysis it was considered that when the aperture and inertial effect change simultaneously the impact of fracture could be ignored section 4 3 2 2 showed that roughness affected ω in fractures as well however compared with the significant impacts of flow regime and aperture on ω the slight impact of roughness did not contradict the conclusion drawn in this section it should also be noted that the conclusions presented in section 4 3 2 3 were not contradictory to the conclusions drawn in this section since the inertial effects and turbulence effects were not consistent larger inertial effects did not necessarily lead to the occurrence of turbulence effects in summary the influence of aperture and roughness on ω did not contradict the conclusion drawn in this section when considering the combined effects of varying inertial effect aperture and roughness the inertial effect was the dominant factor therefore as a main factor inertial effect would produce a significant impact on the scaling factor ω and the inertia effect was inversely proportional to ω it should be noted that a varying ω caused by different inertial effects also indicated that the predicted value of inertial permeability would change with inertial effect similar to the influence of different roughness element shape although these two conclusions are different it is indicated that a relationship may be existed between inertial permeability and fluid characteristics which is different from previous study bai et al 2010 rust and cashman 2004 ranjith and viete 2011 4 3 2 6 effect of horizontal fracture and vertical fracture on the varying characteristics of ω during the data collection process it was also found that the distribution of data points generated by vertical fractures and horizontal fractures showed different trends the data points of vertical fractures were mostly greater than the data points of horizontal fractures as the intercept in eq 12 could directly represent ω it was reasonably speculated that different direction of fractures might affect ω therefore experimental data from different sources were separated according to different fracture direction horizontal and vertical as shown in fig 14 the ω of vertical fracture data ω in this study is 108 606 m 2 ω of the reference data is 1011 022 m 2 was obviously larger than that of horizontal fracture data ω in this study ω 107 491 m 2 ω of the reference data is ω 1010 204 m 2 undoubtedly the effects of horizontal fractures and vertical fractures on ω were different and the experiment data from two different sources showed same trend it should be noted that difference between the ω values of the same horizontal fractures or vertical fractures in this study and reference could be explained by the conclusion presented in section 4 3 2 1 although specific conditions such as roughness inertia effect aperture etc of each data were not considered here these data were sufficient to prove that the influence on ω generated by horizontal and vertical fractures was different consequently the fitting results proved that horizontal fracture direction would lead to a reduction of ω compared with vertical fractures the influence of horizontal fractures caused a reduction of ω of 0 8 to 1 1 orders of magnitude in previous studies the influence of different fracture directions horizontal and vertical fractures were the two extreme inclinations of the fracture direction shown in supplementary material s1 on the water flow is rarely mentioned and in most case this influence on fluid flow is basically ignored for example by using the dupuit assumption the vertical velocity induced by gravity could be ignored qian et al 2015 theoretically due to the presence of gravity the flow in a vertical fracture should be different from that in a horizontal fracture regarding the effect of gravity some scholars have considered the effect of gravity on fluid flow in porous media celik et al 2016 nakayama 1992 but gravity is always ignored when linear or nonlinear equations are used to describe flow in single fractures chen et al 2011 qian et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 however the above statistical analysis indicated that the scaling factor ω would be affected by horizontal or vertical fractures considering that ω was determined by the void space distribution pattern and relative roughness a varying void space distribution pattern and relative roughness the varying ω might further affect fluid flow thus it was necessary to consider the possible influence of the fracture direction when conducting laboratory experiments in summary the fracture types and inertia effect were the main factors affecting the scaling factor ω in empirical quantitative model under the influence of these factors ω varied at most more than 2 orders of magnitude other minor factors were the average aperture roughness roughness element shape and difference between horizontal and vertical fractures 5 conclusions in this study fluid flow in different single fractures was investigated and an empirical quantitative model of the relationship between viscous and inertial permeabilities in single fractures was obtained this study might be the first to propose factors that affect the scaling coefficient ω in the empirical power law quantitative model and to disclose the varying characteristics of ω under influencing factors the main conclusions of this study as followings 1 the forchheimer model could effectively describe the nonlinear flow in almost all types of single fractures in this study such as smooth rough horizontal or vertical artificial single fractures and fractures generated by a numerical simulation 2 an empirical quantitative model for predicting inertial permeability based on the viscous permeability in single fracture was obtained k i ω k v 3 2 mergeformat where ω 108 m 2 the lower limit is 106 m 2 and upper limit is 1010 m 2 3 the fluctuation degree of ω is related to the number of media types and more types of media lead to a larger ω fluctuation range different factors affected the value of ω the main factors were fracture type and inertia effect ω produced by artificial single fractures was lower than that in natural rock fractures ω was inversely proportional to the magnitude of inertial effect and under the effects of roughness aperture and inertia the inertial effect played the dominant role other minor factors were roughness average aperture roughness element shape and fracture direction the presence of roughness caused ω to decrease roughness element shapes that induced a greater turbulence effect on fluid flow produced a larger ω the average aperture was inversely proportional to ω and ω produced by horizontal fractures was smaller than that produced by vertical fractures although the applicability of inertial permeability prediction model proposed in this study will be limited due to the inconsistency of the roughness quantification method and the fracture aperture range it is undeniable that this study also has a certain practical applicability based on the quantitative models and characterization of the influencing factors the degree of non darcy effect which had a significant impact on the production rate of petroleum gas was quantified additionally the model proposed in this study further verified the applicability of the forchheimer model in single fractured media and improved the accuracy of the flow rate prediction in groundwater engineering credit authorship

4972,the dynamics of suprapermafrost groundwater regulate hydrological processes including the fate and transport of carbon and nutrients suitability of aquatic habitats and evolution of permafrost in arctic boreal and high altitude regions nevertheless relatively few studies have focused on these dynamics on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp in this study soil hydraulic conductivities saturated thicknesses and related hydrological processes were observed in situ around a typical thermokarst lake during the warm season the results showed that the water table in the active layer fluctuated markedly from june to october and at depths of up to 1 0 m the discharge of suprapermafrost groundwater was often 0 1 m2 d 1 which was attributed to the thin aquifer and low permeability of the active layer groundwater fluxes were controlled by the freeze thaw cycle and local factors and were altered by rainfall events and evapotranspiration the contributions of suprapermafrost groundwater to the thermokarst lake water were often 1 4 mm d 1 and were greater in the late warm season moreover surface runoff in initial warm season was the dominant water resource in some open parts of the lake and the frequent exchange between surface runoff and lake water accelerated the degradation of the permafrost beneath the lake these findings provide insights into the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in regional hydrological cycles and the evolution of thermokarst lakes on the qinghai tibet plateau keywords suprapermafrost groundwater thermokarst lake qinghai tibet plateau water balance 1 introduction groundwater dynamics control the generation of runoff sun et al 2020 evolution of nearby lakes zhang et al 2017 distribution of permafrost song et al 2020 biogeochemical cycles connolly et al 2020 ma et al 2019 and infrastructure stability mu et al 2018 in permafrost regions the degradation of permafrost has been found to alter the hydraulic connections between different water bodies the interactions between ground and surface waters and groundwater flow paths karlsson et al 2012 song et al 2020 as a key component of permafrost groundwater suprapermafrost groundwater develops in the active layer and is characterized by thin aquifers and seasonal variability cheng and jin 2013 woo 2012 suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics are driven by meteorological conditions land surface temperatures huang et al 2020 freeze thaw processes chang et al 2015a saturated zone thicknesses o connor et al 2019 and microtopographic features quinton et al 2000 wright et al 2009 thus suprapermafrost groundwater exhibits strong spatial and temporal heterogeneities the qinghai tibet plateau qtp known as asia s water tower feeds many rivers in asia suprapermafrost groundwater is an important water resource in the qtp and accounts for approximately 85 of the total water resources in this area cheng and jin 2013 li et al 2020b as global warming accelerates the degradation of permafrost jin et al 2019 water tables are expected to decline in the warm season thereby decreasing the proportion of the suprapermafrost groundwater contribution to total base flow walvoord et al 2012 feedback runoff components ecological evolution biogeochemical processes and thermal effects are also likely being altered as a result of variations in the suprapermafrost water table you et al 2017 to date research that has been conducted on suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics has mainly involved field surveys koch 2016 isotope geochemical methods hinkel et al 2017 li et al 2020b water balance calculations pan et al 2017 process based numerical models sun et al 2020 and neural network models chang et al 2015b however there remains a lack of direct field based studies of groundwater flow in the qtp thermokarst lakes also known as thaw lakes comprise typical landscapes in the arctic and high altitude cryosphere and form as a result of the degradation of ice rich permafrost and the gathering of water morgenstern et al 2013 niu et al 2011 to account for the evolution of thermokarst lakes the results of recent studies have suggested that suprapermafrost groundwater is an important water source in thermokarst lakes narancic et al 2017 fedorov et al 2014 estimated the water balance in a typical siberian thermokarst lake over the last two decades and demonstrated that the lake volume increased from 33 7 m3 in 1993 to 3503 m3 in 2008 wherein suprapermafrost groundwater occupied 30 of the total water recharge on the arctic plain koch 2016 measured and simulated the components of lake water budgets and demonstrated that 70 of the mid summer inflow entering lakes were the result of lateral and subsurface flows thermokarst lakes have developed throughout the qtp due to persistent climate warming and wetting the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in regulating thermokarst lake evolution has only been indirectly inferred from water balance calculations gao et al 2018 pan et al 2017 wan et al 2019 yang et al 2016 for instance in the eastern qtp pan et al 2017 monitored and simulated the hydrological processes of two closed i e no surface runoff exchange and negligible groundwater leakage thermokarst lakes using a water balance model to explore the dynamics of the suprapermafrost groundwater they found that its contribution to discharge reached 22 during the ice season and 170 of the precipitation during the ice free season in some thermokarst lakes moreover the results from isotope mass balance models revealed that the mean contribution of suprapermafrost groundwater accounts for 60 of the total regional water resources in the qtp gao et al 2018 nevertheless little is known about the complex dynamics of suprapermafrost groundwater in the thermokarst lake region of the qtp to improve our understanding of the hydrological processes acting in thermokarst lakes with continuous permafrost a systematic monitoring scheme was employed for two consecutive years focusing on soil thawing processes suprapermafrost water tables soil hydraulic conductivities and lake water levels within a typical thermokarst lake setting of the qtp the major aims of this study were to 1 determine the flow processes of suprapermafrost groundwater 2 identify the hydrological processes involved in thermokarst lake water budgets in the qtp and 3 evaluate the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in regulating the water balance of thermokarst lakes the findings presented here are expected to enhance the understanding of solute transport dynamics and regional hydrological evolution on the qtp in the present and the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the beiluhe basin where thermokarst lakes are widely distributed was selected as the study area fig 1 the warmest and coldest months recorded between 1958 and 2018 were july 5 5 c and january 16 8 c respectively the mean annual precipitation is 300 mm and has increased at a rate of 22 mm decade more than 80 of the annual precipitation occurs as rainfall during the warm season june october westerly cold and dry air masses lead to a high mean annual potential evaporation of 1600 mm lin et al 2017 in the beiluhe basin permafrost is ice rich in the top few meters gravimetric moisture content 20 lin et al 2020 and the permafrost thickness is 50 120 m zhou et al 2000 based on long term measurement of soil temperature the active layer thickness in alpine ecosystems is 1 6 3 4 m and increases at a rate of 1 9 6 7 cm a wu et al 2015 alpine wet meadows alpine meadows and alpine steppes are the main vegetation types wherein the dominant species are kobresia tibetica kobresia humilis and carex moorcroftii respectively previously a thermokarst lake designated as blh a was investigated to study the thermal regime lin et al 2010 in this study another thermokarst lake designated as blh b was selected to study suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics in june of 2018 fig 1 the seasonal streamlets recharged and discharged the lake in the north south direction the average lake water area of blh b was 9100 m2 in the warm season with a maximum water depth of 1 83 m the north south diameter is 110 m during the warm season the total dissolved solids and ph in the blh b lake water ranged from 234 to 305 mg l 1 and 7 8 8 5 respectively the lake water was observed to freeze at the end of october and thaw in mid may while the maximum depth of lake ice was 60 70 cm huang et al 2019 2 2 continuous measurements around the studied thermokarst lake four transects were set in the four cardinal directions each transect consisted of two or three groundwater monitoring wells at distances from the lakeshore of 5 10 or 30 m fig 1 the groundwater monitoring wells are summarized in table 1 in the study area 3 m deep groundwater monitoring wells were constructed using a drilling machine with a 90 mm drill diameter a 60 mm diameter pvc pipe was installed into which 5 mm holes were pre augured down the entire length of the pipe packed with gauze and backfilled with native soil the bottom and top caps were cased wherein the top cap was perforated to maintain the same pressure between the atmosphere and the air in the pipe a hobo u20 001 04 pressure type water level data logger onset co usa was installed at a depth of 1 5 m to monitor the water tables at 0 5 h intervals at a resolution of 0 14 cm raw water table data were corrected using manually measured water tables owing to the harsh and cold environment and the lack of suprapermafrost groundwater flow in the cold season the data loggers were retrieved at the end of october and re installed in may thus two datasets 7 26 2018 11 9 2018 and 6 1 2019 10 26 2019 were obtained the locations and elevations of each monitoring well were measured using a global positioning system geoexplorer 6000 trimble navigation ltd usa and the relative elevation was corrected using a level gauge with an accuracy of 2 mm a weighing cumulative precipitation gauge t200b geonor inc usa was installed on the lake shore and recorded the precipitation at 0 5 h intervals with a measurement accuracy of 0 1 mm the wind induced uncaught solid precipitation was corrected using the method proposed by smith 2007 further an hobo mx2301 sensor onset co usa housed in a radiation shield and was installed at 1 5 m height over lake surface to measure air temperature and humidity in the study area the data were recorded continuously at 0 5 h intervals with a measurement accuracy of 0 21 c a radiometer also was installed above the lake water surface at a height of 1 5 m to measure the net daily radiation at the water surface cnr2 kipp zonen inc germany the ground thawing front determined the aquifer thickness in study area and the ground temperature was measured from the ground surface to a depth of 5 m using a string of thermistors in each transect a 5 m borehole was drilled 5 m away from the shoreline fig 1b and the thermistors were placed in the borehole and backfilled with native soil the thermistors were positioned as follows 0 05 m intervals at depths of 0 0 5 m 0 1 m intervals at depths of 0 5 1 5 m 0 25 m intervals at depths of 1 5 3 0 m and 0 5 m intervals at depths of 3 0 5 0 m the thermistors were manufactured by the state key laboratory of frozen soil engineering china and have an accuracy of 0 05 c a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa was used to automatically measure the ground temperature at 4 h intervals thus the thawing process was acquired for the northern eastern and southern transects via interpolation in 2019 however data were missing in the western transect because the power supply failed and the lost data were supplemented through interpolation in this study the thawing process of 2019 was used to calculate the aquifer thickness in 2018 and interannual variations were neglected 2 3 soil hydraulic conductivity from borehole nuclear magnetic resonance in this study soil hydraulic conductivity was determined in situ with a dart sensor vista clara inc usa which is based on a borehole nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique niu et al 2019 the principle of borehole nmr logging involves obtaining information on pore space geometries and water filled porosity which are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity dlubac et al 2013 because of its easy operation and high vertical resolution nmr logging is widely used to study hydraulic conductivity dlubac et al 2013 kleinberg and griffin 2005 niu et al 2019 the schlumberger doll research equation was adopted here to estimate soil hydraulic conductivity ksdr which is sensitive to thin low k beds and is expressed as follows 1 k sdr c ϕ m t 2 m l 2 where φ is the fractional porosity c and m are the lithologic constant and porosity exponent respectively and t2ml is the logarithmic mean of the t2 decay time distribution which is calculated as 2 t 2 m l exp σ a i ln t 2 i σ a i where ai is proportional to the total spins in the ith pore type which relaxes with decay time t2i in each transect around the thermokarst lake the strata were continuous from 2 0 m to the permafrost table thus the soil hydraulic conductivities were measured at depths of 0 2 m in particular a borehole with a depth of 2 m and diameter of 60 mm was drilled 5 m away from the shoreline in each transect a pvc probe with a diameter of 50 mm was placed in the borehole and the probe bottom was sealed to avoid water seepage a dart sensor was placed in the pvc probe to measure the soil hydraulic conductivity via the cylindrical shell diameter 15 2 cm in the soil surrounding the center of the probe at a 0 2 m vertical resolution to validate the results of soil hydraulic conductivities acquired using the borehole nmr technique undisturbed soil samples in different profiles were collected from the study sites and transported to the laboratory to measure the soil hydraulic conductivities using a permeameter under constant pressure tian et al 2017 2 4 detection of unfrozen water via surface nuclear magnetic resonance a gmrtm surface nmr instrument vista clara inc usa was used to detect unfrozen water content using a noninvasive and direct geophysical method however we could not detect ground ice because of the negligible signal the surface nmr technique is based on free induction decay experiments where an excitation pulse is emitted using large surface coil cables and the relaxation signals are recorded müller petke et al 2011 therefore the maximum detection depth is close to the diameter of the surface coil cable prior to our measurements the nuclear spins in the water were in equilibrium due to alignment by earth s background magnetic field an oscillating electromagnetic pulse at the larmor frequency which is related to the gyromagnetic ratio specific to hydrogen nuclei and the magnitude of the local background magnetic field was generated in the surface coil cables to perturb the equilibrium of the nuclear spins once the electromagnetic pulse was turned off the rotary motion of the net magnetization emitted another electromagnetic field while the spins relaxed to their equilibrium states the amplitude of the relaxation signal decay time t 2 which is related to the volumetric water content was recorded from the surface coil cables the existence of significant dead time between the shutdown of the electromagnetic pulses and signal recording 5 ms for the gmr restrict the surface nmr from detecting short relaxation time signals thus clay bound water and ground ice content could not be acquired the current and duration of the electromagnetic pulse moment increased with increasing detection depth additional details regarding the principles of surface nmr were given in previous studies by müller petke et al 2011 legchenko 2013 and behroozmand et al 2015 in this study a 70 m square loop located on the blh b lakeshore was used to detect the vertical distribution of unfrozen water earth s magnetic field was calculated using the world magnetic model acquired from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www ngdc noaa gov geomag web igrfwmm noise canceling loops were set to measure ambient noise as the qinghai tibet railway was located near the study region during post processing the ambient noise was subtracted from the data measured on the transmitter receiver coil raw data were imported to the gmr business software and band pass filtered and digital noise compensation was subsequently applied finally the unfrozen volumetric water content was interpreted 2 5 determination of suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes the suprapermafrost groundwater flux was estimated using darcy s law which is expressed as follows 3 q n z 0 z b k i h d z 4 q n q n l n where qn is the discharge of suprapermafrost groundwater to the thermokarst lake per unit width in the n direction per meter m2 d 1 ki is the soil

runoff mm d 1 that was calculated from the water balance equation qsg is the suprapermafrost groundwater flux mm d 1 qws is lake water seepage mm d 1 and δw is the change in lake water volume mm d 1 which was acquired from the changes in the depth of the lake water as the lake area varied little with water depth the variation in lake area was neglected in our calculations the open water evaporation during the ice free season ew mm d 1 was estimated according to the penman equation penman 1948 6 e w 1 ρ w δ δ γ r n g λ γ δ γ e a where ew is the daily evaporation in an open water body

follows 8 f u 2 6 1 0 54 u 2 where u 2 is the wind speed m s 1 at a height of 2 m and f u is given in mm d 1 kpa 1 according to the methods of finch 2001 and mcmahon et al 2013 we calculated the daily changes in the heat storage of the water body g in eq 4 as follows 9 g ρ w c w h w i t w t where ρw and cw are the density kg m 3 and specific heat of water mj kg 1 c 1 respectively hw i is the water

measured long wave downward and upward radiations w m 2 respectively ε is the surface emissivity ε 0 02 at the water surface and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 wm 2 k 4 the daily lake water seepage qws in equation 5 was assumed to be constant in the ice free and ice covered seasons and calculated as follows 11 q ws p s e ic δ w ic d where ps is the total precipitation in an ice covered season mm eic is the total sublimation mm δwic is the decreased water level throughout the ice covered season mm and d is the number of days in the ice covered season d in this study the lake water level decreased by 330 mm in the ice covered season of 2018 2019 the daily sublimation was roughly estimated according to the method of kuchment and gelfan 1996 which was determined as the product of an empirical wind function and the atmospheric saturation deficit as a result the total lake ice sublimation was estimated to be 201 mm during this period which was consistent with the results of pan et al 2017 moreover the total precipitation was 28 mm in this period thus the lake ice water seepage qws was estimated to be 0 8 mm d 1 which was regarded as a constant in the lake water balance evaluation 3 results 3 1 soil hydraulic conductivity in the active layer in the active soil layer alpine grass roots were mainly distributed within the top 0 6 m and the soil structure was very loose due to the existence of fine sands and organic matter om in depths of 0 6 1 0 m coarse sands with gravel were distributed in the northern and southern transects while sandy loam was dominant in the eastern and western transects silty clay was distributed from 1 0 m to 2 0 m in the study area except in western transect where the soil was dominated by coarse sands and gravel fig 2 this variety of soil types promoted strong spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivities fig 2 on the ground surface higher soil om contents promoted higher soil hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1 07 to 2 05 m d 1 in the northern transect soil hydraulic conductivities were enhanced at depths of 0 6 1 1 m and a maximum of 2 6 m d 1 achieved at 0 8 m however conductivities in the eastern transect gradually decreased with increasing depth in the soil profile in the southern transect conductivities increased from the ground surface to a depth of 0 8 m with the highest values recorded at depths of 0 5 1 0 m in the western transect soil hydraulic conductivities were high throughout the profile with values exceeding 1 47 m d 1 at depths of 1 4 1 8 m this was attributed to the existence of a coarse sand with gravel layer therefore soil hydraulic conductivity strongly depended on the local distribution of different strata porous om promoted water migration in the top active layer and later subsurface flows readily formed because of the permeability of the silty clay stratum however the stratigraphic distribution of the coarse sand with gravel facilitated the south and westward flow of suprapermafrost groundwater comparing the estimated hydraulic conductivities from the laboratory permeameter klp and nmr knmr fig 2d we found that the knmr values were just slightly lower than the klp values at the same magnitude indicating that the knmr and klp values were in good agreement 3 2 seasonal dynamics of suprapermafrost water tables as shown in fig 3 the water tables were shallow in the study area and were often only 1 m deep especially in the western transect wherein the entire active layer was nearly saturated fig 3 the water tables exhibited sharp fluctuations in the rainy season indicating that the suprapermafrost groundwater was readily affected by local meteorological conditions consistent with the distribution of rainfall water tables were deeper before august and shallower between august and early october however the water table began to decrease rapidly as the topsoil froze beginning on october 10th the response regime of the water table to external meteorological conditions also varied between the study sites due to the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in vegetation and soil properties within the active layer on an interannual scale water table fluctuations were stronger in 2019 than in 2018 the suprapermafrost water table changed synchronously with lake water levels in the warm season fig 4 indicating either that suprapermafrost groundwater is the main resource of lake water or that they are recharged by the same water resource 3 3 suprapermafrost groundwater flow around a thermokarst lake the fluxes in suprapermafrost groundwater varied substantially across different spatiotemporal scales fig 5 the northern and western transects were the dominant inflow directions while the southern transect was the main outflow direction a finding that is consistent with the topographic features of the study area fig 1 however the exchange of suprapermafrost groundwater and thermokarst lake water was bidirectional in the eastern transect under the impact of freeze thaw processes vegetation and stratigraphic distributions and microtopographic characteristics suprapermafrost groundwater was developed from june 1st to july 8th when the active layer thawed to a depth of 0 5 0 8 m and ceased near the end of october when the ground surface froze for the primary inflow and outflow directions western and southern transects the onsets of suprapermafrost groundwater were extended as summer progressed groundwater flow increased because the saturated zone tended to thicken as the thaw depth increased table 2 however the lower permeability of the silty clay layer caused groundwater flow to fluctuate drastically depending upon the prevailing meteorological conditions suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes per unit width ranged from 0 02 0 08 m3 d 1 in 2018 and from 0 01 0 06 m3 d 1 in 2019 in the northern transect these fluxes were closely related to the annual rainfall distribution compared with the northern transect little exchange of suprapermafrost groundwater occurred in the eastern transect in 2018 however the fluxes in this transect fluctuated near 0 015 m3 d 1 in 2019 and rapidly declined to 0 005 m3 d 1 by the end of august of that year in the southern transect suprapermafrost groundwater recharged lake water at the end of july but continual rainfall promoted lake water discharge and supplied the groundwater rendering the relatively stable fluxes the values were 0 05 m3 d 1 owing to active layer saturation in 2018 in 2019 the groundwater fluxes were slightly greater in the western transect suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes were lower before august which was attributable to the porous om and gravel strata in the active layer subsequently the fluxes reached 0 08 m3 d 1 in september 4 discussion 4 1 dominant factors controlling suprapermafrost groundwater flow dynamics as a type of interflow suprapermafrost groundwater flow is susceptible to the influence of climatic factors and soil hydrological properties which can lead to drastic fluctuations in water tables and fluxes during the warm season as shown in fig 6 the correlation coefficients between the water flux and thawing depth aquifer thickness and water table gradually increased from june to october the thawing depth and water table were found to be the two vital factors that determined aquifer thickness and thus affected the water flux freeze thaw cycles in the active layer play a decisive role in groundwater recharge movement discharge and cycles in cold regions quinton et al 2005 after complete freezing soil water content in the active layer declines significantly as the thawing period begins when compared with the water content before freezing hu et al 2009 soil water is recharged by rainfall in the shallow layer and consumed during evapotranspiration thereby decreasing soil water linkages wright et al 2008 suprapermafrost groundwater flow began between june and july when the active layer thawed to depths of 0 5 0 8 m the frozen active layer could effectively block soil water infiltration and was considered to be an aquitard which rapidly increased the water table during initial ablation fig 4 moreover suprapermafrost groundwater discharge began to cease at the end of october as the ground surface froze and water fluxes exhibited exponential or linear decreases with ongoing active layer freezing which is consistent with the results of wang et al 2017 previous studies have indicated that the relationship between suprapermafrost water tables and soil temperatures may be described by boltzmann functions chang et al 2015a with continued climate warming and permafrost degradation some studies have demonstrated that there will be more suprapermafrost groundwater flow in the active layer thereby increasing groundwater discharge to lakes and rivers ge et al 2011 while these results are greatly dependent upon precipitation conditions the area of thermokarst lakes is projected to expand in the future previous isotope and geochemical studies have shown that suprapermafrost groundwater originates from the infiltration of precipitation and the contribution of precipitation to groundwater exceeds 80 in active layer ablation periods li et al 2020a however the groundwater flux was not obviously correlated with the precipitation amount in this study due to the delayed reaction and interception in unsaturated topsoil layers fig 6 moreover suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes depend on deeper soil water contents which change the infiltration in deeper soils dai et al 2019 model forecasts have indicated that suprapermafrost groundwater is likely to increase by 2 5 2 6 when precipitation increases by 10 20 per year chang et al 2015b although the melting of ground ice has proven to be an important source of suprapermafrost groundwater no obvious increase has been demonstrated in the fluxes at the end of the ablation period fig 5 this was attributed to the low contribution of ground ice meltwater to groundwater which was negated by variations in the water table and thus did not cause an obvious increase in saturation thickness the correlation coefficients between the suprapermafrost groundwater flux and thawing depth aquifer thickness and water table indicated significant differences between the four transects fig 6 this suggests that local factors including vegetation soil texture stratal type and topography are essential for controlling the soil hydraulic conductivity and significantly affect suprapermafrost groundwater discharge local topography also had a controlling effect on land surface temperatures which should not be ignored when suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics are simulated huang et al 2020 4 2 estimation of thermokarst lake water balance the hydrological processes in the studied thermokarst lake water balance during 2018 2019 are shown in fig 7 net surface runoff open water evaporation lake volume and suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes varied simultaneously with precipitation during the rainy season the contributions of suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes to thermokarst lake water volume were often 1 4 mm d 1 though these values were higher later in the warm season throughout the warm season suprapermafrost groundwater contributed 60 mm to thermokarst lake water fig 8 however these contributions depended strongly on rainfall events and exhibited obvious interannual variability the values reported here were lower than those in previous studies gao et al 2018 pan et al 2017 yang et al 2016 which were mainly focused on closed thermokarst lakes and neglected surface runoff and lake water leakage the dry warm and windy climate of the study area also increased lake water loss via evaporation which lowered the lake water level from 1 2 mm d 1 to 7 5 mm d 1 in the warm season the recharge of precipitation and suprapermafrost groundwater to lake could not offset the water consumed via evaporation fig 8 compared to the contributions of suprapermafrost groundwater to the studied thermokarst lake the results of the water balance model revealed that surface runoff is the dominant factor that determines the changes in lake water levels fig 7 during the initial ablation period surface runoff readily formed because of the lower water loss through infiltration and evapotranspiration which rapidly increased the water level of the lake fig 4 for instance the net surface runoff raised the lake level by nearly 0 18 m on june 19 of 2019 following a period of continuous rainfall meanwhile surface outflow formed in the southern transect when lake water levels exceeded the elevation of the ground surface thus the net surface runoff fluctuated drastically under the impact of rainfall in the warm season the net surface runoff contributed approximately 55 to 180 mm d 1 to the lake water it should be noted that the net surface runoff estimated from the water balance model contains substantial uncertainty which originated from the estimates of suprapermafrost groundwater water surface evaporation and lake water leakage as well as the observations of precipitation and lake water levels the surface inflow and outflow will be monitored to clarify the contributions of different hydrological components to the lake water balance in future studies 4 3 effect of permafrost degradation on suprapermafrost groundwater discharge suprapermafrost groundwater is sensitive to climate warming because of the restriction of water as a result of the permafrost layer it was found that an open talik formed below the thermokarst lake due to the frequent exchange of lake water and surface runoff although the shallow aquifer thickness and lower permeability of the local soil types led to lesser amounts of suprapermafrost groundwater around the thermokarst lake suprapermafrost groundwater discharge is likely to continue increasing under the impact of persistent climatic warming and wetting on the lakeshore surface nmr analyses revealed that the amount of unfrozen water was relatively low with values 6 these results were consistent with those of yoshikawa and overduin 2005 who demonstrated that the unfrozen water content ranged from 1 to 10 for silt samples based on laboratory nmr analyses moreover the unfrozen water in this study was dominated by gravitational water t 2 33 ms fig 9 which indicates that thick ice rich permafrost was widely distributed the melting of the ground ice deepened the active layer and more water was transformed into suprapermafrost groundwater via surface runoff thus the recharge of the thermokarst lake from suprapermafrost groundwater will likely increase especially in the western transect because of the loose soil structure of the active layer fig 2 the results of this study revealed the mechanisms underlying suprapermafrost groundwater flow and exchange around a thermokarst lake on the qtp however the robust spatiotemporal heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivities generated uncertainty when establishing suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics additionally the estimated thermokarst lake water balance contains a large degree of uncertainty due to the lack of measured surface runoff therefore future research on thermokarst lake water balances should explicitly include multiple environmental factors 5 conclusions suprapermafrost groundwater flows and exchanges on the qtp have been poorly studied despite their potential role in regulating regional hydrological processes fluvial energy budgets and the fates of carbon and nutrients in this study a series of field based measurements were conducted to explore the suprapermafrost groundwater flows around a thermokarst lake on the qtp and to evaluate the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in the thermokarst lake water balance the main findings were as follows 1 soil hydraulic conductivities exhibited substantial variability across different spatial scales porous om promoted water migration in the top active layer and later subsurface flows readily formed because of the permeability of the silty clay layer however the distribution of a coarse sand stratum facilitated suprapermafrost groundwater flow in certain regions 2 suprapermafrost water tables fluctuated sharply during the rainy season with similar trends observed in the initial 1 0 m below the ground surface the water tables were susceptible to local weather conditions but greatly declined as the topsoil froze at the end of october 3 restricted by the lower permeability of the active layer soils suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes were relatively minor often 0 1 m3 d 1 per meter of width and the dynamics were influenced by the thawing depth and rainfall events nonetheless the responses of suprapermafrost groundwater to rainfall were complex because of interception by the upper active layer soil and vegetation 4 in the studied thermokarst lake the contribution of suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes to lake water were often 1 4 mm d 1 though these values were higher later in the warm season precipitation and suprapermafrost groundwater recharge of the lake could not offset the water consumed during evaporation at the annual scale moreover surface runoff in initial warm season was the dominant water resource in some open areas of the lake and the frequent exchange between surface runoff and lake water accelerated the degradation of permafrost beneath lake suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics are likely to become more complex with continued climatic warming and wetting as well as permafrost degradation thus more attention should be paid to these issues in the future

4972,the dynamics of suprapermafrost groundwater regulate hydrological processes including the fate and transport of carbon and nutrients suitability of aquatic habitats and evolution of permafrost in arctic boreal and high altitude regions nevertheless relatively few studies have focused on these dynamics on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp in this study soil hydraulic conductivities saturated thicknesses and related hydrological processes were observed in situ around a typical thermokarst lake during the warm season the results showed that the water table in the active layer fluctuated markedly from june to october and at depths of up to 1 0 m the discharge of suprapermafrost groundwater was often 0 1 m2 d 1 which was attributed to the thin aquifer and low permeability of the active layer groundwater fluxes were controlled by the freeze thaw cycle and local factors and were altered by rainfall events and evapotranspiration the contributions of suprapermafrost groundwater to the thermokarst lake water were often 1 4 mm d 1 and were greater in the late warm season moreover surface runoff in initial warm season was the dominant water resource in some open parts of the lake and the frequent exchange between surface runoff and lake water accelerated the degradation of the permafrost beneath the lake these findings provide insights into the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in regional hydrological cycles and the evolution of thermokarst lakes on the qinghai tibet plateau keywords suprapermafrost groundwater thermokarst lake qinghai tibet plateau water balance 1

permafrost jin et al 2019 water tables are expected to decline in the warm season thereby decreasing the proportion of the suprapermafrost groundwater contribution to total base flow walvoord et al

balance calculations pan et al 2017 process based numerical models sun et al 2020 and neural network models chang et al 2015b however there remains a lack of direct field based studies of groundwater flow in the qtp thermokarst lakes also known as thaw lakes comprise typical landscapes in the arctic and high altitude cryosphere and form as a result of the degradation of ice rich permafrost and the gathering of water morgenstern et al 2013 niu et al 2011 to account for the evolution of thermokarst lakes the results of recent studies have suggested that suprapermafrost groundwater is an important water source in thermokarst lakes narancic et al 2017 fedorov et al 2014 estimated the water balance in a typical siberian thermokarst lake over the last two decades and demonstrated that the lake volume increased from 33 7 m3 in 1993 to 3503 m3 in 2008 wherein suprapermafrost groundwater occupied 30 of the total water recharge on the arctic plain koch 2016 measured and simulated the components of lake water budgets and demonstrated that 70 of the mid summer inflow entering lakes were the result of lateral and subsurface flows thermokarst lakes have developed throughout the qtp due to persistent climate warming and wetting the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in regulating thermokarst lake evolution has only been indirectly inferred from water balance calculations gao et al 2018 pan et al 2017 wan et al 2019 yang et al 2016 for instance in the eastern qtp pan et al 2017 monitored and simulated the hydrological processes of two closed i e no surface runoff exchange and negligible groundwater leakage thermokarst lakes using a water balance model to explore the dynamics of the suprapermafrost groundwater they found that its contribution to discharge reached 22 during the ice season and 170 of the precipitation during the ice free season in some thermokarst lakes moreover the results from isotope mass balance models revealed that the mean contribution of suprapermafrost groundwater accounts for 60 of the total regional water resources in the qtp gao et al 2018 nevertheless little is known about the complex dynamics of suprapermafrost groundwater in the thermokarst lake region of the qtp to improve our understanding of the hydrological processes acting in thermokarst lakes with continuous permafrost a systematic monitoring scheme was employed for two consecutive years focusing on soil thawing processes suprapermafrost water tables soil hydraulic conductivities and lake water levels within a typical thermokarst lake setting of the qtp the major aims of this study were to 1 determine the flow processes of suprapermafrost groundwater 2 identify the hydrological processes involved in thermokarst lake water budgets in the qtp and 3 evaluate the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in regulating the water balance of thermokarst lakes the findings presented here are expected to enhance the understanding of solute transport dynamics and regional hydrological evolution on the qtp in the present and the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the beiluhe basin where thermokarst lakes are widely distributed was selected as the study area fig 1 the warmest and coldest months recorded between 1958 and 2018 were july 5 5 c and january 16 8 c respectively the mean annual precipitation is 300 mm and has increased at a rate of 22 mm decade more than 80 of the annual precipitation occurs as rainfall during the warm season june october westerly cold and dry air masses lead to a high mean annual potential evaporation of 1600 mm lin et al 2017 in the beiluhe basin permafrost is ice rich in the top few meters gravimetric moisture content 20 lin et al 2020 and the permafrost thickness is 50 120 m zhou et al 2000 based on long term measurement of soil temperature the active layer thickness in alpine ecosystems is 1 6 3 4 m and increases at a rate of 1 9 6 7 cm a wu et al 2015 alpine wet meadows alpine meadows and alpine steppes are the main vegetation types wherein the dominant species are kobresia tibetica kobresia humilis and carex moorcroftii respectively previously a thermokarst lake designated as blh a was investigated to study the thermal regime lin et al 2010 in this study another thermokarst lake designated as blh b was selected to study suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics in june of 2018 fig 1 the seasonal streamlets recharged and discharged the lake in the north south direction the average lake water area of blh b was 9100 m2 in the warm season with a maximum water depth of 1 83 m the north south diameter is 110 m during the warm season the total dissolved solids and ph in the blh b lake water ranged from 234 to 305 mg l 1 and 7 8 8 5 respectively the lake water was observed to freeze at the end of october and thaw in mid may while the maximum depth of lake ice was 60 70 cm huang et al 2019 2 2 continuous measurements around the studied thermokarst lake four transects were set in the four cardinal directions each transect consisted of two or three groundwater monitoring wells at distances from the lakeshore of 5 10 or 30 m fig 1 the groundwater monitoring wells are summarized in table 1 in the study area 3 m deep groundwater monitoring wells were constructed using a drilling machine with a 90 mm drill diameter a 60 mm diameter pvc pipe was installed into which 5 mm holes were pre augured down the entire length of the pipe packed with gauze and backfilled with native soil the bottom and top caps were cased wherein the top cap was perforated to maintain the same pressure between the atmosphere and the air in the pipe a hobo u20 001 04 pressure type water level data logger onset co usa was installed at a depth of 1 5 m to monitor the water tables at 0 5 h intervals at a resolution of 0 14 cm raw water table data were corrected using manually measured water tables owing to the harsh and cold environment and the lack of suprapermafrost groundwater flow in the cold season the data loggers were retrieved at the end of october and re installed in may thus two datasets 7 26 2018 11 9 2018 and 6 1 2019 10 26 2019 were obtained the locations and elevations of each monitoring well were measured using a global positioning system geoexplorer 6000 trimble navigation ltd usa and the relative elevation was corrected using a level gauge with an accuracy of 2 mm a weighing cumulative precipitation gauge t200b geonor inc usa was installed on the lake shore and recorded the precipitation at 0 5 h intervals with a measurement accuracy of 0 1 mm the wind induced uncaught solid precipitation was corrected using the method proposed by smith 2007 further an hobo mx2301 sensor onset co usa housed in a radiation shield and was installed at 1 5 m height over lake surface to measure air temperature and humidity in the study area the data were recorded continuously at 0 5 h intervals with a measurement accuracy of 0 21 c a radiometer also was installed above the lake water surface at a height of 1 5 m to measure the net daily radiation at the water surface cnr2 kipp zonen inc germany the ground thawing front determined the aquifer thickness in study area and the ground temperature was measured from the ground surface to a depth of 5 m using a string of thermistors in each transect a 5 m borehole was drilled 5 m away from the shoreline fig 1b and the thermistors were placed in the borehole and backfilled with native soil the thermistors were positioned as follows 0 05 m intervals at depths of 0 0 5 m 0 1 m intervals at depths of 0 5 1 5 m 0 25 m intervals at depths of 1 5 3 0 m and 0 5 m intervals at depths of 3 0 5 0 m the thermistors were manufactured by the state key laboratory of frozen soil engineering china and have an accuracy of 0 05 c a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific inc usa was used to automatically measure the ground temperature at 4 h intervals thus the thawing process was acquired for the northern eastern and southern transects via interpolation in 2019 however data were missing in the western transect because the power supply failed and the lost data were supplemented through interpolation in this study the thawing process of 2019 was used to calculate the aquifer thickness in 2018 and interannual variations were neglected 2 3 soil hydraulic conductivity from borehole nuclear magnetic resonance in this study soil hydraulic conductivity was determined in situ with a dart sensor vista clara inc usa which is based on a borehole nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique niu et al 2019 the principle of borehole nmr logging involves obtaining information on pore space geometries and water filled porosity which are used to estimate hydraulic conductivity dlubac et al 2013 because of its easy operation and high vertical resolution nmr logging is widely used to study hydraulic conductivity dlubac et al 2013 kleinberg and griffin 2005 niu et al 2019 the schlumberger doll research equation was adopted here to estimate soil hydraulic conductivity ksdr which is sensitive to thin low k beds and is expressed as follows 1 k sdr c ϕ m t 2 m l 2 where φ is the fractional porosity c and m are the lithologic constant and porosity exponent respectively and t2ml is the logarithmic mean of the t2 decay time distribution which is calculated as 2 t 2 m l exp σ a i ln t 2 i σ a i where ai is proportional to the total spins in the ith pore type which relaxes with decay time t2i in each transect around the thermokarst lake the strata were continuous from 2 0 m to the permafrost table thus the soil hydraulic conductivities were measured at depths of 0 2 m in particular a borehole with a depth of 2 m and diameter of 60 mm was drilled 5 m away from the shoreline in each transect a pvc probe with a diameter of 50 mm was placed in the borehole and the probe bottom was sealed to avoid water seepage a dart sensor was placed in the pvc probe to measure the soil hydraulic conductivity via the cylindrical shell diameter 15 2 cm in the soil surrounding the center of the probe at a 0 2 m vertical resolution to validate the results of soil hydraulic conductivities acquired using the borehole nmr technique undisturbed soil samples in different profiles were collected from the study sites and transported to the laboratory to measure the soil hydraulic conductivities using a permeameter under constant pressure tian et al 2017 2 4 detection of unfrozen water via surface nuclear magnetic resonance a gmrtm surface nmr instrument vista clara inc usa was used to detect unfrozen water content using a noninvasive and direct geophysical method however we could not detect ground ice because of the negligible signal the surface nmr technique is based on free induction decay experiments where an excitation pulse is emitted using large surface coil cables and the relaxation signals are recorded müller petke et al 2011 therefore the maximum detection depth is close to the diameter of the surface coil cable prior to our measurements the nuclear spins in the water were in equilibrium due to alignment by earth s background magnetic field an oscillating electromagnetic pulse at the larmor frequency which is related to the gyromagnetic ratio specific to hydrogen nuclei and the magnitude of the local background magnetic field was generated in the surface coil cables to perturb the equilibrium of the nuclear spins once the electromagnetic pulse was turned off the rotary motion of the net magnetization emitted another electromagnetic field while the spins relaxed to their equilibrium states the amplitude of the relaxation signal decay time t 2 which is related to the volumetric water content was recorded from the surface coil cables the existence of significant dead time between the shutdown of the electromagnetic pulses and signal recording 5 ms for the gmr restrict the surface nmr from detecting short relaxation time signals thus clay bound water and ground ice content could not be acquired the current and duration of the electromagnetic pulse moment increased with increasing detection depth additional details regarding the principles of surface nmr were given in previous studies by müller petke et al 2011 legchenko 2013 and behroozmand et al 2015 in this study a 70 m square loop located on the blh b lakeshore was used to detect the vertical distribution of unfrozen water earth s magnetic field was calculated using the world magnetic model acquired from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration http www ngdc noaa gov geomag web igrfwmm noise canceling loops were set to measure ambient noise as the qinghai tibet railway was located near the study region during post processing the ambient noise was subtracted from the data measured on the transmitter receiver coil raw data were imported to the gmr business software and band pass filtered and digital noise compensation was subsequently applied finally the unfrozen volumetric water content was interpreted 2 5 determination of suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes the suprapermafrost groundwater flux was estimated using darcy s law which is expressed as follows 3 q n z 0 z b k i h d z 4 q n q n l n where qn is the discharge of suprapermafrost groundwater to the thermokarst lake per unit width in the n direction per meter m2 d 1 ki is the soil

runoff mm d 1 that was calculated from the water balance equation qsg is the suprapermafrost groundwater flux mm d 1 qws is lake water seepage mm d 1 and δw is the change in lake water volume mm d 1 which was acquired from the changes in the depth of the lake water as the lake area varied little with water depth the variation in lake area was neglected in our calculations the open water evaporation during the ice free season ew mm d 1 was estimated according to the penman equation penman 1948 6 e w 1 ρ w δ δ γ r n g λ γ δ γ e a where ew is the daily evaporation in an open water body

follows 8 f u 2 6 1 0 54 u 2 where u 2 is the wind speed m s 1 at a height of 2 m and f u is given in mm d 1 kpa 1 according to the methods of finch 2001 and mcmahon et al 2013 we calculated the daily changes in the heat storage of the water body g in eq 4 as follows 9 g ρ w c w h w i t w t where ρw and cw are the density kg m 3 and specific heat of water mj kg 1 c 1 respectively hw i is the water

measured long wave downward and upward radiations w m 2 respectively ε is the surface emissivity ε 0 02 at the water surface and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 wm 2 k 4 the daily lake water seepage qws in equation 5 was assumed to be constant in the ice free and ice covered seasons and calculated as follows 11 q ws p s e ic δ w ic d where ps is the total precipitation in an ice covered season mm eic is the total sublimation mm δwic is the decreased water level throughout the ice covered season mm and d is the number of days in the ice covered season d in this study the lake water level decreased by 330 mm in the ice covered season of 2018 2019 the daily sublimation was roughly estimated according to the method of kuchment and gelfan 1996 which was determined as the product of an empirical wind function and the atmospheric saturation deficit as a result the total lake ice sublimation was estimated to be 201 mm during this period which was consistent with the results of pan et al 2017 moreover the total precipitation was 28 mm in this period thus the lake ice water seepage qws was estimated to be 0 8 mm d 1 which was regarded as a constant in the lake water balance evaluation 3 results 3 1 soil hydraulic conductivity in the active layer in the active soil layer alpine grass roots were mainly distributed within the top 0 6 m and the soil structure was very loose due to the existence of fine sands and organic matter om in depths of 0 6 1 0 m coarse sands with gravel were distributed in the northern and southern transects while sandy loam was dominant in the eastern and western transects silty clay was distributed from 1 0 m to 2 0 m in the study area except in western transect where the soil was dominated by coarse sands and gravel fig 2 this variety of soil types promoted strong spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivities fig 2 on the ground surface higher soil om contents promoted higher soil hydraulic conductivities ranging from 1 07 to 2 05 m d 1 in the northern transect soil hydraulic conductivities were enhanced at depths of 0 6 1 1 m and a maximum of 2 6 m d 1 achieved at 0 8 m however conductivities in the eastern transect gradually decreased with increasing depth in the soil profile in the southern transect conductivities increased from the ground surface to a depth of 0 8 m with the highest values recorded at depths of 0 5 1 0 m in the western transect soil hydraulic conductivities were high throughout the profile with values exceeding 1 47 m d 1 at depths of 1 4 1 8 m this was attributed to the existence of a coarse sand with gravel layer therefore soil hydraulic conductivity strongly depended on the local distribution of different strata porous om promoted water migration in the top active layer and later subsurface flows readily formed because of the permeability of the silty clay stratum however the stratigraphic distribution of the coarse sand with gravel facilitated the south and westward flow of suprapermafrost groundwater comparing the estimated hydraulic conductivities from the laboratory permeameter klp and nmr knmr fig 2d we found that the knmr values were just slightly lower than the klp values at the same magnitude indicating that the knmr and klp values were in good agreement 3 2 seasonal dynamics of suprapermafrost water tables as shown in fig 3 the water tables were shallow in the study area and were often only 1 m deep especially in the western transect wherein the entire active layer was nearly saturated fig 3 the water tables exhibited sharp fluctuations in the rainy season indicating that the suprapermafrost groundwater was readily affected by local meteorological conditions consistent with the distribution of rainfall water tables were deeper before august and shallower between august and early october however the water table began to decrease rapidly as the topsoil froze beginning on october 10th the response regime of the water table to external meteorological conditions also varied between the study sites due to the spatiotemporal heterogeneities in vegetation and soil properties within the active layer on an interannual scale water table fluctuations were stronger in 2019 than in 2018 the suprapermafrost water table changed synchronously with lake water levels in the warm season fig 4 indicating either that suprapermafrost groundwater is the main resource of lake water or that they are recharged by the same water resource 3 3 suprapermafrost groundwater flow around a thermokarst lake the fluxes in suprapermafrost groundwater varied substantially across different spatiotemporal scales fig 5 the northern and western transects were the dominant inflow directions while the southern transect was the main outflow direction a finding that is consistent with the topographic features of the study area fig 1 however the exchange of suprapermafrost groundwater and thermokarst lake water was bidirectional in the eastern transect under the impact of freeze thaw processes vegetation and stratigraphic distributions and microtopographic characteristics suprapermafrost groundwater was developed from june 1st to july 8th when the active layer thawed to a depth of 0 5 0 8 m and ceased near the end of october when the ground surface froze for the primary inflow and outflow directions western and southern transects the onsets of suprapermafrost groundwater were extended as summer progressed groundwater flow increased because the saturated zone tended to thicken as the thaw depth increased table 2 however the lower permeability of the silty clay layer caused groundwater flow to fluctuate drastically depending upon the prevailing meteorological conditions suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes per unit width ranged from 0 02 0 08 m3 d 1 in 2018 and from 0 01 0 06 m3 d 1 in 2019 in the northern transect these fluxes were closely related to the annual rainfall distribution compared with the northern transect little exchange of suprapermafrost groundwater occurred in the eastern transect in 2018 however the fluxes in this transect fluctuated near 0 015 m3 d 1 in 2019 and rapidly declined to 0 005 m3 d 1 by the end of august of that year in the southern transect suprapermafrost groundwater recharged lake water at the end of july but continual rainfall promoted lake water discharge and supplied the groundwater rendering the relatively stable fluxes the values were 0 05 m3 d 1 owing to active layer saturation in 2018 in 2019 the groundwater fluxes were slightly greater in the western transect suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes were lower before august which was attributable to the porous om and gravel strata in the active layer subsequently the fluxes reached 0 08 m3 d 1 in september 4 discussion 4 1 dominant factors controlling suprapermafrost groundwater flow dynamics as a type of interflow suprapermafrost groundwater flow is susceptible to the influence of climatic factors and soil hydrological properties which can lead to drastic fluctuations in water tables and fluxes during the warm season as shown in fig 6 the correlation coefficients between the water flux and thawing depth aquifer thickness and water table gradually increased from june to october the thawing depth and water table were found to be the two vital factors that determined aquifer thickness and thus affected the water flux freeze thaw cycles in the active layer play a decisive role in groundwater recharge movement discharge and cycles in cold regions quinton et al 2005 after complete freezing soil water content in the active layer declines significantly as the thawing period begins when compared with the water content before freezing hu et al 2009 soil water is recharged by rainfall in the shallow layer and consumed during evapotranspiration thereby decreasing soil water linkages wright et al 2008 suprapermafrost groundwater flow began between june and july when the active layer thawed to depths of 0 5 0 8 m the frozen active layer could effectively block soil water infiltration and was considered to be an aquitard which rapidly increased the water table during initial ablation fig 4 moreover suprapermafrost groundwater discharge began to cease at the end of october as the ground surface froze and water fluxes exhibited exponential or linear decreases with ongoing active layer freezing which is consistent with the results of wang et al 2017 previous studies have indicated that the relationship between suprapermafrost water tables and soil temperatures may be described by boltzmann functions chang et al 2015a with continued climate warming and permafrost degradation some studies have demonstrated that there will be more suprapermafrost groundwater flow in the active layer thereby increasing groundwater discharge to lakes and rivers ge et al 2011 while these results are greatly dependent upon precipitation conditions the area of thermokarst lakes is projected to expand in the future previous isotope and geochemical studies have shown that suprapermafrost groundwater originates from the infiltration of precipitation and the contribution of precipitation to groundwater exceeds 80 in active layer ablation periods li et al 2020a however the groundwater flux was not obviously correlated with the precipitation amount in this study due to the delayed reaction and interception in unsaturated topsoil layers fig 6 moreover suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes depend on deeper soil water contents which change the infiltration in deeper soils dai et al 2019 model forecasts have indicated that suprapermafrost groundwater is likely to increase by 2 5 2 6 when precipitation increases by 10 20 per year chang et al 2015b although the melting of ground ice has proven to be an important source of suprapermafrost groundwater no obvious increase has been demonstrated in the fluxes at the end of the ablation period fig 5 this was attributed to the low contribution of ground ice meltwater to groundwater which was negated by variations in the water table and thus did not cause an obvious increase in saturation thickness the correlation coefficients between the suprapermafrost groundwater flux and thawing depth aquifer thickness and water table indicated significant differences between the four transects fig 6 this suggests that local factors including vegetation soil texture stratal type and topography are essential for controlling the soil hydraulic conductivity and significantly affect suprapermafrost groundwater discharge local topography also had a controlling effect on land surface temperatures which should not be ignored when suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics are simulated huang et al 2020 4 2 estimation of thermokarst lake water balance the hydrological processes in the studied thermokarst lake water balance during 2018 2019 are shown in fig 7 net surface runoff open water evaporation lake volume and suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes varied simultaneously with precipitation during the rainy season the contributions of suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes to thermokarst lake water volume were often 1 4 mm d 1 though these values were higher later in the warm season throughout the warm season suprapermafrost groundwater contributed 60 mm to thermokarst lake water fig 8 however these contributions depended strongly on rainfall events and exhibited obvious interannual variability the values reported here were lower than those in previous studies gao et al 2018 pan et al 2017 yang et al 2016 which were mainly focused on closed thermokarst lakes and neglected surface runoff and lake water leakage the dry warm and windy climate of the study area also increased lake water loss via evaporation which lowered the lake water level from 1 2 mm d 1 to 7 5 mm d 1 in the warm season the recharge of precipitation and suprapermafrost groundwater to lake could not offset the water consumed via evaporation fig 8 compared to the contributions of suprapermafrost groundwater to the studied thermokarst lake the results of the water balance model revealed that surface runoff is the dominant factor that determines the changes in lake water levels fig 7 during the initial ablation period surface runoff readily formed because of the lower water loss through infiltration and evapotranspiration which rapidly increased the water level of the lake fig 4 for instance the net surface runoff raised the lake level by nearly 0 18 m on june 19 of 2019 following a period of continuous rainfall meanwhile surface outflow formed in the southern transect when lake water levels exceeded the elevation of the ground surface thus the net surface runoff fluctuated drastically under the impact of rainfall in the warm season the net surface runoff contributed approximately 55 to 180 mm d 1 to the lake water it should be noted that the net surface runoff estimated from the water balance model contains substantial uncertainty which originated from the estimates of suprapermafrost groundwater water surface evaporation and lake water leakage as well as the observations of precipitation and lake water levels the surface inflow and outflow will be monitored to clarify the contributions of different hydrological components to the lake water balance in future studies 4 3 effect of permafrost degradation on suprapermafrost groundwater discharge suprapermafrost groundwater is sensitive to climate warming because of the restriction of water as a result of the permafrost layer it was found that an open talik formed below the thermokarst lake due to the frequent exchange of lake water and surface runoff although the shallow aquifer thickness and lower permeability of the local soil types led to lesser amounts of suprapermafrost groundwater around the thermokarst lake suprapermafrost groundwater discharge is likely to continue increasing under the impact of persistent climatic warming and wetting on the lakeshore surface nmr analyses revealed that the amount of unfrozen water was relatively low with values 6 these results were consistent with those of yoshikawa and overduin 2005 who demonstrated that the unfrozen water content ranged from 1 to 10 for silt samples based on laboratory nmr analyses moreover the unfrozen water in this study was dominated by gravitational water t 2 33 ms fig 9 which indicates that thick ice rich permafrost was widely distributed the melting of the ground ice deepened the active layer and more water was transformed into suprapermafrost groundwater via surface runoff thus the recharge of the thermokarst lake from suprapermafrost groundwater will likely increase especially in the western transect because of the loose soil structure of the active layer fig 2 the results of this study revealed the mechanisms underlying suprapermafrost groundwater flow and exchange around a thermokarst lake on the qtp however the robust spatiotemporal heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivities generated uncertainty when establishing suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics additionally the estimated thermokarst lake water balance contains a large degree of uncertainty due to the lack of measured surface runoff therefore future research on thermokarst lake water balances should explicitly include multiple environmental factors 5 conclusions suprapermafrost groundwater flows and exchanges on the qtp have been poorly studied despite their potential role in regulating regional hydrological processes fluvial energy budgets and the fates of carbon and nutrients in this study a series of field based measurements were conducted to explore the suprapermafrost groundwater flows around a thermokarst lake on the qtp and to evaluate the role of suprapermafrost groundwater in the thermokarst lake water balance the main findings were as follows 1 soil hydraulic conductivities exhibited substantial variability across different spatial scales porous om promoted water migration in the top active layer and later subsurface flows readily formed because of the permeability of the silty clay layer however the distribution of a coarse sand stratum facilitated suprapermafrost groundwater flow in certain regions 2 suprapermafrost water tables fluctuated sharply during the rainy season with similar trends observed in the initial 1 0 m below the ground surface the water tables were susceptible to local weather conditions but greatly declined as the topsoil froze at the end of october 3 restricted by the lower permeability of the active layer soils suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes were relatively minor often 0 1 m3 d 1 per meter of width and the dynamics were influenced by the thawing depth and rainfall events nonetheless the responses of suprapermafrost groundwater to rainfall were complex because of interception by the upper active layer soil and vegetation 4 in the studied thermokarst lake the contribution of suprapermafrost groundwater fluxes to lake water were often 1 4 mm d 1 though these values were higher later in the warm season precipitation and suprapermafrost groundwater recharge of the lake could not offset the water consumed during evaporation at the annual scale moreover surface runoff in initial warm season was the dominant water resource in some open areas of the lake and the frequent exchange between surface runoff and lake water accelerated the degradation of permafrost beneath lake suprapermafrost groundwater dynamics are likely to become more complex with continued climatic warming and wetting as well as permafrost degradation thus more attention should be paid to these issues in the future

4973,in the emergent anthropocene interactions among water supply power generation and environment wpe systems are increasingly prominent due to the impact of human activity the understanding of which calls for a holistic and dynamic coevolutionary perspective therefore inspired by the nexus approach this study investigates these three systems integrated as a wpe coupling system this paper aims to construct a system dynamics model from the perspective of socio hydrology in order to predict and understand the coevolution trajectories and dynamics of the wpe coupling system firstly the system dynamics model which comprises the conceptual stock and flow diagrams and stylized models is constructed to describe the dynamics of state variables of the wpe system then the model is implemented in the wpe system of the upper yangtze river basin of china results show that 1 the system dynamics model which considers two way feedbacks is capable of modeling the coevolution of the wpe system and provides a powerful tool for exploring and understanding the emergent properties of the system 2 the interrelation between economic development and environmental health is not entirely contradictory however if the economic development scale is not limited their relationship will gradually evolve in the direction of contradiction and 3 model parameters not only affect the timing and magnitude of the evolution trajectories of state variables but also their evolution patterns these observations obtained by modeling interactions across different systems are insightful improving our understanding of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system keywords system dynamics model socio hydrology coevolution coupling system upper yangtze river basin 1 introduction human history can be written in terms of the interactions and interrelations between humans and water elshafei et al 2014 during the anthropocene humans have exerted an unprecedented effect on the natural environment crutzen 2002 and interactions between humans and the environment are occurring on an unprecedented scale blair and buytaert 2016 human activities such as the construction of dams and reservoirs changes of land use and discharge of pollutants have contributed to significant changes to water systems at the watershed scale li et al 2019 savenije et al 2014 thompson et al 2013 presently the fact that humans water and the natural environment are linked through mutual interaction falkenmark 1977 has been widely recognized and accepted blair and buytaert 2016 consequently how to consider these interactions in decision making models to improve water resource management decisions has become a common concern of water scientists and decision makers montanari et al 2013 fresh water is one of the most precious and critical natural resources that is required to maintain the sustainable development of life human production and the environment however since modern times the rapid development of human economy and society including economic and population growth and the intensification of agricultural and industrial activities have led to and accelerated the exploitation of fresh water globally chen et al 2020 if humans do not implement effective water resource management measures competition among various water use applications will become increasingly intense in the future moreover electric energy is also one of the most important resources required to ensure human production and life with the gradual increases in social and economic development scales the global power demand will increase from 25 000 twh in 2017 to about 38 700 twh in 2050 driving new investments in the expansion of power generation capacity chen et al 2020 as a promising renewable energy hydropower is poised to become the main driving force for power generation capacity growth pazheri et al 2014 particularly in china where hydropower potential remains significant national hydropower development will become the main driving force for global hydropower development z feng et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 however under the stress of intense water related and power related human activities global environmental problems are becoming increasingly prominent and addressing this has become a primary concern in water resource management williams 2011 reasonable and reliable water resource management can effectively alleviate competition between productive and domestic water use and ecological and environmental water demand as well as promote the recovery and improvement of environmental water systems in fact regarding water resource system and natural environment system sustainability relevant global policies and management decisions have gradually emphasized the importance of environmental water needs and allocations despite the increasing demand for basic resources such as food water and energy chen et al 2020 undoubtedly the allocation use and management of water resources has a significant impact on the quality of human production and life as well as ecological and environmental health chen et al 2020 with the gradual intensification of human activities particularly the large scale development of water conservancy projects the interactions of water supply power generation and the environment are prominent chen et al 2019 and jointly support and affect social progress and economic development therefore to coordinate the contradiction between human water use and environmental water demand while promoting the sustainable development of social economies ecology and the environment it is necessary to analyze water supply power generation and environment in the water resource system as a whole m feng et al 2016 2019 a full understanding of the interaction and interrelationship among water supply power generation and environment systems will effectively assist in policy development and decision making for water resource management chen et al 2019 there are distinctive interactions and feedbacks between humans and water specifically among water supply power generation and environment systems understanding these calls for a holistic and dynamic coevolutionary perspective hale et al 2015 li et al 2019 sivapalan et al 2012 srinivasan et al 2017 thompson et al 2013 in recent years focusing on the complex interconnections and interdependences across different systems a new approach has been proposed called the nexus approach hoff 2011 in order to understand the dynamics and coevolution of the coupled human water system socio hydrology a new science which can study and represent the relationships between water and humans more deeply has emerged nearly simultaneously sivapalan et al 2012 although the research objects of the nexus approach and socio hydrology theory are not identical their essence is similar to analyze the interactions and interrelationship across different systems from the perspective of whole and dynamic evolution in recent years many researchers have applied either the nexus approach or social hydrology theory to study various complex coupling systems in order to cope with the substantial pressure of global climate change and social hydrological change on water food and energy resources the international community posited the concept of the water food energy nexus and has conducted in depth research on this subject biggs et al 2015 chini and stillwell 2018 conway et al 2015 hoff 2011 lawford et al 2013 leck et al 2015 nhamo et al 2018 scanlon et al 2017 siddiqi and anadon 2011 zhang et al 2018 considering the complex interdependence and interconnection among water supply power generation and environment systems feng et al 2016 described the three systems as a nexus wpe nexus and modeled the wpe nexus in the hehuang region of china with the research paradigm of socio hydrology which promoted the understanding of interactions across systems in the tarim river basin in western china and the murrumbidgee river basin in eastern australia there is an intense competition for water between economic development and ecological health applications leading to the phenomena known as pendulum swing van emmerik et al 2014 liu et al 2014 this phenomenon is difficult to capture using traditional hydrologic models which regard human behaviors as the boundary conditions sivapalan and blöschl 2015 therefore van emmerik et al 2014 liu et al 2014 and liu et al 2015 conducted detailed modeling studies of this phenomenon from the perspective of socio hydrology in order to understand the coevolution of human flood systems in urban areas baldassarre et al 2013 baldassarre et al 2015 and lopez et al 2017 developed stylized models this type of model can generally represent interactions between humans and water and provide insight into the interaction and dynamics involved in coupling systems li et al 2019 water supply power generation and environment systems are intrinsically linked by a human interfered water cycle feng et al 2016 m sivapalan et al 2012 2014 how to analyze and understand the interactions among water supply power generation and environment systems is an urgent problem to be solved in this study considering the interaction among water supply power generation and environment and by drawing on the core idea of the nexus method these three systems are regarded as a whole namely the wpe coupling system on this basis with the holistic and dynamic coevolutionary perspective advocated by the socio hydrology serving as methodology we aim to construct a system dynamics model to predict and understand the coevolution behavior of the wpe coupling system which we believe can provide decision making basis for adaptive management of water resources the system dynamics modeling approach is one of the most effective approaches to constructing the socio hydrological model blair and buytaert 2016 feng et al 2016 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in addition other commonly used modeling methods include agent based modeling and system modeling blair and buytaert 2016 although these three methods are able to model the complex characteristics of the coupled system due to the better flexibility of the system dynamics modeling and its advantages in capturing the long term evolution characteristics of the complex system feng et al 2016 we use the system dynamics method to model the wpe coupling system the system dynamics model also known as the stylized model uses a differential equation to represent the dynamics of each state variable in the coupled system feng et al 2016 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in other words the system dynamics model can describe the dynamics of the coupled system through a set of ordinary differential equations the specific modeling steps of the system dynamics approach have been summarized by sivapalan and blöschl 2015 finally it is worth mentioning that although feng et al 2016 have carried out surprising and insightful modeling research on the nexus across water supply power generation and environment systems in the hehuang region of china as the author stated their research is a simplistic paradigm of low complexity modeling of the wpe nexus which requires further improvement in addition there are several significant differences between the present study and that conducted by feng et al 1 firstly a representative river basin the upper yangtze river basin is taken as the study area 2 secondly the impact of climate change on the coevolution of the wpe coupling system is considered 3 thirdly the evolution process of reservoir construction in the basin is considered 4 fourthly the stress effect of reservoir construction on the environment system in the basin is considered 5 further we identify the variables in the wpe coupling system and their causal relationships and interactions in a more comprehensive and detailed manner 6 the impact of family planning policy and population aging on the evolution of population in the basin is considered and 7 finally we obtain insightful meaningful and novel results not previously obtained in this study we aim to construct a system dynamics model to predict and understand the coevolution trajectories and its dynamics of the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the basic information of the study area and its water supply power generation and environment systems are described in detail followed by a summary of the data sources needed for model development and testing in section 3 the wpe coupling system is first conceptualized as a model then refined into a stock and flow diagram sfd model which is further formulated as several coupled ordinary differential equations i e stylized model before calibration in section 4 the system dynamics model is validated and its application to predict possible future coevolution trajectories of the wpe coupling system is presented then the coevolution and its dynamics of the wpe system are analyzed and interpreted further implications for future water resource management are discussed finally sensitivity analysis of model parameters is presented in section 5 the conclusions are drawn 2 study area wpe system description and data used 2 1 study area the upper yangtze river basin is taken as study area fig 1 the upper reaches of the yangtze river refers to the section from the source of the yangtze river to yichang city in hubei province with a total length of approximately 4500 km chai et al 2019 its catchment area is approximately 1 0 million km2 accounting for about 58 of the catchment area of the yangtze river the annual average precipitation of the basin is about 854 2 billion m3 and the annual average water resource i e annual average runoff is about 429 6 billion m3 in addition the basin releases annually an average outflow of about 411 8 billion m3 to the downstream basin and the outlet is located at the yc hydrologic station fig 1 2 2 description of the wpe coupling system in study area the water supply system is an important part of the wpe coupling system with the rapid socio economic development of the upper yangtze river basin the demand for and consumption of water resources as well as the discharge of waste water have been increasing from 1998 to 2017 the total population in this basin increased from 152 3131 million to 164 3317 million the annual total water use increased from 35 2 billion m3 to 45 964 billion m3 the annual total water consumption increased from 16 544 billion m3 to 19 929 billion m3 the annual power generation increased from 94 214 billion kwh to 647 379 billion kwh and the gross domestic product gdp of the basin increased from 643 662 billion rmb to 7246 445 billion rmb however the growth of social wealth was accompanied with the gradual pollution of the water environment for example the annual sewage discharge amount increased from 4 095 billion tons to 7 862 billion tons from 1998 to 2017 the power generation system is another important part of the wpe coupling system the types of electrical energy used in this basin include thermal power hydropower wind power and solar power among which annual hydropower generation increased from 44 307 billion kwh in 1998 to 455 407 billion kwh in 2017 wind power and solar power generation increased from 0 0078 billion to 21 56 billion kwh and annual thermal power generation increased from 49 89 billion to 170 407 billion kwh in 2017 hydropower accounted for 70 of all energy consumption dominating the energy structure of the basin the basin s hydropower resources are relatively rich accounting for about one third of national hydropower resources it features five out of china s thirteen hydropower bases zhou et al 2015 namely the jinsha river yalong river dadu river and wujiang hydropower bases and the upper reaches of the yangtze river hydropower base for these bases large scale reservoir groups have been planned constructed and put into operation z feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 the environment system is the third important part of the wpe coupling system the intense water related and power related human activities have been exerting a negative impact on the environment system endangering the sustainable development of the social economy in this basin environmental problems in this basin have aroused great concern from policy makers and all sectors of society and the overall environmental awareness of the basin community has been increasing in order to restore and protect the water ecology and water environment the basin community has been actively promoting the development of the green industry the technological innovation of ecological environment protection and the construction of water resource management systems to ensure sustainable economic and social development since 2011 the ministry of water resources in china implemented a strategy of adaptive water management based on three red lines of control water resource quantity control water use efficiency control and waste water quantity control xia et al 2012 this approach has promoted the process of basin ecological and environmental protection from 1998 to 2017 the level of water saving technology and sewage treatment technology in this basin was gradually improved for example the productive water uses per 10 000 rmb of gdp decreased from 486 28 m3 to 50 49 m3 and the water consumption rate decreased from 0 47 to 0 41 which effectively supported the economic development and environment protection of the basin undoubtedly the human and water systems in this basin especially the water supply power generation and environment systems are increasingly interacting with each other exhibiting complex interactions and feedbacks and are interconnected as a wpe coupling system from different perspectives this wpe coupling system shows the characteristics of coevolution blair and buytaert 2016 liu et al 2014 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 feedback dynamic complexity sivapalan and blöschl 2015 and complex adaptability blair and buytaert 2016 levin et al 2013 therefore under changing environments in order to realize the adaptive management of water resources and promote the coordinated and orderly development of the water supply power generation and environment systems it is necessary to understand and predict future trajectories of coevolution of this wpe coupling system by using system dynamics approach 2 3 data used for modeling the wpe coupling system historical statistical data on hydrology society economy water conservancy and electricity are the fundamental data used for calibrating and validating the model at present the changjiang and southwest rivers water resources bulletin covering 1998 2017 only has been published so our model is limited to data from 1998 to 2017 after the system dynamics model is developed and tested the possible future trajectories of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system during 2018 2050 will be predicted that is to say the simulation period of this system dynamics model is 1998 2017 while the prediction period is 2018 2050 the data used and their sources are presented in detail in supplementary material text s1 and table s1 3 model description in this study we aim to predict and understand the coevolution trajectories and its dynamics of the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin using the system dynamics model which is able to provide a decision making basis for adaptive management of water resources following the question driven modeling process proposed by garcia et al 2016 the possible steps of framing and modeling human water interactions summarized by sivapalan and blöschl 2015 and the system dynamics modeling approach blair and buytaert 2016 firstly the conceptual model of wpe coupling system is constructed by identifying the key elements and their causal relationships secondly based on the conceptual model the state variables rate variables auxiliary variables constants or model parameters and exogenous variables are identified further the sfd model for the wpe coupling system is constructed in which all variables are interconnected by positive and negative feedbacks then according to the sfd model seven coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations or governing equations are formulated to describe the variations of state variables of wpe coupling system which constitute a stylized model for the wpe coupling system finally in order to complete the system dynamics model the constitutive relations in the stylized model are estimated according to the observed data and the model parameters are calibrated this system dynamics modeling process i e from conceptual model to stylized model is a typical top down modeling process blair and buytaert 2016 the modeling procedure in this study is shown in fig 2 3 1 conceptual model the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin is a typical socio hydrological system in the upper yangtze river basin the development and utilization of water resources such as water supply water use and water consumption promote social and economic development and sustained population growth in turn the continuous expansion of economic scale also stimulates more intense water resource development activities certainly there is a positive feedback relationship between the exploitation of water resources and the development of the social economy in addition electrical energy is one of the incentive sources of social and economic development and there is also a positive feedback relationship between them however with the increasing intensity of human activities the river basin environment gradually worsens which in turn affects humans environmental awareness the rise of environmental awareness not only has a certain inhibitory effect on production activities in the basin but also promotes community based reparations of the basin environment as well as the restoration and improvement of the environment system according to the above dynamics hypotheses about the underlying causes of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system the conceptual model also known as a perceptual model or causal loop diagram model that describes the wpe coupling system is constructed and shown in fig 3 in this model the arrow curve is a causal feedback linkage which indicates that there is a causal relationship between the elements at both ends the non arrow end of the causal linkage is the cause and the arrow end is the result in this conceptual model of the wpe coupling system there are two types of causal feedback loops the first is the positive feedback loop such as reservoir project water supply capacity total water supply socio economic conditions power and water demand reservoir project this type of causal loop represents the feedbacks between the socio economic development and the exploitation of water resources the second type is the negative feedback loop such as reservoir project basin environment conditions environmental awareness power and water demand reservoir project the negative feedback loops mainly represent the feedback among socio economic development water resource exploitation environmental awareness of the basin community and environmental conditions in the basin the key components are the three types of causal linkages which are respectively the environmental conditions response linkage environmental awareness response linkage and environmental awareness action linkage and correspond to the blue purple and red arrow line in fig 3 respectively the environmental condition response linkage describes the one way feedback between environmental health state and human activities such as water supply and power generation the environmental awareness response linkage represents the one way feedback between environmental awareness of human community and health state of environment system the environmental awareness action linkage describes the one way feedback between environmental awareness and human activities and the coupling of these three kinds of causal linkages describes the two way feedbacks among water supply power generation and environment systems 3 2 stock and flow diagram model on the basis of identifying the essential system components and their interactions by the above conceptual model the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin can be further divided into six primary components reservoirs human community ecology and environment social economy science and technology and power plants humans extract water from reservoirs and obtain electric power from the power plant in order to satisfy water and power demands for production and living which promote the development of the social economy that is the social economy benefits from water supply and power generation systems for the water supply system part of the water used for production and living is used consumptively and part is returned into the surrounding environment carrying contaminants feng et al 2016 with the growth of the social economy the growing water demand urges human communities to develop water resources and build reservoirs so as to address water shortage for the power generation system power plants include hydropower and non hydropower plants the water used for hydropower plants is nearly non consumptive while the non hydropower plants such as thermal wind and photoelectric plants will consume minimal water for technical use feng et al 2016 although hydropower plants release little waste water the construction of reservoirs and dams for hydropower result in the channelization of natural rivers and fragmentation of the ecological environment which would cause the deterioration of ecology and the environment with the growth of the social economy the growing power demand drives human communities to construct hydropower plants or reservoir dams and other types of power plants additionally in order to reduce power and water demand the human community actively invests in the development of science and technology so as to improve efficiency of water usage and power usage for the environment system the ecology and environment in upper yangtze river basin which broadly covers vegetation animals microorganisms water environment and land environment is cultivated by the untapped water however deteriorated by the released waste water and the channelization effect of reservoir dams as the environment deteriorates environmental awareness increases gradually human activities are inhibited to some extent and water environment treatments and waste water treatment technology are developed rapidly according to the above conceptualization of the wpe coupling system seven state variables and other variables including rate variables auxiliary variables constants and exogenous variables are identified then the sfd model of the wpe coupling system is established fig 4 the sfd model shows in detail the feedbacks among all variables in addition corresponding to the conceptual model of wpe coupling system there are also three kinds of key causal linkages in the sfd model the red blue and purple causal linkages shown in fig 4 in the sfd model the seven state variables include basin water resources environmental conditions i e the health state of environment system environmental awareness scientific and technological level comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs population size and gross basin product gbp i e gdp of the basin basin water resources is defined as the total water storage i e the total runoff in the upper yangtze river basin at a given time due to the lack of quantification monitoring and evaluation of the local and overall water ecology and environment of the basin xia et al 2018 environmental conditions are defined in a broad sense and used to indicate abstractly and macroscopically the state of health of the environment system environmental awareness as first proposed by van emmerik et al 2014 is introduced to denote the response of human community to environment conditions to better model the interconnections between human activities and the environment system scientific and technological level is used to indicate the capacity of the human community for water resource exploitation and water environment treatment and it depend on the social economy in the basin and environmental awareness comprehensive effective water head of reservoir is defined to represent the status of reservoir construction the reservoirs in the basin are able to store water for human activities such as water supply and power generation due to the abundant hydropower resources in the upper yangtze river basin the reservoirs also play an extremely important role in the power generation system in addition the reason the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs is chosen as the state variable is that it also roughly reflects the water supply capacity of the water supply system and the power generation capacity of the power generation system at the same time population size is identified as the size of the human community to which domestic water demand is primarily related gbp is adopted to describe the scale of the economy to which both water and power demands are primarily related in the sfd model state variables auxiliary variables constants and rate variables are endogenous collectively known as endogenous variables these endogenous variables are used to describe the system interior while the exogenous variables are used to describe the system environment therefore the endogenous variables are usually unknown while exogenous variables are known input conditions in fig 4 the endogenous and exogenous variables are presented in different forms they are 1 state variables denoted within black rectangles such as environmental awareness in fig 4c 2 rate variables shown below funnel shaped figures such as growth rate of environmental awareness in fig 4c 3 constants variables with outflow arrows and no inflow arrows such as runoff coefficient in fig 4a 4 exogenous variables i e precipitation policy impact factor aging factor and planned growth rate of gbp as shown in fig 4a 4f and 4g respectively and 5 auxiliary variables shown with inflow arrows and outflow arrows except for the exogenous variables such as water resource carrying capacity in fig 4f in addition the variable with angled bracket is a shadow variable and it is the shadow of the variable defined elsewhere and has the same meaning the original variable the purpose of defining shadow variables is to make the model look clearer and not confusing in addition the state variables are the backbone of the sfd model while all other variables are mainly used to represent more intuitively and simply the mutual feedback relationships between state variables more specifically the auxiliary variables are intermediate being directly affected by other variables and their functional relationship can be called a constitutive relation the rate variable is also intermediate and represents the rate not the ratio of change of state variables the exogenous variable represents the external driver which is not affected by endogenous variables the constant variables also are not affected by other variables and can be considered the model parameters usually the feedback of other variables or the state variable itself on each of the state variables are achieved by directly acting on the rate variables of the state variables as shown in fig 4 3 3 governing equations following the conceptual and sfd models a stylized model is constructed the system dynamics model of the wpe coupling system is formulated as seven nonlinear ordinary differential equations each of which describes the dynamics of the corresponding state variable in essence these differential equations are the mathematical representation of complex interconnections in the sfd model feng et al 2016 and describe the feedback between the state variables as well as the effects of the external forcing sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in order to construct the stylized model more conveniently all variables in the sdf model are abbreviated as shown in appendix a in this study the unit of time is year and all variables are defined in terms of a one year time step 3 3 1 hydrology equation the hydrology equation simulates the dynamics of water resources quantity of the upper yangtze river basin as shown in fig 4a the basin water resource bw r s is determined by precipitation p e bwr and runoff coefficient r c c bwr which is represented as follows 1 bw r s p e bwr r c c bwr where the funopture precipitation p e bwr can be estimated by applying the ncep reanalysis datasets sdsm and global climate model canesm2 which have been shown to be applicable for the upper yangtze river basin by chu et al 2015 and zhong et al 2020 for the state variable bw r s it is assumed that it will be depleted by domestic and productive water consumption and the outflow released to the downstream at the end of each year in other words for the next year the remaining basin water resources of the previous year is nearly zero hence equation 1 is not written as a differential equation rather equation 1 is a special differential equation this assumption is reasonable according to the changjiang and southwest rivers water resources bulletin which can be downloaded from http www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb 3 3 2 environmental conditions equation the environmental conditions equation is used to track the dynamics of the health state of environment system in the upper yangtze river basin however it is unclear which environmental indicators or variables can most effectively reflect the health state of environment system some environmental indicators have been put forward for various purposes feng et al 2016 2019 van emmerik et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 thought that the water use for agricultural irrigation mainly affected the downstream wetland system so they chose the water storage of the downstream wetland as the environment indicator feng et al 2016 thought that the waste water from human activities had a greater impact on the basin biology so biomass was chosen as the main environmental index in their study however although relevant studies do propose certain environmental indicators the data support for these indicators is extremely lacking in fact this problem is common in the modeling of the human water coupling system due to the lack of quantification monitoring and evaluation of the local and overall water ecology and environment of the basin xia et al 2018 in order to solve this problem feng et al 2016 gave a certain physical significance to the biomass in the basin without being concerned about whether its magnitude was consistent with the actual situation but mainly focused on its evolutionary trend in this study facing the same problem our solution is similar to that in literature feng et al 2016 the environmental conditions e c s is defined and used to indicate abstractly and macroscopically the comprehensive health state of the environment system according to fig 4b the environmental conditions equation is expressed as follows de c s dt i r r ec d r r ec 2a 2b i r r ec e i c a ec e c s 1 e c s u t a ec 2c d r r ec e d c a ec e c s 1 e c s u t a ec 2d ei c a ec f ec e i c e c s e a s s t l s u w a bwr 2e ed c a ec f ec e d c e c s t d w w a gbp c i r n a h 2f u t a ec f ec u t u w a bwr t d w w a gbp where i r r ec is the improvement rate of environmental conditions and d r r ec is the deterioration rate of environmental conditions the logistic model has been widely used to represent the dynamics of population ecology with limited resources feng et al 2016 2019 kingsland 1982 therefore considering the limited self purification capacity and pollutant carrying capacity of the basin environment the dynamic evolution of i r r ec and d r r ec is represented as a modified logistic model shown in equations 2b and 2c ei c a ec is the environmental improvement coefficient which is the function of environmental conditions e c s environmental awareness e a s scientific and technological level st l s and untapped water resources u w a bwr as shown in fig 4b and equations 2d the ei c a ec function f ec e i c considers the purification effect of undeveloped water resources on the environment system and the resilience stability of the environment system itself as well as the artificial restoration effect of environmental treatment on the environment system ed c a ec is the environmental deterioration coefficient which is driven by environmental conditions e c s total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp and channelization index of river network cir n a h as shown in fig 4b and equations 2e the ed c a ec function f ec e d c considers the deterioration effect of wastewater discharge on the environment system and the resistance stability of the environment system itself as well as the negative impact of river network channelization on the environment system u t a ec is the upper threshold of environmental conditions which is affected by untapped water resources u w a bwr and total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp as shown in fig 4b and equations 2f it can be understood as the best state of the environment system that the polluted environment system can achieve under the dual effects of natural recovery and artificial treatment in addition f ec e i c f ec e d c f ec u t can also be called constitutive relations van emmerik et al 2014 feng et al 2016 they represent the functional relationship between the dependent variable and its directly connected cause variables in this study the symbolic representation of constitutive relations follows certain rules for example for the constitutive relation f ec e i c ec indicates that the f ec e i c belongs to the environmental conditions ec submodel in fig 4b and eic indicates that the dependent variable of f ec e i c is ei c a ec similarly other constitutive relations can be understood in this way 3 3 3 environmental awareness equation environmental awareness was first proposed by van emmerik et al 2014 it reflects the response or perception of human community to the health states of environment system and accumulates when the environmental conditions are below a threshold whereas it lapses otherwise it has been widely used in the modeling of the coupled human water system feng et al 2016 2019 van emmerik et al 2014 another term that describes the human community s attitudes toward environment protection and human activities is community sensitivity chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017 in essence the two terms of environmental awareness and community sensitivity have similar meanings both of which can describe the perception of human community on the health status of the environment system that is to say they can be used interchangeably under certain conditions feng et al 2016 however environmental awareness is considered more specific than community sensitivity m feng et al 2019 therefore environmental awareness was adopted in this study according to the fig 4c the dynamics of environmental awareness are represented by the following equation 3a de a s dt g r r ea d r r ea 3b g r r ea min g c a ea e a s g i c ea u t c ea e a s e a s u t c ea e c s c t c ea 0 e a s u t c ea e c s c t c ea 3c d r r ea min d c a ea e a s d i c ea e a s e a s l t c ea e c s c t c ea 0 e a s l t c ea e c s c t c ea 3d g c a ea f ea g c e a s 3e d c a ea f ea d c e a s where e a s is the environmental awareness of the human community in the upper yangtze river basin and g r r ea and d r r ea are its growth rate and decay rate respectively g c a ea and d c a ea are the growth coefficient and decay coefficient of e a s respectively both of which are affected by environmental awareness as shown in fig 4c and equations 3d and 3e u t c ea and l t c ea are the upper threshold and lower threshold of e a s respectively g i c ea and d i c ea are the growth index and decay index of e a s respectively c t c ea is the critical threshold of environmental conditions e c s when e c s is greater than it e a s decreases otherwise e a s increases and f ea g c is the constitutive relation which describes the feedbacks between g c a ea and its direct cause variables f ea d c can be understood similarly in this study we assume that the greater the environmental awareness the higher its increase rate and the lower its decrease rate while the lower the environmental awareness the lower its increase rate and the higher its decrease rate this is the dynamics hypothesis of the basic structure of equations 3b and 3c in addition based on this f ea g c and f ea d c are estimated in section 3 4 2 finally by substituting equations 3b 3c 3d and 3e into equation 3a we can obtain a differential equation of environmental awareness only involving state variables exogenous variables and constants 3 3 4 science and technology equation the scientific and technological level shows the capacity of human community for the exploitation of water resources utilization of water resources and treatment of the water environment van emmerik et al 2014 described technology as a function of per capita gbp similarly feng et al 2016 defined technology as a function of community wealth on the basis of their research this study further considers the impact of the environmental awareness of human community on the evolution of science and technology as shown in fig 4d the science and technology equation is therefore formulated as follows 4a dst l s dt p r r stl 4b p r r stl p c c stl g b p s p i a stl o i c stl 1 s t l s 4c p i a stl f stl p i g b p s e a f a stl where st l s is the scientific and technological level p r r stl is the progress rate of st l s p c c stl is the progress coefficient of st l s p i a stl is the proportion of investment in science and technology o i c stl is the output index of science and technology investment and gb p s is the gross basin product gbp in the upper yangtze river basin f stl p i is the constitutive relation and describes the feedback between p i a stl gb p s and ea f a stl as shown in fig 4d here ea f a stl is the environmental awareness action factor ⅱ and the feedback between it and the environment awareness e a s is described by the constitutive relation f stl e a f as shown in table 2 all constitutive relations are estimated in section 3 4 2 in equation 4b the component 1 s t l s depicts the bottleneck effect of science and technology development and the component g b p s p i a stl o i c stl represents the promotion effect of science and technology investment on science and technology in addition in this study st l s can be approximately defined as lwdp g c gbp wdp g a gbp where lwdp g c gbp is the minimum water demand per 10 000 rmb of gb p s and wdp g a gbp is the water demand per 10 000 rmb of gb p s in other words the value of historical st l s can be approximately taken as lwdp g c gbp wdp g a gbp and 0 lwdp g c gbp wdp g a gbp 1 that is 0 s t l s 1 3 3 5 reservoir water head equation reservoirs play an extremely important role in the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin which can store water for the water supply system and store water energy for the power generation system in this study the comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs is defined to represent the reservoir s scale which is able to describe the key role of reservoirs in water supply system and power generation system concurrently as follows 5 e m g η h j ρ v g η h j ρ g 3 6 10 6 η v h kwh equation 5 is the calculation formula of water energy where m is the quality of the water flowing through the reservoir dams g is the acceleration of gravity ρ is the density of water v is the volume of the water flowing through the reservoir dams and η is the efficiency of water energy utilization according to equation 5 the comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs h s is specifically defined as follows 6 h s e ρ g 3 6 10 6 η v e ccw e c h c h g c c h v where ccw e c h is the calculation coefficient of water energy and is equal to ρ g 3 6 10 6 2 725 10 3 while chg c c h is the comprehensive hydropower generation coefficient and is equal to η in this study the historical h s can be obtained by equation 6 based on the known historical hydropower generation e and runoff v flowing through the basin outlet yc hydrologic station according to the above definition and the fig 4e the dynamics of h s are given as follows 7a d h s dt g r r h 7b g r r h min g c c h e a

may be caused by various reasons such as aging of reservoirs and geological disaster be h a h is the exploitable water head of the basin and is determined by the total comprehensive effective water

head be h a h 3 3 6 population equation the logistic model has been widely used to represent the dynamics of population size with limited resources feng et al 2016 2019 kingsland 1982 therefore considering the limited carrying capacity of water resources the population dynamics in the study area can be described as follows 8a d n s dt g r r n 8b g r r n n g r a n n s 1 n s wrc c a n 8c ng r a n f n n g r p i f e n a f e n 8d wrc c a n f n w r c c w s c a bwr c w u p c a n where n s is the population size of the basin g r r n is the growth rate of basin population and is expressed as the equation 8b ng r a n is the natural growth rate of population which is set as time variant according to historical statistical data the evolution track of population in the basin is basically consistent with the family planning policy orientation in addition there are relevant reports showing that the aging of population structure in china is gradually prominent http www gov cn zhengce content 2017 01 25 content 5163309 htm therefore the family planning policy impact factor pi f e n and population aging factor a f e n are chosen as the exogenous driving forces of ng r a n as shown in fig 4f and equation 8c wrc c a n is the water resource carrying capacity and it is directly affected by the comprehensive water use per capita cwup c a n and water supply capacity ws c a bwr and their feedback relationship is expressed as f n w r c c in equation 8d 3 3 7 gross basin product equation in this model wealth of the basin is expressed in term of gbp proposed by van emmerik et al 2014 in the upper yangtze river basin power resources and water resources are the key resources to drive economic development the supply of electrical energy and water resources as well as the power use efficiency and water use efficiency are the decisive factors to determine gbp for the basin based on this and according to fig 4g the gbp equation which shows the dynamics of gbp is expressed as follows 9a dgb p s dt g r r gbp 9b g r r gbp s g b p a gbp g b p s 9c sgb p a gbp min 10 4 twu p a gbp wdp g a gbp 10 4 tp g a gbp pdp g a gbp where gb p s is the gbp g r r gbp is the growth rate of gbp sgb p a gbp is the simulated value of gbp not the planned gbp in fig 4g in the basin twu p a gbp is the total water use for production tp g a gbp is the total power generation driven by power demand wdp g a gbp is the water demand per 10 000 rmb of gb p s and pdp g a gbp is the power demand per 10 000 rmb of gb p s in addition for the equation 9b its discrete representation i e g r r gbp t s g b p a gbp t g b p s t 1 can more clearly show how it actually works 3 4 model calibration in the above seven coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations which govern the coevolution of the wpe coupling system there are constants exogenous variables and constitutive relations which need to be estimated to complete the system dynamics model here the constants can be seen as the model parameters while exogenous variables represent the external environment of the system and are the external driving force of the system and the constitutive relations refer to the intrinsic characteristics embedded in the wpe coupling system van emmerik et al 2014 feng et al 2016 3 4 1 exogenous variables estimating there are four exogenous variables to be estimated in the model precipitation p e bwr policy impact factor pi f e n population aging factor a f e n and planned growth rate of gbp pg r e gbp as shown in fig 4 in this study these four exogenous variables are estimated separately for the simulation period 1998 2017 and prediction period 2018 2050 and their specific methods are described in supplementary material text s1 fig 5 shows the evolution trajectories of the estimated exogenous variables at this stage in the study there are no empirical data available to validate the estimates of the policy impact factor pi f e n and population aging factor a f e n therefore in order to ensure that the policy impact factor pi f e n and population aging factor a f e n could be reasonably estimated they are preliminarily designed according to the national population development plan 2016 2030 http www gov cn zhengce content 2017 01 25 content 5163309 htm and the china s family planning policy and healthy aging strategies http www nhc gov cn jtfzs zcwj2 zcwj shtml furthermore they are iteratively adjusted by using the trial and error method combined with model calibration 3 4 2 constitutive relations estimating in this study constitutive relations are the functional relationships that describe the feedback between the auxiliary variable and its direct causal factors sivapalan and blöschl 2015 the constitutive relations are the intrinsic characteristics embedded in the wpe coupling system which are the determinant linking state variables and dominate the coevolution of the wpe system van emmerik et al 2014 feng et al 2016 according to fig 4 and the governing equation in section 3 3 there are 40 constitutive relations that must be estimated herein according to the complexity of constitutive relations the forty constitutive relations are divided into two categories as shown in table 1 and table 2 type i indicates that the constitutive relation can be obtained directly through the definition of variables and the estimated constitutive relations are shown in table 1 type ii indicates that the constitutive relation should be properly estimated based on the observed data or expert knowledge combined with the model calibration the following discussion focuses on the estimation of constitutive relations of type ii the definition and symbol or abbreviation of all variables in the model can be viewed in fig 4 and appendix a the constitutive relations of type ii can be estimated using intuition through data analysis if the appropriate data exist taken from the literature on related studies or based on consensus principles e g logistic growth elshafei et al 2014 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 with these methods the seventeen constitutive relations of type ii can be estimated and are given in table 2 as shown in table 2 the water supply capacity ws c a bwr is a function of basin water resources bw r s proportion of exploitable water resources pew r c bwr as well as channelization index of river network cir n a h implying that the water supply capacity are affected mainly by the water resources and the reservoirs scale and this function is obtained by fitting the observed data the environment improvement coefficient ei c a ec is a function of environmental conditions e c s environmental awareness e a s scientific and technological level st l s and untapped water resources u w a bwr which takes into account the purification effect of the undeveloped water resources on the environment system the resilience stability of the environment system itself as well as the artificial restoration effect of environmental treatment on the environment system and the functional form is constructed following the research paradigm which has been widely adopted by researchers baldassarre et al 2013 chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 feng et al 2016 li et al 2019 roobavannan et al 2018 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 and the functional parameters are estimated iteratively by using the trial and error method combined with model calibration the environment deterioration coefficient ed c a ec is a function of environmental conditions e c s total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp and channelization index of river network cir n a h taking into account the deterioration effect of wastewater discharge on the environment system and the resistance stability of the environment system itself as well as the negative impact of river network channelization on the environment system and this function is estimated following the same method as the above the upper threshold of environmental conditions u t a ec is a function of untapped water resources u w a bwr and total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp which can be understood as the best state of the environment system that the polluted environment system can achieve under the dual effects of natural recovery and artificial treatment and this function is estimated using the same method as the above for the growth coefficient of environmental awareness g c a ea and decay coefficient of environmental awareness d c a ea both of them are functions of environmental awareness e a s similarly combined with calibration the trial and error method is employed to estimate these two functions the proportion of investment in science and technology p i a stl is a function of gbp gb p s and environmental awareness action factor ii ea f a stl in which ea f a stl dominates the evolution trend of p i a stl while gb p s promotes the growth of p i a stl and this function is estimated by fitting the observed data on the basis that ea f a stl is determined regarding the environmental awareness action factors i ea f a n ii ea f a stl and iii ea f a h all are functions of environmental awareness describing the impact of environmental awareness on different human activities respectively and these functions are estimated by using the trial and error method the science and technology action factor sta f a h is a function of scientific and technological level st l s representing the promotion effect of the science and technology level on reservoir construction and this function is estimated using the trial and error method water demands per capita wdp c a n is a function of gbp per capita gbpp c a n minimum water demands per capita lwdp c c n environmental awareness action factor i ea f a n as well as maximum water demands per capita uwdp c c n which is constructed following the function form of domestic water use equation in the work of li et al 2019 and estimated by fitting the observed data on the basis that ea f a n is determined the natural population growth rate ng r a n is a function of the aging factor of population a f e n and policy impact factor pi f e n this function is estimated iteratively by using the trial and error method combined the simulation result of population n s the comprehensive water consumption rate cwc r a gbp comprehensive rate of sewage generation rate crs g a gbp water demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp wdp g a gbp and power demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp pdp g a gbp all are functions of st l s and these four functions are estimated by fitting the observed data 3 4 3 initial conditions and model parameters setting table 3 shows the initial conditions for all state variables except the basin water resources bw r s in the model the initial condition of the basin water resources is unnecessary due to the assumption in the hydrology equation the initial conditions about st l s h s n s and gb p s are obtained according to the observed data the initial condition of e c s is determined based on the brief description of changjiang and southwest rivers water resources bulletin on the environmental health state in the basin while the initial condition for the state variables e a s is obtained by calibration in the system dynamics model of the wpe coupling system the values of 20 model parameters must be estimated these model parameters are the constant variables in the sfd model in fig 4 or the stylized model in section 3 3 the runoff coefficient of the river basin r c c bwr is obtained according to the observed data the proportion of exploitable water resources pew r c bwr is set following the research work of lei et al 2010 based on the statistical data about total water energy reserves of the basin and annually average runoff through the outlet of the basin the total comprehensive effective water head of the basin t h c h is calculated by equations 5 and 6 the calculation coefficient of water energy ccw e c h is obtained according to equation 6 the comprehensive hydropower generation coefficient chg c c h is set as 0 95 the proportion of exploitable water head pe h c h is estimated based on the exploitable water energy resources and total water energy reserves in the basin the minimum domestic water demands per capita per year lwdp c c n is set as the minimum value of historical domestic water use per capita per year the maximum domestic water demands per capita per year uwdp c c n is set as 100 m3 according to the research of li et al 2019 in this study the power generation system is dominated by hydropower generation so the hydropower generation and its related reservoir construction are considered as the main components of the wpe coupling system while the non hydropower generation is only a supplement to hydropower and not focused on in this study therefore in order to constrain model complexity the installed non hydroelectric capacity inh c c gbp is set to a large enough value 100 108 kw in other words the non hydropower can always supplement the shortage of hydropower in fact this assumption is reasonable because traditional thermal power plants can be quickly established in order to respond to power demand finally all other model parameters are obtained by using the trial and error method table 3 shows the definition of model parameters and the calibrated values of model parameters 4 results and discussion the results of the system dynamics model implementation in the upper yangtze river basin are presented in four parts 1 the system dynamics model is first validated by comparing the observed data with simulated data 2 the coevolution process and its dynamics of the wpe coupling system are then analyzed and interpreted 3 the implications for future water management are discussed based on the possible future coevolution trajectories of the wpe coupling system and 4 the sensitivity analysis of model parameters is performed to assess the sensitivity and robustness of the model 4 1 model validation in this study the same 20 year data set for 1998 2017 is used for model calibration and validation due to the relatively short series of historical observation data which is similar to the practice of feng et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 the simulated values of 18 variables in the model are compared with the corresponding observed values in addition the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 legates and mccabe 1999 and mean absolute percentage error mape myttenaere et al 2016 for these 18 variables are calculated to show the model performance which is shown in table 4 as shown in table 4 except for the variable nh g a gbp the mapes of other variables are below 20 that is most variables are not overestimated or underestimated in addition r2 and nses of these 18 variables show that other variables except variables tdw w a gbp twu p a gbp tw u a gbp tw c a gbp and nh g a gbp have been well simulated using the system dynamics model finally it is worth noting that since the planned growth rate of gbp during the simulation period is designed to be the actual growth rate of gbp of the basin fig 5b and simultaneously the water supply capacity can meet the total water demand for production during the simulation period the simulated evolution trajectory of gbp and observed one are coincident so the mape of gbp in table 4 is 0 from the three performance indices of the model we can see that only a few variables cannot be well simulated however according to the fig 6 the simulated total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp total water use for production twu p a gbp total basin water use tw u a gbp total basin water consumption tw c a gbp and non hydroelectric generation nh g a gbp are all acceptable both in terms of magnitude and trend compared with the observed values the evolution trends of these five variables are shown in the dotted green lines in fig 6k 6l 6n 6q and 6r for these five variables the reasons for the poor performance of the model can be explained as follows 1 the gbp gb p s in fig 6a enlarges the influence of simulation error of productive water demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp wdp g a gbp in fig 6b which increases the simulation error of total water use for production twu p a gbp and further affects the simulation accuracy of total basin water use tw u a gbp total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp and total basin water consumption tw c a gbp and 2 the simulation error of power demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp pdp g a gbp in fig 6c leads to a larger power demand than the actual demand which in turn leads to increased non hydropower generation nh g a gbp in fig 6r therefore the simulation results can be accepted taking all of these variables into consideration and the system dynamics model is suitable for exploring possible future coevolution trajectories of the wpe coupling system 4 2 coevolution of the wpe coupling system in this study the evolution processes of exogenous variables are estimated in three scenarios 1 in the rcp 2 6 scenario precipitation under the low emission scenario rcp 2 6 and low planned growth rate of gbp are estimated 2 in the rcp 4 5 scenario precipitation under the medium emission scenario rcp 4 5 and medium planned growth rate of gbp are estimated 3 in the rcp 8 5 scenario precipitation under the high emission scenario rcp 8 5 and high planned growth rate of gbp are estimated as shown in fig 5 taking the estimated exogenous variables in fig 5 as the input the wpe coupling system is simulated by using the system dynamics model based on the ventana simulation environment vensimdss for windows version 5 11a copyright 1998 2010 ventana systems inc the simulated results under three scenarios are shown in figs 7 9 fig 7 shows the possible future coevolution trajectories of state variables including the scientific and technological level st l s population size n s gbp gb p s comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs h s environmental awareness e a s environmental conditions e c s and basin water resources bw r s fig 8 shows the evolution trajectories of rate variables that describe the speed of change of the state variables fig 9 presents the future evolution trajectories of certain key auxiliary variables in the model in addition the black dotted line is the dividing line between the simulation period 1998 2017 and prediction period 2018 2050 as shown in figs 7 9 since the exogenous input of the model is unique in the simulation period the model output is the same in this section the coevolution processes and its dynamics of wpe coupling system under rcp 8 5 scenario are analyzed and interpreted while the comparative analysis of the coevolution under each of the three scenarios is conducted in section 4 3 fig 7a shows the s shaped evolution track of the scientific and technological level st l s and its rate of change is presented in fig 8h fig 7b illustrates that the population size n s gradually increases in the early stage and decreases in the later stage after reaching the peak and the rate of change of population is shown in fig 8c fig 7c presents the gbp gb p s which increases rapidly in the early stage and fluctuates around a certain value in the later stage and the rate of change of gb p s is illustrated in fig 8f fig 7d shows the evolution of comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs h s is approximately exponential growth and the rate of change of h s is presented in fig 8g fig 7e illustrates the possible evolution trajectory of environmental awareness e a s and its rate of growth increases gradually as shown in fig 8d fig 7f shows the three stages of the evolution of environmental conditions e c s 1 in the early stage of the river basin development 1998 2019 the health states of the environment system deteriorates rapidly 2 in the middle stage 2020 2036 the environmental conditions recover slowly and 3 in the late stage 2037 2050 the environmental conditions begin to deteriorate again furthermore the rates of change of environmental conditions are shown in fig 8b and 8e the dynamics of the coevolution process of state variables can be interpreted as follows science and technology investments are the primary driving force of technological progress but this is also influenced by the investment willingness and wealth of human society as shown in the sfd model in fig 4 in the upper yangtze river basin the proportion of investments in science and technology fig 9a gradually increases being driven by the environmental awareness of human community fig 7e and the gbp fig 7c which in turn increases the science and technology investments further driven by these science and technology investments the progress rate of science and technology level gradually increases but due to the bottleneck effect of science and technology development its progress rate begins to decline around 2033 as shown in fig 8h the above is the dynamics explanation of s shaped evolution of science and technology fig 7a according to the sfd model the water resource carrying capacity family planning policy and population aging are the main driving forces of population evolution as shown in fig 4 before 2011 under the influence of the family planning policy fig 5c and with the decrease of the water resource carrying capacity fig 9c the growth rate of basin population gradually decreases fig 8c and the population growth trend in the basin slows down fig 7b however after 2011 due to the relaxation of family planning policy fig 5c and increase in the water resource carrying capacity fig 9c the growth rate of basin population shows an upward trend fig 8c however with the gradual deepening of the aging of the population fig 5c the growth rate of basin population declines again after 2020 and drops to 0 around 2030 fig 8c when the population reaches its peak fig 7b after 2030 the population aging dominates the population evolution process fig 5c and the population gradually decreases fig 7b in the system dynamics model the auxiliary variable natural population growth rate is the bridge for the family planning policy factor and population aging factor to influence evolution of population its evolution process is shown in fig 9b in this study the evolution process of population shown in fig 7b is basically consistent with the development trend given in the national population development plan 2016 2030 which can be downloaded from http www gov cn zhengce content 2017 01 25 content 5163309 htm in the wpe coupling system water resources and power resources are indispensable for supporting gbp growth during 1998 2050 with the continuous construction of water conservancy infrastructure fig 7d and the continuous improvement of the scientific and technological level fig 7a the water supply capacity fig 9d and hydropower generation capacity fig 9l of the basin increase rapidly and the productive water demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp fig 9e and power demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp fig 9m decrease rapidly providing a strong guarantee for the rapid economic development of the basin fig 7c however with the continuous growth of the gbp of the basin the water supply capacity is not sufficient to support the planned growth rate of gbp which makes the evolution trend of the gbp and its rate of change fluctuate with the water supply capacity as shown in fig 7c and 8f in the system dynamics model proposed by this study the environmental awareness and the scientific and technological level are the main driving forces of construction of reservoirs as shown in fig 9n and fig 9o combined with equation 7b it can be seen that the inhibition effect of environmental awareness on the development of reservoirs is gradually prominent while the promotion effect of science and technology on the construction of reservoirs is gradually strengthened under the comprehensive effect of science and technology and environmental awareness the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs which is equivalent to the scale of reservoirs in the basin increases approximatively exponentially as shown in fig 7d and 8g in addition according to the evolution process shown in fig 7d the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs approaches its exploitable upper limit in theory around 2026 which is basically consistent with the expected development goal of the 13th five year plan for hydropower development http www nea gov cn 2016 11 29 c 135867663 htm the measure of environmental awareness is used to represent the community s response to the health state of the environment system in the basin in the model the environmental health state is the only driving force for the accumulation or decline of environmental awareness under rcp 8 5 scenario the water supply system and power generation system have a significant negative effect on the environment system of the basin and cause environmental conditions to fail in recovering above the critical threshold during 1998 2050 fig 7f as a result the environmental awareness of human community continues to grow during 1998 2050 as shown in fig 7e in addition due to the self promotion effect of environmental awareness the growth rate of this variable is gradually accelerated as shown in fig 8d water and power related human activities including sewage discharge and hydropower generation negatively affect the natural environment system of the upper yangtze river basin as can be seen from fig 7f the evolution track of environmental conditions in rcp 8 5 scenario experiences three stages in the early stage of the basin development 1998 2019 due to the low level of science and technology fig 7a the productive water demand per 10 000 rmb gbp is large fig 9e causing the productive water use of the basin to gradually increase with the gbp growth fig 9f at the same time due to the weak awareness of environmental protection fig 7e and the stimulation of increasing wealth fig 7c in this period the domestic water demand per capita fig 9g and total domestic water use fig 9h in the basin gradually increase the dual drive of productive water use and domestic water use causes the total water use of the basin fig 9i to increase gradually while the rate of sewage generation fig 9j also shows an increasing trend in this period leading to the rapid increase of the total discharge of waste water fig 9k the pollution effect of a large amount of waste water on the environment system which is magnified by the river channelization caused by reservoir construction fig 7d causes the recovery ability of the environment system fig 9p to be lower than its deterioration stress fig 9q and affects the best state fig 9r to which the environment system can recover thus the improvement rate of the environmental conditions fig 8e is lower than its deterioration rate fig 8b so that the health state of the environment system gradually deteriorates fig 7f in the middle stage of basin development 2020 2036 the deteriorating environment system fig 7f stimulates the growth of environmental awareness of human communities fig 7e which promotes the annual increase of investment in science and technology and the rapid improvement of the level of science and technology fig 7a the progress of science and technology thus improves the efficiency of productive water use fig 9e reduces the rate of sewage generation fig 9j and enhances the water environment treatment capacity of the human community in spite of the rapid economic growth in the basin during this period fig 7c the higher water use efficiency avoids a large amount of production water demand and maintains the total water use for production at a lower growth rate fig 9f in addition the decreasing rate of sewage generation also effectively avoids the possibility of increasing sewage discharge caused by the increase of water use causing the sewage discharge to gradually decrease fig 9k with the gradual reduction of sewage discharge the improvement rate of environmental conditions is higher than its deterioration rate fig 8b and fig 8e under the effect of self resilience of the environment system and artificial remediation of water environment treatment so that the health state of the environment system is gradually improved as shown in fig 7f in the late stage of basin development 2037 2050 with the support of high level science and technology fig 7a the water use efficiency nearly reaches its highest level fig 9e and the rate of sewage generation is almost at its lowest level fig 9j however in this period the scale of gbp in the basin is very large fig 7c and the total water use for production and living gradually reaches the limit level of water supply capacity in the basin fig 9d and 9i leading to the rapid growth of wastewater discharge in the basin fig 9k with the large scale exploitation and utilization of water resources and the large scale discharge of waste water as well as the negative effect of rivers channelization on the environment system the stability of resilience and resistance of the environment system and the artificial restoration effect of water environment treatment on the environment system are not sufficient to contain the deterioration of the environment resulting in the continued deterioration of the environment fig 7f finally the coevolution trajectories of state variables in other scenarios rcp 2 6 scenario and rcp 4 5 scenario can be analyzed and interpreted in a similar manner 4 3 implications for future water management in this section we compare the future coevolution trajectories of state variables under three different scenarios we believe that this comparative analysis is favorable to better understanding of the coevolution and its dynamics of the wpe coupling system which can provide insightful reference information for the decision making of water resources management fig 7 shows the possible future coevolution trajectories of state variables under three different scenarios as shown in fig 7 the laws of coevolution of the state variables are nearly identical in different scenarios even for certain state variables in which their evolution processes are almost overlapping in addition an emergent property of the wpe coupling system can be observed according to the coevolution processes in fig 7 which is interpreted in detail below the dynamics reasons of the above observations can be explained as follows because the state of environment system health in each of the three scenarios fails to recover above the critical threshold i e the critical threshold for environmental conditions c t c ea in equations 3b and 3c over an extended time period the environmental awareness continues growing resulting in nearly the same evolution track of environmental awareness for all three scenarios as shown in fig 7e and 7f before the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs increases to its exploitable upper limit the evolution tracks of its two main influencing factors i e the environmental awareness and scientific and technological level are nearly overlapping in all three scenarios fig 7a and 7e such that the evolution tracks of the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs in the three scenarios are identical as shown fig 7d for the state variable population size its evolution trend is mainly affected by two exogenous variables the policy impact factor and population aging factor fig 5c while the auxiliary variable water resource carrying capacity fig 9c mainly affects its magnitude therefore under each of the three scenarios the evolution trends of the population size of basin are essentially identical although there is a certain gap in their magnitude as shown in fig 7b the evolution of the scientific and technological level is dominated by the wealth of the river basin and the environmental awareness of the human community because the evolution laws of different evolution tracks of the two driving forces are basically similar fig 7c and 7e the different evolution tracks of the science and technology level all are s shaped in addition the evolution of river basin wealth with the low medium and high growth rates fig 5b and 7c inevitably lead to low medium and high levels of science and technology investment respectively which in turn leads to different progress rates of the science and technology level in different scenarios as shown in fig 7a for the state variable gbp when the water resources and power resources are sufficient to support the production and living demand of the basin the gbp increases according to the planned growth rate of gbp fig 5b otherwise the growth of gbp is limited by the water supply capacity fig 9d and power generation capacity fig 9l the evolution tracks of gbp under three scenarios are shown in fig 7c as shown in fig 7f corresponding to the different evolution processes of the basin gbp fig 7c the basin environment conditions also evolve along three different evolution tracks reflecting the dynamic evolution of the relationship between economic development and the environmental pollution in the river basin aiming at the problems of economic development and environmental pollution meadows et al 1972 cleveland et al 1984 and arrow et al 1995 found that economic development exerts pressure on the environment and when this pressure exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment the ecosystem will collapse based on this we can consider that the scale of economic activities is directly proportional to the degree of environmental deterioration which is a relatively intuitive judgment however according to the coevolution process of environmental conditions and gbp in fig 7f and fig 7c this intuitive judgment is not supported in other words fig 7c and 7f show an counterintuitive phenomenon or an emergent property of wpe coupling system that is with the economic growth of the basin the environment system gradually deteriorates and after the economic level reaches a certain scale the environment system begins to improve gradually in fact this counterintuitive relationship between economic development and environmental pollution can be described by the environment kuznets curve ekc hypothesis proposed by grossman and krueger 1991 many scholars have empirically tested the ekc hypothesis from different perspectives and shown the validity of the ekc copeland and taylor 1994 grossman and krueger 1995 muradian and martinez alier 2001 panayotou 1997 pasche 2002 selden and song 1995 stern 2002 suri and chapman 1998 a simplified illustration of the ekc is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from fig 7f and 10 with the growth of the basin s gbp under the rcp 2 6 scenario and rcp 4 5 scenario the evolution process of the environmental health state is very similar to the ekc curve however under rcp 8 5 scenario the environmental health state of the river basin deteriorates again after a slow improvement which can be described by the following improved ekc curve the reason there are two evolution patterns figs 10 and 11 is as follows pattern i fig 10 in the early stage of basin development under the rcp 2 6 scenario and rcp 4 5 scenario the level of science and technology is low fig 7a the efficiency of water use is low fig 9e and the rate of sewage generation is high fig 9j which causes the total water use fig 9i and total sewage discharge fig 9k to gradually increase with the growth of the economic scale of the basin leading to the development of the environment in the direction of deterioration fig 7f however in the middle and later stage of basin development the level of science and technology is relatively high fig 7a the awareness of water environment treatment fig 7e and the efficiency of water use in the basin fig 9e are gradually improved and the rate of sewage generation is gradually reduced fig 9j causing the total water use and total discharge of waste water remain at a relatively low level with the growth of economic scale thus promoting the development of the environment in the direction of improvement as shown in fig 7f the above analysis is from the perspective of technological progress to explain pattern i similar to the work of selden and song 1995 and pasche 2002 pattern ii fig 11 the coevolution trajectories of state variables in rcp 8 5 scenario are interpreted in detail in section 4 2 in fact the interpretation of pattern ii is also from the perspective of technological progress the reason the environment system deteriorates again in pattern ii is that when the economic growth is too rapid and the scale is too large the technological progress is not sufficient to curb the large scale water use and sewage discharge so that in turn the resilience stability and resistance stability of the environment system itself and the artificial restoration effect of water environment treatment on the environment system are not sufficient to curb the environmental degradation resulting in a second period of environmental deterioration based on the above analysis we infer that under the rcp 2 6 scenario and rcp 4 5 scenario the water supply system power generation system and environment system all coordinate with each other and coevolve towards a sustainable direction while under rcp 8 5 scenario the wpe coupling system will collapse however we think this is a kind of self deception according to the evolution trend of the environment system as shown in fig 7f we believe that if no other measures can be taken to effectively avoid pollution then with the growth of the economic scale of the basin the environment system will face inevitable collapse regardless of how moderate the growth rate of the economic scale remains in other words pattern ii is the future of pattern i unless river basin communities can control the scale of basin economic development or find environmental shelters which is a concept put forward by copeland and taylor 1994 meaning that a region transfers pollution industries to other locations to protect its own ecological and environmental security finally based on the above discussion and analysis three insightful observations can be obtained as follows 1 economic growth and environment system restoration and improvement are not absolute opposites the improvement of the science and technology level the improvement of water use efficiency and the reduction of sewage generation rate together can alleviate the large scale water demand caused by the continuous growth of economic scale and avoid large scale water use and sewage discharge thus promoting the improvement of environmental conditions in the basin 2 however when the economic scale of the basin is too large such as rcp 8 5 scenario the improvement of water use efficiency cannot effectively reduce its large scale water demand inevitably leading to a large amount of waste water thus seriously deteriorating the environment therefore while paying attention to economic growth we should also properly control the economic scale 3 when the intensity of human activities is within a reasonable range the water supply system power generation system and environment system are able to coordinate with each other and the wpe coupling system develops in an orderly direction in these conditions the ekc curve can be used to describe the relationship between the intensity of human activities and the deterioration of the environment system when the intensity of human activities is very intense the water supply system and power generation system cause significant stress on the environment system and the wpe coupling system develops in a disorderly direction in these conditions the improved ekc curve can be used to describe the relationship between human activity intensity and environment system deterioration 4 4 sensitivity analysis of model parameters the system dynamics model which is essentially a socio hydrological model sivapalan and blöschl 2015 though parsimonious has numerous parameters although this can cause the model to more flexibly represent diverse socio hydrological behaviors it may also lead to model uncertainty and parameter equifinality savenije 2001 van emmerik et al 2014 in order to verify the impacts of model parameters on the coevolution processes of state variables and assess alternate realities that the system dynamics model can generate based on the alternative future evolution trajectories corresponding to various parameters elshafei et al 2014 feng et al 2016 2019 van emmerik et al 2014 a sensitivity analysis is conducted under the parameter settings presented in table 5 for each parameter 1000 values are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution specified by the minimum and maximum values using a monte carlo algorithm embedded in vensim software each parameter is varied within the sampled 1000 values with the other parameters remaining unchanged in addition of the parameters listed in table 3 only those which have a significant influence on model output are selected for the sensitivity analysis and the process is described as follows through the vensim simulation platform taking the estimated exogenous variables in rcp 4 5 scenario in fig 5 as the input the evolution trajectories of state variables with varied parameter values are obtained the evolution trajectories of the environmental conditions are selected as an example as shown in fig 12 the evolution trajectories of other state variables are shown in supplementary material figs s1 to s5 in fig 12 different colors represent different confidence boundaries yellow represents the 50 confidence boundary green 75 blue 95 and gray 100 in addition the red line represents the mean value of 1000 trajectories taking the 50 confidence boundary as an example it shows that at each time point 1 4 of the trajectories have a bigger value than the top of the confidence boundary while 1 4 of the trajectories have a smaller value than the bottom of the boundary other confidence boundaries can be similarly understood it can be seen from fig 12 that the evolution of environmental conditions is sensitive to most of the selected parameters which also implies that the parameters in one system can influence the evolution of state variables in other system in fact this is not surprising because this is the external manifestation of the interaction between the water supply power generation and environment systems by comparing the evolution trajectories of different state variables the following three observations can be noted firstly as shown in fig 12 the growth index of environmental awareness g i c ea critical threshold of environmental conditions c t c ea output index of science and technology investment o i c stl and progress coefficient of scientific and technological level p c c stl are identified as the most sensitive parameters that influence the evolution of environmental conditions e c s similarly according to the figs s1 to s5 in the supplementary material the impacts of these parameters on the evolution of other state variables can also be identified for the population size n s the proportion of exploitable water resources pew r c bwr and loss rate of comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs l r c h are identified as the most sensitive parameters for the scientific and technological level st l s parameters o i c stl and p c c stl are most sensitive for the comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs in basin h s parameters o i c stl and g i c ea are most sensitive for environmental awareness e a s parameters g i c ea c t c ea o i c stl and p c c stl are the most sensitive parameters which significantly change the evolution process for the gbp gb p s parameters pew r c bwr and o i c stl are most sensitive secondly as shown in fig 12 when these parameters are varied not only the timing and magnitude of the evolution process of environmental conditions are affected but also the evolution pattern fig 12 shows that the system dynamics model is able to simulate three different evolution patterns of the wpe coupling system i e continued decline pattern ekc pattern fig 10 and improved ekc pattern fig 11 as can be seen from fig 12 in most cases the model outcomes with varied parameter values are relatively close to the evolution pattern of the best fit with reality i e the ekc pattern decline followed by a growth in rcp 4 5 scenario in fig 7f which can be verified by the mean value trajectories however low c t c ea low o i c stl or low g i c ea lead to evolution trajectories that resemble the continued decline pattern medium values of the parameters g i c ea or p c c stl lead to evolution processes that resemble the improved ekc pattern in fig 11 thirdly according to the evolution trajectories of all state variables with varied parameter values we find that the uncertainty of model output caused by parameter uncertainty increases with time which can be shown in fig 13 drawn by referring to the work of zhao et al 2011 in fact for almost all prediction models the evolution law of model output uncertainty with time follows this rule it is worth emphasizing that the focus of this study is on predicting and understanding possible future trajectories of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin by using the system dynamics model rather than accurately predicting future trends therefore reducing the uncertainty of model output is not the focus of this study and the limited model output uncertainty will not have a great impact on our research nevertheless we attempted to avoid uncertainty which is why we only forecast to 2050 the development of the model presented in this study including the performed sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential of using system dynamics modeling from the perspective of socio hydrology to understand and predict possible future trajectories of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system conceptually our model is fundamentally sound and agrees with certain other socio hydrologic modeling and system dynamics modeling elshafei et al 2014 feng et al 2016 2019 king et al 2017 li et al 2019 van emmerik et al 2014 5 conclusions this study used the system dynamics model to predict and evaluate the coevolution and dynamics of the wpe coupling system our efforts to understand the possible future coevolution trajectories of the wpe coupling system include the following 1 firstly the system dynamics model which comprises the conceptual sfd and stylized models was constructed to describe the dynamics of state variables of the wpe coupling system 2 secondly the model was applied to the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin of china 3 then the coevolution process and associated dynamics of the wpe coupling system were analyzed and interpreted and its implications for future water resources management are discussed and 4 the sensitivity analysis of model parameters was performed finally the following conclusions were drawn 1 the system dynamics model established in this paper explicitly considers the two way feedback between human and water systems through environmental condition response linkage environmental awareness response linkage and environmental awareness action linkage thus it is suitable for modeling the coevolution of the wpe coupling system this model provides a powerful tool for exploring and understanding the emergent properties of the wpe coupling system 2 according to the coevolution trajectories of state variables two coevolution patterns of the wpe coupling system the ekc pattern and the improved ekc pattern are identified in the ekc pattern due to the economic development scale is appropriate the water supply system power generation system and environment system coordinate with each other resulting in the development of the wpe coupling system in an orderly direction however in the improved ekc pattern due to the economic scale is too large water supply system and power generation system cause significant stress on the environment system such that the wpe coupling system will develop in a disorderly direction this emergent property shows that the relationship between economic development and environmental improvement is not absolutely contradictory however if the scale of economic development is not limited their relationship will gradually evolve in the direction of contradiction 3 model parameters not only affect the timing and magnitude of the evolution trajectories of state variables but also their evolution patterns for instance the evolution processes of environmental health with varied parameters can be classified into three different evolution patterns the continued decline pattern ekc pattern and improved ekc pattern in addition the uncertainties of model output caused by parameter uncertainties increases with time in this study the coevolution of the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin was modeled effectively and its possible future trajectories were predicted and understood using the system dynamics model however this study should only be taken as a plausible research paradigm for the modeling of the wep coupling system there are several aspects to be further studied 1 a method for determining the planned growth rate of gbp policy impact factor and population aging factor endogenously rather than exogenously need to be determined 2 the richness of historical observation data which affects the model calibration and test ability must be improved and 3 the physical mechanism of feedbacks and interactions within the wpe coupling system need to be clarified further credit authorship contribution statement benjun jia software writing original draft validation jianzhong zhou

4973,in the emergent anthropocene interactions among water supply power generation and environment wpe systems are increasingly prominent due to the impact of human activity the understanding of which calls for a holistic and dynamic coevolutionary perspective therefore inspired by the nexus approach this study investigates these three systems integrated as a wpe coupling system this paper aims to construct a system dynamics model from the perspective of socio hydrology in order to predict and understand the coevolution trajectories and dynamics of the wpe coupling system firstly the system dynamics model which comprises the conceptual stock and flow diagrams and stylized models is constructed to describe the dynamics of state variables of the wpe system then the model is implemented in the wpe system of the upper yangtze river basin of china results show that 1 the system dynamics model which considers two way feedbacks is capable of modeling the coevolution of the wpe system and provides a powerful tool for exploring and understanding the emergent properties of the system 2 the interrelation between economic development and environmental health is not entirely contradictory however if the economic development scale is not limited their relationship will gradually evolve in the direction of contradiction and 3 model parameters not only affect the timing and magnitude of the evolution trajectories of state variables but also their evolution patterns these observations obtained by modeling interactions across different systems are insightful improving our understanding of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system keywords system dynamics model socio hydrology coevolution coupling system upper yangtze river basin 1 introduction human history can be written in terms of the interactions and interrelations between humans and water elshafei et al 2014 during the anthropocene humans have exerted an unprecedented effect on the natural environment crutzen 2002 and interactions between humans and the environment are occurring on an unprecedented scale blair and buytaert 2016 human activities such as the construction of dams and reservoirs changes of land use and discharge of pollutants have contributed to significant changes to water systems at the watershed scale li et al 2019 savenije et al 2014 thompson et al 2013 presently the fact that humans water and the natural environment are linked through mutual interaction falkenmark 1977 has been widely recognized and accepted blair and buytaert 2016 consequently how to consider these interactions in decision making models to improve water resource management decisions has become a common concern of water scientists and decision makers montanari et al 2013 fresh water is one of the most precious and critical natural resources that is required to maintain the sustainable development of life human production and the environment however since modern times the rapid development of human economy and society including economic and population growth and the intensification of agricultural and industrial activities have led to and accelerated the exploitation of fresh water globally chen et al 2020 if humans do not implement effective water resource management measures competition among various water use applications will become increasingly intense in the future moreover electric energy is also one of the most important resources required to ensure human production and life with the gradual increases in social and economic development scales the global power demand will increase from 25 000 twh in 2017 to about 38 700 twh in 2050 driving new investments in the expansion of power generation capacity chen et al 2020 as a promising renewable energy hydropower is poised to become the main driving force for power generation capacity growth pazheri et al 2014 particularly in china where hydropower potential remains significant national hydropower development will become the main driving force for global hydropower development z feng et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 however under the stress of intense water related and power related human activities global environmental problems are becoming increasingly prominent and addressing this has become a primary concern in water resource management williams 2011 reasonable and reliable water resource management can effectively alleviate competition between productive and domestic water use and ecological and environmental water demand as well as promote the recovery and improvement of environmental water systems in fact regarding water resource system and natural environment system sustainability relevant global policies and management decisions have gradually emphasized the importance of environmental water needs and allocations despite the increasing demand for basic resources such as food water and energy chen et al 2020 undoubtedly the allocation use and management of water resources has a significant impact on the quality of human production and life as well as ecological and environmental health chen et al 2020 with the gradual intensification of human activities particularly the large scale development of water conservancy projects the interactions of water supply power generation and the environment are prominent chen et al 2019 and jointly support and affect social progress and economic development therefore to coordinate the contradiction between human water use and environmental water demand while promoting the sustainable development of social economies ecology and the environment it is necessary to analyze water supply power generation and environment in the water resource system as a whole m feng et al 2016 2019 a full understanding of the interaction and interrelationship among water supply power generation and environment systems will effectively assist in policy development and decision making for water resource management chen et al 2019 there are distinctive interactions and feedbacks between humans and water specifically among water supply power generation and environment systems understanding these calls for a holistic and dynamic coevolutionary perspective hale et al 2015 li et al 2019 sivapalan et al 2012 srinivasan et al 2017 thompson et al 2013 in recent years focusing on the complex interconnections and interdependences across different systems a new approach has been proposed called the nexus approach hoff 2011 in order to understand the dynamics and coevolution of the coupled human water system socio hydrology a new science which can study and represent the relationships between water and humans more deeply has emerged nearly simultaneously sivapalan et al 2012 although the research objects of the nexus approach and socio hydrology theory are not identical their essence is similar to analyze the interactions and interrelationship across different systems from the perspective of whole and dynamic evolution in recent years many researchers have applied either the nexus approach or social hydrology theory to study various complex coupling systems in order to cope with the substantial pressure of global climate change and social hydrological change on water food and energy resources the international community posited the concept of the water food energy nexus and has conducted in depth research on this subject biggs et al 2015 chini and stillwell 2018 conway et al 2015 hoff 2011 lawford et al 2013 leck et al 2015 nhamo et al 2018 scanlon et al 2017 siddiqi and anadon 2011 zhang et al 2018 considering the complex interdependence and interconnection among water supply power generation and environment systems feng et al 2016 described the three systems as a nexus wpe nexus and modeled the wpe nexus in the hehuang region of china with the research paradigm of socio hydrology which promoted the understanding of interactions across systems in the tarim river basin in western china and the murrumbidgee river basin in eastern australia there is an intense competition for water between economic development and ecological health applications leading to the phenomena known as pendulum swing van emmerik et al 2014 liu et al 2014 this phenomenon is difficult to capture using traditional hydrologic models which regard human behaviors as the boundary conditions sivapalan and blöschl 2015 therefore van emmerik et al 2014 liu et al 2014 and liu et al 2015 conducted detailed modeling studies of this phenomenon from the perspective of socio hydrology in order to understand the coevolution of human flood systems in urban areas baldassarre et al 2013 baldassarre et al 2015 and lopez et al 2017 developed stylized models this type of model can generally represent interactions between humans and water and provide insight into the interaction and dynamics involved in coupling systems li et al 2019 water supply power generation and environment systems are intrinsically linked by a human interfered water cycle feng et al 2016 m sivapalan et al 2012 2014 how to analyze and understand the interactions among water supply power generation and environment systems is an urgent problem to be solved in this study considering the interaction among water supply power generation and environment and by drawing on the core idea of the nexus method these three systems are regarded as a whole namely the wpe coupling system on this basis with the holistic and dynamic coevolutionary perspective advocated by the socio hydrology serving as methodology we aim to construct a system dynamics model to predict and understand the coevolution behavior of the wpe coupling system which we believe can provide decision making basis for adaptive management of water resources the system dynamics modeling approach is one of the most effective approaches to constructing the socio hydrological model blair and buytaert 2016 feng et al 2016 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in addition other commonly used modeling methods include agent based modeling and system modeling blair and buytaert 2016 although these three methods are able to model the complex characteristics of the coupled system due to the better flexibility of the system dynamics modeling and its advantages in capturing the long term evolution characteristics of the complex system feng et al 2016 we use the system dynamics method to model the wpe coupling system the system dynamics model also known as the stylized model uses a differential equation to represent the dynamics of each state variable in the coupled system feng et al 2016 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in other words the system dynamics model can describe the dynamics of the coupled system through a set of ordinary differential equations the specific modeling steps of the system dynamics approach have been summarized by sivapalan and blöschl 2015 finally it is worth mentioning that although feng et al 2016 have carried out surprising and insightful modeling research on the nexus across water supply power generation and environment systems in the hehuang region of china as the author stated their research is a simplistic paradigm of low complexity modeling of the wpe nexus which requires further improvement in addition there are several significant differences between the present study and that conducted by feng et al 1 firstly a representative river basin the upper yangtze river basin is taken as the study area 2 secondly the impact of climate change on the coevolution of the wpe coupling system is considered 3 thirdly the evolution process of reservoir construction in the basin is considered 4 fourthly the stress effect of reservoir construction on the environment system in the basin is considered 5 further we identify the variables in the wpe coupling system and their causal relationships and interactions in a more comprehensive and detailed manner 6 the impact of family planning policy and population aging on the evolution of population in the basin is considered and 7 finally we obtain insightful meaningful and novel results not previously obtained in this study we aim to construct a system dynamics model to predict and understand the coevolution trajectories and its dynamics of the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the basic information of the study area and its water supply power generation and environment systems are described in detail followed by a summary of the data sources needed for model development and testing in section 3 the wpe coupling system is first conceptualized as a model then refined into a stock and flow diagram sfd model which is further formulated as several coupled ordinary differential equations i e stylized model before calibration in section 4 the system dynamics model is validated and its application to predict possible future coevolution trajectories of the wpe coupling system is presented then the coevolution and its dynamics of the wpe system are analyzed and interpreted further implications for future water resource management are discussed finally sensitivity analysis of model parameters is presented in section 5 the conclusions are drawn 2 study area wpe system description and data used 2 1 study area the upper yangtze river basin is taken as study area fig 1 the upper reaches of the yangtze river refers to the section from the source of the yangtze river to yichang city in hubei province with a total length of approximately 4500 km chai et al 2019 its catchment area is approximately 1 0 million km2 accounting for about 58 of the catchment area of the yangtze river the annual average precipitation of the basin is about 854 2 billion m3 and the annual average water resource i e annual average runoff is about 429 6 billion m3 in addition the basin releases annually an average outflow of about 411 8 billion m3 to the downstream basin and the outlet is located at the yc hydrologic station fig 1 2 2 description of the wpe coupling system in study area the water supply system is an important part of the wpe coupling system with the rapid socio economic development of the upper yangtze river basin the demand for and consumption of water resources as well as the discharge of waste water have been increasing from 1998 to 2017 the total population in this basin increased from 152 3131 million to 164 3317 million the annual total water use increased from 35 2 billion m3 to 45 964 billion m3 the annual total water consumption increased from 16 544 billion m3 to 19 929 billion m3 the annual power generation increased from 94 214 billion kwh to 647 379 billion kwh and the gross domestic product gdp of the basin increased from 643 662 billion rmb to 7246 445 billion rmb however the growth of social wealth was accompanied with the gradual pollution of the water environment for example the annual sewage discharge amount increased from 4 095 billion tons to 7 862 billion tons from 1998 to 2017 the power generation system is another important part of the wpe coupling system the types of electrical energy used in this basin include thermal power hydropower wind power and solar power among which annual hydropower generation increased from 44 307 billion kwh in 1998 to 455 407 billion kwh in 2017 wind power and solar power generation increased from 0 0078 billion to 21 56 billion kwh and annual thermal power generation increased from 49 89 billion to 170 407 billion kwh in 2017 hydropower accounted for 70 of all energy consumption dominating the energy structure of the basin the basin s hydropower resources are relatively rich accounting for about one third of national hydropower resources it features five out of china s thirteen hydropower bases zhou et al 2015 namely the jinsha river yalong river dadu river and wujiang hydropower bases and the upper reaches of the yangtze river hydropower base for these bases large scale reservoir groups have been planned constructed and put into operation z feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 the environment system is the third important part of the wpe coupling system the intense water related and power related human activities have been exerting a negative impact on the environment system endangering the sustainable development of the social economy in this basin environmental problems in this basin have aroused great concern from policy makers and all sectors of society and the overall environmental awareness of the basin community has been increasing in order to restore and protect the water ecology and water environment the basin community has been actively promoting the development of the green industry the technological innovation of ecological environment protection and the construction of water resource management systems to ensure sustainable economic and social development since 2011 the ministry of water resources in china implemented a strategy of adaptive water management based on three red lines of control water resource quantity control water use efficiency control and waste water quantity control xia et al 2012 this approach has promoted the process of basin ecological and environmental protection from 1998 to 2017 the level of water saving technology and sewage treatment technology in this basin was gradually improved for example the productive water uses per 10 000 rmb of gdp decreased from 486 28 m3 to 50 49 m3 and the water consumption rate decreased from 0 47 to 0 41 which effectively supported the economic development and environment protection of the basin undoubtedly the human and water systems in this basin especially the water supply power generation and environment systems are increasingly interacting with each other exhibiting complex interactions and feedbacks and are interconnected as a wpe coupling system from different perspectives this wpe coupling system shows the characteristics of coevolution blair and buytaert 2016 liu et al 2014 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 feedback dynamic complexity sivapalan and blöschl 2015 and complex adaptability blair and buytaert 2016 levin et al 2013 therefore under changing environments in order to realize the adaptive management of water resources and promote the coordinated and orderly development of the water supply power generation and environment systems it is necessary to understand and predict future trajectories of coevolution of this wpe coupling system by using system dynamics approach 2 3 data used for modeling the wpe coupling system historical statistical data on hydrology society economy water conservancy and electricity are the fundamental data used for calibrating and validating the model at present the changjiang and southwest rivers water resources bulletin covering 1998 2017 only has been published so our model is limited to data from 1998 to 2017 after the system dynamics model is developed and tested the possible future trajectories of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system during 2018 2050 will be predicted that is to say the simulation period of this system dynamics model is 1998 2017 while the prediction period is 2018 2050 the data used and their sources are presented in detail in supplementary material text s1 and table s1 3 model description in this study we aim to predict and understand the coevolution trajectories and its dynamics of the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin using the system dynamics model which is able to provide a decision making basis for adaptive management of water resources following the question driven modeling process proposed by garcia et al 2016 the possible steps of framing and modeling human water interactions summarized by sivapalan and blöschl 2015 and the system dynamics modeling approach blair and buytaert 2016 firstly the conceptual model of wpe coupling system is constructed by identifying the key elements and their causal relationships secondly based on the conceptual model the state variables rate variables auxiliary variables constants or model parameters and exogenous variables are identified further the sfd model for the wpe coupling system is constructed in which all variables are interconnected by positive and negative feedbacks then according to the sfd model seven coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations or governing equations are formulated to describe the variations of state variables of wpe coupling system which constitute a stylized model for the wpe coupling system finally in order to complete the system dynamics model the constitutive relations in the stylized model are estimated according to the observed data and the model parameters are calibrated this system dynamics modeling process i e from conceptual model to stylized model is a typical top down modeling process blair and buytaert 2016 the modeling procedure in this study is shown in fig 2 3 1 conceptual model the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin is a typical socio hydrological system in the upper yangtze river basin the development and utilization of water resources such as water supply water use and water consumption promote social and economic development and sustained population growth in turn the continuous expansion of economic scale also stimulates more intense water resource development activities certainly there is a positive feedback relationship between the exploitation of water resources and the development of the social economy in addition electrical energy is one of the incentive sources of social and economic development and there is also a positive feedback relationship between them however with the increasing intensity of human activities the river basin environment gradually worsens which in turn affects humans environmental awareness the rise of environmental awareness not only has a certain inhibitory effect on production activities in the basin but also promotes community based reparations of the basin environment as well as the restoration and improvement of the environment system according to the above dynamics hypotheses about the underlying causes of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system the conceptual model also known as a perceptual model or causal loop diagram model that describes the wpe coupling system is constructed and shown in fig 3 in this model the arrow curve is a causal feedback linkage which indicates that there is a causal relationship between the elements at both ends the non arrow end of the causal linkage is the cause and the arrow end is the result in this conceptual model of the wpe coupling system there are two types of causal feedback loops the first is the positive feedback loop such as reservoir project water supply capacity total water supply socio economic conditions power and water demand reservoir project this type of causal loop represents the feedbacks between the socio economic development and the exploitation of water resources the second type is the negative feedback loop such as reservoir project basin environment conditions environmental awareness power and water demand reservoir project the negative feedback loops mainly represent the feedback among socio economic development water resource exploitation environmental awareness of the basin community and environmental conditions in the basin the key components are the three types of causal linkages which are respectively the environmental conditions response linkage environmental awareness response linkage and environmental awareness action linkage and correspond to the blue purple and red arrow line in fig 3 respectively the environmental condition response linkage describes the one way feedback between environmental health state and human activities such as water supply and power generation the environmental awareness response linkage represents the one way feedback between environmental awareness of human community and health state of environment system the environmental awareness action linkage describes the one way feedback between environmental awareness and human activities and the coupling of these three kinds of causal linkages describes the two way feedbacks among water supply power generation and environment systems 3 2 stock and flow diagram model on the basis of identifying the essential system components and their interactions by the above conceptual model the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin can be further divided into six primary components reservoirs human community ecology and environment social economy science and technology and power plants humans extract water from reservoirs and obtain electric power from the power plant in order to satisfy water and power demands for production and living which promote the development of the social economy that is the social economy benefits from water supply and power generation systems for the water supply system part of the water used for production and living is used consumptively and part is returned into the surrounding environment carrying contaminants feng et al 2016 with the growth of the social economy the growing water demand urges human communities to develop water resources and build reservoirs so as to address water shortage for the power generation system power plants include hydropower and non hydropower plants the water used for hydropower plants is nearly non consumptive while the non hydropower plants such as thermal wind and photoelectric plants will consume minimal water for technical use feng et al 2016 although hydropower plants release little waste water the construction of reservoirs and dams for hydropower result in the channelization of natural rivers and fragmentation of the ecological environment which would cause the deterioration of ecology and the environment with the growth of the social economy the growing power demand drives human communities to construct hydropower plants or reservoir dams and other types of power plants additionally in order to reduce power and water demand the human community actively invests in the development of science and technology so as to improve efficiency of water usage and power usage for the environment system the ecology and environment in upper yangtze river basin which broadly covers vegetation animals microorganisms water environment and land environment is cultivated by the untapped water however deteriorated by the released waste water and the channelization effect of reservoir dams as the environment deteriorates environmental awareness increases gradually human activities are inhibited to some extent and water environment treatments and waste water treatment technology are developed rapidly according to the above conceptualization of the wpe coupling system seven state variables and other variables including rate variables auxiliary variables constants and exogenous variables are identified then the sfd model of the wpe coupling system is established fig 4 the sfd model shows in detail the feedbacks among all variables in addition corresponding to the conceptual model of wpe coupling system there are also three kinds of key causal linkages in the sfd model the red blue and purple causal linkages shown in fig 4 in the sfd model the seven state variables include basin water resources environmental conditions i e the health state of environment system environmental awareness scientific and technological level comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs population size and gross basin product gbp i e gdp of the basin basin water resources is defined as the total water storage i e the total runoff in the upper yangtze river basin at a given time due to the lack of quantification monitoring and evaluation of the local and overall water ecology and environment of the basin xia et al 2018 environmental conditions are defined in a broad sense and used to indicate abstractly and macroscopically the state of health of the environment system environmental awareness as first proposed by van emmerik et al 2014 is introduced to denote the response of human community to environment conditions to better model the interconnections between human activities and the environment system scientific and technological level is used to indicate the capacity of the human community for water resource exploitation and water environment treatment and it depend on the social economy in the basin and environmental awareness comprehensive effective water head of reservoir is defined to represent the status of reservoir construction the reservoirs in the basin are able to store water for human activities such as water supply and power generation due to the abundant hydropower resources in the upper yangtze river basin the reservoirs also play an extremely important role in the power generation system in addition the reason the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs is chosen as the state variable is that it also roughly reflects the water supply capacity of the water supply system and the power generation capacity of the power generation system at the same time population size is identified as the size of the human community to which domestic water demand is primarily related gbp is adopted to describe the scale of the economy to which both water and power demands are primarily related in the sfd model state variables auxiliary variables constants and rate variables are endogenous collectively known as endogenous variables these endogenous variables are used to describe the system interior while the exogenous variables are used to describe the system environment therefore the endogenous variables are usually unknown while exogenous variables are known input conditions in fig 4 the endogenous and exogenous variables are presented in different forms they are 1 state variables denoted within black rectangles such as environmental awareness in fig 4c 2 rate variables shown below funnel shaped figures such as growth rate of environmental awareness in fig 4c 3 constants variables with outflow arrows and no inflow arrows such as runoff coefficient in fig 4a 4 exogenous variables i e precipitation policy impact factor aging factor and planned growth rate of gbp as shown in fig 4a 4f and 4g respectively and 5 auxiliary variables shown with inflow arrows and outflow arrows except for the exogenous variables such as water resource carrying capacity in fig 4f in addition the variable with angled bracket is a shadow variable and it is the shadow of the variable defined elsewhere and has the same meaning the original variable the purpose of defining shadow variables is to make the model look clearer and not confusing in addition the state variables are the backbone of the sfd model while all other variables are mainly used to represent more intuitively and simply the mutual feedback relationships between state variables more specifically the auxiliary variables are intermediate being directly affected by other variables and their functional relationship can be called a constitutive relation the rate variable is also intermediate and represents the rate not the ratio of change of state variables the exogenous variable represents the external driver which is not affected by endogenous variables the constant variables also are not affected by other variables and can be considered the model parameters usually the feedback of other variables or the state variable itself on each of the state variables are achieved by directly acting on the rate variables of the state variables as shown in fig 4 3 3 governing equations following the conceptual and sfd models a stylized model is constructed the system dynamics model of the wpe coupling system is formulated as seven nonlinear ordinary differential equations each of which describes the dynamics of the corresponding state variable in essence these differential equations are the mathematical representation of complex interconnections in the sfd model feng et al 2016 and describe the feedback between the state variables as well as the effects of the external forcing sivapalan and blöschl 2015 in order to construct the stylized model more conveniently all variables in the sdf model are abbreviated as shown in appendix a in this study the unit of time is year and all variables are defined in terms of a one year time step 3 3 1 hydrology equation the hydrology equation simulates the dynamics of water resources quantity of the upper yangtze river basin as shown in fig 4a the basin water resource bw r s is determined by precipitation p e bwr and runoff coefficient r c c bwr which is represented as follows 1 bw r s p e bwr r c c bwr where the funopture precipitation p e bwr can be estimated by applying the ncep reanalysis datasets sdsm and global climate model canesm2 which have been shown to be applicable for the upper yangtze river basin by chu et al 2015 and zhong et al 2020 for the state variable bw r s it is assumed that it will be depleted by domestic and productive water consumption and the outflow released to the downstream at the end of each year in other words for the next year the remaining basin water resources of the previous year is nearly zero hence equation 1 is not written as a differential equation rather equation 1 is a special differential equation this assumption is reasonable according to the changjiang and southwest rivers water resources bulletin which can be downloaded from http www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb 3 3 2 environmental conditions equation the environmental conditions equation is used to track the dynamics of the health state of environment system in the upper yangtze river basin however it is unclear which environmental indicators or variables can most effectively reflect the health state of environment system some environmental indicators have been put forward for various purposes feng et al 2016 2019 van emmerik et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 thought that the water use for agricultural irrigation mainly affected the downstream wetland system so they chose the water storage of the downstream wetland as the environment indicator feng et al 2016 thought that the waste water from human activities had a greater impact on the basin biology so biomass was chosen as the main environmental index in their study however although relevant studies do propose certain environmental indicators the data support for these indicators is extremely lacking in fact this problem is common in the modeling of the human water coupling system due to the lack of quantification monitoring and evaluation of the local and overall water ecology and environment of the basin xia et al 2018 in order to solve this problem feng et al 2016 gave a certain physical significance to the biomass in the basin without being concerned about whether its magnitude was consistent with the actual situation but mainly focused on its evolutionary trend in this study facing the same problem our solution is similar to that in literature feng et al 2016 the environmental conditions e c s is defined and used to indicate abstractly and macroscopically the comprehensive health state of the environment system according to fig 4b the environmental conditions equation is expressed as follows de c s dt i r r ec d r r ec 2a 2b i r r ec e i c a ec e c s 1 e c s u t a ec 2c d r r ec e d c a ec e c s 1 e c s u t a ec 2d ei c a ec f ec e i c e c s e a s s t l s u w a bwr 2e ed c a ec f ec e d c e c s t d w w a gbp c i r n a h 2f u t a ec f ec u t u w a bwr t d w w a gbp where i r r ec is the improvement rate of environmental conditions and d r r ec is the deterioration rate of environmental conditions the logistic model has been widely used to represent the dynamics of population ecology with limited resources feng et al 2016 2019 kingsland 1982 therefore considering the limited self purification capacity and pollutant carrying capacity of the basin environment the dynamic evolution of i r r ec and d r r ec is represented as a modified logistic model shown in equations 2b and 2c ei c a ec is the environmental improvement coefficient which is the function of environmental conditions e c s environmental awareness e a s scientific and technological level st l s and untapped water resources u w a bwr as shown in fig 4b and equations 2d the ei c a ec function f ec e i c considers the purification effect of undeveloped water resources on the environment system and the resilience stability of the environment system itself as well as the artificial restoration effect of environmental treatment on the environment system ed c a ec is the environmental deterioration coefficient which is driven by environmental conditions e c s total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp and channelization index of river network cir n a h as shown in fig 4b and equations 2e the ed c a ec function f ec e d c considers the deterioration effect of wastewater discharge on the environment system and the resistance stability of the environment system itself as well as the negative impact of river network channelization on the environment system u t a ec is the upper threshold of environmental conditions which is affected by untapped water resources u w a bwr and total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp as shown in fig 4b and equations 2f it can be understood as the best state of the environment system that the polluted environment system can achieve under the dual effects of natural recovery and artificial treatment in addition f ec e i c f ec e d c f ec u t can also be called constitutive relations van emmerik et al 2014 feng et al 2016 they represent the functional relationship between the dependent variable and its directly connected cause variables in this study the symbolic representation of constitutive relations follows certain rules for example for the constitutive relation f ec e i c ec indicates that the f ec e i c belongs to the environmental conditions ec submodel in fig 4b and eic indicates that the dependent variable of f ec e i c is ei c a ec similarly other constitutive relations can be understood in this way 3 3 3 environmental awareness equation environmental awareness was first proposed by van emmerik et al 2014 it reflects the response or perception of human community to the health states of environment system and accumulates when the environmental conditions are below a threshold whereas it lapses otherwise it has been widely used in the modeling of the coupled human water system feng et al 2016 2019 van emmerik et al 2014 another term that describes the human community s attitudes toward environment protection and human activities is community sensitivity chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2014 roobavannan et al 2017 in essence the two terms of environmental awareness and community sensitivity have similar meanings both of which can describe the perception of human community on the health status of the environment system that is to say they can be used interchangeably under certain conditions feng et al 2016 however environmental awareness is considered more specific than community sensitivity m feng et al 2019 therefore environmental awareness was adopted in this study according to the fig 4c the dynamics of environmental awareness are represented by the following equation 3a de a s dt g r r ea d r r ea 3b g r r ea min g c a ea e a s g i c ea u t c ea e a s e a s u t c ea e c s c t c ea 0 e a s u t c ea e c s c t c ea 3c d r r ea min d c a ea e a s d i c ea e a s e a s l t c ea e c s c t c ea 0 e a s l t c ea e c s c t c ea 3d g c a ea f ea g c e a s 3e d c a ea f ea d c e a s where e a s is the environmental awareness of the human community in the upper yangtze river basin and g r r ea and d r r ea are its growth rate and decay rate respectively g c a ea and d c a ea are the growth coefficient and decay coefficient of e a s respectively both of which are affected by environmental awareness as shown in fig 4c and equations 3d and 3e u t c ea and l t c ea are the upper threshold and lower threshold of e a s respectively g i c ea and d i c ea are the growth index and decay index of e a s respectively c t c ea is the critical threshold of environmental conditions e c s when e c s is greater than it e a s decreases otherwise e a s increases and f ea g c is the constitutive relation which describes the feedbacks between g c a ea and its direct cause variables f ea d c can be understood similarly in this study we assume that the greater the environmental awareness the higher its increase rate and the lower its decrease rate while the lower the environmental awareness the lower its increase rate and the higher its decrease rate this is the dynamics hypothesis of the basic structure of equations 3b and 3c in addition based on this f ea g c and f ea d c are estimated in section 3 4 2 finally by substituting equations 3b 3c 3d and 3e into equation 3a we can obtain a differential equation of environmental awareness only involving state variables exogenous variables and constants 3 3 4 science and technology equation the scientific and technological level shows the capacity of human community for the exploitation of water resources utilization of water resources and treatment of the water environment van emmerik et al 2014 described technology as a function of per capita gbp similarly feng et al 2016 defined technology as a function of community wealth on the basis of their research this study further considers the impact of the environmental awareness of human community on the evolution of science and technology as shown in fig 4d the science and technology equation is therefore formulated as follows 4a dst l s dt p r r stl 4b p r r stl p c c stl g b p s p i a stl o i c stl 1 s t l s 4c p i a stl f stl p i g b p s e a f a stl where st l s is the scientific and technological level p r r stl is the progress rate of st l s p c c stl is the progress coefficient of st l s p i a stl is the proportion of investment in science and technology o i c stl is the output index of science and technology investment and gb p s is the gross basin product gbp in the upper yangtze river basin f stl p i is the constitutive relation and describes the feedback between p i a stl gb p s and ea f a stl as shown in fig 4d here ea f a stl is the environmental awareness action factor ⅱ and the feedback between it and the environment awareness e a s is described by the constitutive relation f stl e a f as shown in table 2 all constitutive relations are estimated in section 3 4 2 in equation 4b the component 1 s t l s depicts the bottleneck effect of science and technology development and the component g b p s p i a stl o i c stl represents the promotion effect of science and technology investment on science and technology in addition in this study st l s can be approximately defined as lwdp g c gbp wdp g a gbp where lwdp g c gbp is the minimum water demand per 10 000 rmb of gb p s and wdp g a gbp is the water demand per 10 000 rmb of gb p s in other words the value of historical st l s can be approximately taken as lwdp g c gbp wdp g a gbp and 0 lwdp g c gbp wdp g a gbp 1 that is 0 s t l s 1 3 3 5 reservoir water head equation reservoirs play an extremely important role in the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin which can store water for the water supply system and store water energy for the power generation system in this study the comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs is defined to represent the reservoir s scale which is able to describe the key role of reservoirs in water supply system and power generation system concurrently as follows 5 e m g η h j ρ v g η h j ρ g 3 6 10 6 η v h kwh equation 5 is the calculation formula of water energy where m is the quality of the water flowing through the reservoir dams g is the acceleration of gravity ρ is the density of water v is the volume of the water flowing through the reservoir dams and η is the efficiency of water energy utilization according to equation 5 the comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs h s is specifically defined as follows 6 h s e ρ g 3 6 10 6 η v e ccw e c h c h g c c h v where ccw e c h is the calculation coefficient of water energy and is equal to ρ g 3 6 10 6 2 725 10 3 while chg c c h is the comprehensive hydropower generation coefficient and is equal to η in this study the historical h s can be obtained by equation 6 based on the known historical hydropower generation e and runoff v flowing through the basin outlet yc hydrologic station according to the above definition and the fig 4e the dynamics of h s are given as follows 7a d h s dt g r r h 7b g r r h min g c c h e a f a h 1 s t a f a h l r c h b e h a h h s 7c ea f a h f h e a f e a s 7d sta f a h f h s t a f s t l s 7e be h a h f h b e h t h c h p e h c h where g r r h is the growth rate of comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs h s g c c h is the growth coefficient of h s which can be understood as the average level of annual growth of h s l r c h is the loss rate of water head h s which may be caused by various reasons such as aging of reservoirs and geological disaster be h a h is the exploitable water head of the basin and is determined by the total comprehensive effective water head t h c h of basin and proportion of exploitable water head pe h c h as shown in fig 4e while their feedback relationships are expressed as the constitutive relation f h b e h shown in equation 7e ea f a h is the environmental awareness action factor iii and is affected by environmental awareness e a s and sta f a h is the science and technology action factor and is driven by the scientific and technological level st l s in equation 7b ea f a h reflects the inhibition effect of environmental awareness on reservoir construction sta f a h characterizes the promotion effect of the science and technology level on reservoir construction and be h a h h s indicates that the comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs h s in the upper yangtze river basin cannot exceed the exploitable water head be h a h 3 3 6 population equation the logistic model has been widely used to represent the dynamics of population size with limited resources feng et al 2016 2019 kingsland 1982 therefore considering the limited carrying capacity of water resources the population dynamics in the study area can be described as follows 8a d n s dt g r r n 8b g r r n n g r a n n s 1 n s wrc c a n 8c ng r a n f n n g r p i f e n a f e n 8d wrc c a n f n w r c c w s c a bwr c w u p c a n where n s is the population size of the basin g r r n is the growth rate of basin population and is expressed as the equation 8b ng r a n is the natural growth rate of population which is set as time variant according to historical statistical data the evolution track of population in the basin is basically consistent with the family planning policy orientation in addition there are relevant reports showing that the aging of population structure in china is gradually prominent http www gov cn zhengce content 2017 01 25 content 5163309 htm therefore the family planning policy impact factor pi f e n and population aging factor a f e n are chosen as the exogenous driving forces of ng r a n as shown in fig 4f and equation 8c wrc c a n is the water resource carrying capacity and it is directly affected by the comprehensive water use per capita cwup c a n and water supply capacity ws c a bwr and their feedback relationship is expressed as f n w r c c in equation 8d 3 3 7 gross basin product equation in this model wealth of the basin is expressed in term of gbp proposed by van emmerik et al 2014 in the upper yangtze river basin power resources and water resources are the key resources to drive economic development the supply of electrical energy and water resources as well as the power use efficiency and water use efficiency are the decisive factors to determine gbp for the basin based on this and according to fig 4g the gbp equation which shows the dynamics of gbp is expressed as follows 9a dgb p s dt g r r gbp 9b g r r gbp s g b p a gbp g b p s 9c sgb p a gbp min 10 4 twu p a gbp wdp g a gbp 10 4 tp g a gbp pdp g a gbp where gb p s is the gbp g r r gbp is the growth rate of gbp sgb p a gbp is the simulated value of gbp not the planned gbp in fig 4g in the basin twu p a gbp is the total water use for production tp g a gbp is the total power generation driven by power demand wdp g a gbp is the water demand per 10 000 rmb of gb p s and pdp g a gbp is the power demand per 10 000 rmb of gb p s in addition for the equation 9b its discrete representation i e g r r gbp t s g b p a gbp t g b p s t 1 can more clearly show how it actually works 3 4 model calibration in the above seven coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations which govern the coevolution of the wpe coupling system there are constants exogenous variables and constitutive relations which need to be estimated to complete the system dynamics model here the constants can be seen as the model parameters while exogenous variables represent the external environment of the system and are the external driving force of the system and the constitutive relations refer to the intrinsic characteristics embedded in the wpe coupling system van emmerik et al 2014 feng et al 2016 3 4 1 exogenous variables estimating there are four exogenous variables to be estimated in the model precipitation p e bwr policy impact factor pi f e n population aging factor a f e n and planned growth rate of gbp pg r e gbp as shown in fig 4 in this study these four exogenous variables are estimated separately for the simulation period 1998 2017 and prediction period 2018 2050 and their specific methods are described in supplementary material text s1 fig 5 shows the evolution trajectories of the estimated exogenous variables at this stage in the study there are no empirical data available to validate the estimates of the policy impact factor pi f e n and population aging factor a f e n therefore in order to ensure that the policy impact factor pi f e n and population aging factor a f e n could be reasonably estimated they are preliminarily designed according to the national population development plan 2016 2030 http www gov cn zhengce content 2017 01 25 content 5163309 htm and the china s family planning policy and healthy aging strategies http www nhc gov cn jtfzs zcwj2 zcwj shtml furthermore they are iteratively adjusted by using the trial and error method combined with model calibration 3 4 2 constitutive relations estimating in this study constitutive relations are the functional relationships that describe the feedback between the auxiliary variable and its direct causal factors sivapalan and blöschl 2015 the constitutive relations are the intrinsic characteristics embedded in the wpe coupling system which are the determinant linking state variables and dominate the coevolution of the wpe system van emmerik et al 2014 feng et al 2016 according to fig 4 and the governing equation in section 3 3 there are 40 constitutive relations that must be estimated herein according to the complexity of constitutive relations the forty constitutive relations are divided into two categories as shown in table 1 and table 2 type i indicates that the constitutive relation can be obtained directly through the definition of variables and the estimated constitutive relations are shown in table 1 type ii indicates that the constitutive relation should be properly estimated based on the observed data or expert knowledge combined with the model calibration the following discussion focuses on the estimation of constitutive relations of type ii the definition and symbol or abbreviation of all variables in the model can be viewed in fig 4 and appendix a the constitutive relations of type ii can be estimated using intuition through data analysis if the appropriate data exist taken from the literature on related studies or based on consensus principles e g logistic growth elshafei et al 2014 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 with these methods the seventeen constitutive relations of type ii can be estimated and are given in table 2 as shown in table 2 the water supply capacity ws c a bwr is a function of basin water resources bw r s proportion of exploitable water resources pew r c bwr as well as channelization index of river network cir n a h implying that the water supply capacity are affected mainly by the water resources and the reservoirs scale and this function is obtained by fitting the observed data the environment improvement coefficient ei c a ec is a function of environmental conditions e c s environmental awareness e a s scientific and technological level st l s and untapped water resources u w a bwr which takes into account the purification effect of the undeveloped water resources on the environment system the resilience stability of the environment system itself as well as the artificial restoration effect of environmental treatment on the environment system and the functional form is constructed following the research paradigm which has been widely adopted by researchers baldassarre et al 2013 chen et al 2016 elshafei et al 2014 van emmerik et al 2014 feng et al 2016 li et al 2019 roobavannan et al 2018 sivapalan and blöschl 2015 and the functional parameters are estimated iteratively by using the trial and error method combined with model calibration the environment deterioration coefficient ed c a ec is a function of environmental conditions e c s total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp and channelization index of river network cir n a h taking into account the deterioration effect of wastewater discharge on the environment system and the resistance stability of the environment system itself as well as the negative impact of river network channelization on the environment system and this function is estimated following the same method as the above the upper threshold of environmental conditions u t a ec is a function of untapped water resources u w a bwr and total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp which can be understood as the best state of the environment system that the polluted environment system can achieve under the dual effects of natural recovery and artificial treatment and this function is estimated using the same method as the above for the growth coefficient of environmental awareness g c a ea and decay coefficient of environmental awareness d c a ea both of them are functions of environmental awareness e a s similarly combined with calibration the trial and error method is employed to estimate these two functions the proportion of investment in science and technology p i a stl is a function of gbp gb p s and environmental awareness action factor ii ea f a stl in which ea f a stl dominates the evolution trend of p i a stl while gb p s promotes the growth of p i a stl and this function is estimated by fitting the observed data on the basis that ea f a stl is determined regarding the environmental awareness action factors i ea f a n ii ea f a stl and iii ea f a h all are functions of environmental awareness describing the impact of environmental awareness on different human activities respectively and these functions are estimated by using the trial and error method the science and technology action factor sta f a h is a function of scientific and technological level st l s representing the promotion effect of the science and technology level on reservoir construction and this function is estimated using the trial and error method water demands per capita wdp c a n is a function of gbp per capita gbpp c a n minimum water demands per capita lwdp c c n environmental awareness action factor i ea f a n as well as maximum water demands per capita uwdp c c n which is constructed following the function form of domestic water use equation in the work of li et al 2019 and estimated by fitting the observed data on the basis that ea f a n is determined the natural population growth rate ng r a n is a function of the aging factor of population a f e n and policy impact factor pi f e n this function is estimated iteratively by using the trial and error method combined the simulation result of population n s the comprehensive water consumption rate cwc r a gbp comprehensive rate of sewage generation rate crs g a gbp water demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp wdp g a gbp and power demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp pdp g a gbp all are functions of st l s and these four functions are estimated by fitting the observed data 3 4 3 initial conditions and model parameters setting table 3 shows the initial conditions for all state variables except the basin water resources bw r s in the model the initial condition of the basin water resources is unnecessary due to the assumption in the hydrology equation the initial conditions about st l s h s n s and gb p s are obtained according to the observed data the initial condition of e c s is determined based on the brief description of changjiang and southwest rivers water resources bulletin on the environmental health state in the basin while the initial condition for the state variables e a s is obtained by calibration in the system dynamics model of the wpe coupling system the values of 20 model parameters must be estimated these model parameters are the constant variables in the sfd model in fig 4 or the stylized model in section 3 3 the runoff coefficient of the river basin r c c bwr is obtained according to the observed data the proportion of exploitable water resources pew r c bwr is set following the research work of lei et al 2010 based on the statistical data about total water energy reserves of the basin and annually average runoff through the outlet of the basin the total comprehensive effective water head of the basin t h c h is calculated by equations 5 and 6 the calculation coefficient of water energy ccw e c h is obtained according to equation 6 the comprehensive hydropower generation coefficient chg c c h is set as 0 95 the proportion of exploitable water head pe h c h is estimated based on the exploitable water energy resources and total water energy reserves in the basin the minimum domestic water demands per capita per year lwdp c c n is set as the minimum value of historical domestic water use per capita per year the maximum domestic water demands per capita per year uwdp c c n is set as 100 m3 according to the research of li et al 2019 in this study the power generation system is dominated by hydropower generation so the hydropower generation and its related reservoir construction are considered as the main components of the wpe coupling system while the non hydropower generation is only a supplement to hydropower and not focused on in this study therefore in order to constrain model complexity the installed non hydroelectric capacity inh c c gbp is set to a large enough value 100 108 kw in other words the non hydropower can always supplement the shortage of hydropower in fact this assumption is reasonable because traditional thermal power plants can be quickly established in order to respond to power demand finally all other model parameters are obtained by using the trial and error method table 3 shows the definition of model parameters and the calibrated values of model parameters 4 results and discussion the results of the system dynamics model implementation in the upper yangtze river basin are presented in four parts 1 the system dynamics model is first validated by comparing the observed data with simulated data 2 the coevolution process and its dynamics of the wpe coupling system are then analyzed and interpreted 3 the implications for future water management are discussed based on the possible future coevolution trajectories of the wpe coupling system and 4 the sensitivity analysis of model parameters is performed to assess the sensitivity and robustness of the model 4 1 model validation in this study the same 20 year data set for 1998 2017 is used for model calibration and validation due to the relatively short series of historical observation data which is similar to the practice of feng et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 the simulated values of 18 variables in the model are compared with the corresponding observed values in addition the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 legates and mccabe 1999 and mean absolute percentage error mape myttenaere et al 2016 for these 18 variables are calculated to show the model performance which is shown in table 4 as shown in table 4 except for the variable nh g a gbp the mapes of other variables are below 20 that is most variables are not overestimated or underestimated in addition r2 and nses of these 18 variables show that other variables except variables tdw w a gbp twu p a gbp tw u a gbp tw c a gbp and nh g a gbp have been well simulated using the system dynamics model finally it is worth noting that since the planned growth rate of gbp during the simulation period is designed to be the actual growth rate of gbp of the basin fig 5b and simultaneously the water supply capacity can meet the total water demand for production during the simulation period the simulated evolution trajectory of gbp and observed one are coincident so the mape of gbp in table 4 is 0 from the three performance indices of the model we can see that only a few variables cannot be well simulated however according to the fig 6 the simulated total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp total water use for production twu p a gbp total basin water use tw u a gbp total basin water consumption tw c a gbp and non hydroelectric generation nh g a gbp are all acceptable both in terms of magnitude and trend compared with the observed values the evolution trends of these five variables are shown in the dotted green lines in fig 6k 6l 6n 6q and 6r for these five variables the reasons for the poor performance of the model can be explained as follows 1 the gbp gb p s in fig 6a enlarges the influence of simulation error of productive water demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp wdp g a gbp in fig 6b which increases the simulation error of total water use for production twu p a gbp and further affects the simulation accuracy of total basin water use tw u a gbp total discharge of waste water tdw w a gbp and total basin water consumption tw c a gbp and 2 the simulation error of power demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp pdp g a gbp in fig 6c leads to a larger power demand than the actual demand which in turn leads to increased non hydropower generation nh g a gbp in fig 6r therefore the simulation results can be accepted taking all of these variables into consideration and the system dynamics model is suitable for exploring possible future coevolution trajectories of the wpe coupling system 4 2 coevolution of the wpe coupling system in this study the evolution processes of exogenous variables are estimated in three scenarios 1 in the rcp 2 6 scenario precipitation under the low emission scenario rcp 2 6 and low planned growth rate of gbp are estimated 2 in the rcp 4 5 scenario precipitation under the medium emission scenario rcp 4 5 and medium planned growth rate of gbp are estimated 3 in the rcp 8 5 scenario precipitation under the high emission scenario rcp 8 5 and high planned growth rate of gbp are estimated as shown in fig 5 taking the estimated exogenous variables in fig 5 as the input the wpe coupling system is simulated by using the system dynamics model based on the ventana simulation environment vensimdss for windows version 5 11a copyright 1998 2010 ventana systems inc the simulated results under three scenarios are shown in figs 7 9 fig 7 shows the possible future coevolution trajectories of state variables including the scientific and technological level st l s population size n s gbp gb p s comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs h s environmental awareness e a s environmental conditions e c s and basin water resources bw r s fig 8 shows the evolution trajectories of rate variables that describe the speed of change of the state variables fig 9 presents the future evolution trajectories of certain key auxiliary variables in the model in addition the black dotted line is the dividing line between the simulation period 1998 2017 and prediction period 2018 2050 as shown in figs 7 9 since the exogenous input of the model is unique in the simulation period the model output is the same in this section the coevolution processes and its dynamics of wpe coupling system under rcp 8 5 scenario are analyzed and interpreted while the comparative analysis of the coevolution under each of the three scenarios is conducted in section 4 3 fig 7a shows the s shaped evolution track of the scientific and technological level st l s and its rate of change is presented in fig 8h fig 7b illustrates that the population size n s gradually increases in the early stage and decreases in the later stage after reaching the peak and the rate of change of population is shown in fig 8c fig 7c presents the gbp gb p s which increases rapidly in the early stage and fluctuates around a certain value in the later stage and the rate of change of gb p s is illustrated in fig 8f fig 7d shows the evolution of comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs h s is approximately exponential growth and the rate of change of h s is presented in fig 8g fig 7e illustrates the possible evolution trajectory of environmental awareness e a s and its rate of growth increases gradually as shown in fig 8d fig 7f shows the three stages of the evolution of environmental conditions e c s 1 in the early stage of the river basin development 1998 2019 the health states of the environment system deteriorates rapidly 2 in the middle stage 2020 2036 the environmental conditions recover slowly and 3 in the late stage 2037 2050 the environmental conditions begin to deteriorate again furthermore the rates of change of environmental conditions are shown in fig 8b and 8e the dynamics of the coevolution process of state variables can be interpreted as follows science and technology investments are the primary driving force of technological progress but this is also influenced by the investment willingness and wealth of human society as shown in the sfd model in fig 4 in the upper yangtze river basin the proportion of investments in science and technology fig 9a gradually increases being driven by the environmental awareness of human community fig 7e and the gbp fig 7c which in turn increases the science and technology investments further driven by these science and technology investments the progress rate of science and technology level gradually increases but due to the bottleneck effect of science and technology development its progress rate begins to decline around 2033 as shown in fig 8h the above is the dynamics explanation of s shaped evolution of science and technology fig 7a according to the sfd model the water resource carrying capacity family planning policy and population aging are the main driving forces of population evolution as shown in fig 4 before 2011 under the influence of the family planning policy fig 5c and with the decrease of the water resource carrying capacity fig 9c the growth rate of basin population gradually decreases fig 8c and the population growth trend in the basin slows down fig 7b however after 2011 due to the relaxation of family planning policy fig 5c and increase in the water resource carrying capacity fig 9c the growth rate of basin population shows an upward trend fig 8c however with the gradual deepening of the aging of the population fig 5c the growth rate of basin population declines again after 2020 and drops to 0 around 2030 fig 8c when the population reaches its peak fig 7b after 2030 the population aging dominates the population evolution process fig 5c and the population gradually decreases fig 7b in the system dynamics model the auxiliary variable natural population growth rate is the bridge for the family planning policy factor and population aging factor to influence evolution of population its evolution process is shown in fig 9b in this study the evolution process of population shown in fig 7b is basically consistent with the development trend given in the national population development plan 2016 2030 which can be

2050 with the continuous construction of water conservancy infrastructure fig 7d and the continuous improvement of the scientific and technological level fig 7a the water supply capacity fig 9d and hydropower generation capacity fig 9l of the basin increase rapidly and the productive water demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp fig 9e and power demand per 10 000 rmb of gbp fig 9m decrease rapidly providing a strong guarantee for the rapid economic development of the basin fig 7c however with the continuous growth of the gbp of the basin the water supply capacity is not sufficient to support the planned growth rate of gbp which makes the evolution trend of the gbp and its rate of change fluctuate with the water supply capacity as shown in fig 7c and 8f in the system dynamics model proposed by this study the environmental awareness and the scientific and technological level are the main driving forces of construction of reservoirs as shown in fig 9n and fig 9o combined with equation 7b it can be seen that the inhibition effect of environmental awareness on the development of reservoirs is gradually prominent while the promotion effect of science and technology on the construction of reservoirs is gradually strengthened under the comprehensive effect of science and technology and environmental awareness the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs which is equivalent to the scale of reservoirs in the basin increases approximatively exponentially as shown in fig 7d and 8g in addition according to the evolution process shown in fig 7d the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs approaches its exploitable upper limit in theory around 2026 which is basically consistent with the expected development goal of the 13th five year plan for hydropower development http www nea gov cn 2016 11 29 c 135867663 htm the measure of environmental awareness is used to represent the community s response to the health state of the environment system in the basin in the model the environmental health state is the only driving force for the accumulation or decline of environmental awareness under rcp 8 5 scenario the water supply system and power generation system have a significant negative effect on the environment system of the basin and cause environmental conditions to fail in recovering above the critical threshold during 1998 2050 fig 7f as a result the environmental awareness of human community continues to grow during 1998 2050 as shown in fig 7e in addition due to the self promotion effect of environmental awareness the growth rate of this variable is gradually accelerated as shown in fig 8d water and power related human activities including sewage discharge and hydropower generation negatively affect the natural environment system of the upper yangtze river basin as can be seen from fig 7f the evolution track of environmental conditions in rcp 8 5 scenario experiences three stages in the early stage of the basin development 1998 2019 due to the low level of science and technology fig 7a the productive water demand per 10 000 rmb gbp is large fig 9e causing the productive water use of the basin to gradually increase with the gbp growth fig 9f at the same time due to the weak awareness of environmental protection fig 7e and the stimulation of increasing wealth fig 7c in this period the domestic water demand per capita fig 9g and total domestic water use fig 9h in the basin gradually increase the dual drive of productive water use and domestic water use causes the total water use of the basin fig 9i to increase gradually while the rate of sewage generation fig 9j also shows an increasing trend in this period leading to the rapid increase of the total discharge of waste water fig 9k the pollution effect of a large amount of waste water on the environment system which is magnified by the river channelization caused by reservoir construction fig 7d causes the recovery ability of the environment system fig 9p to be lower than its deterioration stress fig 9q and affects the best state fig 9r to which the environment system can recover thus the improvement rate of the environmental conditions fig 8e is lower than its deterioration rate fig 8b so that the health state of the environment system gradually deteriorates fig 7f in the middle stage of basin development 2020 2036 the deteriorating environment system fig 7f stimulates the growth of environmental awareness of human communities fig 7e which promotes the annual increase of investment in science and technology and the rapid improvement of the level of science and technology fig 7a the progress of science and technology thus improves the efficiency of productive water use fig 9e reduces the rate of sewage generation fig 9j and enhances the water environment treatment capacity of the human community in spite of the rapid economic growth in the basin during this period fig 7c the higher water use efficiency avoids a large amount of production water demand and maintains the total water use for production at a lower growth rate fig 9f in addition the decreasing rate of sewage generation also effectively avoids the possibility of increasing sewage discharge caused by the increase of water use causing the sewage discharge to gradually decrease fig 9k with the gradual reduction of sewage discharge the improvement rate of environmental conditions is higher than its deterioration rate fig 8b and fig 8e under the effect of self resilience of the environment system and artificial remediation of water environment treatment so that the health state of the environment system is gradually improved as shown in fig 7f in the late stage of basin development 2037 2050 with the support of high level science and technology fig 7a the water use efficiency nearly reaches its highest level fig 9e and the rate of sewage generation is almost at its lowest level fig 9j however in this period the scale of gbp in the basin is very large fig 7c and the total water use for production and living gradually reaches the limit level of water supply capacity in the basin fig 9d and 9i leading to the rapid growth of wastewater discharge in the basin fig 9k with the large scale exploitation and utilization of water resources and the large scale discharge of waste water as well as the negative effect of rivers channelization on the environment system the stability of resilience and resistance of the environment system and the artificial restoration effect of water environment treatment on the environment system are not sufficient to contain the deterioration of the environment resulting in the continued deterioration of the environment fig 7f finally the coevolution trajectories of state variables in other scenarios rcp 2 6 scenario and rcp 4 5 scenario can be analyzed and interpreted in a similar manner 4 3 implications for future water management in this section we compare the future coevolution trajectories of state variables under three different scenarios we believe that this comparative analysis is favorable to better understanding of the coevolution and its dynamics of the wpe coupling system which can provide insightful reference information for the decision making of water resources management fig 7 shows the possible future coevolution trajectories of state variables under three different scenarios as shown in fig 7 the laws of coevolution of the state variables are nearly identical in different scenarios even for certain state variables in which their evolution processes are almost overlapping in addition an emergent property of the wpe coupling system can be observed according to the coevolution processes in fig 7 which is interpreted in detail below the dynamics reasons of the above observations can be explained as follows because the state of environment system health in each of the three scenarios fails to recover above the critical threshold i e the critical threshold for environmental conditions c t c ea in equations 3b and 3c over an extended time period the environmental awareness continues growing resulting in nearly the same evolution track of environmental awareness for all three scenarios as shown in fig 7e and 7f before the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs increases to its exploitable upper limit the evolution tracks of its two main influencing factors i e the environmental awareness and scientific and technological level are nearly overlapping in all three scenarios fig 7a and 7e such that the evolution tracks of the comprehensive effective head of reservoirs in the three scenarios are identical as shown fig 7d for the state variable population size its evolution trend is mainly affected by two exogenous variables the policy impact factor and population aging factor fig 5c while the auxiliary variable water resource carrying capacity fig 9c mainly affects its magnitude therefore under each of the three scenarios the evolution trends of the population size of basin are essentially identical although there is a certain gap in their magnitude as shown in fig 7b the evolution of the scientific and technological level is dominated by the wealth of the river basin and the environmental awareness of the human community because the evolution laws of different evolution tracks of the two driving forces are basically similar fig 7c and 7e the different evolution tracks of the science and technology level all are s shaped in addition the evolution of river basin wealth with the low medium and high growth rates fig 5b and 7c inevitably lead to low medium and high levels of science and technology investment respectively which in turn leads to different progress rates of the science and technology level in different scenarios as shown in fig 7a for the state variable gbp when the water resources and power resources are sufficient to support the production and living demand of the basin the gbp increases according to the planned growth rate of gbp fig 5b otherwise the growth of gbp is limited by the water supply capacity fig 9d and power generation capacity fig 9l the evolution tracks of gbp under three scenarios are shown in fig 7c as shown in fig 7f corresponding to the different evolution processes of the basin gbp fig 7c the basin environment conditions also evolve along three different evolution tracks reflecting the dynamic evolution of the relationship between economic development and the environmental pollution in the river basin aiming at the problems of economic development and environmental pollution meadows et al 1972 cleveland et al 1984 and arrow et al 1995 found that economic development exerts pressure on the environment and when this pressure exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment the ecosystem will collapse based on this we can consider that the scale of economic activities is directly proportional to the degree of environmental deterioration which is a relatively intuitive judgment however according to the coevolution process of environmental conditions and gbp in fig 7f and fig 7c this intuitive judgment is not supported in other words fig 7c and 7f show an counterintuitive phenomenon or an emergent property of wpe coupling system that is with the economic growth of the basin the environment system gradually deteriorates and after the economic level reaches a certain scale the environment system begins to improve gradually in fact this counterintuitive relationship between economic development and environmental pollution can be described by the environment kuznets curve ekc hypothesis proposed by grossman and krueger 1991 many scholars have empirically tested the ekc hypothesis from different perspectives and shown the validity of the ekc copeland and taylor 1994 grossman and krueger 1995 muradian and martinez alier 2001 panayotou 1997 pasche 2002 selden and song 1995 stern 2002 suri and chapman 1998 a simplified illustration of the ekc is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from fig 7f and 10 with the growth of the basin s gbp under the rcp 2 6 scenario and rcp 4 5 scenario the evolution process of the environmental health state is very similar to the ekc curve however under rcp 8 5 scenario the environmental health state of the river basin deteriorates again after a slow improvement which can be described by the following improved ekc curve the reason there are two evolution patterns figs 10 and 11 is as follows pattern i fig 10 in the early stage of basin development under the rcp 2 6 scenario and rcp 4 5 scenario the level of science and technology is low fig 7a the efficiency of water use is low fig 9e and the rate of sewage generation is high fig 9j which causes the total water use fig 9i and total sewage discharge fig 9k to gradually increase with the growth of the economic scale of the basin leading to the development of the environment in the direction of deterioration fig 7f however in the middle and later stage of basin development the level of science and technology is relatively high fig 7a the awareness of water environment treatment fig 7e and the efficiency of water use in the basin fig 9e are gradually improved and the rate of sewage generation is gradually reduced fig 9j causing the total water use and total discharge of waste water remain at a relatively low level with the growth of economic scale thus promoting the development of the environment in the direction of improvement as shown in fig 7f the above analysis is from the perspective of technological progress to explain pattern i similar to the work of selden and song 1995 and pasche 2002 pattern ii fig 11 the coevolution trajectories of state variables in rcp 8 5 scenario are interpreted in detail in section 4 2 in fact the interpretation of pattern ii is also from the perspective of technological progress the reason the environment system deteriorates again in pattern ii is that when the economic growth is too rapid and the scale is too large the technological progress is not sufficient to curb the large scale water use and sewage discharge so that in turn the resilience stability and resistance stability of the environment system itself and the artificial restoration effect of water environment treatment on the environment system are not sufficient to curb the environmental degradation resulting in a second period of environmental deterioration based on the above analysis we infer that under the rcp 2 6 scenario and rcp 4 5 scenario the water supply system power generation system and environment system all coordinate with each other and coevolve towards a sustainable direction while under rcp 8 5 scenario the wpe coupling system will collapse however we think this is a kind of self deception according to the evolution trend of the environment system as shown in fig 7f we believe that if no other measures can be taken to effectively avoid pollution then with the growth of the economic scale of the basin the environment system will face inevitable collapse regardless of how moderate the growth rate of the economic scale remains in other words pattern ii is the future of pattern i unless river basin communities can control the scale of basin economic development or find environmental shelters which is a concept put forward by copeland and taylor 1994 meaning that a region transfers pollution industries to other locations to protect its own ecological and environmental security finally based on the above discussion and analysis three insightful observations can be obtained as follows 1 economic growth and environment system restoration and improvement are not absolute opposites the improvement of the science and technology level the improvement of water use efficiency and the reduction of sewage generation rate together can alleviate the large scale water demand caused by the continuous growth of economic scale and avoid large scale water use and sewage discharge thus promoting the improvement of environmental conditions in the basin 2 however when the economic scale of the basin is too large such as rcp 8 5 scenario the improvement of water use efficiency cannot effectively reduce its large scale water demand inevitably leading to a large amount of waste water thus seriously deteriorating the environment therefore while paying attention to economic growth we should also properly control the economic scale 3 when the intensity of human activities is within a reasonable range the water supply system power generation system and environment system are able to coordinate with each other and the wpe coupling system develops in an orderly direction in these conditions the ekc curve can be used to describe the relationship between the intensity of human activities and the deterioration of the environment system when the intensity of human activities is very intense the water supply system and power generation system cause significant stress on the environment system and the wpe coupling system develops in a disorderly direction in these conditions the improved ekc curve can be used to describe the relationship between human activity intensity and environment system deterioration 4 4 sensitivity analysis of model parameters the system dynamics model which is essentially a socio hydrological model sivapalan and blöschl 2015 though parsimonious has numerous parameters although this can cause the model to more flexibly represent diverse socio hydrological behaviors it may also lead to model uncertainty and parameter equifinality savenije 2001 van emmerik et al 2014 in order to verify the impacts of model parameters on the coevolution processes of state variables and assess alternate realities that the system dynamics model can generate based on the alternative future evolution trajectories corresponding to various parameters elshafei et al 2014 feng et al 2016 2019 van emmerik et al 2014 a sensitivity analysis is conducted under the parameter settings presented in table 5 for each parameter 1000 values are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution specified by the minimum and maximum values using a monte carlo algorithm embedded in vensim software each parameter is varied within the sampled 1000 values with the other parameters remaining unchanged in addition of the parameters listed in table 3 only those which have a significant influence on model output are selected for the sensitivity analysis and the process is described as follows through the vensim simulation platform taking the estimated exogenous variables in rcp 4 5 scenario in fig 5 as the input the evolution trajectories of state variables with varied parameter values are obtained the evolution trajectories of the environmental conditions are selected as an example as shown in fig 12 the evolution trajectories of other state variables are shown in supplementary material figs s1 to s5 in fig 12 different colors represent different confidence boundaries yellow represents the 50 confidence boundary green 75 blue 95 and gray 100 in addition the red line represents the mean value of 1000 trajectories taking the 50 confidence boundary as an example it shows that at each time point 1 4 of the trajectories have a bigger value than the top of the confidence boundary while 1 4 of the trajectories have a smaller value than the bottom of the boundary other confidence boundaries can be similarly understood it can be seen from fig 12 that the evolution of environmental conditions is sensitive to most of the selected parameters which also implies that the parameters in one system can influence the evolution of state variables in other system in fact this is not surprising because this is the external manifestation of the interaction between the water supply power generation and environment systems by comparing the evolution trajectories of different state variables the following three observations can be noted firstly as shown in fig 12 the growth index of environmental awareness g i c ea critical threshold of environmental conditions c t c ea output index of science and technology investment o i c stl and progress coefficient of scientific and technological level p c c stl are identified as the most sensitive parameters that influence the evolution of environmental conditions e c s similarly according to the figs s1 to s5 in the supplementary material the impacts of these parameters on the evolution of other state variables can also be identified for the population size n s the proportion of exploitable water resources pew r c bwr and loss rate of comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs l r c h are identified as the most sensitive parameters for the scientific and technological level st l s parameters o i c stl and p c c stl are most sensitive for the comprehensive effective water head of reservoirs in basin h s parameters o i c stl and g i c ea are most sensitive for environmental awareness e a s parameters g i c ea c t c ea o i c stl and p c c stl are the most sensitive parameters which significantly change the evolution process for the gbp gb p s parameters pew r c bwr and o i c stl are most sensitive secondly as shown in fig 12 when these parameters are varied not only the timing and magnitude of the evolution process of environmental conditions are affected but also the evolution pattern fig 12 shows that the system dynamics model is able to simulate three different evolution patterns of the wpe coupling system i e continued decline pattern ekc pattern fig 10 and improved ekc pattern fig 11 as can be seen from fig 12 in most cases the model outcomes with varied parameter values are relatively close to the evolution pattern of the best fit with reality i e the ekc pattern decline followed by a growth in rcp 4 5 scenario in fig 7f which can be verified by the mean value trajectories however low c t c ea low o i c stl or low g i c ea lead to evolution trajectories that resemble the continued decline pattern medium values of the parameters g i c ea or p c c stl lead to evolution processes that resemble the improved ekc pattern in fig 11 thirdly according to the evolution trajectories of all state variables with varied parameter values we find that the uncertainty of model output caused by parameter uncertainty increases with time which can be shown in fig 13 drawn by referring to the work of zhao et al 2011 in fact for almost all prediction models the evolution law of model output uncertainty with time follows this rule it is worth emphasizing that the focus of this study is on predicting and understanding possible future trajectories of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin by using the system dynamics model rather than accurately predicting future trends therefore reducing the uncertainty of model output is not the focus of this study and the limited model output uncertainty will not have a great impact on our research nevertheless we attempted to avoid uncertainty which is why we only forecast to 2050 the development of the model presented in this study including the performed sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential of using system dynamics modeling from the perspective of socio hydrology to understand and predict possible future trajectories of the coevolution of the wpe coupling system conceptually our model is fundamentally sound and agrees with certain other socio hydrologic modeling and system dynamics modeling elshafei et al 2014 feng et al 2016 2019 king et al 2017 li et al 2019 van emmerik et al 2014 5 conclusions this study used the system dynamics model to predict and evaluate the coevolution and dynamics of the wpe coupling system our efforts to understand the possible future coevolution trajectories of the wpe coupling system include the following 1 firstly the system dynamics model which comprises the conceptual sfd and stylized models was constructed to describe the dynamics of state variables of the wpe coupling system 2 secondly the model was applied to the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin of china 3 then the coevolution process and associated dynamics of the wpe coupling system were analyzed and interpreted and its implications for future water resources management are discussed and 4 the sensitivity analysis of model parameters was performed finally the following conclusions were drawn 1 the system dynamics model established in this paper explicitly considers the two way feedback between human and water systems through environmental condition response linkage environmental awareness response linkage and environmental awareness action linkage thus it is suitable for modeling the coevolution of the wpe coupling system this model provides a powerful tool for exploring and understanding the emergent properties of the wpe coupling system 2 according to the coevolution trajectories of state variables two coevolution patterns of the wpe coupling system the ekc pattern and the improved ekc pattern are identified in the ekc pattern due to the economic development scale is appropriate the water supply system power generation system and environment system coordinate with each other resulting in the development of the wpe coupling system in an orderly direction however in the improved ekc pattern due to the economic scale is too large water supply system and power generation system cause significant stress on the environment system such that the wpe coupling system will develop in a disorderly direction this emergent property shows that the relationship between economic development and environmental improvement is not absolutely contradictory however if the scale of economic development is not limited their relationship will gradually evolve in the direction of contradiction 3 model parameters not only affect the timing and magnitude of the evolution trajectories of state variables but also their evolution patterns for instance the evolution processes of environmental health with varied parameters can be classified into three different evolution patterns the continued decline pattern ekc pattern and improved ekc pattern in addition the uncertainties of model output caused by parameter uncertainties increases with time in this study the coevolution of the wpe coupling system in the upper yangtze river basin was modeled effectively and its possible future trajectories were predicted and understood using the system dynamics model however this study should only be taken as a plausible research paradigm for the modeling of the wep coupling system there are several aspects to be further studied 1 a method for determining the planned growth rate of gbp policy impact factor and population aging factor endogenously rather than exogenously need to be determined 2 the richness of historical observation data which affects the model calibration and test ability must be improved and 3 the physical mechanism of feedbacks and interactions within the wpe coupling system need to be clarified further credit authorship contribution statement benjun jia software writing original draft validation jianzhong zhou

4974,the simultaneous thermodynamic pathways i e isenthalps of the air at the measurement height and at the vegetated land surface under isobaric and adiabatic wetting drying cycles of the environment make it possible to define the actual evaporation rate with the help of three one measured and two derived vapor pressure and corresponding temperature terms from the first order approximation about the constancy of the relative average speed which the two isenthalps are travelled at during drying out of the environment a non dimensional linear form of the complementary relationship cr of evaporation naturally emerges but now expressed by vapor pressures and temperatures respectively without an artificially low priestley taylor parameter value this linear cr would overestimate the evaporation rates because the surface warms faster than the constant relative speed assumption permits with the appropriate estimation of the wet surface temperature and employment of realistic boundary conditions the latter leading to a nonlinear cr land evaporation rates can be estimated fairly accurately with minimal input variables air temperature humidity wind speed and net surface radiation and without any information of land surface properties not only actual but three potential evaporation rates can also be defined by linking the temperature vapor pressure coordinates of the air and the surface isenthalps thus reproducing certain existing formulations of the cr as well as re creating an existing hybrid containing both non dimensional vapor pressure and evaporation terms version of it keywords complementary relationship land evaporation water phase diagram isenthalps 1 introduction the complementary relationship cr of evaporation first proposed by bouchet 1963 is one of the few tools available to hydrologists civil biological environmental engineers hydro meteorologists and climate modelers to estimate actual land evaporation rates with minimal atmospheric and radiation input data requirements and without detailed knowledge of the land surface properties while the cr is widely accepted to build on the intricate feedback mechanism present in the land atmosphere interface brutsaert 1982 morton 1983 its critiques see it as merely an heuristic approach without much concrete physical basis mcnaughton and spriggs 1989 or valid only under certain environmental conditions shuttleworth et al 2009 potentially contributing to its largely underemployed and overlooked status in the hydrological hydro meteorological and climate modeling community despite numerous highly successful efforts to prove the predictive power of its recently developed non dimensional versions brutsaert 2015 crago et al 2016 brutsaert et al 2017 2020 han and tian 2018 a calibration free non dimensional and nonlinear version of the cr szilagyi et al 2017 has also been systematically compared to other more data intensive and complex remote sensing reanalysis land surface model and machine learning based methods on a continental scale for further demonstration of its capabilities szilagyi 2018 ma et al 2019 ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2020 szilagyi et al 2020 despite of its remarkable performance the cr still needs a long overdue clear physically based derivation for an anticipated better acceptance and wider recognition by the geophysical community in large the cr has classically been based on the realization that the actual unknown land evaporation rate e m s 1 can be inferred from evaporation rates of two wet land surfaces different only in spatial extent one is plot sized with corresponding evaporation rate of ep the other regionally significant with evaporation rate of ew the difference in the two wet surface evaporation rates ep ew e is caused by horizontal energy advection called oasis effect which becomes stronger with the drying of the environment in the form of hotter and drier air blown over the plot sized wet surface thus increasing its evaporation rate the same effect is negligible on a wet land of regional extent as the originally hot and dry air becomes ever cooler and wetter along its trajectory over the expansive wet surface until it blends completely into the already cool and moist air of the expansive wet land while the plot sized wet surface can hardly influence the physical properties of the air blown over it the regionally expansive wet land can fully influence and transform it bringing it into equilibrium with its net energy and surface properties it follows that in the so called wet environment of the regionally expansive wet land surface the three evaporation rates potential ep wet environment ew and actual e become equal it also follows then that the actual land evaporation rate can be derived from differences in the ep and ew terms i e it is expected that the larger this difference the stronger the oasis effect therefore the more arid the environment has become which means a proportionally reduced wet environment evaporation rate as actual evaporation different authors came up with different mostly heuristic answers to how this rate of reduction should be formulated see han and tian 2020 for a brief review on the history of the cr theory the heuristic formulation of the cr however can be augmented or completely replaced by a physically based one when taking into consideration that the moisture content of the air during wetting and drying cycles of the environment is explicitly related to its temperature under a constant in a daily or longer averaging sense wind and energy qn rn g where rn w m 2 is the net surface radiation and g w m 2 soil heat flux into the ground available at the surface for latent i e evaporation and sensible heat h fluxes for possible objections that these two requirements i e temporally constant qn and horizontal wind speed are right away untenable as both wind and surface available energy are affected by drying wetting of the environment it is worth to mention that the only measurements employed in the cr in general come from just one type of actual typically drying conditions no simultaneous wet and drying environment measurements of any kind are ever employed so that the wet or drying environment data could come from disturbed environmental conditions meaning wind and qn different from those observed in the actual drying wet environment thus not being representative of the actually observed conditions in other words the physical reasoning in what follows employs a hypothetical as long as drying conditions prevail otherwise the hypothetical becomes what is being measured wet environment evaporation term valid strictly under the measured typically drying environment qn and wind conditions as base of reference therefore the question whether wetting drying cycle constancy of the qn and wind terms actually holds true or not in nature is irrelevant below a derivation giving rise to a physical foundation of the cr is given the water phase diagrams build upon the work of monteith 1981 szilagyi and jozsa 2008 szilagyi 2014 and qualls and crago 2020 corresponding states i e points given by temperature and vapor pressure coordinates along the resulting adiabatic lines i e isenthalps are related to different evaporation terms the cr emerges by considerations about the mean speed the corresponding isenthalps are traveled at during a complete dry out of the environment from a fully wet starting condition the resulting equation then is written in different forms by employing various wet surface evaporation rates realistic boundary conditions are also introduced to account for possible changes in the mean speed the isenthalps are traveled at during a dry out finally the different versions of the cr equations are tested with eddy covariance measurements 2 theory thermodynamic pathways of an air layer in contact with the evaporating surface 2 1 derivation of the isenthalps let us consider the air layer that extends from the vegetated i e canopy surface to the height of measurements zm which can be a few meters to possibly up to several tens of meters above the surface let the surface receive a temporally constant energy qn w m 2 available for sensible h w m 2 and latent heat le w m 2 fluxes under a steady wind profile the latent heat flux can be expressed as le lvρwe where lv j kg 1 is the latent heat of vaporization ρw kg m 3 the density of water and e m s 1 is the evaporation rate let us assume that the latent and sensible heat fluxes stay constant along any vertical the sum of them equaling the constant qn which approximately holds true in the lowest part of the neutral atmospheric surface layer brutsaert 1982 leading to adiabatic conditions then the temporal rate of change t in h defined as 1 h c p ρ k z z θ t z and le as 2 le l v ρ k z z q t z is equal but opposite in sign at any level above the vegetated surface i e 3 t h t l e 0 here cp j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat of air at constant pressure p hpa ρ kg m 3 air density k m2 s 1 the turbulent diffusivity assumed to be the same for water vapor and heat exchange z denotes differentiation with respect to height above the surface q the specific humidity of the air approximately equal to 0 622 e p where e hpa is the vapor pressure finally θ k is the potential temperature obtainable as ta gzm cp e g stull 2000 where ta k is the air temperature measured at zm and g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration note that q and θ also e and t are temporal averages of a suitably chosen relatively short time period e g 20 min and depend on both time t and height z above the surface while k is only a function of height by inserting the flux expressions eqs 1 and 2 into eq 3 changing the order of differentiations and integrating with respect to elevation one obtains 4 0 622 t e z p c p t t z l v f t which holds true at any height in any time f t is an unknown function including being a constant that may depend only on time for a physically meaningful solution f t must be a constant the constant must be equal to zero then otherwise the sum of the t and e values at any height would be a linear function of time and thus boundless which violates the constant qn assumption at the surface under which the attainable maximum surface temperature is limited thus eq 4 transforms into 5 de d t γ yielding quasi straight lines i e adiabats which are also called isenthalps under isobaric conditions of slope γ hpa k 1 in the e versus t phase diagram fig 1 here γ cpp 0 622lv is the so called psychrometric constant its minor temperature dependence due to the lv term is neglected in this study eq 5 says that changes in vapor pressure as a result of changing evaporation rates at the land surface are strictly tied to changes in air temperature under adiabatic and isobaric conditions fig 1 depicts the two isenthalps in the water phase diagram the lower one from here on referenced as air isenthalp after qualls and crago 2020 at the measurement height zm the other at the surface upper one note that for larger measurement heights all measured temperature values are ought to be converted to potential temperatures and all ensuing calculations performed with those converted values this way fig 1 is strictly valid for measurements at a few meters above the surface 2 2 important points of the isenthalps at the air isenthalp the minimum temperature achievable by evaporating water into the air is given by the wet bulb temperature twb obtainable from monteith 1981 szilagyi 2014 6 e wb e a t wb t a γ where ea and ta the measured vapor pressure and air temperature while ewb e twb the saturation vapor pressure at twb eq 6 is implicit for twb and can be solved by iterations using e g the teten s formula for the saturation vapor pressure e t 6 108exp 17 27 t 237 3 t where t is supplied in degree centigrade note that ea e td where td is the dew point temperature on the other extreme the highest temperature ta dry under a constant qn is obtained when the air becomes devoid of moisture yielding szilagyi et al 2017 szilagyi 2018 7 t a dry t wb e wb γ t a e a γ for placement of the surface isenthalp the wet surface temperature tws can be used szilagyi and schepers 2014 demonstrated that the wet surface temperature is independent of the areal extent of the wet surface thus it can be estimated for a plot sized wet patch that can only slightly influence the temperature and humidity of the overpassing air by assuming also that qn of the drying land is approximately valid for the wet patch one can write out the bowen ratio bo h le as follows szilagyi and jozsa 2008 8 h le q n e p e p γ t ws t a e t ws e a where qn now is expressed in water equivalents of mm d 1 and the above estimate of tws is denoted by tws sj from here on when tws is discussed below in general then the superscript is omitted eq 8 is another implicit equation for tws similar to eq 6 the evaporation rate of the wet patch can be obtained by the penman equation 1948 as 9 e p δ q n δ γ γ f u e t a e a δ γ where the empirical wind function fu mm d 1 hpa 1 is traditionally given by brutsaert 1982 fu 0 26 1 0 54u2 here u2 m s 1 is the horizontal wind speed at 2 m it can be estimated by a power function brutsaert 1982 from measurements uh at h meters above the surface as u2 uh 2 h 1 7 δ denotes the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at the measured temperature ta a possible correction to the tws sj value as was recently suggested by qualls and crago 2020 is discussed in appendix i the maximum achievable surface temperature ts dry can be obtained from eq 7 by replacing twb with tws sj in fig 1 different evaporation rates can be defined qualls and crago 2020 if eq 2 is divided by lvρw and finite differences are employed i e 10 e 0 622 ρ p ρ w k z z e 0 622 k z m r d t ρ w z m e a e s f w e s e a where rd is the gas constant of dry air 287 j kg 1 k 1 and fw m s 1 pa 1 is a general wind function when es i e the vapor pressure at the surface is ews e tws then eq 10 yields ep and the vertical projection of the corresponding dotted ep line of fig 1 is directly proportional to this value with the same es but ea is replaced by zero i e dry environment case it yields ep dry note that this latter is true as tws stays constant under a constant qn and unchanging wind conditions monteith 1981 szilagyi 2014 note also that for ep and ep dry the corresponding sensible heat fluxes the horizontal projections of the dotted lines may become negative as the air temperature of the drying environment ta can be larger than the surface temperature tws of the plot sized wet patch and as a consequence the wet patch evaporation rates ep ep dry may be enhanced by this downward heat transport to exceed the evaporation rate of the wet environment i e ep dry ep ew an unchanging wet surface temperature during drying of the environment cannot be assumed for above ground evaporation pans where the pan is also heated through its side by the sun and the colliding warming air szilagyi and jozsa 2008 or for bare soil where the sun and warming air heats the dry surface granules of the soil surrounding the wet pores aminzadeh et al 2016 qualls and crago 2020 argue that from the wet endpoint i e from tws ews of the surface isenthalp the other wet endpoint twb ewb of the air isenthalp cannot be reached in a constant flux layer as the latter requires that the ratio of the two fluxes is constant which takes place along straight dotted lines in the phase diagram of fig 1 the lowest such air temperature can be obtained from the intersection of the line tangent to e tws with a corresponding slope of δ tws and the air isenthalp they also argue that a relatively dry and warm air entraintment at the top of the boundary layer lhomme 1997 with the consequent vertical mixing warms and dries the air above the ground thus depressing the vapor pressure along the air isenthalp to ept q in fig 1 with the corresponding elevated air temperature of tpt q here tpt is the wet environment air temperature while ept the corresponding vapor pressure and the superscript q designates their estimate by qualls and crago 2020 later an alternative estimation of tpt and ept will be introduced qualls and crago 2020 argue that the effect of air entraintment can be accounted for by multiplying the slope δ tws of the line tangent to e tws with a constant c 1 the value of c can be obtained by writing bo as γ cδ tws in the near saturated air layer of a wet environment rearranging it for e qn 1 bo and equaling it to the wet environment evaporation rate priestley and taylor 1972 of 11 e w α δ t ws q n δ t ws γ where α 1 is the dimensionless priestley taylor coefficient also accounting for the boundary layer air entraintment the result becomes qualls and crago 2020 12 c α γ δ t ws 1 α γ the wet environment evaporation rate of eq 11 then can also be expressed by eq 10 with the help of ews and ept q fig 1 the latter as the intersection of the air isenthalp with the cδ tws line see later 2 3 estimation of actual evaporation rates for the actual evaporation rate e the point ts es on the surface isenthalp that links with ta ea on the air isenthalp must be located this can be achieved from the observation that during a complete drying out of the environment from fully wet conditions the ts es and the corresponding ta ea states points travel down the whole length of the respective isenthalps reachable in a constant flux layer with entraintment i e from tws ews down to ts dry 0 on the surface isenthalp and from ept q tpt q to ta dry 0 on the air isenthalp fig 1 since later on an alternative definition of tpt and ept is given and what follows is equally true for those alternative estimates reference to the type of tpt and ept estimate is dropped from here on except when it becomes important which estimate is considered as the two isenthalp sections have different lengths the average speed they are fully travelled down at are different but their ratio is constant 1 since the saturation vapor pressure curve is a monotonically increasing function with temperature and the same constant under unchanging qn and wind conditions by assuming as a first approximation that this constant ratio of the average velocities holds true any time during a dry out then the same applies to the distances travelled note it does not mean that drying out of the environment would happen at a constant speed along the isenthalps it only means that the distance the phase diagram coordinate point on the surface isenthalp reaches by any time from its wet starting point is larger than the one on the air isenthalp by the same constant percentage as the slopes of the two isenthalps are identical forming similar right angled triangles the two ratios of ea ept and es ews must also be equal similar expressions can be written for the corresponding temperatures additionally involving ta dry and ts dry the 13 e a e pt e s e ws relationship can equally be written as 14 e a e pt e ws e ws e a e ws e ws e pt e s e ws from eq 13 the right hand side of eq 14 can also be written as 15 e s e ws e s 1 e a e s e ws 1 e a e s e s 1 e pt e ws e ws 1 e pt e ws e s e s e ws e pt e ws e pt e s e a e ws e pt by combining eqs 14 and 15 one obtains 16 e s e a e ws e pt e ws e ws e a e ws e ws e pt which with the help of eq 10 and fig 1 yields a linear non dimensional equation crago and qualls 2018 17 e e w e p dry e p e p dry e w which upon rearrangement and division by ep transforms into 18 e e p e p dry e p e p dry e w e w e p ep dry can be calculated from eq 9 with the ea 0 and ta ta dry substitutions plus δ evaluated at ta dry the right hand side of eq 17 can be considered as an instantaneous wetness index w with values between zero under extremely dry conditions and unity in a wet environment eq 18 can be written in a more succinct non dimensional form as 19 y x w i t h y e e p x e p dry e p e p dry e w e w e p from eq 16 and fig 1 y and x can be equally expressed with only the vapor pressure terms as 20 y e s e a e ws e a a n d x e a e pt e ws e pt e ws e a note that w ea ept now actual evaporation rates then can be estimated in several ways the first such approach is when one employs only the vapor pressure terms or equally temperature ones but this latter approach would also require the ta dry and ts dry values without explicit reliance on eq 9 or eq 11 from the definition of bo one can write e qn 1 bo i e 21 e q n 1 γ t s t a e s e a in which es from eq 13 becomes 22 e s e ws e a e pt where ept can be obtained from elementary coordinate geometry of finding the intersection of the air isenthalp e γ ta t ea and the cδ tws tangent line e cδ tws t tws ews yielding 23 t pt c δ t ws t ws γ t a e a e ws c δ t ws γ and thus 24 e pt γ t a t pt e a the unknown ts in eq 21 drops out from the surface isenthalp equation as 25 t s t ws e ws e s γ note that eq 21 does not contain any explicit wind reference but implicitly it is present in the estimation of tws via eqs 8 and 9 crago and qualls 2018 found that eq 19 worked well for diverse grass wetland bush savanna forest eddy covariance measurement locations in australia the present vapor pressure based approach of eq 21 eliminates any potential uncertainties associated with the estimation of ep dry szilagyi et al 2017 szilagyi 2018 ma and szilagyi 2019 and ma et al 2019 2020 found a nonlinear formulation of eq 19 very effective with continental scale gridded input data of monthly ta td qn and u10 values the nonlinear version follows from considerations about the relative changes dy and dx in y and x of eqs 19 and 20 at w 0 writing dy de dep des dea dep and dx dea ept ew dep one obtains dy dx des dea dea ept ew where ept and ew are constant during isenthalpic processes thus dy dx vanishes provided the terms in the bracket do the same requiring des dea es w 0 es w 0 ea w 0 ea w 0 1 considering that at w 0 both es and ea are zero theoretically this is equivalent to the condition of es ea following wetting the dry surface for an infinitesimally short period of time but this can exactly be expected as a small quantity of moisture introduced onto the dry surface will require only a negligible vertical gradient in atmospheric humidity to diffuse practically evenly within the turbulent boundary layer resulting in a quasi constant vertical humidity profile for a practical illustration of this taking place see the average vertical profile of the specific humidity in fig 5a in mamtimin et al 2020 obtained at 4p m each day in the winter of 2017 over a desert area in china in the winter the desert is covered in a thin layer of snow partly the result of dry deposition during the extreme cold winter nights but a small quantity of meltwater may occur for a short period of time even in subzero temperatures due to strong daytime irradiation creating brief wet pulses in the afternoons of sunny days mimicking the wetting requirement described above with the obvious difference that evaporation is limited not by the lack of moisture at the surface but instead by subzero temperatures during most of the day and resulting in a practically constant afternoon vertical moisture profile the ensuing nonlinear form of eq 19 can thus be written as 26 y 2 x x 2 see ma and szilagyi 2019 for more details about the nonlinear approach this nonlinear approach of eq 26 can now be applied where x and y are defined by eq 20 and the resulting es inserted into eq 21 the bowen ratio term of eq 21 may cause problems with inaccurate measurements especially when es is close to ea therefore for practical applications it may be better to employ a hybrid approach that would contain both flux and vapor pressure terms by keeping the vapor pressure formulation of the wetness index w ea ept in eq 20 and inserting it into x of eq 19 or eq 26 with y e ep a linear 27 e e p e a e pt e w e p or nonlinear 28 e e p 2 e a e pt e w e p e a e pt e w e p 2 hybrid approach is defined where eq 21 is no longer needed the nonlinear approach relaxes the constant relative mean speed assumption of eq 13 and lets the ts es state point of the surface isenthalp run progressively ahead of the corresponding ta ea state on the air isenthalp so that the ratio of distances travelled changes in time as a consequence the nonlinear approach always yields smaller evaporation rates than the linear one with the same α value fig 2 the reason of accounting for possible changes in the relative mean speed of the isenthalp coordinates by eq 26 rather than taking a nonlinear function of w itself in eq 17 is that eq 26 does not introduce any additional parameter to calibrate while taking any nonlinear function of w in eq 17 would as the relative changes of e ew and w at the wet and dry end points of the isenthalps are unknown yet contrary to the better researched case of y and x in eq 26 note that the hybrid approaches eqs 27 and 28 still contain only one parameter to calibrate the priestley taylor coefficient α finally it is also worthwhile to test the cr in a full flux mode eqs 19 and 26 where all evaporation terms are explicitly given ep by eq 9 ew by eq 11 ep dry by eq 9 again with ea dry 0 and ta dry estimated with the help of eq 7 szilagyi et al 2017 szilagyi 2018 2 4 an alternative derivation of the wet environment air and surface temperature the wet environment air temperature tpt can be obtained by equating the evaporation rate of the penman equation eq 9 with that of the priestley taylor equation eq 11 if in either equation the yet unknown tpt is employed which thus yields an implicit equation for tpt provided a value for α is set i e 29 α δ t pt δ t pt γ q n δ t pt δ t pt γ q n γ δ t pt γ f u e t pt e pt where the estimate of ept i e ept s to differentiate it from a similar estimate of qualls and crago 2020 comes from eq 24 with the tpt solution of eq 29 note that the estimate of tpt i e tpt s in eq 29 is strictly tied to the value of the typically unknown priestley taylor α the also unknown vapor pressure value at the surface ews as an alternative to e tws sj of eq 8 then can be obtained by equating the priestley taylor equation with eq 21 both employing tpt s such as 30 α δ t pt s δ t pt s γ q n q n 1 γ t ws t pt s e ws e pt s which is again implicit for ews e tws and can be solved by iterations the resulting estimates of tws and ews i e

flux of the cr were tested with eddy covariance data of seven australian fluxnet sites http fluxnet fluxdata org sites site list and pages these sites include land covers of grass permanent wetland open shrubland woody savanna and evergreen broadleaf forests for more information on the data stations and their locations see crago and qualls 2018 measurement heights for u2 and θ were reduced by the average height of the vegetation all three cr versions were tested by the wet environment air temperature tpt q of qualls and crago 2020 and also by tpt s similarly the two wet surface estimates tws sj and tws s were also tested through systematic trial and error optimization a pt α value was calibrated by minimizing the root mean squares error rmse between model estimates and ec measurements no correction of any sort was applied for the ec values model performance was gauged by simultaneous assessment of the i rmse value ii place the calibrated pt α value occupies within the widely accepted range of 1 1 32 iii slope of the sum of squares fitted line and iv shape of the data cloud around the best fit line the linear correlation coefficient value r was found a weak indicator for additional model performance assessment because it varies little between the model versions table 2 summarizes model performances as seen in table 2 the rmse value improves from 20 17 to 19 18 mm mo 1 in the linear cr version by a switch from tpt q to tpt s values the improvement is not sensitive to whether the original ews sj or the newly derived ews s estimates fig 4 are employed as model performance practically stays the same with the tpt s values the optimized value of α increases from its physically meaningful lower boundary of unity to 1 06 with the tpt q to tpt s switch because the latter values are generally closer to twb the unity pt α value in the first case suggests that the linear cr overestimates the evaporation rates by overestimating es this is possible only if the surface isenthalp point cannot satisfactorily run ahead of the air isenthalp point due to the employed constant relative speed assumption therefore calibration will lower the value of α in eq 12 thus pushing the cδ tws line to the left in fig 1 and as a consequence raising the value of ept q which in turn lowers the value of es in eq 22 which physically means the es ts point is pushed further down the surface isenthalp the lowered α 1 value will result in a relatively good performance of the linear cr model the nonlinear model version employing tpt q can improve upon only in the slope 0 97 vs 0 79 of the best fit line fig 5 and in better predicting low values the tpt q to tpt s switch also improves the estimation in the nonlinear model evidenced in table 2 and fig 5 note that the nonlinear model does not need such low α values as the corresponding linear one since it is able to let the surface isenthalp point run ahead more freely demonstrated by the lower curve and thus reduced evaporation rate as a result of a more advanced es value down the surface isenthalp in fig 2 with the nonlinear cr version employing ews s and tpt s the rmse value becomes the smallest so far the small measured ec values at the bottom of the data cloud in fig 5 are also captured much better with either tpt value than in the linear model when switching to the hybrid model formulation of eqs 27 and 28 the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve δ in ew of eq 11 may be evaluated at different temperatures eq 11 defines the slope at the wet surface temperature tws but originally it was defined at the wet environment air temperature tpt by priestley and taylor 1972 due to the typical availability of tpt when the measurements are actually carried out under fully wet environmental conditions since both the wet surface and the wet environment air temperature tpt estimates are available now it is worth evaluating eq 11 at either wet surface and wet environment air temperature model performance was found to improve when the tws values ew is evaluated at are capped by the actual dry environment air temperature ta normally the wet surface temperature is below the drying environment air temperature except when the environment is close to its fully wet state to be consistent with the penman equation eq 11 must also be evaluated at the wet environment air as was done by priestley and taylor 1972 and not the surface temperature the wet surface temperature serves only as a proxy of the typically unknown i e when measurements are coming from a drying environment wet environment air temperature and since this latter is always smaller than the drying environment air temperature due to the energy requirement of evaporation the tws values must be capped by ta note that the tpt values are tied to the pt α values via eqs 12 and 23 for tpt q and via eq 29 for tpt s therefore the latter cannot be calibrated independent of tpt as it can be done when eq 11 is evaluated at tws instead of tpt as seen in table 2 the linear hybrid model generally performs the same way as before with typically low calibrated α values a real improvement takes place rmse 17 54 mm mo 1 best fit slope of 0 96 in the nonlinear model fig 6 when eq 11 is evaluated at the wet surface temperature tws s and the wetness index w ea ept is expressed with tpt s a similar performance is seen rmse 17 48 mm mo 1 best fit slope of 0 94 when the wet environment air temperature tpt is replaced by the wet bulb temperature in the wetness index i e w ea ewb this again indicates that the tpt s values are generally closer to the wet bulb temperatures than the tpt q estimates note that in all cases so far cases a vs c d vs f g vs h m vs n in table 2 the tpt s estimates produced better performance than the tpt q ones when the cr is applied in its full flux mode the best model performance rmse 17 18 mm mo 1 is provided by the linear model version table 2 and fig 7 however the best fit line s slope still remains relatively low 0 83 and the smallest values are greatly overestimated the best nonlinear full flux cr model versions rmse 18 17 mm mo 1 and rmse 18 54 mm mo 1 improve model sensitivity fig 7 yielding an almost perfect best fit line slope of unity with ew evaluated at tws s or at tws sj respectively table 2 on average tws s is smaller than tws sj but the difference is only 0 1 c the calibrated pt α 1 14 value in either model versions is almost identical to what was reported α 1 15 by szilagyi et al 2017 using the same monthly full flux model with gridded data over the coterminous united states model estimates are about 4 mm mo 1 i e 5 below the ec measurements on average by these best performing nonlinear full flux model versions the results considered so far employed a measurement height that was reduced by the average height of the vegetation something that is not routinely known for natural land covers to see how the lack of this information affects modeling results all calculations were repeated using the original measurement height values table 3 lists the so derived performance statistics the differences are generally small because for forests where the measurement height differences are the largest the empirical wind function in the penman equation is only mildly sensitive to wind speed differences as wind speed itself changes little vertically at those heights in other sites where the vertical wind profile closer to the surface changes more rapidly the vegetation height itself is small as seen all of the general conclusions drawn thus far still remain valid as the numerical values change only slightly with a few exceptions only this is in support of a routine application of the cr with gridded basic meteorological data where typically land cover information is missing 4 summary with the help of the water phase diagram under isenthalpic i e isobaric and adiabatic drying wetting cycles of the environment and also assuming unchanging wind conditions states i e successive e t points along the surface isenthalp were linked to similar states along the air isenthalp the latter representing the measurement height the linkage was based on the constant relative speed assumption which surmises that the states evolve along the respective isenthalps during drying wetting cycles so that the scaled distances i e distance travelled from an endpoint of the isenthalp divided by the total length of the isenthalp are equal between the isenthalps the isenthalps were represented by straight lines of slope γ on the phase diagram which is an acceptable approximation under naturally occurring environmental conditions the linked vapor pressure terms thus define different evaporation rates up to a near constant multiplier of a general wind function eq 10 the latter incorporating the turbulent diffusivity and the measurement height the placing i e horizontal or vertical distance of the two isenthalps depends only on the i available energy at the surface ii wind function and iii measurement height and it can be located with the help of the priestley taylor and penman equations as was demonstrated above actual evaporation rates were first estimated by only the measured air temperature and vapor pressure together with the estimated surface temperature and vapor pressure values via eq 21 the latter requires the maximum value the vapor pressure may assume ept at the measurement height and it was estimated by eqs 23 and 24 recommended by qualls and crago 2020 and by a different approach described above i e with the help of eqs 29 and 24 by assigning evaporation rates e ep ep dry ew to the different air and surface vapor pressure combinations an existing linear cr model i e that of crago and qualls 2018 emerges naturally from the constant relative speed assumption the constant relative speed assumption then was relaxed with the help of a nonlinear relationship szilagyi et al 2017 among two scaled nondimensional evaporation terms y e ep and x w ew ep where w is a wetness index to yield a nonlinear cr both the linear i e y x and nonlinear i e y 2 x x 2 cr models first containing only vapor pressure and temperature terms were tested by monthly aggregated ec measurements of seven australian fluxnet sites the nonlinear model gave better evaporation estimates in terms of the rmse value and model sensitivity expressed in best fit line slopes close to unity table 2 in comparison with the linear model the latter ending up overestimating the small values and underestimating the large ones fig 4 the wet environment air temperature estimation of eq 29 tpt s helped with improving the rmse value and model sensitivity table 2 next in the hybrid approach ep and ew were expressed by the corresponding flux equations eqs 9 and 11 while the wetness index was kept in its vapor pressure formulation of w ea ept ew then was evaluated with two alternative wet surface capped by ta and also with two wet environment air temperature estimates the linear model gave similar evaporation estimates with typical low model sensitivity expressed in low values of the best fit line the nonlinear model improved model performance except with tpt q in ew leading to significantly better overall sensitivity reaching a best fit slope of 0 96 in the next step the wet surface temperatures were kept for evaluating ew and it was tested if replacing tpt by the wet bulb temperature twb in the wetness index as the lowest achievable air temperature by evaporating water into the air typically provided by psychrometers or estimated by eq 6 would result in better predictions neither the linear nor the nonlinear model responded much which suggests that the hybrid model is more sensitive to whether the model is linear or not than to which tpt estimate the wetness index contains once ew is evaluated at tws in the final step of cr theory demonstration the wetness index was also expressed by explicit flux terms leading to the best overall rmse value of 17 2 mm mo 1 in the linear model but still accompanied by low model sensitivity note that the tpt values now are present only optionally in place of tws in the ew term the full flux model formulation lead to a somewhat larger rmse value in the nonlinear approach but yielded practically perfect best fit line slope of unity with ew evaluated at the alternative wet surface temperatures the full flux model only slightly worsened when tws was replaced by tpt s for the ew evaluation but deteriorated significantly especially in the nonlinear case with tpt q reinforcing that the tpt s estimates are physically more realistic than the tpt estimates of qualls and crago 2020 the flux formulation of the wetness index seems to be more sensitive to changes in environmental aridity than the vapor pressure one this may be the reason for an improved cr model response in the rmse and best fit slope values for the linear version and in the latter only for the nonlinear one this improved sensitivity may occur because the penman equation contains the vapor pressure deficit which is highly responsive to changes in air temperature as a response to surface wetness due to the steep slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve especially at higher temperatures even though the rmse indicator did not improve for the nonlinear model the best fit slope did so yielding an almost perfect value of unity similar observations about the two versions of the wetness index vapor pressure or flux have already been made by szilagyi et al 2017 with continental scale gridded data as seen the cr model is not sensitive to the location of the surface isenthalp compare table 2 and 3 therefore canopy height of the vegetation is not required to be known which is a great advantage in large scale model applications employing gridded data neither is the cr model sensitive to the type of wet surface temperature estimate tws sj vs tws s which is again advantageous as this way the priestley taylor α can be estimated calibration free and separately of the cr application as was demonstrated by szilagyi et al 2017 and szilagyi 2018 for the conterminous united states and by ma et al 2019 for china also the demonstrated best sensitivity of the full flux model further justifies its previous very effective continental scale applications most recently by szilagyi et al 2020 in cases where aridity is changing on a wide scale 5 conclusions all in all this study revealed a physical foundation for the complementary relationship of evaporation with the help of defining the thermodynamic pathways the air at the vegetated surface and at the measurement height may follow under simplified atmospheric isobaric and adiabatic conditions certainly such conditions may be violated in the real atmosphere but typically not to such a degree that would invalidate the cr theory as a whole as it is proven by its practical success outperforming or matching existing often complex and data intensive large scale evaporation estimation methods szilagyi 2018 ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019 2020 as about the linearity vs nonlinearity dilemma of the cr the present study confirmed earlier findings by han et al 2012 and szilagyi 2018 that a nonlinear formulation can be expected to result in more realistic evaporation estimates expressed in best fit line slope values close to unity hopefully the detailed physical approach on the foundation of the cr discussed in this study will lead to wider application of the method for estimating land evaporation rates on a weekly monthly annual bases this is expected to happen as the method can be made calibration free i e full flux version with ew evaluated at tws sj at large spatial scales where the value of its sole temporarily and spatially constant parameter the priestley taylor α can be set by the method of szilagyi et al 2017 requiring no ground truth measurements of evaporation or application of water balances due to its minimal data requirement air temperature and humidity horizontal wind speed and net surface radiation an estimate for the latter also obtainable from sunshine duration data it can provide land evaporation estimates over longer historical periods than probably any other existing physically based method notice that it requires no precipitation information at all the cr is not recommended to be routinely applied at a daily scale and near sudden jumps of wetness conditions e g near sea shores where the moisture of the air may not be representative of the underlying land surface either temporarily due to a passing weather front or permanently due to existing diurnal land sea breezes declaration of competing interest the

viz tkp2020 appendix i qualls and crago 2020 argue that the tws value obtainable from eq 8 is incorrect as the δ term in eq 9 is evaluated at the known ta and not at the typically unknown ts as it ought to be they overlook the possibility that the ts to ta switch could be corrected at least to some degree by a properly chosen wind function in eq 9 they argue that the correct surface isenthalp must go through the intersection of the ep line i e the solid line between ta ea and tws sj ews sj in fig a1 and the line tangent δ ta resulting in the sample ts δ es δ point of fig a1 the

process employed in eq 6 but with ts δ es δ this intersection point however progressively climbs upward on the phase diagram fig a2 before ta reaches tws sj from its starting value of tpt q during adiabatic drying out of the environment from a fully wet condition at ta tws sj the intersection point is on the saturation vapor pressure curve yielding tws sj with additional drying of the environment the intersection point starts to fall fig a2 as the ta ea point slides further down the air isenthalp and simultaneously ta e ta climbs higher on the saturation vapor pressure curve the corresponding surface isenthalps that should go through these temporally changing intersection points parallel with the unchanging one going through tws sj ews sj would also yield temporally changing wet surface temperatures i e tws q in fig a1 which is a physical contradiction as the value of tws is strictly tied to that of twb by a constant qn and wind speed as was pointed out by monteith 1981 and experimentally proven by szilagyi 2014 see appendix ii for the latter as seen the tws correction of qualls and crago 2020 pushes the surface isenthalp closer to the air one thus depressing the es

4974,the simultaneous thermodynamic pathways i e isenthalps of the air at the measurement height and at the vegetated land surface under isobaric and adiabatic wetting drying cycles of the environment make it possible to define the actual evaporation rate with the help of three one measured and two derived vapor pressure and corresponding temperature terms from the first order approximation about the constancy of the relative average speed which the two isenthalps are travelled at during drying out of the environment a non dimensional linear form of the complementary relationship cr of evaporation naturally emerges but now expressed by vapor pressures and temperatures respectively without an artificially low priestley taylor parameter value this linear cr would overestimate the evaporation rates because the surface warms faster than the constant relative speed assumption permits with the appropriate estimation of the wet surface temperature and employment of realistic boundary conditions the latter leading to a nonlinear cr land evaporation rates can be estimated fairly accurately with minimal input variables air temperature humidity wind speed and net surface radiation and without any information of land surface properties not only actual but three potential evaporation rates can also be defined by linking the temperature vapor pressure coordinates of the air and the surface isenthalps thus reproducing certain existing formulations of the cr as well as re creating an existing hybrid containing both non dimensional vapor pressure and evaporation terms version of it keywords complementary relationship land evaporation water phase diagram isenthalps 1 introduction the complementary relationship cr of evaporation first proposed by bouchet 1963 is one of the few tools available to hydrologists civil biological environmental engineers hydro meteorologists and climate modelers to estimate actual land evaporation rates with minimal atmospheric and radiation input data requirements and without detailed knowledge of the land surface properties while the cr is widely accepted to build on the intricate feedback mechanism present in the land atmosphere interface brutsaert 1982 morton 1983 its critiques see it as merely an heuristic approach without much concrete physical basis mcnaughton and spriggs 1989 or valid only under certain environmental conditions shuttleworth et al 2009 potentially contributing to its largely underemployed and overlooked status in the hydrological hydro meteorological and climate modeling community despite numerous highly successful efforts to prove the predictive power of its recently developed non dimensional versions brutsaert 2015 crago et al 2016 brutsaert et al 2017 2020 han and tian 2018 a calibration free non dimensional and nonlinear version of the cr szilagyi et al 2017 has also been systematically compared to other more data intensive and complex remote sensing reanalysis land surface model and machine learning based methods on a continental scale for further demonstration of its capabilities szilagyi 2018 ma et al 2019 ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2020 szilagyi et al 2020 despite of its remarkable performance the cr still needs a long overdue clear physically based derivation for an anticipated better acceptance and wider recognition by the geophysical community in large the cr has classically been based on the realization that the actual unknown land evaporation rate e m s 1 can be inferred from evaporation rates of two wet land surfaces different only in spatial extent one is plot sized with corresponding evaporation rate of ep the other regionally significant with evaporation rate of ew the difference in the two wet surface evaporation rates ep ew e is caused by horizontal energy advection called oasis effect which becomes stronger with the drying of the environment in the form of hotter and drier air blown over the plot sized wet surface thus increasing its evaporation rate the same effect is negligible on a wet land of regional extent as the originally hot and dry air becomes ever cooler and wetter along its trajectory over the expansive wet surface until it blends completely into the already cool and moist air of the expansive wet land while the plot sized wet surface can hardly influence the physical properties of the air blown over it the regionally expansive wet land can fully influence and transform it bringing it into equilibrium with its net energy and surface properties it follows that in the so called wet environment of the regionally expansive wet land surface the three evaporation rates potential ep wet environment ew and actual e become equal it also follows then that the actual land evaporation rate can be derived from differences in the ep and ew terms i e it is expected that the larger this difference the stronger the oasis effect therefore the more arid the environment has become which means a proportionally reduced wet environment evaporation rate as actual evaporation different authors came up with different mostly heuristic answers to how this rate of reduction should be formulated see han and tian 2020 for a brief review on the history of the cr theory the heuristic formulation of the cr however can be augmented or completely replaced by a physically based one when taking into consideration that the moisture content of the air during wetting and drying cycles of the environment is explicitly related to its temperature under a constant in a daily or longer averaging sense wind and energy qn rn g where rn w m 2 is the net surface radiation and g w m 2 soil heat flux into the ground available at the surface for latent i e evaporation and sensible heat h fluxes for possible objections that these two requirements i e temporally constant qn and horizontal wind speed are right away untenable as both wind and surface available energy are affected by drying wetting of the environment it is worth to mention that the only measurements employed in the cr in general come from just one type of actual typically drying conditions no simultaneous wet and drying environment measurements of any kind are ever employed so that the wet or drying environment data could come from disturbed environmental conditions meaning wind and qn different from those observed in the actual drying wet environment thus not being representative of the actually observed conditions in other words the physical reasoning in what follows employs a hypothetical as long as drying conditions prevail otherwise the hypothetical becomes what is being measured wet environment evaporation term valid strictly under the measured typically drying environment qn and wind conditions as base of reference therefore the question whether wetting drying cycle constancy of the qn and wind terms actually holds true or not in nature is irrelevant below a derivation giving rise to a physical foundation of the cr is given the water phase diagrams build upon the work of monteith 1981 szilagyi and jozsa 2008 szilagyi 2014 and qualls and crago 2020 corresponding states i e points given by temperature and vapor pressure coordinates along the resulting adiabatic lines i e isenthalps are related to different evaporation terms the cr emerges by considerations about the mean speed the corresponding isenthalps are traveled at during a complete dry out of the environment from a fully wet starting condition the resulting equation then is written in different forms by employing various wet surface evaporation rates realistic boundary conditions are also introduced to account for possible changes in the mean speed the isenthalps are traveled at during a dry out finally the different versions of the cr equations are tested with eddy covariance measurements 2 theory thermodynamic pathways of an air layer in contact with the evaporating surface 2 1 derivation of the isenthalps let us consider the air layer that extends from the vegetated i e canopy surface to the height of measurements zm which can be a few meters to possibly up to several tens of meters above the surface let the surface receive a temporally constant energy qn w m 2 available for sensible h w m 2 and latent heat le w m 2 fluxes under a steady wind profile the latent heat flux can be expressed as le lvρwe where lv j kg 1 is the latent heat of vaporization ρw kg m 3 the density of water and e m s 1 is the evaporation rate let us assume that the latent and sensible heat fluxes stay constant along any vertical the sum of them equaling the constant qn which approximately holds true in the lowest part of the neutral atmospheric surface layer brutsaert 1982 leading to adiabatic conditions then the temporal rate of change t in h defined as 1 h c p ρ k z z θ t z and le as 2 le l v ρ k z z q t z is equal but opposite in sign at any level above the vegetated surface i e 3 t h t l e 0 here cp j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat of air at constant pressure p hpa ρ kg m 3 air density k m2 s 1 the turbulent diffusivity assumed to be the same for water vapor and heat exchange z denotes differentiation with respect to height above the surface q the specific humidity of the air approximately equal to 0 622 e p where e hpa is the vapor pressure finally θ k is the potential temperature obtainable as ta gzm cp e g stull 2000 where ta k is the air temperature measured at zm and g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration note that q and θ also e and t are temporal averages of a suitably chosen relatively short time period e g 20 min and depend on both time t and height z above the surface while k is only a function of height by inserting the flux expressions eqs 1 and 2 into eq 3 changing the order of differentiations and integrating with respect to elevation one obtains 4 0 622 t e z p c p t t z l v f t which holds true at any height in any time f t is an unknown function including being a constant that may depend only on time for a physically meaningful solution f t must be a constant the constant must be equal to zero then otherwise the sum of the t and e values at any height would be a linear function of time and thus boundless which violates the constant qn assumption at the surface under which the attainable maximum surface temperature is limited thus eq 4 transforms into 5 de d t γ yielding quasi straight lines i e adiabats which are also called isenthalps under isobaric conditions of slope γ hpa k 1 in the e versus t phase diagram fig 1 here γ cpp 0 622lv is the so called psychrometric constant its minor temperature dependence due to the lv term is neglected in this study eq 5 says that changes in vapor pressure as a result of changing evaporation rates at the land surface are strictly tied to changes in air temperature under adiabatic and isobaric conditions fig 1 depicts the two isenthalps in the water phase diagram the lower one from here on referenced as air isenthalp after qualls and crago 2020 at the measurement height zm the other at the surface upper one note that for larger measurement heights all measured temperature values are ought to be converted to potential temperatures and all ensuing calculations performed with those converted values this way fig 1 is strictly valid for measurements at a few meters above the surface 2 2 important points of the isenthalps at the air isenthalp the minimum temperature achievable by evaporating water into the air is given by the wet bulb temperature twb obtainable from monteith 1981

on the other extreme the highest temperature ta dry under a constant qn is obtained when the air becomes devoid of moisture yielding szilagyi et al 2017 szilagyi 2018 7 t a dry t wb e wb γ t a e a γ for placement of the surface isenthalp the wet surface temperature tws can be used szilagyi and schepers 2014 demonstrated that the wet surface temperature is independent of the areal extent of the wet surface thus it can be estimated for a plot sized wet patch that can only slightly influence the temperature and humidity of the overpassing air by assuming also that qn of the drying land is approximately valid for the wet patch one can write out the bowen ratio bo h le as follows szilagyi and jozsa 2008 8 h le q n e p e p γ t ws t a e t ws e a where qn now is expressed in water equivalents of mm d 1 and the above estimate of tws is denoted by tws sj from here on when tws is discussed below in general then the superscript is omitted eq 8 is another implicit equation for tws similar to eq 6 the evaporation rate of the wet patch can be obtained by the penman equation 1948 as 9 e p δ q n δ γ γ f u e t a e a δ γ where the empirical wind function fu mm d 1 hpa 1 is

the surface as u2 uh 2 h 1 7 δ denotes the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at the measured temperature ta a possible correction to the tws sj value as was recently suggested by qualls and crago 2020 is discussed in appendix i the maximum achievable surface temperature ts dry can be obtained from eq 7 by replacing twb with tws sj in fig 1 different evaporation rates can be defined qualls and crago 2020 if eq 2 is divided by lvρw and finite differences are employed i e 10 e 0 622 ρ p ρ w k z z e 0 622 k z m r d t ρ w z m e a e s f w e s e a where rd is the gas constant of dry air 287 j kg 1 k 1 and fw m s 1 pa 1 is a general wind function when es i e the vapor pressure at the surface is ews e tws then eq 10 yields ep and the vertical projection of the corresponding dotted ep line of fig 1 is directly proportional to this value with the same es but ea is replaced by zero i e dry environment case it yields ep dry note that this latter is true as tws stays constant under a constant qn and unchanging wind conditions monteith 1981 szilagyi 2014 note also that for ep and ep dry the corresponding sensible heat fluxes the horizontal projections of the dotted lines may become negative as the air temperature of the drying environment ta can be larger than the surface temperature tws of the plot sized wet patch and as a consequence the wet patch evaporation rates ep ep dry may be enhanced by this downward heat transport to exceed the evaporation rate of the wet environment i e ep dry ep ew an unchanging wet surface temperature during drying of the environment cannot be assumed for above ground evaporation pans where the pan is also heated through its side by the sun and the colliding warming air szilagyi and jozsa 2008 or for bare soil where the sun and warming air heats the dry surface granules of the soil surrounding the wet pores aminzadeh et al 2016 qualls and crago 2020 argue that from the wet endpoint i e from tws ews of the surface isenthalp the other wet endpoint twb ewb of the air isenthalp cannot be reached in a constant flux layer as the latter requires that the ratio of the two fluxes is constant which takes place along straight dotted lines in the phase diagram of fig 1 the lowest such air temperature can be obtained from the intersection of the line tangent to e tws with a corresponding slope of δ tws and the air isenthalp they also argue that a relatively dry and warm air entraintment at the top of the boundary layer lhomme 1997 with the consequent vertical mixing warms and dries the air above the ground thus depressing the vapor pressure along the air isenthalp to ept q in fig 1 with the corresponding elevated air temperature of tpt q here tpt is the wet environment air temperature while ept the corresponding vapor pressure and the superscript q designates their estimate by qualls and crago 2020 later an alternative estimation of tpt and ept will be introduced qualls and crago 2020 argue that the effect of air entraintment can be accounted for by multiplying the slope δ tws of the line tangent to e tws with a constant c 1 the value of c can be obtained by writing bo as γ cδ tws in the near

of eq 11 then can also be expressed by eq 10 with the help of ews and ept q fig 1 the latter as the intersection of the air isenthalp with the cδ tws line see later 2 3 estimation of actual evaporation rates for the actual evaporation rate e the point ts es on the surface isenthalp that links with ta ea on the air isenthalp must be located this can be achieved from the observation that during a complete drying out of the environment from fully wet conditions the ts es and the corresponding ta ea states points travel down the whole length of the respective isenthalps reachable in a constant flux layer with entraintment i e from tws ews down to ts dry 0 on the surface isenthalp and from ept q tpt q to ta dry 0 on the air isenthalp fig 1 since later on an alternative definition of tpt and ept is given and what follows is equally true for those alternative estimates reference to the type of tpt and ept estimate is dropped from here on except when it becomes important which estimate is considered as the two isenthalp sections have different lengths the average speed they are fully travelled down at are different but their ratio is constant 1 since the saturation vapor pressure curve is a monotonically increasing function with temperature and the same constant under unchanging qn and wind conditions by assuming as a first approximation that this constant ratio of the average velocities holds true any time during a dry out then the same applies to the distances travelled note it does not mean that drying out of the environment would happen at a constant speed along the isenthalps it only means that the distance the phase diagram coordinate point on the surface isenthalp reaches by any time from its wet starting point is larger than the one on the air isenthalp by the same constant percentage as the slopes of the two isenthalps are identical forming similar right angled triangles the two ratios of ea ept and es ews must also be equal similar expressions can be written for the corresponding temperatures additionally involving ta dry and ts dry the 13 e a e pt e s e ws relationship can equally be written as 14 e a e pt e ws e ws e a e ws e

by combining eqs 14 and 15 one obtains 16 e s e a e ws e pt e ws e ws e a e ws e ws e pt which with the help of eq 10 and fig 1 yields a linear non dimensional equation crago and qualls 2018 17 e e w

substitutions plus δ evaluated at ta dry the right hand side of eq 17 can be considered as an instantaneous wetness index w with values between zero under extremely dry conditions and unity in a wet

one employs only the vapor pressure terms or equally temperature ones but this latter approach would also require the ta dry and ts dry values without explicit reliance on eq 9 or eq 11 from the definition of bo one can write e qn 1 bo i e 21 e q n 1 γ t s t a e s e a in which es from eq 13 becomes 22 e s e ws e a e pt where ept can be obtained from elementary coordinate geometry of finding

in eq 21 drops out from the surface isenthalp equation as 25 t s t ws e ws e s γ note that eq 21 does not contain any explicit wind reference but implicitly it is present in the estimation of tws via eqs 8 and 9 crago and qualls 2018 found that eq 19 worked well for diverse grass wetland bush savanna forest eddy covariance measurement locations in australia the present vapor pressure based approach of eq 21 eliminates any potential uncertainties associated with the estimation of ep dry szilagyi et al 2017 szilagyi 2018 ma and szilagyi 2019 and ma et al 2019 2020 found a nonlinear formulation of eq 19 very effective with continental scale gridded input data of monthly ta td qn and u10 values the nonlinear version follows from considerations about the relative changes dy and dx in y and x of eqs 19 and 20 at w 0 writing dy de dep des dea dep and dx dea ept ew dep one obtains dy dx des dea dea ept ew where ept and ew are constant during isenthalpic processes thus dy dx vanishes provided the terms in the bracket do the same requiring des dea es w 0 es w 0 ea w 0 ea w 0 1 considering that at w 0 both es and ea are zero theoretically this is equivalent to the condition of es ea following wetting the dry surface for an infinitesimally short period of time but this can exactly be expected as a small quantity of moisture introduced onto the dry surface will require only a negligible vertical gradient in atmospheric humidity to diffuse practically evenly within the turbulent boundary layer resulting in a quasi constant vertical humidity profile for a practical illustration of this taking place see the average vertical profile of the specific humidity in fig 5a in mamtimin et al 2020 obtained at 4p m each day in the winter of 2017 over a desert area in china in the winter the desert is covered in a thin layer of snow partly the result of dry deposition during the extreme cold winter nights but a small quantity of meltwater may occur for a short period of time even in subzero temperatures due to strong daytime irradiation creating brief wet pulses in the afternoons of sunny days mimicking the wetting requirement described above with the obvious difference that evaporation is limited not by the lack of moisture at the surface but instead by subzero temperatures during most of the day and resulting in a practically constant afternoon vertical moisture profile the ensuing nonlinear form of eq 19 can thus be written as 26 y 2 x x 2 see ma and szilagyi 2019 for more details about the nonlinear approach this nonlinear approach of eq 26 can now be applied where x and y are defined by eq 20 and the resulting es inserted into eq 21 the bowen ratio term of eq 21 may cause problems with inaccurate measurements especially when es is close to ea therefore for practical applications it may be better to employ a hybrid approach that would contain both flux and vapor pressure terms by keeping the vapor pressure formulation of the wetness index w ea ept in eq 20 and inserting it into x of eq 19 or eq 26 with y e ep a linear 27 e e p e a e pt e w e p or nonlinear 28 e e p 2 e a e pt e w e p e a e pt e w e p 2 hybrid approach is defined where eq 21 is no longer needed the nonlinear approach relaxes the constant relative mean speed assumption of eq 13 and lets the ts es state point of the surface isenthalp run progressively ahead of the corresponding ta ea state on the air isenthalp so that the ratio of distances travelled changes in time as a consequence the nonlinear approach always yields smaller evaporation rates than the linear one with the same α value fig 2 the reason of accounting for possible changes in the relative mean speed of the isenthalp coordinates by eq 26 rather than taking a nonlinear function of w itself in eq 17 is that eq 26 does not introduce any additional parameter to calibrate while taking any nonlinear function of w in eq 17 would as the relative changes of e ew and w at the wet and dry end points of the isenthalps are unknown yet contrary to the better researched case of y and x in eq 26 note that the hybrid approaches eqs 27 and 28 still contain only one parameter to calibrate the priestley taylor coefficient α finally it is also worthwhile to test the cr in a full flux mode eqs 19 and 26 where all evaporation terms are explicitly given ep by eq 9 ew by eq 11 ep dry by eq 9 again with ea dry 0 and ta dry estimated with the help of eq 7 szilagyi et al 2017 szilagyi 2018 2 4 an alternative derivation of the wet environment air and surface temperature the wet environment air temperature tpt can be obtained by equating the evaporation rate of the penman equation eq 9 with that of the priestley taylor equation eq 11 if in either equation the yet unknown tpt is employed which thus yields an implicit equation for tpt provided a value for α is set i e 29 α δ t pt δ t pt γ q n δ t pt δ t pt γ q n γ δ t pt γ f u e t pt e pt where the estimate of ept i e ept s to differentiate it from a similar estimate of qualls and crago 2020 comes from eq 24 with the tpt solution of eq 29 note that the estimate of tpt i e tpt s in eq 29 is strictly tied to the value of the typically unknown priestley taylor α the also unknown vapor pressure value at the surface ews as an alternative to e tws sj of eq 8 then can be obtained by equating the priestley taylor equation with eq 21 both employing tpt s such as 30 α δ t pt s δ t pt s γ q n q n 1 γ t ws t pt s e ws e pt s which is again implicit for ews e tws and can be solved by iterations the resulting estimates of tws and ews i e tws s ews s define the surface isenthalp fig 3 which is to the left of the original isenthalp going through tws sj e tws sj for the cr theory demonstration below both wet environment air temperature tpt q and tpt s and wet surface temperature estimates tws sj tws s are applied 3 results demonstration of the cr theory with eddy covariance measurements the three versions bowen ratio hybrid and full flux of the cr were tested with eddy covariance data of seven australian fluxnet sites http fluxnet fluxdata org sites site list and pages these sites include land covers of grass permanent wetland open shrubland woody savanna and evergreen broadleaf forests for more information on the data stations and their locations see crago and qualls 2018 measurement heights for u2 and θ were reduced by the average height of the vegetation all three cr versions were tested by the wet environment air temperature tpt q of qualls and crago 2020 and also by tpt s similarly the two wet surface estimates tws sj and tws s were also tested through systematic trial and error optimization a pt α value was calibrated by minimizing the root mean squares error rmse between model estimates and ec measurements no correction of any sort was applied for the ec values model performance was gauged by simultaneous assessment of the i rmse value ii place the calibrated pt α value occupies within the widely accepted range of 1 1 32 iii slope of the sum of squares fitted line and iv shape of the data cloud around the best fit line the linear correlation coefficient value r was found a weak indicator for additional model performance assessment because it varies little between the model versions table 2 summarizes model performances as seen in table 2 the rmse value improves from 20 17 to 19 18 mm mo 1 in the linear cr version by a switch from tpt q to tpt s values the improvement is not sensitive to whether the original ews sj or the newly derived ews s estimates fig 4 are employed as model performance practically stays the same with the tpt s values the optimized value of α increases from its physically meaningful lower boundary of unity to 1 06 with the tpt q to tpt s switch because the latter values are generally closer to twb the unity pt α value in the first case suggests that the linear cr overestimates the evaporation rates by overestimating es this is possible only if the surface isenthalp point cannot satisfactorily run ahead of the air isenthalp point due to the employed constant relative speed assumption therefore calibration will lower the value of α in eq 12 thus pushing the cδ tws line to the left in fig 1 and as a consequence raising the value of ept q which in turn lowers the value of es in eq 22 which physically means the es ts point is pushed further down the surface isenthalp the lowered α 1 value will result in a relatively good performance of the linear cr model the nonlinear model version employing tpt q can improve upon only in the slope 0 97 vs 0 79 of the best fit line fig 5 and in better predicting low values the tpt q to tpt s switch also improves the estimation in the nonlinear model evidenced in table 2 and fig 5 note that the nonlinear model does not need such low α values as the corresponding linear one since it is able to let the surface isenthalp point run ahead more freely demonstrated by the lower curve and thus reduced evaporation rate as a result of a more advanced es value down the surface isenthalp in fig 2 with the nonlinear cr version employing ews s and tpt s the rmse value becomes the smallest so far the small measured ec values at the bottom of the data cloud in fig 5 are also captured much better with either tpt value than in the linear model when switching to the hybrid model formulation of eqs 27 and 28 the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve δ in ew of eq 11 may be evaluated at different temperatures eq 11 defines the slope at the wet surface temperature tws but originally it was defined at the wet environment air temperature tpt by priestley and taylor 1972 due to the typical availability of tpt when the measurements are actually carried out under fully wet environmental conditions since both the wet surface and the wet environment air temperature tpt estimates are available now it is worth evaluating eq 11 at either wet surface and wet environment air temperature model performance was found to improve when the tws values ew is evaluated at are capped by the actual dry environment air temperature ta normally the wet surface temperature is below the drying environment air temperature except when the environment is close to its fully wet state to be consistent with the penman equation eq 11 must also be evaluated at the wet environment air as was done by priestley and taylor 1972 and not the surface temperature the wet surface temperature serves only as a proxy of the typically unknown i e when measurements are coming from a drying environment wet environment air temperature and since this latter is always smaller than the drying environment air temperature due to the energy requirement of evaporation the tws values must be capped by ta note that the tpt values are tied to the pt α values via eqs 12 and 23 for tpt q and via eq 29 for tpt s therefore the latter cannot be calibrated independent of tpt as it can be done when eq 11 is evaluated at tws instead of tpt as seen in table 2 the linear hybrid model generally performs the same way as before with typically low calibrated α values a real improvement takes place rmse 17 54 mm mo 1 best fit slope of 0 96 in the nonlinear model fig 6 when eq 11 is evaluated at the wet surface temperature tws s and the wetness index w ea ept is expressed with tpt s a similar performance is seen rmse 17 48 mm mo 1 best fit slope of 0 94 when the wet environment air temperature tpt is replaced by the wet bulb temperature in the wetness index i e w ea ewb this again indicates that the tpt s values are generally closer to the wet bulb temperatures than the tpt q estimates note that in all cases so far cases a vs c d vs f g vs h m vs n in table 2 the tpt s estimates produced better performance than the tpt q ones when the cr is applied in its full flux mode the best model performance rmse 17 18 mm mo 1 is provided by the linear model version table 2 and fig 7 however the best fit line s slope still remains relatively low 0 83 and the smallest values are greatly overestimated the best nonlinear full flux cr model versions rmse 18 17 mm mo 1 and rmse 18 54 mm mo 1 improve model sensitivity fig 7 yielding an almost perfect best fit line slope of unity with ew evaluated at tws s or at tws sj respectively table 2 on average tws s is smaller than tws sj but the difference is only 0 1 c the calibrated pt α 1 14 value in either model versions is almost identical to what was reported α 1 15 by szilagyi et al 2017 using the same monthly full flux model with gridded data over the coterminous united states model estimates are about 4 mm mo 1 i e 5 below the ec measurements on average by these best performing nonlinear full flux model versions the results considered so far employed a measurement height that was reduced by the average height of the vegetation something that is not routinely known for natural land covers to see how the lack of this information affects modeling results all calculations were repeated using the original measurement height values table 3 lists the so derived performance statistics the differences are generally small because for forests where the measurement height differences are the largest the empirical wind function in the penman equation is only mildly sensitive to wind speed differences as wind speed itself changes little vertically at those heights in other sites where the vertical wind profile closer to the surface changes more rapidly the vegetation height itself is small as seen all of the general conclusions drawn thus far still remain valid as the numerical values change only slightly with a few exceptions only this is in support of a routine application of the cr with gridded basic meteorological data where typically land cover information is missing 4 summary with the help of the water phase diagram under isenthalpic i e isobaric and adiabatic drying wetting cycles of the environment and also assuming unchanging wind conditions states i e successive e t points along the surface isenthalp were linked to similar states along the air isenthalp the latter representing the measurement height the linkage was based on the constant relative speed assumption which surmises that the states evolve along the respective isenthalps during drying wetting cycles so that the scaled distances i e distance travelled from an endpoint of the isenthalp divided by the total length of the isenthalp are equal between the isenthalps the isenthalps were represented by straight lines of slope γ on the phase diagram which is an acceptable approximation under naturally occurring environmental conditions the linked vapor pressure terms thus define different evaporation rates up to a near constant multiplier of a general wind function eq 10 the latter incorporating the turbulent diffusivity and the measurement height the placing i e horizontal or vertical distance of the two isenthalps depends only on the i available energy at the surface ii wind function and iii measurement height and it can be located with the help of the priestley taylor and penman equations as was demonstrated above actual evaporation rates were first estimated by only the measured air temperature and vapor pressure together with the estimated surface temperature and vapor pressure values via eq 21 the latter requires the maximum value the vapor pressure may assume ept at the measurement height and it was estimated by eqs 23 and 24 recommended by qualls and crago 2020 and by a different approach described above i e with the help of eqs 29 and 24 by assigning evaporation rates e ep ep dry ew to the different air and surface vapor pressure combinations an existing linear cr model i e that of crago and qualls 2018 emerges naturally from the constant relative speed assumption the constant relative speed assumption then was relaxed with the help of a nonlinear relationship szilagyi et al 2017 among two scaled nondimensional evaporation terms y e ep and x w ew ep where w is a wetness index to yield a nonlinear cr both the linear i e y x and nonlinear i e y 2 x x 2 cr models first containing only vapor pressure and temperature terms were tested by monthly aggregated ec measurements of seven australian fluxnet sites the nonlinear model gave better evaporation estimates in terms of the rmse value and model sensitivity expressed in best fit line slopes close to unity table 2 in comparison with the linear model the latter ending up overestimating the small values and underestimating the large ones fig 4 the wet environment air temperature estimation of eq 29 tpt s helped with improving the rmse value and model sensitivity table 2 next in the hybrid approach ep and ew were expressed by the corresponding flux equations eqs 9 and 11 while the wetness index was kept in its vapor pressure formulation of w ea ept ew then was evaluated with two alternative wet surface capped by ta and also with two wet environment air temperature estimates the linear model gave similar evaporation estimates with typical low model sensitivity expressed in low values of the best fit line the nonlinear model improved model performance except with tpt q in ew leading to significantly better overall sensitivity reaching a best fit slope of 0 96 in the next step the wet surface temperatures were kept for evaluating ew and it was tested if replacing tpt by the wet bulb temperature twb in the wetness index as the lowest achievable air temperature by evaporating water into the air typically provided by psychrometers or estimated by eq 6 would result in better predictions neither the linear nor the nonlinear model responded much which suggests that the hybrid model is more sensitive to whether the model is linear or not than to which tpt estimate the wetness index contains once ew is evaluated at tws in the final step of cr theory demonstration the wetness index was also expressed by explicit flux terms leading to the best overall rmse value of 17 2 mm mo 1 in the linear model but still accompanied by low model sensitivity note that the tpt values now are present only optionally in place of tws in the ew term the full flux model formulation lead to a somewhat larger rmse value in the nonlinear approach but yielded practically perfect best fit line slope of unity with ew evaluated at the alternative wet surface temperatures the full flux model only slightly worsened when tws was replaced by tpt s for the ew evaluation but deteriorated significantly especially in the nonlinear case with tpt q reinforcing that the tpt s estimates are physically more realistic than the tpt estimates of qualls and crago 2020 the flux formulation of the wetness index seems to be more sensitive to changes in environmental aridity than the vapor pressure one this may be the reason for an improved cr model response in the rmse and best fit slope values for the linear version and in the latter only for the nonlinear one this improved sensitivity may occur because the penman equation contains the vapor pressure deficit which is highly responsive to changes in air temperature as a response to surface wetness due to the steep slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve especially at higher temperatures even though the rmse indicator did not improve for the nonlinear model the best fit slope did so yielding an almost perfect value of unity similar observations about the two versions of the wetness index vapor pressure or flux have already been made by szilagyi et al 2017 with continental scale gridded data as seen the cr model is not sensitive to the location of the surface isenthalp compare table 2 and 3 therefore canopy height of the vegetation is not required to be known which is a great advantage in large scale model applications employing gridded data neither is the cr model sensitive to the type of wet surface temperature estimate tws sj vs tws s which is again advantageous as this way the priestley taylor α can be estimated calibration free and separately of the cr application as was demonstrated by szilagyi et al 2017 and szilagyi 2018 for the conterminous united states and by ma et al 2019 for china also the demonstrated best sensitivity of the full flux model further justifies its previous very effective continental scale applications most recently by szilagyi et al 2020 in cases where aridity is changing on a wide scale 5 conclusions all in all this study revealed a physical foundation for the complementary relationship of evaporation with the help of defining the thermodynamic pathways the air at the vegetated surface and at the measurement height may follow under simplified atmospheric isobaric and adiabatic conditions certainly such conditions may be violated in the real atmosphere but typically not to such a degree that would invalidate the cr theory as a whole as it is proven by its practical success outperforming or matching existing often complex and data intensive large scale evaporation estimation methods szilagyi 2018 ma and szilagyi 2019 ma et al 2019 2020 as about the linearity vs nonlinearity dilemma of the cr the present study confirmed earlier findings by han et al 2012 and szilagyi 2018 that a nonlinear formulation can be expected to result in more realistic evaporation estimates expressed in best fit line slope values close to unity hopefully the detailed physical approach on the foundation of the cr discussed in this study will lead to wider application of the method for estimating land evaporation rates on a weekly monthly annual bases this is expected to happen as the method can be made calibration free i e full flux version with ew evaluated at tws sj at large spatial scales where the value of its sole temporarily and spatially constant parameter the priestley taylor α can be set by the method of szilagyi et al 2017 requiring no ground truth measurements of evaporation or application of water balances due to its minimal data requirement air temperature and humidity horizontal wind speed and net surface radiation an estimate for the latter also obtainable from sunshine duration data it can provide land evaporation estimates over longer historical periods than probably any other existing physically based method notice that it requires no precipitation information at all the cr is not recommended to be routinely applied at a daily scale and near sudden jumps of wetness conditions e g near sea shores where the moisture of the air may not be representative of the underlying land surface either temporarily due to a passing weather front or permanently due to existing diurnal land sea breezes declaration of competing interest the

viz tkp2020 appendix i qualls and crago 2020 argue that the tws value obtainable from eq 8 is incorrect as the δ term in eq 9 is evaluated at the known ta and not at the typically unknown ts as it ought to be they overlook the possibility that the ts to ta switch could be corrected at least to some degree by a properly chosen wind function in eq 9 they argue that the correct surface isenthalp must go through the intersection of the ep line i e the solid line between ta ea and tws sj ews sj in fig a1 and the line tangent δ ta resulting in the sample ts δ es δ point of fig a1 the

process employed in eq 6 but with ts δ es δ this intersection point however progressively climbs upward on the phase diagram fig a2 before ta reaches tws sj from its starting value of tpt q during adiabatic drying out of the environment from a fully wet condition at ta tws sj the intersection point is on the saturation vapor pressure curve yielding tws sj with additional drying of the environment the intersection point starts to fall fig a2 as the ta ea point slides further down the air isenthalp and simultaneously ta e ta climbs higher on the saturation vapor pressure curve the corresponding surface isenthalps that should go through these temporally changing intersection points parallel with the unchanging one going through tws sj ews sj would also yield temporally changing wet surface temperatures i e tws q in fig a1 which is a physical contradiction as the value of tws is strictly tied to that of twb by a constant qn and wind speed as was pointed out by monteith 1981 and experimentally proven by szilagyi 2014 see appendix ii for the latter as seen the tws correction of qualls and crago 2020 pushes the surface isenthalp closer to the air one thus depressing the es
